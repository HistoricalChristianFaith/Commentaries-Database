"And behold a whirlwind came from the North, and a great cloud." Because the north wind constrains with cold, the torpor of the malignant spirit is not unfittingly designated by the name of the north wind. The prophet Isaiah also testifies to this, who declares that the devil said: "I will sit upon the mountain of the testament, in the sides of the north." For the malignant spirit held the mountain of the testament, because he subjugated the Jewish people, who had received the law, to himself in faithlessness. For when he holds the hearts of teachers, the devil presides over the mountain of the testament. He also sits in the sides of the north, because he possesses the cold minds of men. Whence also it is said in the voice of the bridegroom in the Song of Songs: "Arise, O north wind, and come, O south wind, blow through my garden, and let its spices flow forth." For when, at the Lord's command, the cold spirit withdraws, the warm spirit occupies the mind of the faithful; which blows through God's garden, that is, the holy Church, so that the fragrances of its virtues may flow forth to the knowledge of many like spices. For when the north wind withdraws, that is, the malignant spirit, the Holy Spirit fills the mind like the south wind. When He blows by warming, immediately the spices of virtues flow from the hearts of the faithful. Therefore the prophet, seeing what things were to come at the end, saw a wind of whirlwind coming from the north, because at the end of the age the malignant spirit will more grievously occupy the minds of men with the cold of his torpor. Whence it is written: "Woe to the earth and to the sea, because the devil has descended to you having great wrath, knowing that he has but a short time." For the ancient adversary has more grievously intensified the efforts of his treacheries in human minds. Against his growing pride, the humility of the incarnate God was made manifest: and so that He might heal the human race from its weakness, then the great power of the physician appeared, when the sickness of the patient increased.

Well, the sending forth of a malign spirit is called a whirlwind. For a whirlwind shatters a building it touches by shaking it. And every temptation of the ancient enemy, which is carried out in the mind, is a whirlwind; because by shaking it through desires, it tears it from the state of its uprightness. But let us pass over in silence these things that will come upon the human race from the cunning enemy at the end, and turn our words to Judaea alone, from which the Prophet came, and whose destruction he beholds in prophesying. She endured a whirlwind from the north all the more grievously when the Lord was incarnate, inasmuch as she fell shaken from her uprightness and remained in cold perfidy through the torpor of the mind. Therefore a whirlwind came from the north when the malign spirit shook the life of the Jewish people in temptation. Where it is also rightly added: "And a great cloud."

For the more anyone burned with cruelty, the more he deserved to be blinded in the darkness of his ignorance. Indeed, they denied the Redeemer of the human race whom they had awaited while understanding him in the law and the prophets, yet denied him when they saw him. Hence it came about that their mind was covered by a great cloud of their ignorance, so that they would not recognize him when seeking him afterward—him whom they had been able to proclaim before, yet refused to love. For when they beheld now his powers and miracles, but now his sufferings, a great cloud had come from the North into the hearts of the unbelievers, because from the cold of their sin, on account of the weakness of his passion, they were blind even amid the signs.

But what followed from that darkness of the great cloud is added, when it immediately says: "And fire enveloping." For by the name of fire, when it is spoken through signification, sometimes the Holy Spirit is designated, and sometimes the malice of the mind. For concerning good fire it is written: "I have come to cast fire upon the earth; and what do I desire, except that it be kindled?" For fire is cast upon the earth when the earthly mind, breathed upon by the ardor of the Holy Spirit, is consumed away from its carnal desires. But concerning evil fire it is said: "And now fire shall consume the adversaries," because the most wicked heart wastes away from its own malice. Moreover, just as the fire of love raises up the mind, so the fire of malice envelops it, because the Holy Spirit elevates the heart which it fills, and the ardor of malice always bends it toward lower things. Therefore Judea, blinded by the cloud of her ignorance, because she soon burst forth into the wickedness of persecution, was enveloped by her own fire, she who entangled herself in the bond of wickedness through that very cruelty with which she burned. "And a wind of whirlwind was coming from the North, and a great cloud, and fire enveloping," because having been led from the coldness of her torpor into the darkness of ignorance, she burst forth even unto the malice of persecution. Whence it is also said to another prophet: "What do you see?" Who immediately responded: "I see a boiling pot, and its face is from the face of the North." For the mind of the Jews, raging in persecution and rolling waves of thoughts in the cruelty of malice, what else was it but a boiling pot? Its face is said to be from the face of the North, because if she had not subjected herself to the adversary spirit through torpor of mind, she would not have burned against good people in such great malice. Therefore fire enveloping follows the cloud, because in them the cruelty of persecution followed the blindness of mind. For if they had known, they would never have crucified the Lord of glory.

But this fire burned in one place and shone in another. For it is added: "And splendor was round about it." For while persecution was being carried out in Judea, the holy preaching of the apostles was scattered throughout the whole world, as they themselves say: "The word of God had been sent to you, but since you have judged yourselves unworthy, behold, we go to the Gentiles." Therefore from the cruelty of malice, which burned up the mind of Judea, almighty God spread light to the Gentiles, because through the fact that she persecuted her Redeemer and his members, with the holy apostles scattered in various directions, we who were situated in the region around Judea in darkness saw the splendor of the true light by the gift of heavenly grace. Whence it is written: "To those sitting in darkness and the shadow of death, a light has risen for them."

And so this fire of malice which burned from the hearts of the Jews in persecution, before it would afflict the holy apostles by raging against them, exercised itself upon the very author and redeemer of the human race. Whence it is also added: "And from its midst as it were the appearance of electrum," that is, from the midst of the fire.

What is designated by the appearance of electrum, except Christ Jesus, the Mediator of God and men? For electrum is made from gold and silver. In electrum, when gold and silver are mixed, the silver increases in brightness, while the gold grows pale from its own brilliance. The one advances toward brightness, the other is tempered from brightness. Therefore, since in the only-begotten Son of God our nature was united to the nature of divinity, in which union humanity grew into the glory of majesty, while divinity tempered itself from the power of its brilliance to human eyes—through the fact that human nature was made brighter, as it were the silver increased through the gold. And because divinity was tempered from its brilliance to our sight, as it were the gold grew pale to us through the silver. For that immutable nature, which remaining in itself renews all things, if it had wished to appear to us as it is, would have burned us with its brilliance rather than renewed us. But God tempered the brightness of his greatness to our eyes, so that while his brightness is tempered for us, even our weakness might become bright in his light through likeness to him, and through grace received might change, so to speak, the color of its condition. Therefore, like electrum in fire is God made man in persecution.

But if anyone wishes to understand these things which we have said about the Lord's first coming also concerning His second coming, he is to be followed with swift agreement, because often the spirit of prophecy in one thing it speaks beholds many things at once. For the whirlwind comes from the North, because indeed the cause of sins demands that the shaking of strict judgment disturb all the elements together. For the terror of the final disturbance is said to come from where it is generated. For since the judgment of final disturbance is carried out to strike the cold minds of sinners, rightly the whirlwind is said to come from the North. This shaking is aptly called a whirlwind, because on that day the hearts of all who shall then be found in mortal flesh will be moved with excessive fear. For when what is written begins to be fulfilled: "The sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken," what mind of man will there be that does not dread the sentence of the eternal Judge? For there then all sins at once return before the eyes, there all things which were done with delight are recalled to memory with fear, there is the darkness of miserable thought from the punishment of approaching damnation. Whence it is also added: "And a great cloud." For then from the memory of sins the darkness of blindness weighs down the perception of the mind, when the reprobate are not permitted to behold the only-begotten Son of God in the form of divinity. For "they shall look upon Him whom they pierced." And, "Let the ungodly be taken away, lest he see the glory of God." Where it is also openly added: "And fire enfolding itself." Because indeed that fire of judgment, which will burn up the aerial heaven and the earth, will no longer permit sinners to be raised up in their pride, but will enfold them, whom without doubt it will crush in the punishment of their damnation.

And there was splendor all around it. For just as lightning goes out from the East and appears even to the West, so will be the coming of the Son of Man. Where no one is then permitted to hide in his mind from the judgment, because he is penetrated by the very brilliance of the Judge. Concerning this it is soon added: "And in its midst was something like the appearance of electrum," that is, from the midst of the fire. For He Himself, our Redeemer, presiding over angels and archangels and all the powers, who as in the likeness of electrum remained one from both and in both natures, both God with the Father, and for our redemption was made mortal with men, will then be seen in His terror, and the fire of judgment will serve Him in vengeance upon the reprobate. For thus it is written: "The day of the Lord will make clear because it will be revealed in fire." Thus the Psalmist says: "God will come manifestly, our God, and He will not be silent; fire will burn in His sight, and around Him will be a mighty storm." Thus the apostle Peter says: "The day of the Lord will come as a thief, in which the heavens will pass away with great violence, and the elements will be dissolved by the heat of fire."
