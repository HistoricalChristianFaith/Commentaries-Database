But when one has been rejected, in whom clearly the whole body of the wicked is represented, a general judgment is immediately added, in which it is said: "For many are called, but few are chosen." What we have heard is greatly to be feared, dearest brothers. Behold, we who have all now been called through faith come to the wedding feast of the heavenly king, we both believe and confess the mystery of his incarnation, we receive the banquet of the divine Word, but on the future day of judgment the king will enter. That we are called, we know; whether we are chosen, we do not know. Therefore it is necessary that each one of us humble himself in humility all the more because he does not know whether he is chosen. For some do not even begin good works, while others do not persist at all in the good works they have begun. One person is seen to lead nearly his whole life in wickedness, but near the end of his life he is called back from his wickedness through the lamentations of severe penance; another seems to lead a chosen life, and yet it happens that near the end of his life he turns aside to the wickedness of error. One begins good well and finishes better; another casts himself down in evil deeds from his earliest age, and in the same works is always finished worse than himself. Therefore let each one anxiously fear for himself all the more because he does not know what remains, for, what must often be said and retained without forgetfulness: "Many are called, but few are chosen."

But because sometimes the examples of the faithful convert the minds of hearers more than the words of teachers, I wish to tell you something from nearby, which your hearts may hear with all the more fear, since it sounds to them from close at hand. For we are not speaking of things done long ago, but we recall those of which witnesses exist, and who report that they were present. My father had three sisters, who were all three sacred virgins: one was called Tharsilla, another Gordiana, another Aemiliana. All were converted with one ardor, consecrated at one and the same time, living under regular discipline, they led a common life in their own home. And when they had been for a long time in the same manner of life, Tharsilla and Aemiliana began to grow daily with increasing love for their Creator, and though they were here only in body, daily they passed in spirit to eternal things. But on the contrary, Gordiana's spirit began to grow lukewarm from the warmth of inner love through daily losses, and little by little to return to the love of this world. Often Tharsilla used to say to her sister Aemiliana with great sighing: "I see that our sister Gordiana is not of our lot; for I perceive that she flows outward, and does not keep her heart to what she has professed." They took care to correct her with gentle daily reproof, and to reform her from levity of manners to the gravity of her state. She would indeed suddenly assume an expression of gravity amid the words of correction, but when the hour of that correction had passed, the assumed gravity of respectability immediately passed as well, and she soon returned to frivolous words. She rejoiced in the company of lay girls, and any person who was not devoted to this world was very burdensome to her.

But one night to this Tharsilla, my aunt, who among her sisters had excelled in the honor and height of sanctity by virtue of continuous prayer, zealous mortification, singular abstinence, and gravity of life, as she herself related, my great-great-grandfather Felix, bishop of this Roman Church, appeared in a vision, and showed her a mansion of perpetual brightness, saying: "Come, for I receive you into this mansion of light." She was immediately seized by a fever the following day and came to her final day. And just as when noble women and men are dying many gather to console their relatives, at the very hour of her departure many men and women stood around her bed, among whom my mother also was present; when suddenly she looked upward and saw Jesus coming, and with great earnestness began to cry out to those standing around, saying: "Depart, depart, Jesus comes." And as she gazed upon him whom she saw, that holy soul was released from the flesh; and suddenly such a fragrance of wondrous odor was spread about that the sweetness itself showed to all that the author of sweetness had come there. And when her body was stripped to be washed as is the custom for the dead, it was found that hardened skin had grown on her elbows and knees, in the manner of camels, from long practice of prayer, and her dead flesh testified to what her living spirit had always done.

These things occurred before the day of the Lord's Nativity. When that had passed, she soon appeared to her sister Aemiliana in a vision of the night, saying: "Come, so that since I spent the Lord's Nativity without you, I may now spend the holy day of Theophany with you." She, immediately anxious about the salvation of their sister Gordiana, replied: "And if I come alone, to whom do I leave our sister Gordiana?" To her, as she reported, Tharsilla said again with sad countenance: "Come, for our sister Gordiana has been reckoned among the laywomen." This vision was soon followed by bodily illness, and just as had been said, before the day of the Lord's appearing, with that illness growing worse, she died. But Gordiana, as soon as she found herself left alone, her wickedness increased, and what had previously lain hidden in the desire of thought, she afterward carried out in the effect of wicked action. For forgetful of the fear of the Lord, forgetful of modesty and reverence, forgetful of her consecration, she afterward took the steward of her fields as a husband. Behold, all three were first converted with one ardor, but they did not remain in one and the same devotion, because according to the Lord's voice, "Many are called, but few are chosen."

I have said these things therefore, lest anyone already established in good work attribute to himself the strength of good work, lest anyone trust in his own action, because even if he knows today what he is like, he still does not know what he will be tomorrow. Let no one therefore rejoice securely in his own works, since while still in the uncertainty of this life he does not know what end will follow.

But because I have related a matter which terrified you from divine severity, I also relate another thing from nearby which may console your terrified hearts from divine mercy; which however I remember that I already said in another sermon, but you were by no means present. Two years ago, a certain brother came to my monastery, which is situated near the Church of the blessed martyrs John and Paul, for the purpose of conversion. After being tested according to the rule for a long time, he was eventually admitted. His brother followed him to the monastery not out of zeal for conversion but out of carnal affection. Now the one who had come for conversion was very pleasing to the brothers; but his brother, on the contrary, was far different from his life and character. He lived in the monastery more from necessity than from choice. And though he was perverse in all his actions, he was patiently tolerated by everyone for the sake of his brother. For he was frivolous in speech, wicked in action, refined in clothing, unrefined in character; and he could not bear it if anyone spoke to him about adopting the religious life. Indeed, his way of life had become burdensome for all the brothers to witness, yet, as was said, he was tolerable to all for the sake of his brother. He greatly despised it if anyone spoke to him about correcting his depravity. He could not only not do good things, but could not even hear about them. He kept declaring, with oaths, anger, and mockery, that he would never embrace the religious life.

But in that plague which recently consumed a great part of the population of this city, he was struck in the groin and brought to the point of death. When he was breathing his last, the brothers gathered to protect his departure with their prayers. His body was already dead from the extremities, and vital warmth still lingered only in his chest. All the brothers began to pray more earnestly for him as they saw him departing so quickly. Suddenly, with the brothers standing by, he began to cry out with whatever effort he could and to interrupt their prayers, saying: "Withdraw, withdraw! Behold, I have been given to a dragon to be devoured, and because of your presence he cannot devour me. He has already swallowed my head in his mouth; give him room so that he may torment me no longer but do what he is going to do. If I have been given to him to be devoured, why do I suffer this delay because of you?" Then the brothers began to say to him: "What are you saying, brother? Make the sign of the holy cross upon yourself." He answered as best he could, saying: "I want to sign myself, but I cannot, because I am pressed down by the dragon." When the brothers heard this, they prostrated themselves on the ground and with tears began to pray more intensely for his deliverance. And behold, suddenly the sick man began to improve and to rejoice with whatever voice he had, saying: "Thanks be to God! Behold, the dragon who had taken me to devour me has fled; driven out by your prayers, he could not remain. Now intercede for my sins, because I am ready to be converted and to abandon the worldly life entirely." Therefore this man, who, as was already said, had been dead from the extremities of his body, was preserved for life and was converted to God with his whole heart. He was disciplined by long and continuous afflictions in that same conversion, and died a few days ago when his bodily illness increased. As he was dying, he did not see the dragon, because he had conquered it through the transformation of his heart.

Behold, my brothers, Gordiana, whom I mentioned above, fell from the height of the religious habit to punishment, and this brother, about whom I have told these things, returned from the very moment of death to eternal life. Therefore no one knows what is being done concerning himself in the hidden judgments of God; for "many are called, but few are chosen." Since, therefore, no one is certain about himself that he is chosen, it remains that all should tremble, all should fear concerning their conduct, all should rejoice only in divine mercy, and no one should presume upon his own strength.
