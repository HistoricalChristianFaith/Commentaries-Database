But because these things have been said against the reprobate, the words soon turn to the consolation of the elect. For it is added: "But when these things begin to come to pass, look up and lift up your heads, because your redemption draws near." As if the Truth openly admonishes His elect, saying: When the calamities of the world increase, when the terror of judgment is shown by the powers being shaken, lift up your heads, that is, gladden your hearts, because while the world, to which you are not friends, comes to an end, the redemption which you have sought draws near.

For in Sacred Scripture the head is often used to mean the mind, because just as the members are governed by the head, so thoughts are arranged by the mind. Therefore to lift up our heads is to raise our minds to the joys of the heavenly homeland. Those who love God are therefore commanded to rejoice and be glad at the end of the world, because indeed they soon find Him whom they love, while that which they did not love passes away. For far be it that any of the faithful who desires to see God should grieve over the afflictions of the world, knowing that it will end through these very afflictions.

For it is written: "Whoever wishes to be a friend of this world is made an enemy of God." Therefore whoever does not rejoice as the end of the world approaches testifies that he is its friend, and by this is convicted of being an enemy of God. But far be this from the hearts of the faithful, far be it from those who both believe by faith that there is another life, and love it through their deeds. For to grieve over the destruction of the world belongs to those who have planted the roots of their heart in love of it, who do not seek the life to come, who do not even suspect that it exists.

But we who have known the eternal joys of the heavenly homeland ought to hasten to them as quickly as possible. We should desire to journey there sooner and to arrive by a shorter way. For by what evils is the world not oppressed? What sadness, what adversity does not distress us? What is mortal life but a journey? And consider, my brothers, what it means to grow weary from the labor of the journey, and yet not want that same journey to end.
