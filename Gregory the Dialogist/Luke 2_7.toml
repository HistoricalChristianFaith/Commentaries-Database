He who is born not in his parents' house, but on the way, surely showed that through the humanity which he had assumed, he was being born as if in a foreign place. I say "foreign," of course, not according to power, but according to nature. For concerning his power it is written: He came unto his own. In his own nature, indeed, he was born before all ages; in our nature he came in time. He, therefore, who remaining eternal appeared temporal—the place where he descended is foreign to him. And because it is said through the prophet: All flesh is grass, he, having been made man, turned our grass into grain, he who said of himself: Unless a grain of wheat falling into the earth dies, it remains alone. Hence also, when born, he is laid in a manger, so that he might refresh all the faithful, namely his holy animals, with the grain of his flesh, lest they remain fasting from the food of eternal understanding.
