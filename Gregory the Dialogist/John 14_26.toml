Many of you, dearly beloved, know that the Greek word Paraclete means in Latin “advocate” or “consoler.” He is called an advocate because he intervenes before the Father’s justice on behalf of the wrongdoings of sinners. He who is of one substance with the Father, and the Son is said to plead earnestly on behalf of sinners because he causes those whom he fills to do so. This is why Paul says, “For the Spirit himself pleads for us with unutterable groanings.” But one who pleads is of less importance than the one receiving the plea. How is the Spirit, then, who is not less important, said to plead? The Spirit pleads, rousing those he fills to plead. The same Spirit is called a consoler because when he prepares a hope of pardon for those grieving over their sins he is lifting up their hearts from sorrow and affliction.

It is only right that Jesus promised, “He will teach you all things,” because unless the Spirit is present in the heart of a listener, the teacher’s utterance is useless. No one should attribute to his teacher what he understands from him, because unless there is an inner teacher, the one outside is exerting himself in vain. You all hear equally the single voice of the person speaking, and yet you each have a different perception of the meaning. The voice is not different—why do your hearts understand it differently? Is it not that through what the speaker’s voice counsels generally there is an inner master who teaches each one individually about its meaning? John says this about the anointing of the Spirit: “His anointing teaches you about everything.” No one is instructed by a voice when his heart is not anointed by the Spirit. But why do I speak in this way about human teaching when our Creator himself does not speak for the instruction of any person unless he speaks to that person by the anointing of the Spirit?

We must ask why it is said of the Spirit, “He will remind you of everything,” when reminding is usually the action of someone of lesser importance. We sometimes use “remind” to mean “furnish with information,” and so we say that the invisible Spirit “reminds” us because he provides us with knowledge not as an inferior but as one who knows what is secret.
