There follows: (Verse 27.) But Jonathan had not heard when his father adjured the people, and he stretched out the tip of the staff that he had in his hand, and dipped it in the honeycomb, and brought his hand back to his mouth, and his eyes were brightened.

Whom does Jonathan represent in this place, if not those who are great in word and deed, yet are not great in the zeal of circumspection? They preach lofty things indeed, they perform mighty works, but they do not manfully hold themselves in the circumspection of humility. For what does it mean that he holds a rod in his hand, except that the discipline by which he forbids others from sinning does not restrain himself? Indeed, the rod by which little ones are accustomed to be corrected can fittingly signify the word of correction. Therefore preaching and good work are the rod and the hand. What then is it to extend the rod and bring back the hand to the mouth with honey, except to receive the taste of vain favor both from the word of preaching and from the zeal of good work? But because he sins in the manner of the elect, he is said to take up honey not with the rod, but with the tip of the rod. For they turn the rod and hand full of honey to their mouth who, according to the voice of Truth: "Do all their works to be seen by men" (Matt. 23:5). For while they are sated with their own praises, they have honey not as a thin taste at the tip of the rod, but either in the whole rod or in the hand for a full meal. Such certainly were those whom the Lord reproaches in the Gospel, saying: "How can you believe, receiving glory from one another?" (John 5:44). What then is this tip of the rod, except that for the most part they both wish to glorify the Lord in their work and do not shrink from appearing praiseworthy themselves? Rightly therefore Jonathan is said not to have heard the voice of the father by which he bound the people under oath, because he does not hear the words of God or of His preacher who neglects to fulfill them. But what does it mean that Jonathan's eyes were enlightened from the taste of honey, except that those who receive the breeze of vain favor are strengthened by the same to perform mighty deeds? In this place indeed the eyes are not said to have been opened, so that they might be understood to have been closed, but so that with the vigor of the body restored, they might be understood as restored both for seeing and for destroying enemies. Which assuredly entirely befits the proud, who perform greater and mightier deeds in proportion as they see their praiseworthy works being exalted.
