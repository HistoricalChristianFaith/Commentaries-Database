Holy preachers are also accustomed to reprove their hearers with sharp words, and to rage with strict severity against their sins: as it is written, The words of the wise are as goads, and as nails fastened deep. But their words are rightly called nails, since they do not know how to handle gently the sins of offenders, but how to pierce them through. Were not the words of John nails, when he said, O generation of vipers, who hath shewed you to flee from the wrath to come? Were not the words of Stephen nails, when he said, Ye have always resisted the Holy Ghost? Were not the words of Paul, when he said, O senseless Galatians, who hath bewitched you? and again when saying to the Corinthians, For whereas there is among you envying and strife, are ye not carnal, and walk according to man?
