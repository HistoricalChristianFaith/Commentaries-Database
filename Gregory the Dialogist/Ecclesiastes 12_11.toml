Holy preachers are also accustomed to reprove their hearers with sharp words and to rage with strict severity against their sins. As it is written, “The words of the wise are goads, and as nails fastened deep.” But their words are properly called nails, since they do not know how to handle the sins of offenders gently, but only how to pierce them. Were not the words of John nails when he said, “O generation of vipers, who has shown you to flee from the wrath to come?” Were not the words of Stephen nails when he said, “You have always resisted the Holy Spirit”? Were not the words of Paul nails when he said, “O senseless Galatians, who has bewitched you?” and again when saying to the Corinthians, “For while there is among you envying and strife, are you not carnal, and do you not walk according to man?”
