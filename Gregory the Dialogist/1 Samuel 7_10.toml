20. When Samuel was offering a holocaust, the Philistines enter battle against Israel: because evil spirits then stir up graver temptations against the faithful subjects when they see Pastors standing more firmly against them. But the Lord thunders upon the Philistines: because when doctors pray and the faithful subjects pray, divine grace supplies strength. For thunder usually occurs through clouds. And by sublime clouds are understood souls raised up through heavenly desire. Whence also the prophet, marveling at the minds of the elect elevated in the love of heavenly things, said: "Who are these who fly as clouds?" (Isa. 60:8). And what are the thunders of the clouds, if not those fervent and heavenly desires of the elect: by which, when their mind is set ablaze through divine grace, they utterly expel from it everything that evil spirits suggest by deception? Rightly therefore it is said: "The Lord thundered upon the Philistines and terrified them." For when through His grace He pours heavenly desires into the minds of the elect, because He also makes them despise all earthly things, He turns to flight even the wicked spirits who suggest that they desire those things. For they flee as if terrified by thunder, when in the minds of the elect, which they had assailed by tempting, they tremble at the immense sound of divine power. Since indeed the Lord is said to have thundered with a great crash, what else does this mean except that the imperfect desires of Christians are not terrible to demons? For the great crash of thunder is the perfect desire of each one of the elect. When therefore the Lord thunders upon the Philistines with a great crash, then they are slain by the children of Israel: because when perfect devotion raises the mind of the elect to heavenly joys, it utterly cuts off from itself everything that serves the opposing side. Well also are the Philistines recorded as first being terrified and then slain by the children of Israel: for they are terrified by the devotion of the elect, they are slain by their works. And because devotion precedes works, they are rightly said to be first terrified and afterward slain. For we first receive from the Lord the gift of good will, so that we may afterward be able to confute the counsels of evil spirits. Well also is the Lord said to thunder upon the Philistines and terrify them, while the children of Israel are said to slay them: because good desires are supplied to us through divine grace, but we advance the gifts of grace through the effort of free will to the victories of the virtues. The order of heavenly warfare, therefore, is that God be first heard thundering with a great crash, and afterward the soldier advance to cut down the ranks of the enemy: so that he may first see in himself the gifts of grace, then burst forth more powerfully to the field of battle, and confidently hope for the outcome of victory, he who has been sustained by the powers with which he will be crowned before the time of the engagement.
