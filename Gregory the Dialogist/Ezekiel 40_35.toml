"And he brought me to the gate which looked toward the North, and he measured according to the former measures, its chamber, and its front, and its vestibule." Those things also which were said concerning the South gate and the East gate are repeated in the same words also concerning the gate which looks toward the North. The converted Gentile world is designated by the North. For Heber himself, from whom the Hebrews are named, was chosen from among the Gentiles. The Gentile world existed before the Synagogue. But our Redeemer deigned to be born in human nature between Judea and the Gentile world, because He came both at the end of the Synagogue and before the beginning of the Church, which He gathered from the Gentiles.
