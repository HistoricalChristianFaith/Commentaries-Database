But what does it mean that he is called a cousin of Saul? A cousin is one who is born from the brother of one's father. Hence here too it is added: 'Kish was the father of Saul, and Ner the father of Abner was the son of Abiel.'

And when a king to be chosen was sought, it was said: "And there was a man named Kish, the son of Abiel" (1 Samuel 9:1). Since we have more fully explained what these names of the royal lineage signify, let us only set forth how Abner is said to be Saul's cousin. Now Saul is known to be the son of Kish, that is, of "the hard one"; Abner also is said to be the son of "a lamp." We have shown that "the hard one" designates men of excessively austere manner of life, and that Ner is interpreted as "lamp." What then does it mean that "lamp" and "the hard one" are said to be sons of the same father, except that both what Holy Scripture commands as austere and the outward strength of a hard manner of life come from God? For "the hard one" is the brother of "the lamp," because the grace of fulfilling the law comes from Him from whom the law itself has its origin. Hence the Psalmist also confidently promises, saying: "For He who gave the law will also give a blessing" (Psalm 84:7). For to give the law is to set forth the precepts of life to the elect, and to give a blessing is to bestow the grace of fulfilling the law. Since therefore both the light of Scripture and the harshness of our life come from One, Kish and Ner are said to be sons of one father. Therefore Abner, the son of Ner, is rightly said to be the cousin of King Saul, because he who is chosen for the care of souls is judged as needing to be of a hard and austere life. But those who desire to be helpers of preachers never accomplish what they desire if they do not bring to completion the light of Holy Scripture, in which they were conceived through knowledge, in good works and holy preaching, as if by being born. But since the knowledge of the Holy Scriptures is ascribed more to the chief teachers than to their subordinate helpers, and following examples of conduct seems to befit the lesser rather than the greater, what does it mean that the king is called the son of "the hard one," while the prince of the king is called the son of "the lamp"? But by these words it does not signify what the chief teachers and their helpers possess, but, passing over what they possess, it sets forth what each must do. For the king, that is, the supreme and chosen preacher, because he already possesses the light of Scripture through the knowledge of the highest learning, should not so trust in his knowledge as to fail to follow the examples of others. Likewise the prince, that is, the helper of the great teacher, because he is subject to the examples of his own superior, should lean toward the light, so that he who follows examples may be born, as it were, into the learning of higher doctrine, as into the great light of a lamp. He therefore who, being learned, is brought back through humility to the examples of his elders, and who, instructed by examples, is raised up through learning to the splendor of the Scriptures, is rightly said to be a king, the son of "the hard one," and a prince, the son of "the lamp."
