48.  Whereas Paul the Apostle saith; For, if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged, [1 Cor. 11, 31] the Lord is found to be our ‘Salvation’ Then, in proportion as our sin is now rebuked by ourselves, from fear of God.  Whence the Elect are used never to spare their own sins, that they may find the Judge of sin rendered propitious; and they look to find Him hereafter truly their ‘Salvation,’ Whom they now strictly fear as their Judge.  For, he that spareth himself now in sin, is not spared hereafter in punishment, So let him say, But I will rebuke mine own ways before Him.  And what use and advantage results from such rebuking.
