He had said above, “See, God is exalted in his power”; now he repeats, “See, God is great.” What does “see” mean when speaking about God, and why does he repeat “see,” but for the reason that we are speaking of what we indicate in the present? And since God is present everywhere, when we say, “see” with regard to him we recall the fact that he is present also with those who do not see him.
