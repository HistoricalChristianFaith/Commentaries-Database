22. And since we have referred Anna's drink to the joy of the holy Church, which is shown to rejoice, how is it narrated that she wept with a bitter spirit? But it can reasonably be understood that contemplation of heavenly reward had lifted her up to rejoice, and compassion for rejected Judea stirred her up by affecting her with bitterness of spirit. For caught in the whirlwinds of great persecution, with heavenly rewards revealed to her, she exulted, but she fell into bitterness because she saw the formerly chosen people perishing. Hence she is described as weeping abundantly while praying, so that by the gift of such great affection, she might be able to obtain the salvation of her people from the Lord. This whole passage can also be understood differently. For in Shiloh, that is, in the ministry to which she was sent, she ate; because even if she could not win over the entire Jewish people, she nevertheless converted many of them to faith in the Redeemer by preaching. Hence when Peter preached, five thousand men believed in one day (Acts 4:4), and on another, three thousand believed (Acts 2:41). And because what we drink we can swallow more easily than what we eat: Anna ate and drank, because she converted some with difficulty and others easily by preaching. For at Peter's aforementioned preaching, many thousands believed in one moment, but Paul did not believe until he had vehemently opposed the preachers themselves with threats and slaughter. But after Anna ate and drank in Shiloh, she arose: because when she had taken away from Judea those who were predestined to eternal life, she prepared herself for preaching to the Gentiles. But what kind of child she desired to bear is shown by what was added: (Verse 15) And she vowed a vow, saying: O Lord of hosts, if looking you will see the affliction of your handmaid, and will remember me, and not forget your servant, and will give to your servant a male child, I will give him to the Lord all the days of his life, and no razor shall come upon his head.
