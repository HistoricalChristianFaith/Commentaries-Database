“Their young ones leave and go to pasture.” Holy Scripture calls “pasture” that green place of eternity where our nourishment will never be spoiled by any drought. About this pasture the psalmist says, “The Lord is my shepherd, and I will never lack anything. In a green place, there he gave me rest.” And again, “We are his people and herd of his pasture.” And the Truth himself says about these pastures, “If one enters through me, he will be saved and will get out and will find pasture.” They go to pasture because, after going out of their body, they find the eternal green pastures. They go out and do not go back to them, because, after being received in that joyful contemplation, they do not need to hear the words of those who teach. And so, after going out they do not go back to them, because after escaping the afflictions of life, they do not seek to receive any longer from the doctors the doctrine of life.
