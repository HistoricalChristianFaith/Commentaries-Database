28.  When the evil spirit sees our Redeemer shine forth by miracles, he cries out, We know Who Thou art, the Holy One of God. [Luke 4, 34]  And in saying this, he dreads, whilst he owns, the Son of God.  Yet being a stranger to the power of heavenly pity, there are seasons when, beholding Him subject to suffering, he supposes Him to be mere man.  Now he had learnt that there were many in the pastoral station, cloked under the guise of sanctity, who, being very far removed from the bowels of charity, held for very little other men's ills.  And thus as though judging of Him by other men, because after much had been taken from Him, he did not see him subdued, he so flamed against Him even to His very flesh, in applying the touch of suffering, as to say, Skin for skin; yea, all that a man hath will he give for his life.  But put forth Thine hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will curse Thee to Thy face.  As though he said in plain terms, ‘He does not care to be moved by the things that are without Him, but it will then be really known what He is, if He shall experience in Himself what may make Him grieve.’  This Satan expressed in his own person not by words, but by wishes, when he desired to have it brought to pass; in his members he brought it on both by words and wishes at once.  For it is himself that speaks, when, according to the words of the Prophet, his followers say, Let us put the wood in his bread, and let us raze him out from the land of the living. [Jer. 11, 19. Vulg.]  For ‘to put the wood into the bread,’ is to apply the trunk of the cross to His body in affixing Him thereto; and they think themselves able to ‘raze out’ His life from the land of the living, Whom while they perceive Him to be mortal mould, they imagine to be put an end to by death.

5.  The old enemy derives from outward things the charge which he urges against the blessed man's soul.  For he affirms that ‘skin is given for skin;’ as it often happens that when we see a blow directed against the face, we put our hands before our eyelids to guard the eyes from the stroke, and we present our bodies to be wounded, lest they be wounded in a tenderer part.  Satan then, who knew that such things are customarily done, exclaims, Skin for skin, and all that a man hath will he give in exchange for his life.  As if he said in plain words, ‘It is for this reason that Job bears with composure so many strokes falling without, because he fears lest he should be smitten himself, and so it is care of the flesh that makes him unmoved by hurt done to the feelings of the flesh; for while he fears for his own person, he feels the less the hurt of what belongs to him. 
And hence he immediately requires his flesh to be smitten, in these words;
"But put forth Thine hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will curse Thee to Thy face. "
He had said above, Touch all that he hath, and he will curse Thee to Thy face. [Job 1, 11]  Now, as if forgetting his former proposal, being beaten upon one point, he demands another.  And this is justly allowed him by God's dispensation, that the audacious disputer, by being over and over again overcome, may be made to keep silence.
