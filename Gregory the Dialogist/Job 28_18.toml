81.  For all the Elect of the Country Above are indeed holy and righteous, but by a participation of Wisdom, not by comparison therewith.  For what are men compared with God?  Now ‘Light’ Wisdom is used to be called, ‘light’ also the servants of Wisdom are wont to be called; but She as light lighting up, they as light lighted up; as it was written; That was the true Light, Which lighteth every man that cometh into the world. [John 1, 9]  But to these it is only said, Ye are the light of the world. [Matt. 5, 14]  ‘Righteousness’ indeed Wisdom is called ‘righteousness,’ the servants of ‘Wisdom’ as well are called: but She righteousness that maketh righteous, they righteousness that is made righteous.  For of God, Who is ‘Wisdom,’ it is said, That He might Himself be just and the Justifier; [Rom. 3, 26] but these say, that we might be made the righteousness of God in Him. [1 Cor. 5, 21]  So then it is after one sort that the ‘Light lighting’ is to be reverenced, after another that the ‘light lighted’ is to be; in one way the Righteousness that maketh righteous, in another way the righteousness that is made righteous.  Now Wisdom both is and is wise, nor has She for one thing to be, and for another thing to be wise; but the servants of ‘Wisdom’ are indeed able to be wise men, but yet they have not their being the same thing as being wise.  For they may be, and not be wise.  Wisdom hath life, but She hath not one thing, and is another thing, inasmuch as, to Her it is that to be that it is to live.  But the servants of ‘Wisdom’ whilst they have life are one thing and have another, inasmuch as to whom to be is not the identical thing it is to live.  For they may be after a sort, and yet not live.  For to them it is one thing to be, and a different thing to live; for in the very first parent they had being by a beginning, and life by an addition, since man was first made of the earth, and afterwards as it is written; He breathed into his nostrils the breath of life. [Gen. 2, 7.]  Now Wisdom hath being, She hath life; but this, which She hath, She Her own Self is.  Wherefore She lives unchangeably, because she lives not by contingency, but essentially.  He then alone Is truly with the Father and the Holy Spirit, to Whose Being ours compared, is not to Be.  To this Wisdom if we be joined, we are, we live, we are wise.  If we be compared to Him, we neither are wise, nor live at all, nor are.
82.  Hence it is that all the Saints, when they advance in the vision of God, the more they view the interior depths of the Divine Nature, see so much the more that they themselves are nothing.  For it is no where read that Abraham confessed that he was dust and ashes except when he obtained to enjoy the converse of God.  For he says, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord, which am but dust and ashes. [Gen. 18, 27]  For he would perchance have thought that he was something, if he had not perceived at all the true Essence that is above himself.  But when for the contemplating of the Unchangeable One he was transported above himself, being filled with so mighty a power of contemplation, when he saw Him, he saw that he himself was nought but ‘dust.’  Hence it is that the Prophet being filled with the same Wisdom crieth out, Remember, O Lord, that we are but dust; [Ps. 103, 14. lxx.] who again viewing the unchangeableness of that Essence, saith, Yea, all of them shall wax old as doth a garment, and as a vesture shalt Thou change them, and they shall be changed; but Thou art the same, and Thy years shall not fail. [Ps. 102, 26. 27.]  Hence it is said to Moses, I AM THAT I AM: Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, HE THAT IS hath sent me unto you. [Ex. 3, 14.]  For He alone truly IS, Who alone unchangeably continues.  For every thing that now is after this way, and now after another way, is near to not being.  For to continue in its standing, it is not able.  And in some manner there is a going on not to be, whilst from that which was, it is by the enfarings of time ever being led away to some other thing.  In order then that in the partaking of His Body we may be something, let us know and see our own selves, that we are well nigh nothing.  Therefore it is well said, Nor shall they be made mention of in comparison with her; because vessels of gold high and overtopping, which by participation of Wisdom are fit objects of reverence to us, in comparison of Wisdom are not even fit to be made mention of.  But because this Wisdom is by secret means poured into the hearts of men, (as it is likewise said of the Holy Spirit, The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth; [John 3, 8]) for this reason it is added,
For wisdom is drawn from out of sight.
83.  ‘Wisdom is drawn from out of sight;’ because whereas She is invisible, She cannot be found saving in an invisible way.  And She is rightly said to be ‘drawn’ also, because like as we draw the breath, that the body may live, so from the interior depths of Wisdom the Spirit is derived, that the soul may hold on to life.  Whence the Psalmist says, I opened my mouth, and drew in the spirit. [Ps. 119, 131.]  Which very Wisdom, taking human flesh together with [al. ‘by the medium of.’] a rational soul, when It had presented Itself from the interior depths close at hand, because this world could not behold its invisible Maker, Him Whom it saw visible Man, it also knew as invisible God as well.  The Gentile world was converted from the darkness of its unbelief, being before full of pride by its avertedness; signs and wonders being exhibited, faith gained ground; and the faith being spread abroad, the summit of Holy Church shone forth in reverence with all men.  To which same when there were wanting open adversaries, she began to be tried by her own members.  For numberless heresies springing up in her, they arrayed against her wars of cruel conflict.  For she must be exercised at this time by toiling, who is on the way to her recompensing in that which follows.  Whereby it has come to pass that some in her should come forth who should call the Mediator between God and man, the Man Christ Jesus, created mere man, but one by grace made God, and should attribute so much of holiness to him as they knew in the rest of the Saints, the same being His servants.  Which persons blessed Job being inspired with the spirit of prophecy, reproves by the laying out of his sentence.
