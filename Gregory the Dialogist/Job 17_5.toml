38.  After that blessed Job had uttered a sentence relating to the multitude of the wicked, i.e. the body of our old enemy; he directly shifts the sentence to the very leader of them, i.e. the head of all the children of perdition, and returns from the plural to the singular number: for the devil and all wicked people are so one body, that it very often happens that the body is rated with the name of the head, and the head designated by the title of the body.  Thus the body is rated with the name of the head, when it is said of a bad man, And one of you is a devil. [John 6, 70]  And again the head is designated by the title of the body, when it is said of the apostate Angel himself, A man [Vulg. ‘inimicus homo’] that is an enemy hath done this. [Matt. 13, 28]  Thus the prince of all the wicked has some for ‘associates’ and some as ‘children.’  For who are his associates, but those apostate Angels, who fell with him from the seat of the heavenly country?  or what others has he as children, saving bad men, who are begotten by his evil persuading in the practice of wickedness.  Whence too it is said by the voice of Truth to unbelievers, Ye are of your father the devil. [John 8, 44]
39.  So that evil author of error promises ‘prey’ to his ‘associates,’ in that he promises the evil spirits the souls of bad men to be seized at their latter end; and the eyes of his children shall fail, in that while he sets on the aims of men to look for earthly things only, he causes them to love that which they cannot keep for long: for neither can the bent of misdirected love remain, when it appears that both that which he loves, and he himself, who loves it, are tending to nought at a rapid rate.  It may also be, that by ‘the associates’ perhaps are understood all those that are most cruel and already full of every kind of wickedness; but by the sons, those who being still deluded by beguiling promises, are being nourished up to increasing of wickedness; that henceforth the devil should as it were by the title of wickedness, have these as his ‘associates,’ who now no longer have whereunto to grow in perdition, while these he has as sons, whom he suckles with promises, that they may go on advancing to worse.  But ‘the eyes of his children shall fail,’ in that the aims of the wicked fall to the ground, when all that they go after here, they leave behind, and there suffer without end what is fitted to fill them with grief.
