The slothful, in neglecting to do what he ought, imagines to himself certain difficulties and harbors certain unfounded fears; and when he discovers an apparent reason for having fear apparently justified, he acts as if he were quite justified in being inactive and indolent.… The sluggard does not plough because of the cold, when he is held back by the torpor of sloth and fails to do the good that he ought to do. The sluggard does not plough owing to the cold, when he fears trifling evils that confront him and fails to do things of the greatest moment. And it is well said, “He shall beg in the summer, and it shall not be given him.” The person who does not toil in good works now will receive nothing in the summer; that is, when the scorching sun of judgment shall appear, he will beg in vain to enter the kingdom. .
