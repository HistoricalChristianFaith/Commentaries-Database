The slothful, in neglecting to do things that are necessary, imagines certain difficulties and harbors certain unfounded fears. So when they find something they may reasonably fear, they satisfy themselves that they have good reason for remaining indolent.… Indeed sluggards do not plow because of the cold, when they find an excuse for not doing the good things which they ought to do. Sluggards do not plow because of the cold, when they are afraid of small evils that confront them and leave undone things of the greatest importance. It is well said, “They shall beg in summer, and it shall not be given to them.” For those who do not toil now in good works will beg in summer and receive nothing, because, when the burning sun of judgment shall appear, they will then beg in vain for entrance into the kingdom.
