51.  By divine gift the heart of the righteous man is said to be made soft, in that it is penetrated with the fear of the judgment from Above.  For that it is soft, which is capable of being penetrated, but that is hard, which cannot be penetrated.  Whence it is said by Solomon, Happy is the man that feareth always, but he that hardeneth his heart shall fall into mischief. [Prov. 28, 14]  And so the merit of his dread he ascribes not to himself but to his Creator, who says, For God maketh my heart soft, and the Almighty troubleth me.  Now the hearts of good men are not secure but troubled, in that whilst they think of the heavy weight of the future reckoning, they do not seek to enjoy rest here, and they interrupt their security by the thought of the interior severity.  Which persons nevertheless, in the midst of the very chastenings of fear, often recall their mind to the gifts, and that by comforting they may cheer themselves, amidst this which they fear, they bring back the eye to the gifts which they have received, that hope may buoy up him whom fear bears down.
