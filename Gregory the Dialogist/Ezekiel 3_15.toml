Speech is freely accepted by the hearer that is offered by the preacher with compassion of spirit. Thus when iron is joined with iron, it is first dissolved so that afterwards it is in turn held by itself. But if it does not first soften, it will in no way be able to hold itself strongly. Thus the prophet first sat with the captive people and showed himself mourning in their midst, so that when by making this gracious gesture out of charity he showed himself to them as gentle, he immediately held them through the firmness of his speech.
