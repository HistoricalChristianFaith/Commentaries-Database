Among the other miracles of prophecy, the books of the prophets also have this wonder: that just as in them things are explained by words, so sometimes words are explained by things, so that not only their sayings but also their deeds are prophecy. Hence it is now said: "I came to the captivity, to the heap of new fruits, to those who dwelt by the river Chobar." When the occasion required that he should have indicated that he was coming to the captivity, what necessity of speaking was there to express the place also through fruits, saying "to the heap of new fruits," unless it is that often causes are signified through things and places? For many years of captivity had already passed while Ezekiel was prophesying, and of those who had been led into captivity, many had already died in the death of the flesh, to whose children the prophet was coming to speak. Hence it is also said to him above: "Son of man, I am sending you to the children of Israel, to apostate nations who have departed from me. Their fathers transgressed my covenant until this day, and the children are of stiff neck and indomitable heart, to whom I am sending you." Because many of these were going to believe and through obedience were going to arrive at the fertility of good work, they are called a heap of fruits. For that good souls are called the fruits of God, another prophet testifies, saying: "Israel is holy to the Lord, the firstfruits of his fruits." For the Gentiles converted to the faith also became the fruits of the Lord afterward. But because Israel first believed in the Lord, this prophet rightly called him the firstfruits of his fruits. Therefore, because the prophet was sent not to the earlier people but brought words to the children of that same people, he came to a heap of new fruits. But what is designated by the river Chobar, we have already said above; we do not repeat these things now, lest by repeating we generate tedium.

It should be noted with what great compassion the holy prophet joins himself to the captive people, and by sitting and grieving unites himself to their sorrows, because the root of the word is the power of the work. And that speech is willingly received by the hearer which is brought forth by the preacher with compassion of soul. Thus when iron is joined with iron, it is first liquefied, so that afterwards it may be held fast by itself in turn. For if it does not first become soft, it cannot afterwards hold firmly. Thus the prophet sat with the captive people, and stood grieving in their midst, so that while through the grace of charity he rendered himself softer to them by condescending, he might immediately hold them through the strength of the word. But if the Israelite people, who are called the house of exasperation, because they did not recognize their faults even amid scourges, did not depress their spirit with any grief, the prophet took care to sit grieving among those who were rejoicing, so that by being silent he might show what he had come to teach by speaking. And before he spoke words, in this that he was silent in grief he took on the form of words.
