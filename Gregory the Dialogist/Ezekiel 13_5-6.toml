He complains, saying, “You have not gone up against the enemy, neither built a wall for the house of Israel, to stand in the battle in the day of the Lord.” Now, to go up against the enemy is to speak boldly against the powers of this world for defense of the flock To stand in the battle in the day of the Lord is out of love of justice to resist evil people when they contend against us. For if a shepherd feared to say what is right, what else is it but to have turned his back in keeping silence? But surely, if he puts himself in front for the flock, he builds a wall against the enemy for the house of Israel.

To go up in opposition means openly to rebuke any powers that behave wickedly; and we hold fast in battle for the house of Israel on the day of the Lord and build a wall of resistance if we defend innocent believers against the unrighteousness of the wicked with the power of righteousness. Since a hireling does not do these things, he flees when he sees a wolf coming.
