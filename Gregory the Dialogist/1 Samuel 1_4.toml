14. What day do we believe this to be, except the one which Isaiah established by the testimony of the sacred Scriptures, saying: "He shall be led as a sheep to the slaughter, and as a lamb before its shearer shall be silent, and shall not open his mouth" (Isaiah 53:7)? For the day came when the brilliance of the promised oracle revealed the time of the Lord's passion. Then Elkanah sacrificed, because our Redeemer offered himself to the eternal Father in the sacrifice of our absolution through the death of the cross. Then he gave portions to Peninnah and to her sons and daughters, because indeed he brought back to the joys of paradise the elect of Judea whom he found in the underworld. For their portions are the gifts of everlasting joys. Whence also the Psalmist, choosing the situation of his lot, says: "Let my portion, O Lord, be in the land of the living" (Psalm 141:6). But fittingly Peninnah is named separately and the sons and daughters separately in receiving portions. For Peninnah signifies the teachers of Judea, while the sons designate her stronger hearers, and the daughters designate the weaker ones, her subjects. Therefore the mother, and sons, and daughters are mentioned separately: because on account of the unequal merits of the ancient elect, their rewards were not equal. It follows: (Verse 5.) But to Anna he gave one portion sadly: because he loved Anna.

(Moral Exposition) What is it that he says: "The day came, and he sacrificed"; and he did not say: "He worshipped, and he sacrificed," unless because, as I said above, we are so often raised up by divine condescension to behold the glory of divine brightness that we are then troubled by no mingled consideration of judgments. And although the elect soul never stands before almighty God without great veneration, nevertheless it as it were sacrifices but does not worship, when it so enjoys the happiness of that supreme joy that it is shaken by no dejection of fear. For she had come into this disposition who said: "Let him kiss me with the kiss of his mouth" (Song of Songs 1:1). What disposition of fear does she show who desires to be kissed? Hence also it is written of Moses: "That he spoke to God as a man is accustomed to speak to his friend" (Exodus 33:11). For, as if the day were coming, Sacred Scripture thus shows him sacrificing, such that no worship of fear had prostrated him. In which place I see this must be noted: that in order to worship and sacrifice, he is said to ascend, yet not to have worshipped and sacrificed when the day came, but only to have sacrificed. Therefore there are some days on which we ascend to worship and sacrifice; another is that day which, when it comes, we sacrifice. For while by our own effort we are suspended in meditation on divine things, they are as it were the appointed days of our ascent, because we behold certain rays of spiritual light, we ordain certain things for ourselves, we are raised up from the depth of our humanity to a certain height. But because nothing is accomplished in these meditations without divine grace, and because we cannot prevail either to strike fear into ourselves or to exhibit the sweetness of divine delight, they are indeed days of ascent on which we resolve to worship and sacrifice, but nevertheless in them we neither worship nor sacrifice. But another day comes, and we sacrifice, because we are sprinkled with the sudden light of divine grace, and from the glory of His Majesty we receive an ineffable abundance of love. This day, therefore, is not one of those, but follows them, because indeed if we cannot receive this bounty of divine grace by our own disposition, nevertheless we never merit it unless we take care altogether that both by meditating, and by reading daily, and by praying, we dwell upon those spiritual brightnesses which we are able to. But the day is said to have come so that heavenly condescension might be designated, because when it visits elect souls, it is not of our capacity but of its own goodness. There follows: (Verses 4 and 5.) "And he gave portions to Peninnah and to all her sons and daughters. But to Hannah he gave one portion, sad, because he loved Hannah."
