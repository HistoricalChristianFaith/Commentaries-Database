Behold, the king enters the wedding and contemplates the condition of our heart, and to him whom he does not find clothed in charity, he immediately says in anger: "Friend, how did you enter here not having a wedding garment?" It is greatly to be wondered at, dearest brothers, that he both calls him friend and rejects him, as if he were saying to him more openly: "Friend and not friend; friend by faith, but not friend by works." But he was struck silent, because—what cannot be said without groaning—in that strictness of the final rebuke, every argument of excuse ceases, since he who rebukes outwardly is the one who, as witness of conscience, accuses the soul within. But amid these things it must be known that whoever has this garment of virtue, but does not yet have it perfectly, ought not to despair of pardon at the entrance of the merciful king, because he himself also, granting us hope through the Psalmist, says: "Your eyes saw my imperfection, and in your book all shall be written."
