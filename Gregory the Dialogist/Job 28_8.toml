55.  In all the Latin copies we find the word ‘Instructors’ [Institutores] put down, but in the Greek we find ‘traders,’ [negotiatores] whereby it may be inferred that in this passage the several copyists from being ignorant put ‘instructors’ (‘institutors’) instead of ‘institores’ (‘ dealers’).  For we call traders ‘institores’ on this account, that they are ‘instant in plying work.’  But both the one phrase and the other, though they disagree in utterance, yet are not at variance in meaning, because all those who instruct the practice of the faithful, carryon a spiritual dealing, that while they supply preaching to their hearers, they should receive back from them faith and right works; as where it is written touching Holy Church, She maketh fine linen, and selleth it.  Concerning whom it is likewise said a little after in that place, She perceiveth that her trading is good. [Prov. 31, 24]  Who in this place are called ‘instructors’ but the holy Prophets, who busied themselves by prophesying to instruct the ways of the Synagogue unto faith?  ‘Sons’ of whom, assuredly, the holy Apostles are styled, who that they should believe God Man were begotten to the same faith by the preaching of those.  Concerning whom it is said to the Church by the Psalmist; Instead of thy fathers are born to thee children, whom thou mayest make princes over all the earth. [Ps. 45, 16]  But because the Apostles being thrust off went out from the borders of the Synagogue, it is lightly said now, The children of the dealers have not trodden it.  Since the ‘children of the dealers’ would have ‘trodden it,’ if the holy Preachers had borne down the badness of the Synagogue with the heel of goodness.  But if those same ‘dealers’ we take for the Preachers of Holy Church, then the ‘children’ of the dealers, nothing hinders us taking for the Shepherds and Teachers who followed the way of the Apostles.  Which did not ‘tread’ the Synagogue, because whilst their fathers, i.e. the Apostles, were thrust off by that Synagogue, they themselves too ceased from the calling of her.
56.  Which same Synagogue’ the lioness passed not by,’ because Holy Church, being devoted to the assembling together of the Gentiles, never any longer employed itself upon that people of Judaea.  Now the Church is lightly called’ a lioness,’ in that persons living amiss in bad habits, it kills with the mouth of holy preaching.  Hence to the first Shepherd himself it is said as to the mouth of this lioness; slay and eat. [Acts 10, 13]  For what is ‘slain’ is killed out of life, whilst that which is eaten is changed into the body of the person eating.  Accordingly it is said, ‘Slay and eat;’ i.e. ‘Kill those to the sin wherein they are living, and convert them from themselves into thine own members.’  And because this Church is the body of the Lord, the Lord likewise Himself by the voice of Jacob is called’ a lion’ in respect of Himself, a ‘lioness’ by the body, when it is said to him under the likeness of Judah, To the prey, my son, art thou gone up.  Thou hast couched as a lion, and as a lioness.  Who shall rouse him up? [Gen. 49, 9]  Accordingly this lioness it is never said’ passed not’ Judaea, but’ passed not through.’ For upon the Apostles preaching, in the first instance three thousand out of her, and afterwards five thousand, believed.  And so the Church’ passed by’ the way of the Synagogue, but’ passed not through,’ because a few from out of her it carried off to faith, but yet that faithless people it did not utterly make extinct to misbelief.  But, what we have already often said, being cast off by the infidelity of the Jews it turned away to the calling of the Gentiles.
