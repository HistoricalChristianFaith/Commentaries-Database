15. What is the least, if not the rejected? I mean rejected by himself, not by God: because by God one is rejected through pride; but he is rejected by himself who is considered worthless and lowly. Or he is called the least who, in comparison with others, does not appear to be anything. The rejected one, therefore, is called humble; because he sees himself despised and endures it, cares not at all to be displayed, but feeds the sheep; because he nourishes simple thoughts in the contemplation of the eternal inheritance. Of these pastures of the elect, the Lord certainly says: They shall go in and go out, and shall find pastures (John 10:9). For within they have the pastures of contemplation, without the pastures of good works. Within they enrich the mind with devotions, without they satisfy themselves with pious works. Rightly is this little one said to feed the sheep, because every chosen one is humble and is not barren, who daily does great things but does not think great things of himself. Rightly therefore he is declared not only the little one, but the shepherd: because those who are truly humble cast themselves down outwardly, but through interior fellowship they dwell in the highest and eternal pastures. For it is written: God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble (1 Peter 5:5). And what grace? If not that they may see and know the highest things, know and love them, and run toward those beloved things as ones who are well-fed and strong. And so, because he is exceedingly suitable, he is urgently commanded to be brought forth. For there follows: (Verse 11.) And Samuel said to Jesse: Send and bring him. For we shall not sit down until he comes.

16. But what does it mean, "We will not sit down until he comes"? Whom does he seek, except because in the observance of fasting the sacraments of anointing are to be celebrated? But we must attend not only to the sacraments themselves, but to the power of the sacraments. For there are certain foods which, if they are not avoided, by no means allow one to anoint kings well. Indeed, the outward affairs of the Church are certain foods of the soul, which are devoutly administered by the elect. But if the soul is satiated by the multitude of affairs, it is not perfectly permitted to enter into receiving spiritual things. Therefore, when spiritual matters are pressing, let outward things be deferred, because they must be arranged with great quietness of mind.

Therefore the boy who tends the sheep is sought in the pastures, because He submits Himself to the Father in obedience even unto death; yet who shall declare His generation (Isa. 53:8)? He is called the little one because the grace of His humility is commended. He is therefore called the little one, who is declared by the Psalmist to have been made lower than the angels (Ps. 8). But the little one tends the sheep, because through humility He is lowly, and through majesty He is exalted. Here He labors and hungers, but there He feeds the angels from the glory of His majesty. For while all receive from the fullness of His glory, they are, as it were, satisfied in those most blessed pastures by the boy. The little one is also declared to be the shepherd, because over the assumption of His flesh the heavenly citizens rejoice ineffably. For that ineffable joy of the blessed citizens is, as it were, the food of the sheep. He is therefore commanded to be brought forward urgently; until He comes, the reclining at table must necessarily be postponed. For they would have reclined at table before He came, if the people had believed in another. Therefore He had to be awaited, who was the singular and unique food of blessed souls. Whence He also says of Himself: I am the living bread which came down from heaven (John 6:51). But because He who ascended is the same one who descended (Eph. 4:10), He is sent there so that He may be brought forward. For to send to the pastures is to extend the mind above the angels even to the equality of the eternal Father. And to find Him is to believe Him equal to the supreme Father in all things. But he brings Him forward who already declares that He came for the Redemption of the human race through the humanity He assumed. For he had sent and brought Him forward—he to whom one is sent in His type—when he said: He who comes from heaven is above all (John 3:31). Isaiah was bringing forward the little one tending the sheep when he said: A little child is born to us, and a son is given to us, and His name shall be called Wonderful, Counselor, God, Mighty, Father of the age to come, Prince of Peace (Isa. 9:6). But because the faith of a teacher profits only himself for salvation and not also his hearers, He is commanded to be sent and brought forward, so that each one may have faith in Him through which he may deserve to be saved. For each one must go and bring Him, because they must firmly believe Him to be equal to the eternal Father through His divinity, and a partaker of our nature through His humanity.
