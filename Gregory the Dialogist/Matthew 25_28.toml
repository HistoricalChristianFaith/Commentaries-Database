But let us hear with what sentence he strikes the lazy servant: Take the talent from him, and give it to him who has ten talents.

It seemed very fitting that when the one talent is taken from the wicked servant, it should be given rather to the one who had received two talents than to the one who had received five. For it ought to have been given to the one who had less rather than to the one who had more. But, as we said above, by the five talents is signified knowledge of external things, that is, the five senses; while by the two talents are expressed understanding and action. Therefore the one who had received two talents had more than the one who had received five, because he who through the five talents merited the administration of external things was still empty of understanding of internal things. Therefore the one talent, which we said signifies understanding, ought to have been given to the one who had well administered the external things he had received. This we see daily in the holy Church, because many, while they well administer the external things they receive, are led through added grace also to mystical understanding, so that those who faithfully administer external things also excel in internal understanding.
