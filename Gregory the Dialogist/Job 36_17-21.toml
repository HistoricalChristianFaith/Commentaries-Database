[“Lay down your greatness without tribulation, and all the mighty in strength. Do not prolong the night, so that people should go up for them. Take heed that you do not decline to iniquity, for you have begun to follow this after misery.”] … What is this that, while he forbids him to decline iniquity, he condemns him for it at once, as if he had already declined it? Does this suggest that arrogant people wish rather to appear as judges rather than consolers? Hence also, they sometimes smite with severe sentences those faults that they suspect have arisen in the heart. And before the fault of the offenders is certain, severe invective of words is brought forward; and a person is struck by their sentence before anything appears to be smitten. Even just people commonly oppose, by reproof, wicked and secret thoughts, but when any preceding doings make plain these thoughts, they frequently root out from the hearts of their hearers, by the hand of reproof, those sins that have not shown themselves. But then they perceive that they are already following from others that proceed. For as physicians of the body discern that some diseases have already appeared but heal others, that they may not appear, so do holy teachers sometimes restore to health the wounds they have discovered, and sometimes so deal with people’s minds that they are not wounded.
