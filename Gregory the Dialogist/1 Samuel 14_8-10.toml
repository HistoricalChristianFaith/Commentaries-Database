It is the certain and undoubted judgment of the holy Church that chosen preachers must consider not only what, how much, and when they speak, but also to whom they speak. Hence the Lord too, concealing the word from the knowledge of certain people, forbids the disciples, saying: "Do not cast your pearls before swine" (Matt. 7:6). Likewise Scripture forbids the word to be poured out uselessly, and says: "Where there is no hearing, do not pour out speech" (Ecclus. 32:6). What then does it mean that Jonathan says: "If they say: Wait until we come to you, let us stand in our place; but if they say: Come up to us, let us go up, because the Lord has delivered them into our hands" — unless that the chosen preacher must attentively discern to whom he ought to bring forth the word of life? But because this now seems to be shown in the literal sense, let us express it more subtly. Preachers cross over to sinners when they please those to whom they present words not only by word but also by life. Who then are those who say: "Come up to us," unless those who bring forth signs of devotion, because they both reverently hear the word of salvation and earnestly desire to retain it? Therefore one must ascend to these, in whom, even if there is great labor in the work of ministry, there are also great gains of salvation. On the contrary, sinners eagerly desire to cross over to the teachers when they are plunged into such profound blindness that they strive to convert even the preachers themselves to the example of imitating their own depravity. For they are prone to evil, impenitent in heart, and they do not shrink from staining others with the leprosy of sin which they have put on. Of whom the wise man speaks, saying: "They rejoice when they have done evil, and exult in the worst things" (Prov. 2:14). And likewise the Prophet, prophesying about these, says: "They have proclaimed their sin like Sodom" (Isa. 3:9). What then does it mean when he says: "Let us stand in our place"? It is as if he were saying: If we cannot win them over, let us preserve ourselves in good conduct. For our place is good conduct, about which place it is written elsewhere: "If the spirit of one having power rises against you, do not leave your place" (Eccl. 10:4). Indeed this place must be guarded not only from the spirit but also from man, because that spirit not only confronts us by himself but also fights against us through man. But if our place is the Lord, when evil people set themselves against us, let us persist in our place, because when the incorrigible do not receive the warnings of preachers, the preachers themselves must carefully watch that no examples of those people may reach them.
