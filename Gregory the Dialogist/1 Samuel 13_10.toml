15. In this passage it must be considered with a trembling heart how, by neglecting to wait for the briefest time, he was rejected. "When he had completed the burnt offering," it says, "behold, Samuel was coming." If therefore he had waited for him only for the very briefest interval of time during which he offered the burnt offering, he could have securely obtained the strength of his kingdom. And so if the punishment is so great when a prophet is despised, what do we think is incurred from that ocean of divine judgment when the divine precepts themselves are disregarded? And because the delight of the flesh passes in a moment, and every commission of sins, and indeed the hour of transgression is brief, yet the punishment for the crime is not brief; because while we raise up the kingdom of sin in ourselves for a moment, we lose those kingdoms of all ages. For immediately after sin the prophetic word comes to rebuke — which would have been present, had we not sinned, to strengthen us in good. Indeed a polluted conscience now has the divine word against it; which, if it had avoided being polluted, aided by it and upheld, would have stood firm by its own strength. For what else does it spiritually signify to us when it is said: "And when he had completed offering the burnt offering, behold, Samuel was coming"? Even if he had not offered the burnt offering, Samuel would have come nonetheless. So indeed when we are tempted, divine grace is near to help those who endure; near also is divine justice to condemn those who fail. Whence Sacred Scripture, exhorting us to wait, says: "If the spirit of one having power rises against you, do not quickly abandon your place" (Eccles. 10:4). Hence the prophet, testifying, says: "The Lord is my helper, and therefore I am not confounded" (Isa. 50:7). Hence the Psalmist, looking to those same nearby aids, says: "I set the Lord always in my sight, for He is at my right hand, that I may not be moved" (Ps. 15:8). But let us now hear what the prophet says to the one who did not wait, and what he who was unwilling to wait answers: (Verse 11.) And Samuel spoke to him: "What have you done?"
