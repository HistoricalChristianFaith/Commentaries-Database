9.  It is written, For into a malicious soul wisdom shall not enter [Wisd. 1, 4]; and it is declared by the Psalmist, The rich have lacked and been a hungred [Ps. 34, 10].  For if their want and hunger were spoken of outward starving, then surely they would be any thing but rich, who were in want of the bread of the body.  But forasmuch as whilst they are increased without, they are rendered void within, they are described as rich and needy at one and the same time, in that they never entitle themselves to be filled with the bread of wisdom.  And so the children of this hypocrite are ‘worn down with want,’ because they that are born in hypocrisy in mimicry of him, whilst they do not hold the substance of truth, are brought to nought in the penury of the heart.
And his hands shall repay him his own grief.
10.  What is denoted by ‘hands,’ saving works?  Thus ‘his hands will repay him grief,’ because he will reap just damnation from his wicked course of life.  Now it is well said, not ‘give,’ but ‘repay,’ in that his froward deeds shall pay him back eternal punishment like a kind of debt.  But before he is brought to eternal punishment, let him add more fully the sort of character that he shows himself here.
