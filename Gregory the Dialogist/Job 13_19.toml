52.  Holy men so guard themselves in their good works, with God for their aid, that there can be no where found, without, grounds, whereon to accuse them; but within, in the secret thoughts of their own hearts, they watch over themselves with such good heed, that, if it might be, they may at all times stand blameless before the eyes of the interior Judge.  But what they are able to effect, that they never should slip outwardly in act, they are unable to effect inwardly, that they never should make a false step in thought.  For man’s conscience, from the very fact that it withdraws [g] from the things deepest within, is always on slippery ground.  Whence it comes to pass, that even holy men often slip in them.  So let holy Job, speaking as well in his own voice as in the voice of the Elect, say, Who is he that will plead with me?  Let him come.  For, seeing that in external actions there is no occasion for which to fasten a blame upon him, he freely looks about for an accuser.  But because the consciences even of the righteous sometimes have to charge themselves with foolishness of thought, it is on this account perhaps that it is added;
Why am I consumed in silence?
53.  For he is ‘consumed in silence,’ who, in blaming himself for foolishness of thought, is gnawed in his own heart by the tooth of conscience.  As if he said in plain words, ‘As I have so lived that I should never fear any accuser without, would that I had so lived that I should never have my conscience for mine accuser within me.’  For he is ‘consumed in silence,’ who discovers in himself within cause whereby the fire should gnaw him [unde uratur].
