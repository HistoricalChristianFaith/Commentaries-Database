3.  For those are ‘windy words,’ which serve the end of temporal inflating, rather than the end of righteousness.  Now oftentimes the wicked speak even good things, but because they do not say them well, they are putting forth ‘windy words:’ for their words, even if they be at any time sound in the sentence, are yet blown out in self-elation.  But in this that is said, viz. burthensome comforters are ye all; what else are we taught by the tutorage of blessed Job, but that everyone should learn to look to it heedfully, that in the season of sorrow he never urge words of upbraiding?  For if there be some points which might be justly found fault with in time of distress, they ought to be put aside, lest the comforter by rebuking heighten the sorrow, which he had it in view to alleviate.  It goes on;
Or is there any thing troublesome to thee, if Thou speakest?
4.  When bad men utter abusive words to those that are like to themselves, they are the more quickly silenced, in proportion as they in a moment hear concerning themselves the like to what they say to their hearers.  But when they assail good men by words of contumely, nought of annoyance is occasioned them by their abuse, in, that they speak against those that hold their peace, nor are made to hear what they are, seeing that the righteous never return abuse, even when they are made to bear what they are not.  And so it is well said, Or is there any thing troublesome to thee if thou speakest?  As if it were said in plain words to him; ‘Thou speakest the more, that thou hearest not from me any thing unpleasant concerning the conduct.’  Hence it is added, I also could speak as ye do.  The just man tells what he had the power to do, but lest he should depart from righteousness, he forbears what he might have done.
