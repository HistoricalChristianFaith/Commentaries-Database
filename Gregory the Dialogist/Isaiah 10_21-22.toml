But grace from above sometimes looks upon these mighty men and afflicts them by the very employments caused by their abundant goods and intersperses with their prosperity adverse but profitable tribulation. [This is done] in order that, being sorrowful, they may turn to their heart and learn how vainly they are engaged in perishable pursuits.… This can be especially understood also of the Jews.… Because they are to be admitted to the faith at the end of the world … it is said by Isaiah, “if the number of the children of Israel shall be as the sand of the sea, a remnant shall be saved.” For the light returns to them when they themselves return to confess the power of our Redeemer.
