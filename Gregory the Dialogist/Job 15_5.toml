30.  ‘Iniquity teaches the mouth,’ when there is conceived by a bad life somewhat to be spoken of a worse kind.  Now because blessed Job was free in speech in proportion as he was holy in action, by his friends, who hold the type of heretics, he is found fault with at once on the grounds of a wicked life and of a bold mouth, so that it should be said, Thine iniquity teacheth thy mouth.  As if it were said to him in plain words, ‘What thou speakest wickedly, thou hast learnt of a more wicked life.’  But it often happens that heretics, whilst in seeming they venerate God, oppose His mysteries, and they think it humility if they deny the truth.  For there are some, who imagine that they are bringing injury upon God, if they confess that He took true flesh, or if they should think that He was capable of really dying for us in the flesh.  And whilst they endeavour as it were to bestow upon God a greater degree of honour, they are enforced to deny the real praises of His goodness.  For in praise of His charity what is there more efficacious, than that in our behalf He should make those things meet to Himself for the undertaking them, which seem for Him unworthy.  But Holy Church confesses His very and true Flesh, His very and true Death, but in declaring these things she is thought by Heretics to put an indignity upon God.  Whence it is said now, And thou followest the tongue of them that blaspheme.  And if any piece of adversity befall her in this world, they say that it was brought upon her by this very injuriousness of her confession.
