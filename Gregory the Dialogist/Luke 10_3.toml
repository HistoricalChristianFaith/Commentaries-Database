But would that if we are not sufficient for the power of preaching, we might at least maintain the duty of our position in innocence of life. For it is added: Behold, I send you as lambs among wolves. But many, when they receive the rights of governance, burn to tear apart their subjects, display the terror of power, and harm those whom they ought to have benefited. And because they do not have the bowels of charity, they desire to be seen as lords, they do not at all recognize themselves to be fathers, they change the place of humility into the exaltation of domination, and if ever they flatter outwardly, inwardly they rage. Concerning whom the Truth says elsewhere: They come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravenous wolves. Against all these things, we must consider that we are sent as lambs among wolves, so that, preserving the sense of innocence, we may not have the bite of malice. For he who undertakes the position of preaching ought not to inflict evils, but to endure them, so that by his very meekness he may soften the anger of those who rage, and he himself, wounded by afflictions, may heal the wounds of sins in others. And if ever the zeal of righteousness demands that he rage against his subjects, let that fury be from love, not from cruelty, so that he may both display the rights of discipline outwardly, and inwardly love with fatherly affection those whom he chastises as if pursuing them outwardly. This a Ruler exhibits well when he does not know how to love himself through private affection, when he desires nothing of the things of the world, when he in no way bends the neck of his mind to the burdens of earthly desire.
