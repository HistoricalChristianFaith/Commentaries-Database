But the holy man shows why he said these things first, for he added, saying: "Now therefore stand still, and I will contend with you in judgment before the Lord concerning all the mercies which he has done for you and for your fathers."

4. It is the order of the highest reason that he who does not take care to do good things should by no means reprove evils in others. The holy man therefore first carefully asserted that he had avoided evils himself, and then proceeded to the reproof of others; so as to suggest the character of a chosen preacher, who cannot effectively bear the fruit of preaching unless he also demonstrates by the splendor of his conduct what he preaches as luminous concerning eternity. He says therefore: "Now stand, and I will plead with you in judgment before the Lord concerning all the mercies of the Lord." For the hearers to stand is to raise the attention of the mind to the word of the preacher. Rightly therefore they are commanded to stand, because a teacher accomplishes nothing by exhortation if the hearer does not direct his mind to the things he speaks.
