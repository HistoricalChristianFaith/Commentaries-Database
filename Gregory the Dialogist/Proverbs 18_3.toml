The evil mind is always set in pains and labors, since it is either contriving mischiefs that it may bring down or fearing lest these be brought down upon it by others. While hatching plots against neighbors, one becomes all the more afraid of plots being hatched by neighbors against oneself.â€¦ Even when there is peace, he suspects plots, in that he, who is always dealing craftily, calculates that there is no one who might deal honestly with himself.
