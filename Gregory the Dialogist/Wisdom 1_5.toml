The Spirit goes elsewhere when his grace distances itself from the proud and from those who are insincere. Thus it is written, “The Holy Spirit of instruction flees deceit.” Therefore Christ himself says in the Gospel, “The Spirit blows where he wills, and you hear his voice, but you do not know where he comes from or where he goes.” The Spirit comes and goes, because he abandons the reprobate, taking to himself the elect. And because God’s judgment is omnipotent and inscrutable, human beings do not know where they come from or where they go. Indeed, it is not possible to know whether someone will persevere to the end in the grace he has received. It is said therefore that the Spirit leaves one who has fallen and goes to one who will persevere, because, in this earthly life, he abandons some and takes others to himself, whom he does not abandon.
