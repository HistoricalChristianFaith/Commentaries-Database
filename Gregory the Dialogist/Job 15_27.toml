50.  For the sight is in the face, wherein too is the first more honourable part of the body.  Therefore the best of the mind is not unjustly denoted by the face, which wherever we turn it, there we see.  And so ‘fatness covers the face,’ in that the earnestly coveted abundance of earthly good things presses down the eyes of the mind, and that which should be honourable [A.B.C.D. more honorable] in them, it makes foul in the eyes of God, in that it weighs it to the earth with a multitude of concerns.  Who do not however find it enough that they themselves should be full of pride, unless those too that are united to them, themselves also are made boastful by their fatness.  For there are some who on being countenanced by the patronage of the greater ones, are set up with pride, and on the strength of their power uplifted against the destitute.  Hence it is yet further subjoined;
And the fat hangs from his sides. 
51.  Because the fat is the richness of the flesh, and we are accustomed to call those persons the ‘sides’ [latera] of the rich, whom we see united to them, ‘the fat hangs down from his sides,’ in that every one that attaches himself to the powerful and wicked man is by his power himself also as it were swollen with the fatness of good things, so that following the wickedness of an evil patron he has no fear of God, he distresses the poor, whom he is able, and as much as he is able, and uplifts his heart on the strength of temporal glory.  So when there is such an one who is attached to a powerful wicked man, ‘from his side,’ surely enough, ‘the fat hangs down.’
