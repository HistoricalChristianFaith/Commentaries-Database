When they are intent on increasing money, let them hear what is written: “The covetous man is not filled with money, and he that loves riches shall not reap fruit thereof.” For indeed he would reap fruit of them, were he minded, not loving them, to disperse them well. But whoever in his affection for them retains them shall surely leave them behind here without fruit. When they burn to be filled at once with all manner of wealth, let them hear what is written: “He that makes haste to be rich shall not be innocent.” For certainly he who goes about to increase wealth is negligent in avoiding sin; and, being caught after the manner of birds, while looking greedily at the bait of earthly things, he is not aware in what a noose of sin he is being strangled.
