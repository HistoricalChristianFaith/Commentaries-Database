And well is it added concerning the waiting servants: "That when he comes and knocks, they may open to him immediately." For the Lord comes when he hastens to judgment; he knocks when through the troubles of illness he indicates that death is near. We open to him immediately if we receive him with love. For he who trembles to depart from the body does not wish to open to the judge who knocks, and fears to see as judge him whom he remembers having despised. But he who is confident in his hope and work opens immediately to the one who knocks, because he awaits the judge joyfully; and when he recognizes that the time of approaching death has come, he rejoices in the glory of recompense. Hence it is immediately added: "Blessed are those servants whom the lord, when he comes, shall find watching." He watches who keeps the eyes of his mind open to behold the true light; he watches who preserves in action what he believes; he watches who repels from himself the darkness of torpor and negligence. Hence Paul says: "Awake, you righteous, and do not sin." Hence again he says: "It is now the hour for us to rise from sleep."

But let us hear what the coming Lord shows to his watchful servants: "Amen I say to you, that he will gird himself, and make them recline, and passing by will minister to them." He will gird himself, that is, he will prepare himself for recompense; and he will make them recline, that is, to be refreshed in eternal rest. For our reclining in the kingdom is to rest. Whence again the Lord says: "They will come and recline with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob." But the Lord passing by ministers, because he satisfies us with the illumination of his light. And it is said "passing," when he returns from judgment to the kingdom. Or certainly the Lord passes by for us after the judgment, because he raises us from the form of humanity to the contemplation of his divinity. And his passing is to lead us into the vision of his glory, when him whom we perceive in humanity at the judgment, we also see in divinity after the judgment. For coming to judgment, he appears to all in the form of a servant, because it is written: "They will look upon him whom they pierced." But when the reprobate fall into punishment, the just are drawn to the glory of his brightness, as it is written: "Let the impious one be taken away, lest he see the glory of God."
