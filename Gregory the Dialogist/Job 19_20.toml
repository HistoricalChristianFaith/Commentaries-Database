57.  By ‘bone’ we have strength, and by flesh weakness of the body denoted; therefore, whereas Christ and the Church are one person, what is signified by the ‘bone’ but the Lord Himself?  what by the ‘flesh’ save the disciples, who in the hour of His Passion were weakly disposed?  but by the ‘skin,’ which in the body remains more outward than the flesh, what is represented but those holy women, who with the view to furnish the stays of the body, served the Lord by outward offices of ministration?  for when His disciples, though not yet firm, were preaching faith to the people, the flesh kept close to its bone; and when the holy women prepared the outward things that were necessary, they as it were like ‘a skin’ remained on the body outwards; but when it came to the hour of the Cross, exceeding great fear, caused by the persecution of the Jews, took possession of His disciples: they severally fled, the women ‘stuck close,’ and so, the ‘flesh,’ as it were, ‘being consumed,’ ‘the bone of the Lord clave to its skin,’ in that His strength, when the disciples fled in the hour of the Passion, had the women close beside it.  Peter indeed stood for some time, but yet afterwards being affrighted he denied Him.  John too stood, to whom at the very time of the Cross it was said, Behold thy mother. [John 19, 27]  But he could not persevere; since it is also written concerning him [a], And there followed Him a certain young man, having a linen cloth cast about his naked body, and the young men laid hold of him.  And he left the linen cloth, and fled from them naked; [Mark 14, 51.  52.] who although afterwards, to hear the words of his Redeemer, he returned at the hour of the Cross, yet first he was affrighted and fled; but the women are related not only not to have been afraid nor to have fled, but even to have stood fast even to the sepulchre; and so let him say, My bone cleaveth to my skin, through the flesh being wasted; i.e. ‘they that ought to have attached themselves closer to My strength, in the season of My Passion were consumed with dread; and those whom I set to external ministrations, in My Passion I found attached themselves faithfully to Me without fear.’  And here it is plainly implied that these words are delivered in mystery, in that it follows;
And the lips only are left about my teeth.
58.  For what do we have ‘about our teeth,’ but ‘lips,’ even if we suffer no scourges of affliction?  but what is signified by ‘the lips’ but talk, what by ‘teeth’ but the holy Apostles?  who are with this intention set in this body of the Church, that they may bite at the life of the carnal by correction, and break it in pieces from the hardness of its obstinacy; and hence it is said to that first of the Apostles, as being set, as a tooth in His Body, Kill, and eat. [Acts 10, 13]  But because, at the time of His Passion, these ‘teeth’ from fear of death lost the biting of correction, lost the assurance of strength, lost the efficiency of practice of every sort, so that two of them as they walked, after His death and resurrection, talked by the way and said, But we trusted that it should have been he which should have redeemed Israel; [Luke 24, 21] it is rightly said here, And the lips only are left about my teeth.  They were still conversing about Him, but now they no longer at all believed in Him; and so ‘the lips only remained about His teeth,’ in that they had parted with the efficiency of good practice, and only retained words of converse about Him.  They had lost the bite of correction, and possessed the mooting of speech.  Therefore, ‘the lips only were left about the teeth,’ in that to talk about Him indeed they knew still, but to preach Him now, or to bite the bad ways of unbelievers, they were afraid.  Therefore these particulars being finished, which he spoke in the voice of the Head, blessed Job is brought back to his own words.
