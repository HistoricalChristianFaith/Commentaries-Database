Certainly, this very pastor of the Church, at whose most sacred body we are seated, let the servant girl who was the doorkeeper, when questioned, tell how great was his weakness and how great his fear before the coming of the Spirit. For struck by the voice of one woman, while he feared to die, he denied the Life. And then Peter denied on earth, while the thief confessed on the cross. But let us hear what kind of man this person of such great fear became after the coming of the Spirit. A meeting of magistrates and elders takes place, and after being beaten the apostles are ordered not to speak in the name of Jesus: Peter responded with great authority: "We must obey God rather than men."
