(ut sup.) Their unbelieving minds, however, were unable to support these indications of eternity; and not understanding Him, sought to destroy Him: Then they took up stones to cast at Him.

Who, had He chosen to exert the power of His Divinity, could, without a word, by His mere nod, have seized them, with the very stones in their hands, and delivered them to immediate death. But He who came to suffer, was slow to execute judgment.

(ut sup.) What does our Lord mean by hiding Himself, but that the truth is hidden to them, who despise His words. The truth flies the company of an unhumbled soul. His example shows us, that we should in all humility rather retreat from the wrath of the proud, when it rises, than resist it, even though we might be able,

But what the Lord did against the fury of those stoning Him is shown when it is immediately added: "But Jesus hid Himself and went out of the temple." It is very remarkable, dearest brothers, why the Lord avoided His persecutors by hiding Himself, when if He had wished to exercise the power of His divinity, He could have bound them in their very blows by a silent command of His mind, or overwhelmed them with the punishment of sudden death. But because He had come to suffer, He did not wish to exercise judgment. Indeed, at the very time of His passion He both showed how much He could do, and yet endured that for which He had come. For when He said to His persecutors seeking Him, "I am He," by this voice alone He struck down their pride and laid them all flat on the ground. He who therefore could have escaped the hands of those stoning Him in this place without hiding Himself—why did He hide Himself, unless because our Redeemer, made man among men, speaks some things to us by word, other things by example? But what does He say to us by this example, except that even when we are able to resist, we should humbly avoid the wrath of the proud? Hence it is also said through Paul: "Give place to wrath." Let man consider with how great humility he ought to flee the anger of his neighbor, if God avoided the furies of the wrathful by hiding Himself. Let no one therefore raise himself up against insults received, let no one return reproach for reproach. For in imitation of God, it is more glorious to flee injury by keeping silent than to overcome it by responding.

But against this pride says in the heart: It is shameful that, having received an injury, you remain silent. Whoever observes that you receive an insult and remain silent does not think that you are showing patience, but that you are acknowledging guilt. But from where does this voice arise in our heart against patience, unless because we have fixed our thought on base things, and while we seek glory on earth, we do not care to please Him who watches us from heaven? Therefore, having received an insult, let us meditate in our work on the voice of God: I do not seek my own glory; there is one who seeks and judges. Moreover, what is written about the Lord, He hid himself, can be understood in another way. For He had preached many things to the Jews, but they mocked the words of His preaching. They also became worse from the preaching, who went so far as to throw stones. And what does the Lord signify by hiding Himself, except that the truth itself is hidden from those who disdain to follow His words? For truth flees the mind which it does not find humble. And how many are there today who detest the hardness of the Jews, because they refused to hear the preaching of the Lord, and yet such as they accuse those of having been toward the faith, such are they themselves toward works. They hear the precepts of the Lord, they recognize the miracles, but they refuse to turn from their depravities. Behold, He calls, and we do not wish to return. Behold, He waits, and we disregard His patience. Therefore, while there is time, brothers, let each one abandon his depravity, let him fear the patience of God, lest he whom one now despises as tranquil, one may by no means be able to escape when He is angry.
