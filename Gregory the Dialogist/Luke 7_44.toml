The good deeds of the sinful woman are enumerated to the Pharisee, the evil deeds of the false righteous man are enumerated, when it is said: "I entered your house, you gave no water for my feet; but she has washed my feet with tears and wiped them with her hair."

In a mystical sense, our Redeemer enumerates the deeds of this woman as if they were the good deeds of the Gentiles, so that the Jewish people might recognize in what evil they lie. For thus the Pharisee is rebuked, so that through him, as we have said, that faithless people might be shown. "I entered your house, you gave no water for my feet, but she has washed my feet with tears." Water indeed is outside us, but the moisture of tears is within us, because that faithless people never gave even those things that were outside themselves for the Lord; but the converted Gentiles poured out not only the substance of their possessions but even their blood for him.
