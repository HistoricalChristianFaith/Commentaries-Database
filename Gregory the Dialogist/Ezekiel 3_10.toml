"And he said to me: Son of man, receive in your heart all my words that I speak to you, and hear with your ears."

We must carefully observe that by the voice of the Lord it is said to the Prophet that he should first hear His words, and afterward speak. For we hear the words of God if we do them. And then we rightly speak them to our neighbors when we ourselves have first done them. This Mark the Evangelist confirms well when he narrates a miracle performed by the Lord, saying: "They bring to Him one deaf and mute, and they besought Him to lay His hand upon him." He indicates the order of the healing, adding: "He put His fingers into his ears, and spitting, He touched his tongue, and looking up to heaven, He sighed and said to him: Ephphetha, that is, be opened. And immediately his ears were opened, and the bond of his tongue was loosed, and he spoke rightly." For what does it mean that God, the Creator of all things, when He wished to heal the deaf and mute man, put His fingers into his ears and, spitting, touched his tongue? What is designated by the fingers of the Redeemer except the gifts of the Holy Spirit? Hence, when in another place He had cast out a demon, He said: "If I cast out demons by the finger of God, then the kingdom of God has surely come upon you." Concerning which matter He is described by another Evangelist as having said: "If I cast out demons by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you." From both these passages it is gathered that the finger of God is called the Spirit. Therefore to put fingers into the ears is to open the mind of the deaf person to obedience through the gifts of the Holy Spirit. But what does it mean that spitting He touched his tongue? The saliva received from the mouth of the Redeemer is for us wisdom in divine eloquence. For saliva flows down from the head into the mouth. Therefore when our tongue is touched by that wisdom which He Himself is, it is immediately formed for words of preaching. He looked up to heaven and sighed—not because He Himself had need of sighing, He who gave what He asked for, but He taught us to sigh to Him who presides over heaven, so that both our ears ought to be opened through the gifts of the Holy Spirit, and our tongue ought to be loosed through the saliva of the mouth, that is, through knowledge of divine speech, for words of preaching. To whom immediately "Ephphetha," that is, "be opened," is said; and immediately his ears were opened, and the bond of his tongue was loosed. In this matter it should be noted that "be opened" was said because of the closed ears. But for one whose ears of the heart have been opened to obedience, without doubt the bond of his tongue is also subsequently loosed, so that he may speak to others about the good things to be done which he himself has done. And here it is well added: "And he spoke rightly." For he speaks rightly who has first done by obeying what he advises by speaking should be done.
