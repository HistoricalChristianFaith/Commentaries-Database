51.  Which too is not at variance with the person of the self-same blessed Job, since he is only telling that concerning himself without, which ‘Truth’ had inwardly declared to his enemy concerning him; Hast thou considered My servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth?  And yet it is much less that the holy man records concerning himself, than what the Lord declared concerning him.  For it is one thing to be ‘just,’ and another to have ‘none like him.’  Therefore he thought humbly of himself, who, whereas he was just beyond comparison with another, described himself not just above others, but simply able to be ‘found just.’  It seems however to furnish this ground for raising a question in his words, viz. that he who said above, I will rebuke mine own ways before Him; and again says further on, Thou wouldest consume me in the inquities of my youth [ver. 26]; and seeing his sins with a distinct eye, says still further on, My transgression is sealed up in a bag, now saith, If I shall be judged, I know that I shall, be found just. [Job 14, 17]  For it is impossible for sin and righteousness to meet together.  But the holy man, attributing wickedness to himself, and the purifying of him to Almighty God, at once sees that he is a sinner in himself, and knows that he is made righteous by free gift.  Who even in the midst of good practice earned in superabounding grace to have stripes put upon him.  And he already rejoices to be ‘found just’ in Judgment, who beheld himself before Judgment smitten with the rod.  Hence too when he says long afterwards, My transgression is sealed up in a bag, he adds directly; but Thou hast healed mine iniquity.  He, then, that describes himself as ‘found just’ in Judgment, says not at all that he is not justly smitten, although the Lord did not intend to obliterate sins by the scourge, but to increase his merits.
