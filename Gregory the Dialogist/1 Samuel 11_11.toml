12. The people are indeed divided into parts, so that we may strike the serpent Nahash not with a single battle line. And indeed they are divided into three parts, so that the fruit and dignity of sacred abstinence may be shown: because through fasting we are called back to that contemplation of the Holy Trinity which we lose by eating. For hence it is that the fasts of the Law, the Prophets, and the Gospel are commended. For Moses, that he might deserve to receive the Law, fasted twice for a period of forty days (Exod. 34:28). Elijah, that he might escape the hands of Jezebel, in forty days by the strength of a single meal arrived at Horeb, the mountain of God (1 Kings 19:8). Our Lord and Redeemer Jesus Christ, fasting for forty days in the wilderness, took no food whatsoever (Matt. 4:2). Therefore Saul divides the people into three parts: because as an example for those who practice abstinence, the fasts of the Law, the Prophets, and the Gospel are set forth. And when the next day comes, the teacher enters the midst of the camp: because divine grace, which illuminates the hearts of preachers for teaching, also irradiates the minds of the hearers and powerfully raises them to the hope of victory. On the next day, therefore, the teacher, about to triumph, enters the camp of the enemies and lays it open, and in it powerfully strikes the battle lines of concupiscence. And because the minds of the subjects themselves advance by hearing, the king is said to enter the camp of the Ammonites in the morning watch and to continue in their slaughter until the day grew hot. The morning watch is indeed in God's inspiration; the heat of the sun is in its fullness. For as it were the morning light rises for us when, weighed down by the darkness of temptations, we begin to see from the mouth of preachers the light of virtue, that we may follow it. And the sun grows hot for us when through their words our mind is kindled and, as if refined by the heat of a burning sun, is inflamed with holy desires. Then indeed Ammon is violently struck down: because the people of vices is driven from our senses. Therefore the ruler who enters the camp of the Ammonites in the morning watch should not sheathe his sword from slaughter until the day grows hot, because he ought to persist in the instruction of his subjects for so long as it takes until he sees them inflamed with the great heats of the inner light. In this place it should be noted that Nahash, that is, "serpent," is said to be king of the Ammonites; but the people Ammon itself is interpreted as "sorrow." And because we have said that the vice of gluttony is signified by this serpent, when Nahash is struck, the people of sorrow is conquered: because from the one vice of gluttony, innumerable hosts of vices are brought forth to wage war against the soul. And when that same vice of gluttony is cut away, we subjugate many other vices to ourselves. The vice of gluttony is indeed one, but the stings of lust are innumerable, which follow that one going before them as if he were their king. They indeed suggest pleasant things, but lead to the laments of eternal weeping. When Nahash therefore is fought against, the people of sorrow is slain: because when we tame gluttony, the incitements of lust are destroyed. Whence it is rightly asserted that not Nahash himself, but Ammon subject to him—that is, the people—is slain: because the appetite for eating is to be restrained, not extinguished. But it is never well restrained if the people of sorrow that follows—that is, the shameful motions of lust—are not put to death. Against Nahash, therefore, our principal struggle lies: because when he is overcome, Ammon is slain; because lust is then well struck down if its principal origin is subjugated. But how far the progress of chastity advances is secretly shown through what follows. For it says: (Verse 11) "But the rest were scattered, so that not even two were left together."

13. The proof of true abstinence is not in the weakening of the body, but in the perfection of chastity. For the serpent is well worn down if gluttony is so restrained that all the violence of lustful bodily movements is diminished. For the illicit movement of the flesh, as long as the flesh itself exists, cannot be removed, but the violence of its movement can be removed. Indeed, it cannot be taken from the flesh that the law of the flesh should not move its members; yet the violence of the movement can be taken from the flesh, so that the movement remains, but all the obscenity of pleasure is taken away from that same movement, and that movement becomes simple, in which no remaining baseness of lust exists. Well, therefore, are others said to have been turned to flight, because when divine grace perfectly rewards those who are abstinent, it removes from their bodily movements all the stings of obscenities; but it leaves them their natural movements, so that they may always be tempted but never be conquered; since it leaves behind what greatly displeases them, yet so weakens what it leaves behind that it does not permit it to prevail over the victors. He had indeed struck the Ammonites who said: "I chastise my body and bring it into subjection, lest while preaching to others, I myself should become a castaway" (1 Cor. 9:27). Yet even after others were slain, he could not slay the fugitives, because he laments, saying: "I see another law in my members warring against the law of my mind" (Rom. 7:23). Likewise, because he saw that those who remained were weakened, he says: "No creature shall be able to separate us from the love of Christ" (Rom. 8:39). What then does it mean that he laments that a law dwells in his members warring against the law of his mind, if after some were destroyed, others were turned to flight—unless it is because perfect men grieve vehemently over this very thing, that they endure simple movements of the flesh against their will? For they would wish so to remain in the flesh that they would endure nothing from the flesh against the will of the mind. And because this is impossible, he said beforehand: "To will is present with me, but to accomplish I find not. For the good that I will, I do not; but the evil that I hate, that I do" (Rom. 7:18–19). As if he were saying: I would wish to be in the flesh, not with that perfection by which one perfected in the flesh is perfect, but as the angels of God in heaven. But this power I find not, because as long as the death of sin has not been swallowed up in the future resurrection, that which is sin dwelling in me moves me against myself. But what cannot be extinguished can be put to flight. For the movement of the flesh is, as it were, turned to flight when it is well chastised by fasting. For it rises against the spirit all the more rarely and with greater difficulty, the more the presiding spirit subjects it to itself through mortification, since it so tames it that it is slow to rebel and quick to be stilled.

14. But it must be subtly observed what is said: "So that two were not left together." Two indeed remain, but they do not remain together. For there are two things: impure thought and the natural movement of the flesh. In the struggle of the saints, sometimes an impure thought comes first, and sometimes they feel the law of the flesh rising against the law of the mind; but those who are already victors do not fear enemies turned to flight if they return again to battle, because they cannot fight against them simultaneously. For when a wicked thought presents itself, they cast it away before the flesh is moved by its suggestion. And when the law of the flesh stirs the members, the law of the mind in no way nourishes the shameful movement by thinking shameful things; and while it casts away the one, it by no means feels the attack of the other. Rightly, therefore, it is said of the perfect victory of the elect that "the others were scattered, so that two of them were not left together": because through the mortification of the body they advance to such a height of perfection that whatever is brought against them from the flesh or from the mind is easily overcome, since these are not permitted to join together in battle. And indeed the elect attain this victory over all the senses of the body, those who can subject the besieging Nahash to themselves through the power of abstinence. For the flesh, when nourished and fattened, is prone to the fall of the tongue, the eyes, the hearing, smell, and touch. Therefore, when the illicit movements of the bodily senses are drawn from the vice of gluttony into warfare against the mind, it is as if the Ammonite people accompany King Nahash to the siege of the Israelites. But when Nahash is perfectly conquered, Ammon is both partly destroyed and partly put to flight in such a way that two of them are not found together; because when we wear down the body through abstinence, we weaken the countless illicit movements of our senses; and those we cannot entirely uproot, we put to flight as though enfeebled. Of these, two do not remain together against us in battle, because in the pleasure of any bodily sense, we do not join the sense of the mind to it. For often we see with our eyes, often we hear with our ears, often we perceive by touch, often by smell, things that can draw the carnal soul to illicit love; but by perfectly mortifying our flesh we are victors, because we do not see two of the conquered adversaries together. We may indeed behold desirable things, but we avoid joining the appetite of the soul to the movements of the eyes. Often too an illicit thought presents itself to the heart, but the victor over the serpent finds only its fleeting movement, which he observes, alone. For regarding those things which the heart thinks about accidentally, he by no means raises any of the bodily senses toward them through illicit movement. Such indeed are those whom the prophet marvels at, saying: "Who are these that fly as clouds, and as doves to their windows?" (Isaiah 60:8). For they are like doves at their windows who receive desirable things but do not lose the simplicity of a pure heart by desiring them; because they see things they might crave, but they avoid illicitly craving what they behold. Because we advance toward this victory through the exhortation of our preachers, it is fittingly recorded that the Ammonite people were defeated and slain by Saul. Their wars, indeed, are not uniform but diverse. For sometimes they powerfully crush hidden adversaries, and sometimes they wisely endure false brethren. The former they subdue within by great virtue; the latter they tolerate without by wondrous patience. Within, through immense struggles, they are distinguished by the glory of great triumphs; but without, they are adorned with the incomparable honors of such great meekness. We who have learned the account of their inner victory, let us now hear how they also conquer outwardly. For it follows: "And the people said to Samuel: 'Who is it that said: Shall Saul reign over us? Give us the men, and we will kill them.' And Saul said: 'No one shall be killed on this day, because the Lord has wrought salvation in Israel.'"
