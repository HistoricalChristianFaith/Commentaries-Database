But many, when they receive the rights of governance, burn to tear apart their subjects, display the terror of power, and harm those whom they ought to have benefited. And because they do not have the bowels of charity, they desire to be seen as lords, they do not at all recognize themselves to be fathers, they change the place of humility into the exaltation of domination, and if ever they flatter outwardly, inwardly they rage. Concerning whom the Truth says elsewhere: They come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravenous wolves.
