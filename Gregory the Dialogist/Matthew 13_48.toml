They draw it out and sit beside the shore, because just as the sea signifies the world, so the shore of the sea signifies the end of the world. At which end, namely, good fish are selected into vessels, while the bad are thrown away, because each of the elect is received into eternal tabernacles, and having lost the light of the inner kingdom, the reprobate are dragged away to outer darkness. For now the net of faith holds us together, both good and bad, as if we were fish mixed together, but the shore reveals what the net, that is, the Holy Church, was dragging. And indeed fish that have been caught cannot be changed; but we are caught as evil, yet we are transformed into goodness. Let us therefore think about our capture, lest we be divided at the shore. Behold how pleasing today's solemnity is to you, so that it would be no small loss if anyone happened to be absent from this assembly of yours. What then will he do on that day, who is seized from the sight of the Judge, separated from the company of the elect, who is darkened from the light, tortured by eternal burning?
