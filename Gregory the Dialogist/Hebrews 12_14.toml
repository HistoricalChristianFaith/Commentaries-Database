It is written, “Follow peace with all men, and holiness, without which no man shall see God.” For in quarrels the very light of the soul, the light of good intent, is blocked. This is why the psalmist says, “My eye is troubled because of anger.” And what good works remain in us if we lose peace from the heart without which we cannot see the Lord? Therefore, act in such a way that you garner your reward even from those who through strife might have caused it to perish. May almighty God guard your love with heavenly grace and grant you to bear much fruit from those who are committed to you so that your measure may overflow with eternal joys.
