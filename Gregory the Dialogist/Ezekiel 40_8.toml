The man, whose appearance was like the appearance of bronze, measured the vestibule of the gate at eight cubits, and its front at two cubits. And lest we should believe the vestibule to be outside the gate, it is added: But the vestibule of the gate was on the inside. What is signified by the inner vestibule, if not the breadth of eternal life, which is now conceived in the mind through hope amid the narrow constraints of the present life? Of which it is said through the Psalmist: Enter his gates with confession, his courts with hymns of confessions. For when we confess our sins through tears, we enter the gate of the narrow life. But when after these things we are led to eternal life, we enter the courts of our gate with praises of confessions, because there will no longer be any narrowness there, when the joy of perpetual festivity has received us. On account of the narrowness of our confession, the Truth says: Enter through the narrow gate. And when the Psalmist presumed that he would be received into the breadth of eternal joy, he said: You have set my feet in a spacious place. Therefore one proceeds through the gate to the court, because one arrives at the breadth of solemnity from the narrowness of confession. Those joys, therefore, which are called courts in David, are called the inner vestibule in Ezekiel. Hence this same vestibule is said to have been measured at eight cubits. For there all are to be received who now both labor in the exercise of work and sigh for eternal joys through the grace of contemplation.

Nor is it unfitting that the measure of the vestibule is set at eight cubits, because all time unfolds in seven days. For the eternal day, which follows after the completion of the sevenfold succession of days, is indeed the eighth. Hence also the Psalmist, considering the day of resurrection, because he was about to speak of the severity of the final judgment, prefixed the title, saying: "Unto the end, a Psalm of David for the eighth." For to show which eighth day he meant—that day of tremendous terror—he continued at the beginning of the Psalm, saying: "O Lord, rebuke me not in your anger, nor chastise me in your fury." For now whoever is chastised through scourges and amended by corrections is chastised in gentleness, not in anger. But in that severe examination, all reproof and correction is fury and anger, because there is no pardon after correction. The reason for this number eight is that the Lord willed to rise from death after the Sabbath. For the Lord's Day, which is the third from the Lord's death, is numbered as the eighth from the creation of days, because it follows the seventh. Hence also the true passion of our Redeemer and his true resurrection prefigured something concerning his body in the days of his passion. For he suffered on the sixth day, rested in the tomb on the Sabbath, and rose from death on the Lord's Day. For the present life is still for us the sixth day, because it is spent in sorrows and tormented by afflictions. But on the Sabbath we rest as if in the tomb, because we find rest of soul after the body. But on the Lord's Day—that is, the third from the passion, the eighth from creation as we said—we rise in body from death, and we shall rejoice in the glory of the soul together with the flesh. Therefore what our Savior wondrously accomplished in himself, he truly signified in us, so that sorrow may receive us on the sixth day, rest on the seventh, and glory on the eighth. Hence it is said through Solomon: "Give a portion to seven, and also to eight, for you know not what evil shall be upon the earth." For we give a portion to seven and also to eight when we so arrange those things which unfold in seven days that through them we may come to eternal goods; so that while we act cautiously now, the wrath of the coming dreadful judgment may afterward be avoided. Therefore the vestibule is measured at eight cubits within, because through the light which follows after seven days, the breadth of eternity is opened to us.
