But let us now hear by what judgment this proud and arrogant man is convicted. For a parable is set before him concerning two debtors, of whom one owes less and the other more; when the debt of both is forgiven, he is asked which one loves the forgiver of the debt more. To these words he immediately replied: He loves more to whom more is forgiven. In this matter it should be noted that while the Pharisee is convicted by his own judgment, like a madman he carries the rope by which he will be bound.
