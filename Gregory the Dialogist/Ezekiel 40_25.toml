"And there were windows in it and in the arches thereof round about, like those windows: the length was fifty cubits, and the breadth five and twenty cubits."

Among these matters, however, it can be asked, since there are four parts of this world, why in this building of the outer court are not four but three gates mentioned? This would rightly have needed to be asked if the Prophet had seen a corporeal rather than a spiritual building. For the holy Church, that is, the spiritual building, has only three gates to reach the secret joys, namely faith, hope, and charity: one to the East, another to the North, a third to the South. For the gate to the East is faith, because through it the true light is born in the mind. The gate to the North is hope, because anyone placed in sins, if he has despaired of pardon, utterly loses mercy. Whence it is necessary that he who has been extinguished through his own iniquity may revive through hope of mercy. The gate to the South is charity, because it burns with the fire of love. For in the southern region the sun is raised on high, because through charity the light of faith is elevated in the love of God and neighbor. Therefore through three gates one proceeds to the inner court, because through faith, hope, and charity one arrives at the secret joys.

Another question also arises, why the gate of the inner court is said to be placed opposite the gate of the East and the North, while the fact that it opens toward the Southern gate is left unspoken. But because we have said that beginners are designated by the East and the fallen by the North, it was fitting that it be openly stated regarding either the beginners, for whom the sun is still in lukewarmness, or even regarding the fallen but returning through conversion, that the gate of the inner court lies open for them, so that he might make us certain about those concerning whom there could have been doubt. But this did not need to be said about the Southern gate, because no one is unaware that those who remain in virtues through fervor of spirit attain to the internal joys. For Aaron, at the people's demand, had made an idol, and rightly there could be doubt about his life. Therefore Moses is not called holy, because he is known by all to be holy; and he calls Aaron the holy one of the Lord, so that he might remove from us doubt about his life.
