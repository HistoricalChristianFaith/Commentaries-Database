Wherefore also a general exhortation to the disciples is fittingly added, when it is said: "Watch therefore, for ye know neither the day nor the hour." Because God accepts repentance after sins, if anyone knew at what time he would depart from this present world, he could have devoted one time to pleasures and another to repentance. But He who promised pardon to the penitent did not promise tomorrow to the sinner. Therefore we ought always to fear the last day, which we can never foresee.

Behold, this very day in which we speak we have received as a respite for conversion, and yet we refuse to weep for the evils we have done. Not only do we not lament what we have committed, but we even increase the things that should be wept over. But if some sickness seizes us, if signs of illness announce approaching death, we seek a respite for living that we may weep for our sins, and we seek with great fervor of desire those respites which, when we have received them, we now consider as nothing.

I relate a matter, dearest brethren, which if your charity wishes to hear attentively, you will be greatly instructed by considering it. There was a certain nobleman in the province of Valeria named Chrysaorius, whom the common people in rustic speech called Chryserius: a very capable man, but as full of vices as of possessions; swollen with pride, subject to the pleasures of his flesh, inflamed with the torches of avarice in acquiring things. But when the Lord had decreed to put an end to so many evils, as I learned from a certain religious man who still survives, a relative of his, he was struck with bodily illness. When he came to his end, at the very hour when he was about to depart from the body, with open eyes he saw foul and utterly black spirits standing before him, and vehemently pressing upon him to drag him away to the prison of hell.

He began to tremble, to grow pale, to sweat, and with loud cries to beg for a respite, and to call his son named Maximus, whom I myself, now a monk, saw as a monk, with excessive and agitated shouts, saying: "Maximus, run, I have never done you any harm, receive me into your protection." Maximus, disturbed, was present at once; the household gathered, weeping and making noise. But those malign spirits whom he so grievously endured pressing upon him they could not see, but they saw their presence in the confusion, in the pallor and trembling of him who was being dragged away. From fear of their hideous appearance he was turning this way and that on his bed; he lay on his left side, he could not bear the sight of them; he turned toward the wall, there they were. And when, exceedingly constrained, he despaired of being able to be released, he began to cry out with loud voice, saying: "A respite at least until morning, a respite at least until morning." But while he was crying out these things, in the midst of his very cries he was torn from the dwelling of his flesh.

From which it is certainly clear that he saw these things for us, not for himself, so that his vision might profit us whom divine patience still waits for with longsuffering. For what did it profit him to have seen the foul spirits before death and to have begged for a respite, when he did not receive the very respite he begged for? Let us therefore, dearest brethren, now carefully consider these things, lest our time pass away in vain, and then we seek to live for doing good when we are already being compelled to depart from the body.
