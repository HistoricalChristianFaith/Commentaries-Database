30. For she called him Lord, to whom she rendered the ministry of preaching, but in calling him Lord, she denied that she was drunk; so that she might subject herself to the higher order out of humility, and contradict the false accusation with truth. For in calling him Lord, she honored him; and in denying that she was drunk, she showed with sufficient humility what she was not. However, the accusation of drunkenness against the holy Church can be understood in another way. For while she was engaged in the ministry of evangelical preaching, while from the gain of believers she came into great glory among the peoples, the priests of the Jews did not think she was seeking the summit of eternal goods, but desiring the glory of earthly exaltation. Therefore, when she is called drunk, she is rebuked for having an overturned state of mind, for setting aside heavenly things and seeking earthly ones.

31. But she who despised the fleeting goods of the world says: "Not at all, my lord. For I am a woman exceedingly unhappy." As if to say: You think I desire the happiness of this passing world, but I see myself as all the more unhappy, the further I recognize the joys of my happiness to be from here. Because I believe I shall be happy there, here I consider myself greatly unhappy, since I desire no glory at all. Indeed, the holy Church is called a woman on account of her fruitfulness, exceedingly unhappy on account of her fortitude, because she was about to give birth to the world through the word, and she could not perfectly despise the glory of the world unless heavenly love strengthened her with wondrous fortitude; or she was exceedingly unhappy because she grieved not a little over the perdition of her people. The wise Solomon, greatly admiring her, says: "Who shall find a valiant woman?" (Prov. 31:10). In this passage it should also be noted that she does not say "an unhappy woman," but "exceedingly I am." For she was exceedingly unhappy, whom no enticement of the world pleased. Or certainly she declares herself exceedingly unhappy, who remembers that she was expelled from the joys of eternal life through the merit of the first sin, to which she cannot return except through many tribulations of this life. For she would not be exceedingly unhappy if she could have returned to the lost joys of paradise without present tribulation. Hence Paul, showing the inevitable hardship of this excessive unhappiness, says: "Through many tribulations we must enter into the kingdom of God" (Acts 14:21). As if therefore the holy Church, responding to the Jewish priesthood disparaging her, should say: You ascribe to me a kingdom in temporal happiness, but mine is that which is not attained except through the affliction of much tribulation. There follows: (Verse 15) "I have drunk neither wine nor anything that can intoxicate."

32. For he did not drink wine, because he did not seek temporal gains from the office of preaching. He did not drink anything else that could intoxicate, in that the concupiscence of the flesh did not overturn him into a fall of vices. According to the earlier interpretation, however, she did not drink wine, who had nothing of heretical depravity in her refreshment. She would have drunk something else that could intoxicate, if she had swelled up, deceived by eloquence of speech. But because she taught true things with right intention, adding, she says: (Verse 15.) But I poured out my soul in the sight of the Lord.

33. For to pour out one's soul in the sight of the Lord is to preach the knowledge of God's word conceived in the mind for the love of the Creator alone. Indeed, the soul is poured out when the inborn understanding of God's word is spread abroad for the benefit of hearers. For whoever preaches the word of God for human favor, whoever does so for earthly gain, because something other than preaching is sought from the preaching, that word of the soul is not brought forth in the sight of the Lord. Therefore the teacher of the nations also declares, saying: "We are not, as many, adulterating the word of God, but as from sincerity, but as from God, we speak before God in Christ" (2 Cor. 2:17). Therefore Hannah poured out her soul in the sight of the Lord, because holy Church, perfected at the summit of all virtues, brought forth great words of eloquence in the instruction of the faithful, but desired to please God alone through the words of life. She also commends the ministry of this preaching, saying: (Verse 16) "Do not consider your handmaid as one of the daughters of Belial, for from the abundance of my grief and sorrow I have spoken until now."
