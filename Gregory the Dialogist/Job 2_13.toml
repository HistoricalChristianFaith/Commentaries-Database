If the heart feels true sorrow, the vices cannot speak against it. And when one genuinely seeks an upright life, it is fruitless to prompt that person to do evil. But frequently, if we vigorously brace ourselves against the incitements of evil habits, we transform even those very evil habits into virtue. For some people are possessed by anger. Yet if they bring their anger under reason’s influence, it is transformed into service rendered to holy zeal. Some are lifted up by pride. But when they bow the mind before the fear of God, pride is transformed into a free and unfettered authority for the defense of justice. Physical strength is a snare to some. Yet when we control our physical strength through the practice of works of mercy, we purchase pity’s gains and are freed from the prompting of wickedness. - "Morals on the Book of Job 3.70"

68.  For by the weeping pity is betokened, discretion by the cutting of the garments, the affecting [al. ‘effecting’] of good works by the dust upon the head, humility by the sitting.  For sometimes the enemy in plotting against us feigns somewhat that is full of pity, that he may bring us down to an end of cruelty.  As is the case, when he prevents a fault being corrected by chastisement, that that, which is not suppressed in this life, may be stricken with the fire of hell.  Sometimes he presents the form of discretion to the eyes, and draws us on to snares of indiscretion, which happens, when at his instigation we as it were from prudence allow ourselves too much nourishment on account of our weakness, while we are imprudently raising against ourselves assaults of the flesh.  Sometimes he counterfeits the affecting of good works, yet hereby entails upon us restlessness in labours, as it happens, when a man cannot remain quiet, and, as it were, fears to be judged for idleness.  Sometimes he exhibits the form of humility, that he may steal away our affecting of the useful, as is the case when he declares to some that they are weaker and more useless than indeed they are, that whereas they look upon themselves as too unworthy, they may fear to administer the things wherein they might be able to benefit their neighbours.
69.  But these vices which the old enemy hides under the semblance of virtues, are very minutely examined by the hand of compunction.  For he that really grieves within, resolutely foredetermines what things are to be done outwardly, and what are not.  For if the virtue of compunction moves us in our inward parts, all the clamouring of evil dictates is made mute; and hence it follows.
And none spake a word unto him; for they saw that his grief was very great.
70.  For if the heart feels true sorrow, the vices have no tongue against it.  And when the life of uprightness is sought with an entire aim, the fruitless prompting of evil is closed up.  But oftentimes if we brace ourselves with strong energy against the incitements of evil habits, we turn even those very evil habits to the account of virtue.  For some are possessed by anger, but while they submit this to reason, they convert it into service rendered to holy zeal.  Some are lifted up by pride.  But whilst they bow down the mind to the fear of God, they change this into the free tone of unrestrained authority in defence of justice.  Strength of the flesh is a snare to some; but whilst they bring under the body by practising works of mercy, from the same quarter, whence they were exposed to the goading of wickedness, they purchase the gains of pitifulness.  And hence it is well that this blessed Job, after a multitude of conflicts, sacrifices a victim for his friends.  For those whom he has for long borne as enemies by their strife, he one day makes fellow-countrymen by his sacrifice, in that whilst we turn all evil thoughts into virtues, bringing them into subjection, by the offering of the intention, we as it were change the hostile aims of temptation into friendly dispositions.

50.  In the day we make out the objects that we look at, but in the night, either from the blindness we discern nothing, or from the uncertainty we are bewildered.  Accordingly by ‘day’ we have ‘understanding’ represented, and by ‘night,’ ‘ignorance.’  And by the number seven the sum of completeness is expressed; and hence in seven days, and no more, the whole of this transitory period is accomplished.  How then is it that the friends of blessed Job are said to sit with him seven days and seven nights, saving that heretics, whether in those things wherein they admit the true light, or in those wherein they are under the darkness of ignorance, as it were feign to let themselves down to Holy Church in her weakness, while under colour of caresses, they are preparing their snares to catch her withal?  and though, whether in the things which they do understand, or in those which they are unable to understand, through the swelling of a bloated self-elation, they account themselves great in their own eyes, yet sometimes in semblance they bend to Holy Church, and while they make soft their words, they insinuate their venom, ‘To sit upon the earth,’ then, is to exhibit somewhat of the figure of humility, that whilst their exterior appears humble, they may recommend the proud doctrines which they teach.
51.  But it is possible that by ‘the earth’ may be also represented the Incarnation of our Mediator.  And hence it is said to Israel, An altar of earth shalt thou then make unto Me. [Ex. 20, 24]  For to make an altar of earth for the Lord is to trust in the Incarnation of our Mediator.  For then our gift is received by God, when our humility has placed upon His Altar, i.e. upon the belief of our Lord's Incarnation, all the works that it performs.  Thus we place our offered gift upon an altar of earth, if our actions be firmly based upon faith in the Lord's Incarnation.  But there are some heretics, who do not deny that the Incarnation of the Mediator took place, but either think otherwise concerning His Divinity than is true, or in the character of the Incarnation itself are at variance with us.  They then that with us declare the true Incarnation of our Redeemer, as it were sit alike with Job upon the earth, and they are described as sitting upon the ground seven days and seven nights; forasmuch as whether in this very thing that they understand somewhat of the fulness of truth, or in this that they are thoroughly blinded by the darkness of their foolish minds, they cannot yet deny the mystery of the Incarnation.  And so to sit upon the earth with blessed Job, is to believe in the true Flesh of our Redeemer in unison with Holy Church.
52.  Now sometimes heretics wreak their animosity against us in punishments as well, sometimes they pursue us with words only.  Sometimes they provoke us when quiet, but  sometimes, seeing us hold our peace, they remain quiet, and they are friendly to the dumb, but hostile to them that open their lips, and hence forasmuch as blessed Job had not as yet said aught to them in converse, it is rightly added, And none spake a word unto him.  For we find our adversaries hold their peace, so long as we forbear by preaching to beget sons of the true faith.  But if we begin to speak aright, we immediately feel the weight of their reviling by their reply; forthwith they start into hostility, and burst out into a voice of bitterness against us, doubtless because they fear lest the hearts, which the weight of folly presses down beneath, should be drawn up on high by the voice of him that speaketh aright.  Therefore, as we have said, because our enemies love us when mute, and hate us when we speak, it is rightly said in the case of Job keeping silence,
And none spake a word unto him.
53.  Yet sometimes when they see the hearts of believers vacant through sloth, they do not cease to scatter the seeds of error by speech.  But when they see the minds of the good busied on high, seeking the way back to their country, earnestly sorrowing over the toils of this place of exile, they rein in their tongues with anxious heed; in that they see that whilst they assail those sorrowing hearts with fruitless words, they are speedily made to hold their peace.  And hence whereas it is well said, none spake a word unto him, the cause of their silence is immediately brought in by implication, when it is said,
For they saw that his grief was very great.
54.  For when our hearts are pierced with violent grief from the love of God, the adversary fears to speak frowardly at random, for he sees that by provoking the fixed mind, he not only has no power to draw it to untoward ways, but that by its being stirred up, he may chance to lose even those whom he held bound.
55.  Perhaps it may influence some that we have so made out these particulars, that what was well done by the friends should denote that which was to be ill done by heretics.  Yet in this way it very often happens that a circumstance is virtue in the historical fact, evil in its meaning and import, just as an action is sometimes in the doing ground of condemnation, but in the writing, a prophecy of merit, which we shall the sooner show, if we shall bring forward one testimony of Holy Writ to prove both points.  For who, that hears of it, not only among believers but of unbelievers themselves also, does not utterly loathe this, that David walking upon his solar lusteth after Beershebah the wife of Uriah?  Yet when he returns back from the battle, he bids him go home to wash his feet.  Whereupon he answered at once, The Ark of the Lord abideth in tents, shall I then take rest in my house? [2 Sam. 11, 11]  David received him to his own board, and delivers to him letters, through which he must die.  But of whom does David walking upon his solar bear a figure, saving of Him, concerning Whom it is written, He hath set his tabernacle in the sun? [Ps. 19, 4. Vulg.]  And what else is it to draw Beersheba to himself, but to join to Himself by a spiritual meaning the Law of the formal letter, which was united to a carnal people?  For Beersheba is rendered ‘the seventh well,’ assuredly, in that through the knowledge of the Law, with spiritual grace infused, perfect wisdom is ministered unto us.  And whom does Uriah denote, but the Jewish people, whose name is rendered by interpretation, ‘My light from God?’  Now forasmuch as the Jewish people is raised high by receiving the knowledge of the Law, it as it were glories ‘in the light of God.’  But David took from this Uriah his wife, and united her to himself, surely in that the strong-handed One, which is the rendering of ‘David,’ our Redeemer, showed Himself in the flesh, whilst He made known that the Law spake in a spiritual sense concerning Himself, Hereby, that it was held by them after the letter, He proved it to be alienated from the Jewish people, and joined it to Himself, in that He declared Himself to be proclaimed by it.  Yet David bids Uriah ‘go home to wash his feet,’ in that when the Lord came Incarnate, He bade the Jewish people turn back to the home of the conscience, and wipe off with their tears the defilements of their doings, that it should understand the precepts of the Law in a spiritual sense, and finding the fount of Baptism after the grievous hardness of the commandments, have recourse to water after toil.  But Uriah, who recalled to mind that the ark of the Lord was under tents, answered, that he could not enter into his house.  As if the Jewish people said, I view the precepts of God in carnal sacrifices, and I need not to go back to the conscience in following a spiritual meaning.  For he, as it were, declares ‘the ark of the Lord to be under tents,’ who views the precepts of God as designed for no other end than to show forth a service of carnal sacrifice.  Yet when he would not return home, David even bids him to his table, in that though the Jewish people disdain to return home into the conscience, yet the Redeemer at His coming avouches the commandments to be spiritual, saying, For had ye believed Moses, ye would  [Vulg. would perchance] have believed Me: for he wrote of Me. [John 5, 46]  And thus the Jewish people holds that Law, which tells of His Divinity, whereunto that people deigns not to give credence.  And hence Uriah is sent to Joab with letters, according to which he is to be put to death, in that the Jewish people bears itself the Law, by whose convicting testimony it is to die.  For whereas holding fast the commandments of the Law it strives hard to fulfil them, clearly it does itself deliver the judgment whereupon it is condemned.  What, then, in respect of the fact, is more foul than David?  What can be named purer than Uriah?  What again in respect of the mystery can be discovered holier than David, what more faithless than Uriah?  Since the one by guiltiness of life prophetically betokens innocency, and the other by innocency of life prophetically represents guilt.  Wherefore it is with no inaptitude that by the things that are well done by the friends of Job we have represented to us those to be done amiss by heretics, in that it is the excellency of Holy Writ so to relate the past as to set forth the future; in such wise to vindicate the case in the fact, that it is against it in the mystery; so to condemn the things done, that they are commended to us as fit to be done in the way of mystery.

22.  Whether they sat with the afflicted Job for seven days and seven nights together, or possibly for seven days and as many nights kept by him in assiduous and frequent visiting, we cannot tell.  For we are often said to be doing any thing for so many days, though we may not be continually busied therein all those days.  And often holy Scripture is wont to put the whole for a part, in like manner as it does a part for the whole.  Thus it speaks of a part for the whole, as where, in describing Jacob's household, it says, All the souls of the house of Jacob which came into Egypt were threescore and ten. [Gen. 46, 27]  Where indeed, while it makes mention of souls, it clearly takes in the bodies also of the comers.  Again it puts in the whole for a part, as where at the tomb Mary complains, saying, They have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid Him. [John 20, 2]  For it was the Body of the Lord only that she had come to seek, and yet she bewails the Lord as though His whole Person had been altogether taken away [tultum]; and so in this place too it is doubtful whether the whole is put for a part.
23.  Yet this circumstance, viz. that they were a long while silent, and yet in speaking after all were condemned, must not be passed over carelessly.  For there are some men who both begin to speak with precipitation, and follow out that unchecked beginning with still less check.  While there are some who are indeed backward to begin to speak, but having once begun know not how to set limits to their words.  Accordingly the friends of blessed Job, upon seeing his grief, were for long silent, yet, whilst slow to begin, they spoke with indiscretion, because they would not spare him in his grief.  They held their tongue that it might not begin over-hastily, but once begun they never ruled it, that it might not let itself out from imparting consolation so far as to offer insults.  And they indeed had come with a good intention to give comfort; yet that which the pious mind offered to God pure, their hasty speech defiled.  For it is written, If thou offerest rightly, but dividest not rightly, thou has sinned. [Gen. 4, 7. lxx.]  For it is rightly offered, when the thing that is done is done with a right intention.  But it is not ‘rightly divided,’ unless that which is done with a pious mind be made out with exact discrimination.  For to ‘divide the offering aright’ is to weigh all our good aims, carefully discriminating them; and whoso puts by doing this, even when we offer aright, is guilty of sin.
24.  And so it often happens, that in what we do with a good aim, by not exercising careful discrimination therein, we know nothing what end it will be judged withal [quo judicetur fine], and sometimes that becomes ground of accusation, which is accounted an occasion of virtue.  But whoever considers the doings of blessed Job's friends, cannot but see with what a pious intention they came to him.  For let us consider, what great love it showed to have come together by agreement to the stricken man; what a preeminent degree of longsuffering it proved to be with the afflicted, without speaking, seven days and nights; what humility, to sit upon the earth so many days and nights; what compassion, to sprinkle their heads with dust!  But yet when they began to speak, by the same means, whereby they reckoned to win the price of a reward, it was their lot to meet with the arraignment of rebuke; for to the unwary even that which is begun for the object of recompense alone, oftentimes turns to an issue in sin.  Observe!  by hasty speech they lost that good which it cost them so much labour to purchase.  And unless the grace of God had bidden them to offer sacrifice for their guilt, they might have been justly punished by the Lord, on the very grounds whereon they reckoned themselves exceeding well-pleasing to Him.  By the same proceeding they displease the Judge, whereby, as if in that Judge's defence, they please themselves through want of self-control.  Now it is for this reason that we speak thus, that we may recall to the recollection of our readers, for each one to consider heedfully with himself, with what dread visitations the Lord punishes the actions which are done with an evil design, if those which are begun with a good aim, but mixed with the heedlessness of indiscretion, are chastised with such severe rebuke.  For who would not believe that he had secured himself ground of recompense, either if in God's defence he had said aught against his neighbour, or at all events if in sorrow for a neighbour he had kept silence seven days and nights?  And yet the friends of blessed Job by doing this were brought into sin for their pains, because while the good aim of comforting which they were about was known to them, yet they did not know with what a balance of discretion it was to be done.  Whence it appears that we must not only regard what it is that we do, but also with what discretion we put it in execution.  First indeed, that we may never do evil in any manner, and next, that we may not do our good deeds without caution; and it is in fact to perform these good deeds with carefulness, that the Prophet admonishes us when he says, Cursed be he that doeth the work of the Lord negligently. [Jer. 48, 10. Vulg.]  But let these things stand us in stead to this end, that before the exact and incomprehensible scrutiny of the Awful Judge shall be, we may not only fear for all that we have done amiss, but if there be in us aught of the kind, for the very things that we have done well; for oftentimes that is found out to be sin at His Judgment, which before the Judgment passes for virtue, and from the same source, whence we look for the merciful recompense of our works, there comes upon us the chastisement of righteous vengeance.
