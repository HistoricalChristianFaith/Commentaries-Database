But perhaps someone may say: He rightly rose again who, being God, could not be held by death. Therefore, to instruct our ignorance, to strengthen our weakness, He did not wish the example of His own resurrection alone to suffice for us. He alone died at that time, and yet He by no means rose again alone. For it is written: "Many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep arose." Therefore all arguments of unbelief have been removed. For lest anyone say: A man ought not to hope for himself what God made man displayed in His flesh, behold we know that men rose again together with God, and we do not doubt that they were mere men. If therefore we are members of our Redeemer, let us presume in ourselves what is established to have taken place in the Head. If we greatly abase ourselves, we who are the lowest members ought to hope in ourselves for what we have heard concerning His higher members.
