And who is this strong man, except him of whom the Lord says in the Gospel, “No man can enter into a strong man’s house and spoil his goods, unless he first bind the strong man.” The Lord, therefore, bound the fountains and the torrents when he spread in the hearts of his apostles the streams of truth. Of whom it is said again by another prophet; “With joy shall you draw water from the fountains of the Savior.”
