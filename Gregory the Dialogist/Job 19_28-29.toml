Everyone who does wicked things, even he who is too indifferent to fear this, does not know of the judgment of God. If he did know that this was a thing to be feared, he would never do things that are destined to be punished. For there are very many who know that there is a final judgment as far as the words go, but by acting wickedly they bear witness that they do not know it. Since one does not dread this as he ought, he does not yet know with what a tempest of terror judgment will come. For if he had been taught to estimate the weight of the dreadful scrutiny, surely in fearing he would guard against the day of wrath. Moreover, “to fly from the face of the sword” is to propitiate the sentence of the strict visitation before it appears. For the dread and terror of the Judge cannot be avoided, except before the judgment. Now he is not discerned but is appeased by prayers. But when he shall sit on that dreadful inquest, he is both able to be seen and no longer able to be propitiated in that the deeds of the wicked, which he bore long in silence, he shall pay back all of them together in wrath. Hence it is necessary to fear the Judge now, while he does not yet execute judgment, while he bears patiently for long, while he still tolerates the wickedness that he sees, lest when he has once stretched out his hand in the awarding of vengeance, he strikes the more severely in judgment in proportion as he waited longer before judgment.
