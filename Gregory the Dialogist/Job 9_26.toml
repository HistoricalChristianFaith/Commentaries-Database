47.  They that traverse seas transporting fruits, do themselves indeed enjoy the smell of the same, but the food thereof they convey to others.  What else then did the ancient Fathers show themselves, saving ships carrying fruits?  They indeed in foretelling the mystery of God's Incarnation, themselves enjoyed the sweet odour of hope, but to ourselves they brought down the fruit by the completion of that hope.  For what they but smelled at in expecting, we are replenished with in seeing and receiving.  And hence That same Redeemer saith to His disciples, Other men laboured, and ye are entered into their labours. [John 4, 38]  And their days are likened to ships, because they pass by on their way, and very properly to those bearing fruits, for all the Elect severally, whom they carried before the Redeemer's coming, through the Spirit of prophecy, they were enabled to refresh with the expectation, but not to feed with the manifest appearing.  Or, surely, whereas when ships carry fruits, they mix chaff with them, in order that they may transport them to land without injury, the days of the Fathers of yore are rightly described as like to ships bearing fruits, for in that the sayings of the Ancients tell of the mysteries of the spiritual life, they preserve these by means of the intermingled chaff of the history, and they bring down to us the fruit of the Spirit under a covering, when they speak to us carnal things.  For often whilst they relate circumstances proper to themselves, they are exalted to the secrets of the Divine Nature.  And often while they gaze at the loftiness of the Divine Nature, ‘they are suddenly plunged into the mystery of the Incarnation.  Hence it is still further added with fitness,
As the eagle that hasteth to the prey.
48.  For it is of the habits of the eagle to gaze at the sun's rays with unrecoiling eye; but when it is pressed by need of sustenance, it turns the same pupil of the eye, which it had fixed on the rays of the sun, to the ken of the carcase, and though it flies high in air, it seeks the earth for the purpose of getting flesh.  Thus, surely, thus was it with the old fathers, who as far as the frailty of human nature permitted it, contemplated the sight of the Creator with uplifted soul, but foreseeing Him destined to become incarnate at the end of the world, they as it were turned away their eyes to the ground from gazing at the rays of the sun; and they as it were descend from highest to lowest, whilst they see Him to be God above all things, and Man among all things; and whilst they behold Him, Who was to suffer and to die for mankind, by which same Death they know that they are themselves restored and fashioned anew to life, as it were like the eagle, after gazing at the rays of the sun, they seek their food upon the dead Body.  It is good to view the Eagle gazing at the rays of the Sun, which saith, The mighty God, The Everlasting Father, the Prince of Peace. [Is. 9, 6]  But let him come down from the high flight of his lofty range to earth, and seek below the food of the carcase.  For he adds a little while after, saying, The chastisement of our peace was upon Him, and with His stripes we are healed. [Is. 53, 5]  And again, And He is man, and who shall know Him? [Jer. 17, 9. LXX]  Thus the mind of the righteous man being lifted up to the Divine Nature, when it sees the grace of the Economy in His Flesh, as it were ‘hasteth’ suddenly from on high like an ‘eagle to the prey.’  ‘But mark; that Israelitish People, which was for long watered with the Spirit of prophecy above measure, lost those same gifts of prophecy, and never continued in that faith, which in foreseeing it had proclaimed, and, by disowning, put away from itself that Presence of the Redeemer, which, by foretelling, it clearly delivered to all its followers.  Hence, immediately, his speech is suitably made to turn, in sympathy, to their obduracy, and it is shown how the Spirit of prophecy is taken away from them.
