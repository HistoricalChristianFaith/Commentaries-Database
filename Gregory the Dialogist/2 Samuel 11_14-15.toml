Well-pleasing in almost all of his actions in the judgment of him who had chosen him, so soon as the burden of his obligations was not upon him, he broke out into festering conceit and showed himself as harsh and cruel in the murder of a man as he had been weakly dissolute in his desire for a woman. And he who had known how in pity to spare the wicked learned afterwards without let or hesitation to pant for the death of even the good. At first he had, indeed, been unwilling to strike down his captive persecutor, but afterwards, with loss to his wearied army, he killed even his loyal soldier. His guilt would, in fact, have removed him a long way from the number of the elect, had not scourgings restored him to pardon.
