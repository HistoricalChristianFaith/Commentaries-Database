It was the custom of the ancients that the elders should sit together in the gates and judge the cases of those entering in, so that the people of the city might be more peaceful. Now we in revering the sacred history hold it certain that this blessed Job did everything for the sake of the observance of just dealing. We are led further to investigate the mystery of the allegory.
What then is denoted by “the gate of the city”? It refers to every good action by which the soul enters into the company of the heavenly kingdom. Hence the prophet says, “You, who lifted me up from the gates of death, that I may declare all your praises in the gates of the daughter of Zion.” For “the gates of death” are bad actions that drag to destruction. But because Zion is the word for a viewing, “the gates of Zion” we interpret as good actions by which we enter into the country above, that we may view the glory of our King. - "Morals on the Book of Job 19.25"

25.  It was the custom of the ancients, that the elders should sit together in the gates, and judge the cases of those entering in, that so the people of the city might be the more peaceful, in proportion as it was not allowed to those at variance to enter in.  Now we in revering the sacred history hold it certain that all this blessed Job did for the sake of the observance of just dealing, and we are led to the investigating the mysteries of the allegory.  What then is denoted by ‘the gate of the city’ saving every good action, by which the soul enters in to the company of the heavenly Kingdom?  Hence the Prophet saith; Thou, that liftest me up from the gates of death, that I may declare all Thy praises in the gates of the daughter of Sion. [Ps. 9, 13. 14.]  For ‘the gates of death’ are bad actions, which drag to destruction; but because ‘Sion’ is the word for ‘a viewing,’ ‘the gates of Sion ‘we interpret good actions, by which we enter into the Country Above, that we may view the glory of our King.  But what is denoted by the seat but the authority of mastership.  Now ‘a street’ in the Greek tongue is equivalent to ‘breadth.’  And so now Holy Church goes forth to the gate of the city, because that she may obtain access to the heavenly country, she puts herself out in holy actions.  For whom there is ‘a seat prepared in the street,’ because in the breadth of high authority she displays the freedom of her mastership.  For she that proclaims with public announcement the right things she has a perception of as it were ‘sits in the street on the seat,’ in that she fears no one for her preaching, and oppressed by alarms for no man buries herself under silence. Does not she in public sit in command to teach, whom at one and the same time truth in perceiving and power in teaching bear up?  But whilst he ‘went forth to the gate, and sat in the street on the seat,’ what was done by the light-minded, what by the grave.
