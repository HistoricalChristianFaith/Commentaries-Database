But even if both are practiced, it remains that whoever he is should reach toward the heavenly homeland by hope, and should not restrain himself from vices merely for the sake of this world's respectability. For even if he sometimes begins certain good things for the sake of respectability, he ought not to remain in that intention, nor seek the glory of the present world through good works, but should place all his hope in the coming of his Redeemer. Hence it is immediately added: "And be like men waiting for their lord, when he returns from the wedding." For the Lord went to the wedding because, rising from the dead and ascending into heaven, the new man joined to himself the heavenly multitude of angels. He returns when he is manifested to us through judgment.
