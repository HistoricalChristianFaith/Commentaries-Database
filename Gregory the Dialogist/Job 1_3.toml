But because this store of antecedent virtues is followed by a manifold concern for good works, it is rightly added,
His substance also was seven thousand sheep and three thousand camels.
39.  For, saving the historical truth, we are at liberty to follow in a spiritual way that which our ears receive in a carnal shape.  Thus we possess seven thousand sheep, when we feed the innocent thoughts within our breast, in a perfect purity of heart, with the food of truth which we have sought after.
40.  And we shall have three thousand camels likewise in our possession, if all that is high and crooked in us be subdued to the order [rationi] of faith, and when of our own free will, and in our longing after humility, it is made to bow down itself under a knowledge of the Trinity.  For we possess camels, whensoever we put down in humility all the high notions that we entertain.  Surely we are in possession of camels, when we bend our thoughts to sympathy with a brother's weakness, that bearing our burthens by turns, we may by lowering ourselves thereto know how to compassionate the weakness of another man.  By camels, too, which do not cleave the hoof, but chew the cud, may be understood the good stewardships of earthly things, which, in that they have something of the world, and something of God, must needs be represented by a common animal.  For though earthly stewardship may be subservient to our eternal welfare, yet we cannot acquit ourselves of it without inward disquietude.  Therefore because both at the present time the mind is disturbed thereby, and also a reward laid up for ever, like a common animal, it both has something of the Law, and something it has not.  For it does not cleave the hoof, in that the soul does not wholly sever itself from all earthly doings, but yet it ruminates, in that by the right dispensation of temporal things, it gains a hope of heavenly blessings with an assured confidence.  Thus earthly stewardships agree with the law in the head, disagree therewith in the foot; forasmuch as while the objects which they desire to obtain by living righteously are of heaven, the concerns with which they are busied by their performances are of this world.  When then we submit these earthly stewardships to the knowledge of the Trinity, we have camels in possession, as it were, by faith.  The account goes on;
And five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she asses.
41.  There are yokes of oxen for us in our possession, when the virtues in harmony plough up the hardness of our mind.  We also possess five hundred she asses, when we restrain wanton inclinations, and when whatever of a carnal nature seeks to rise up in us, we curb in the spiritual mastery of the heart.  Or indeed to possess she asses is to govern the simple thoughts within us, which, while they have no power to run in a more refined intelligence, by how much more lowly they walk, bear with so much the more meekness their brother's burthens.  For there are some who not understanding deep things constrain themselves the more humbly to the outward works of duty.  Well then do we understand the simple thoughts by she asses, which are an animal slow indeed, yet devoted to carrying burthens, in that very often when made acquainted with our own ignorance, we bear the more lightly the burthens of others; and whereas we are not elevated as by any special height of wisdom, our mind bends itself in patience to submit to the dulness of another's soul.  Now it is well done, whether it be the yokes of oxen or the she asses, that they are mentioned as five hundred, in that, whether in the case that through prudence we are wise, or in the case that we remain in humble ignorance, so long as we are in search of the rest of eternal peace, we are as it were kept within the number of the Jubilee.  It goes on;
And a very great household,
42.  We possess a very great household, when we restrain our host of thoughts under the mastery of the mind, that they may not by their very number get the better of the soul, nor in disordered array tread under the authority which belongs to our faculty of discernment.  And the multitude of our thoughts is well marked out by the designation of a very great household.  For we know that when the mistress is away the tongues of the handmaids wax clamorous, that they cease from silence, neglect the duties of their allotted task, and disarrange the whole ordered method of their life.  But if the mistress suddenly appear, in a moment their noisy tongues are still, they renew the duties of their several tasks, and return to their own work as though they had never left it.  Thus if reason for a moment leave the house of the mind, as if the mistress were absent, the den of our thoughts redoubles itself, like a bevy of talkative maids.  But so soon as reason has returned to the mind, the confused tumult quiets itself at once, and the maids as it were betake themselves in silence to the task enjoined, whilst the thoughts forthwith submit themselves to their appropriate occasions for usefulness.  We possess, then, a great household, when with righteous authority we rule our innumerable thoughts by a discerning use of reason; and assuredly when we do this wisely, we are aiming to unite ourselves to the Angels by that very exercise of discernment: and hence it is rightly subjoined;
So that this man was the greatest of all the men of the east.
43.  For we are then rendered great amongst all them of the east, when the cloud of carnal corruption being kept down by the rays of our discernment, we are, as far as the possibility of the thing admits, made the associates of those Spirits, which abide in the eastern light: and hence Paul says, Our conversation is in heaven [Phil. 3, 20].  For he that follows after temporal things, which are subject to decay, seeks the west [occasum], but whoso fixes his desires upon things above, proves that he dwells in the east.  He then is great not among them of the west but among them of the east, who aims to excel not amid wicked men's scenes of action, who seek low and fleeting things, but amongst the choirs of the citizens above.

21. That believing hearers have been gathered from various manners of 1ife, a truth which is first declared generally by the mention of the daughters, the same is afterwards brought before us in detail by the specification of the animals.  For what does he set forth in the seven thousand sheep, but some men's perfect innocency, which comes from the pastures of the Law to the perfect estate of grace?  what again is signified by the three thousand camels, but the crooked defectiveness of the Gentiles coming to the fulness of faith.  Now in Holy Scripture, sometimes the Lord Himself is expressed by the title of a camel, and sometimes the Gentile people.  For the Lord is signified by the name of a camel, as when it is said by that very Lord to the Jews that set themselves against Him, who strain at a gnat, and swallow a camel. [Mat. 23, 24]  For a gnat wounds while it whispers, but a camel of free will bends to receive its load.  Thus the Jews strained at a gnat, in that they sought that a seditious robber should be let go, but they swallowed a camel, in that Him, Who had come down of His own accord to take upon Him the burthens of our mortal nature, they strove to overwhelm by their clamours.  Again, the Gentile state is signified by the naming of a camel; and hence Rebecca on going to Isaac is brought on a camel's back, in that the Church, which hastens from the Gentile state to Christ, is found in the crooked and defective behaviour of the old life; and she, when she saw Isaac, descended, in that when the Gentile world knew the Lord, it abandoned its sins, and descending from the height of self-elation sought the lowly walks of humility; and she too in bashfulness covers herself with a veil, in that she is confounded in His presence for her past life.  And hence it is said by the Apostle to these same Gentiles, What fruit had ye then in those things whereof ye are now ashamed? [Rom. 6, 21]  Whereas then by the sheep we understand the Hebrews coming to the faith from the pastures of the Law, nothing hinders but that we understand by the camels the Gentile people, crooked in their ways and laden with idolatrous ceremonials.  For because they devised them gods of their own selves whom they should worship, there had grown up as it were out of themselves a load upon their back which they should carry. 
22.  Furthermore in that they are common animals, it is possible that by camels is represented the life of the Samaritans.  For camels chew the cud, but do not divide the hoof.  So likewise the Samaritans do as it were chew the cud, in that they receive in part the words of the Law, but do not divide the hoof as it were, forasmuch as they despise it in part.  And they bear a grievous burthen upon the mind's pack, in that they weary themselves in whatsoever they do without any hope of eternity.  For they are strangers to faith in the Resurrection, and what can be more grievous or more burthensome than to endure the tribulation of this passing state of existence, and yet never, for relief of mind, to look forward to the joy of our reward; but forasmuch as the Lord, when He appeared in the flesh, both filled the Hebrew people with the grace of perfection, and brought some of the Samaritans to the knowledge of the faith by shewing marvellous works, it might well be said of the shadow which was to express the reality, that he possessed both seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels.  It goes on;
And five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she asses.
23.  We have said above that by the number fifty, which is completed by seven weeks and the addition of an unit, rest is signified, and by the number ‘ten’ the sum of perfection is set forth.  Now forasmuch as the perfection of rest is promised to the faithful, by multiplying fifty ten times,  we in this, way arrive at five hundred.  But in sacred Writ, the title of ‘oxen’ sometimes represents the dulness of the foolish sort, and sometimes the life of well doers.  For because the stupidity of the fool is represented by the title of an ox, Solomon says rightly, he goeth after her straightway, as an ox goeth to the slaughter. [Prov. 7, 22]  Again, that the life of every labourer is forth by the title of oxen, the Precepts of the Law are a testimony, which enjoined through Moses; Thou shalt not muzzle the ox when he treadeth out the corn. [Deut. 25, 4]  And this again is declared in plain words; the labourer is worthy of his hire.  [Luke 10, 7]  By the title of asses, too, we have represented sometimes the inertness of fools, sometimes the unrestrained indulgence of the wanton, sometimes the simplemindedness of the Gentiles; for the inertness of fools is imaged by the designation of asses, as where it is said through Moses, Thou shalt not plough with an ox and an ass together. [Deut. 22, 10]  As though he said, ‘do not associate fools and wise men together in preaching, lest by means of him who has no power to accomplish the work, you hinder him who has abundant power.’  The unrestrained indulgence of the wanton is likewise set forth by the appellation of asses, as the prophet testifies, where he says, whose flesh is as the flesh if asses. [Ezek. 23, 20]  Again, by the title of asses is shewn the simplicity of the Gentiles.  Hence when the Lord went up toward Jerusalem, He is related to have sat upon a young ass, for what is it for Him to come to Jerusalem sitting upon an ass, except taking possession of the simple hearts of the Gentiles to conduct them to the vision of peace, by ruling and ordering them?  And this is shewn by one passage, and that a very easy one; in that both the workmen of Judaea are represented by oxen, and the Gentile peoples by an ass, when it is said by the Prophet, The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master's crib. [Isa. 1, 3]  For who appears as the ox, saving the Jewish people, whose neck was worn by the yoke of the Law?  and who was the ass but the Gentile world, which was found like a brute animal of every deceiver, and was overlaid with whatever deceit he pleased, without resisting by any exercise of reason?  Thus the ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master's crib, in that both the Hebrews found out the God Whom they worshipped but as yet knew Him not, and the Gentile world received the food of the Law, which it had none of.  That therefore which is spoken above in the designation of the sheep and of the camels, is here repeated below in the oxen and the asses.
24.  Now even before the coming of the Redeemer Judaea possessed oxen, in that she sent out labourers to preach, to whom it is said by the voice of Truth, Woe unto you, Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye compass sea and land to make one proselyte; and when he is made, ye make him twofold more the child of hell than yourselves. [Mat. 23, 15]  These were weighed down with the heavy yoke of the Law, because they were burthened with the ordinances of the external letter, to whom it is spoken by the voice of Truth, Come unto Me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will refresh you.  Take My yoke upon you, and learn of Me, for I am meek and lowly in heart. [Mat. 11, 28. 29.]  That in the Gospel, therefore, rest is promised to those that labour well, is the same thing as that five hundred yoke of oxen are made mention of in this place; for whereunto does their way lead, who submit their necks to the dominion of our Redeemer, excepting to rest?  And hence we are told of five hundred she asses, forasmuch as the Gentile folk that are called, so long as they desire to attain to rest, gladly bear all the burthens of the commandments; and hence, that this rest should be sought of the Gentiles, Jacob in addressing his sons did mean to signify by the voice of prophecy, saying, Issachar is a strong ass, crouching down between the boundaries [Vulg. Terminus, E.V. burthens]: And he saw that rest was good, and the land that it was pleasant, and bowed the shoulder to bear. [Gen. 49, 14. 15.]  For to crouch down between the boundaries is to rest forestalling the end of the world, and to seek nought of those things, which are now going forward amongst men, but to long after the things that shall be at the last; and the strong ass sees the rest and the pleasant land, when the simple Gentile world lifts itself up to the strong effort of good works, and that because it is on its way to the land of life eternal; and it bows the shoulder to bear, in that having beheld the rest above, it submits itself in doing its work even to severe precepts, and whatever littleness of mind represents as hard to bear, the hope of the reward makes this appear to it light and easy.  So because both Judaea and the Gentile world are gathered to eternal rest as a portion of the elect, he is rightly related to have possessed five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she asses.  The account goes on;
And a very great household.
25.  What means it that the number of the animals is first described, while the household is not mentioned till the end, but that the foolish things of the world are first gathered in to the knowledge of the faith, that afterwards the crafty things of the world may also be called?  as Paul bears witness, who says; For ye see your calling, brethren, how that not many wise men after the flesh, not many noble, not many mighty are called; But God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise. [1 Cor. 1, 26. 27.]  For the first beginnings [principia] of holy Church are reputed to have been without knowledge of letters, plainly for this reason, that in His preachers the Redeemer might manifest to all, that it was not their discourse, but their cause, which had influence with the numbers [populos] that believed unto life.  It proceeds;
So that this man was the greatest of all the men if the East.
26.  That our Redeemer is styled The East is declared by the testimony of the Prophet, where he says, And lo! the Man whose name is The East. [Zech. 6, 12  Vulg. Orients, E.V. the Branch]  And thus all that live in this Orient by faith, are rightly called men of the East.  Now because all men are only men, whereas ‘The East’ Himself is both God and Man, it is rightly said, He was the greatest of all the men of the East.  As though it were said in plain words, He surpassed all those that are born to God in faith.  Because it is not by adoption, as others are, but by the Divine Nature that He is exalted, Who though He appeared like to others in His human Nature, yet in His Divine Nature continued above all men without fellow.

5. We know that the greater the loss, the greater the grief with which it affects the mind; to shew then how great was his virtue, we are told that it was very much, that he lost with patience; for never without pain do we part with aught, saving that which we hold without fondness; therefore while the greatness of his substance is described, yet soon after he is reported as resigned to the loss of it; thus parting with it without regret, it is plain that he had kept it without regard.  It is also to be noted that in the first instance the riches of his heart are described, and afterwards the wealth of the body; for an abundant store is wont to make the mind so much the more slack to the fear of God, as it obliges it to be occupied with a diversity of cares; for inasmuch as it is dissipated by a multitude of objects, it is prevented standing fast in that which is within.  Which was pointed out by Truth Itself in setting forth the Parable of the sower; He also that received seed among the thorns, is he that heareth the word, and the care of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, choke the word, and he becometh unfruitful. [Matt. 13, 22]  See how the blessed Job is both said to have great possessions, and a little after is related to be devoutly assiduous in the divine sacrifices. 
 
7.  Let us then consider how great was the holiness of that man who though thus busied disengaged himself for such assiduous attendance upon God.  Nor had the power of that precept as yet shone out, which bids us leave all things; yet blessed Job already kept the intent of it in his heart, in that he surely had left his substance in intention, which he kept without taking delight in it. 
 
8.  So that this man was the greatest of all the men of the East.  [Job 1, 3]  Who does not know that the men of the East are very wealthy, accordingly ‘he was the greatest of all the men of the East;’ as though it were expressly said that he was even richer than the rich.
