Ver. 22. He believeth not that he shall return out of darkness, and he is waited for of the sword.

For because he believes himself to be on all sides stricken from ambush, despairing of salvation, he is ever growing on in wickedness. Now there are times too when this ungodly man turns his eyes to judgments from above as well, and dreads their coming upon him. But whilst he seeks the wages of the present life, these same judgments which he had begun to fear, being conquered by the madness of avarice, he sets at nought. And he thinks indeed that it is possible he may die in sin, but yet he does not cease from sin.
