37.  God doth not ‘stand in need of a lie,’ in that Truth does not seek to be stayed up by the aid of falsehood.  But because Heretics are unable to defend on principles of truth the things which they erroneously conceive about God, it is as if they sought for the shadow of falsehood, to show the ray of light.  And they ‘speak deceitfully for Him,’ in that weak minds, by being senselessly seduced, they deceive in the understanding of Him.
