12. Aminadab is interpreted as "urbane." Rightly therefore, by the Lord's deliberate counsel, he is rejected: because the holy church does not choose for the governance of souls one who is vigorous in secular affairs, but one who is distinguished in spiritual conduct. Indeed, those are urbane who, having set aside their focus on heavenly things, strive to show themselves vigorous in outward pursuits. Therefore the Lord did not choose this one either, because by the zeal of a faithful pastor, heavenly things, not earthly ones, ought to be provided for the flocks of the faithful — not weak and fleeting things, but sublime and eternal ones. (Verse 9.) Then he brought forward Shammah, about whom he also said: "The Lord has not chosen this one either."
