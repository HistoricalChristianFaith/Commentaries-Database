In this matter it should be noted how much is heaped upon the burning rich man for his punishment. For both knowledge and memory are preserved for him unto his punishment. For he recognizes Lazarus whom he despised, and he also remembers his brothers whom he left behind. For his vengeance from the poor man would not be complete if he did not recognize him in retribution. And the punishment in fire would not be complete if he did not fear for his own what he himself suffers.

Therefore, that sinners may be punished more in their torment, they both see the glory of those whom they despised, and are also tortured by the punishment of those whom they loved unprofitably. Indeed it is to be believed that before the retribution of the last judgment the unjust see certain just ones in rest, so that seeing them in joy they may be tortured not only by their own punishment but also by the good of those others. But the just always behold the unjust in torments, so that their joy may increase from this, because they see the evil which they mercifully escaped; and they give so much greater thanks to their deliverer, as they see in others what they themselves could have suffered if they had been abandoned.

Nor does the observed punishment of the reprobate darken that brightness of such great blessedness in the minds of the just, because where there will no longer be compassion for misery, it will without doubt be unable to diminish the joy of the blessed. But what wonder if, while the just behold the torments of the unjust, this comes to them as a service to their joys, when even in a painting black color is placed beneath so that white or red may appear brighter? For as was said, the joys of the good increase so much more as the evils of the damned which they escaped lie beneath their eyes. And although their own joys suffice them fully for enjoyment, yet they without doubt always behold the evils of the reprobate, because those who see the brightness of their Creator, nothing is done in creation that they cannot see.
