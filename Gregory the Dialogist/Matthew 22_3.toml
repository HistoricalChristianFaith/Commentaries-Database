Therefore he sent his servants to invite friends to this wedding. He sent once, he sent again, because he made the preachers of the Lord's incarnation first prophets, and afterward apostles. Thus he sent servants twice to invite, because he both declared the incarnation of the Only-begotten as future through the prophets, and announced it as accomplished through the apostles. But since those who were first invited were unwilling to come to the wedding banquet, in the second invitation it is now said: "Behold, I have prepared my dinner, my bulls and fatted calves are slain, and all things are ready."
