I tell you that thus there will be joy in heaven over one sinner doing penance, more than over ninety-nine just who have no need of penance. We must consider, my brothers, why the Lord declares there is more joy in heaven over converted sinners than over the just who stand firm, unless it is what we ourselves know through daily experience of observation: that very often those who know themselves weighed down by no burden of sins do indeed stand in the way of justice, commit no unlawful acts, yet do not anxiously long for the heavenly homeland, and grant themselves as much use of lawful things as they remember having committed no unlawful ones. And very often they remain sluggish in practicing the highest goods, because they are quite secure in themselves that they have committed no graver evils. But on the contrary, sometimes those who remember having done certain unlawful things, pierced with compunction by their very grief, burn ardently with love of God, and exercise themselves in great virtues, seek out all the difficulties of holy struggle, abandon all worldly things, flee honors, rejoice when insults are received, burn with desire, long for the heavenly homeland; and because they consider that they have strayed from God, they compensate for preceding losses with subsequent gains. Therefore there is greater joy in heaven over a converted sinner than over a just person standing firm, because a commander in battle also loves more that soldier who, returning after flight, vigorously presses the enemy, than the one who never showed his back, and never performed any deed of valor. So too the farmer loves more that land which after thorns brings forth abundant crops, than that which never had thorns and never produces a fertile harvest.

But amid these things it must be known that there are many righteous persons in whose life there is such joy that no repentance of sinners can in any way be preferred to them. For many are conscious of no evils in themselves, and yet they exert themselves in such ardent affliction as if they were constrained by all sins. They reject even all lawful things, they gird themselves nobly for contempt of the world, they refuse to allow themselves anything whatsoever, they cut off from themselves even permitted goods, they despise visible things, they are inflamed by invisible things, they rejoice in lamentations, they humble themselves in all things; and just as some bewail sins of deeds, so these bewail sins of thoughts. What then shall I call these, except both righteous and penitent, who humble themselves in repentance for sins of thought, and always persevere upright in deed? From this therefore it must be gathered how great a joy the righteous person makes for God when he humbly mourns, if the unrighteous person makes joy in heaven when he condemns through repentance what he has done wickedly.
