Concerning this again he says, "Ascending on high, He led captivity captive, He gave gifts to men." For ascending on high, He led captivity captive, because He absorbed our corruption by the power of His incorruption. And He gave gifts to men, because, sending the Spirit from above, to one He granted the word of wisdom, to another the word of knowledge, to another the grace of powers, to another the grace of healings, to another kinds of tongues, to another the interpretation of speeches. Therefore He gave gifts to men.
