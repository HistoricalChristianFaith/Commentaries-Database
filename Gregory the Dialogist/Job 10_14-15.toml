Therefore let the holy person take note of the wretchedness of the human mind, how often it defiles itself with unhallowed thoughts. After the Judge’s remission of the guilt of our actions, even while Job bewails his own case, let him show to us our sin, for us to bewail, “If I have sinned, and you spare me at the hour, why do you not allow me to be clean from my iniquity?” It is as if Job said in plain words, “If your forgiveness has taken away my sin, why does it not sweep it from my memory also?” Often the mind is so shaken from its center at the recollection of sin that it is prompted to the commission of far worse things than it had been before being subjected to the memory of prior sins. And when entangled the mind is filled with fears, and being driven with different impulses, throws itself into disorder. It dreads lest it should be overcome by temptations, and in resisting, it shudders at this very fact that it is harassed with the long toils of conflict. Hence it is fitly added, “If I am wicked, woe to me! If I am righteous, I cannot lift up my head, for I am filled with disgrace and look upon my affliction.” Certainly the wicked person has “woe” and the righteous person “affliction,” in that everlasting damnation follows the lost sinner and the pains of temporary affliction purify each of the elect. The wicked person lifts up his head, yet when so lifted up he cannot escape the woe that pursues him. The righteous person, faring ill with the toils of his conflict, is not allowed to lift up his head, but while hard pressed, he is freed from everlasting affliction. The one who sets himself up in pleasure is plunging himself to the earth in sorrow and hides himself from the weight of eternal visitation.
