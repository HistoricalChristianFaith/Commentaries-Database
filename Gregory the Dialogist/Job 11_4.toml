For Thou hast said, My speech is pure, and I am clean in Thine eyes.

Whoso remembers the words of blessed Job, knows how falsely this charge is fastened upon his voice. For how could he call himself pure, who says, If I justify myself, mine own mouth shall condemn me; but there is this in the wickedness of the unrighteous, that, while it refuses to bewail real evil things in itself it invents them in others, for it makes use of it as a solace of evil doing, if the life of the reprover can be also stained with false accusations. But we must know that for the most part the wicked wish what is good so far as the lips, in order that they may shew that that is bad which we have at present, and as if from the good will they bear others, they pray for favourable circumstances, in order that they may appear full of kindly affection.
