The sick are to be admonished to consider how great a gift bodily affliction is, which washes away sins that we have committed and restrains those which we might commit, and which inflicts on the troubled mind wounds of penitence derived from outward stripes. As Scripture says, “The blueness of a wound cleanses away evil, and stripes cleanse the secret parts of the belly.” The blueness of a wound cleanses away evil, that is, the pain of scourges cleanses iniquities, whether meditated or perpetrated.…When we are outwardly smitten, we are recalled, silent and afflicted, to remember our sins and bring back before our eyes all our past evil deeds. Through what we suffer outwardly we grieve more inwardly because of what we have done.
