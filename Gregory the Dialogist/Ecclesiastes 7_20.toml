Because the prophet says, “Behold, I was conceived in iniquity, and in sin did my mother bring me forth,” no one coming into the world with sin can be sinless. That is why the same prophet says, “No one living shall be considered righteous in your sight,” and Solomon, “There is no righteous man on earth, who does good, and does not sin.”
