20.  The title of the ‘ungodly’ is not without meaning given to heretics, who through the erroneousness of false doctrine are far removed from the knowledge of the truth; whom in the words following he calls ‘violent’ as well, as being persons who set themselves to wrest by violence to a wrong meaning the sentences of Holy Scripture containing right articles of doctrine.  And so they are ‘violent’ if not in the goods of men, at all events in the senses of precepts.  But the ‘sons of violent men’, are the follower’s of heretics, who while they consent to their error, are as It were engendered by their preaching.  But while being’ multiplied’ ‘they shall’ be in the sword,’ for though now they grow up in an immense multitude in a ruinous liberty, yet they are smitten by the sentence of the Judge to come, Whence the Lord saith by Moses, My sword shall devour flesh.  For ‘the sword of God devours flesh,’ because in the Final Judgment His sentence destroys those, who are carnally wise, On which point it is to be made out why it should be said that the wicked’ receive this portion’ and inheritance of theirs from the Almighty?  Yet to those taking a right view it is plain that though they had it from themselves to act unjustly, yet it comes before the Equity Above, what is unjustly done justly to judge; so that the sentence of God should orderly appoint for punishment those whom their ill-ordered conduct drew into sin, Concerning whom it is fitly subjoined; And his grandchildren shall not be satisfied with bread.
21.  For ‘the grandchildren’ of Heretics are they that are born by the preaching of children in error.  And these ‘bread fails to satisfy;’ because while in the provender of the sacred Word they seek to perceive more than they take in, they are ever a hungering to the knowledge of the truth; and the preachings of instruction, which they are busy to seek for questioning, they are incapable of having for refreshment.  But because from the number of these heretics some Holy Church gathers in, some she leaves obstinate in their wickedness.
