16. If therefore we apply all things in the manner in which they occur above in the ordaining of the king to the custom of the holy Church, her rulers are ordained with great subtlety. For first the king to be chosen was shown to the prophet, then he was sought as though unknown; afterward he was even found by lot, hidden at home, revealed by the Lord, raised up by the people, and received by all into royal dignity. What then is it that they still proceed to Gilgal, so that there the kingdom might be renewed? But with great discernment the king is sought and found, because the affairs of the Churches are most lofty, which if the weak and unskilled undertake, they are crushed by the very magnitude of the matters. Therefore with attention and most subtle investigation one is sought out who may be placed over so great an eminence. He who is truly to be greatly commended is not established by the judgment of those seeking, but when he is found vigorous in the very exercise of the highest ministry. Well therefore, with the king now triumphant and established, it is said: 'They went to Gilgal, and there they made Saul king before the Lord': because when the preacher's strength is recognized, he is honored in the minds of his hearers. Indeed we go to Gilgal, that is "the wheel," when through sacred eloquence we examine the work of our teacher, and there we make him king before the Lord: because him whom we perceive to be worthy of approval, we judge to be worthy of so great an eminence. Therefore Saul is said first to have been chosen by the people, and at last established as king in Gilgal before the Lord: because although a pastor may be chosen in the holy Church with much gravity of counsel, whether he is by merit what he is by rank is not known unless it is made manifest by the strength of his works. Let it therefore be said not of another, but of that one [perhaps "another" is superfluous] who shone forth with a great victory: 'All the people went to Gilgal, and there they made Saul king before the Lord', so that the dignity of the supreme pontiff may not consist in the ambition of high office, but in the summit of virtue. And indeed they go to Gilgal, so that he may not dare to judge from the highest place, to whom the hidden precepts of Sacred Scripture are unknown. And the king is established before the Lord: because then the teacher is honored by the devotion of his subjects, when they themselves acknowledge his acceptable life to the almighty Lord. Moreover, concerning this knowledge of the life and teaching of their pastor: because often one trusts not oneself but those who are better, it is well said that the people established a king in Gilgal before the Lord, but that the same people went to Gilgal at Samuel's urging. 'Let us go', he said, 'to Gilgal, and let us renew the kingdom there.' For the kingdom is renewed: because while the chosen preacher is seen in great virtue, the hearts of his hearers are submitted to him with new and fresh devotion. Whence, as though by the king's displayed victory the kingdom is renewed, when the great manner of life of the teacher becomes known, the very hearts of his subjects receive the splendor of a new devotion, and are stirred by his example to the pursuit of great virtue. But now, we who have beheld triumphs in one battle of inward struggles, let us now behold in another the times of peace run through with wondrous fairness.
