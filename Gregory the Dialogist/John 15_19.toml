For the disparaging of the perverse [toward us] is our praise. There is nothing wrong in not pleasing those who do not please God. For no one can by one and the same act please God and the enemies of God. He proves himself no friend to God who pleases his enemy. And he whose soul is in subjection to the Truth will have to contend with the enemies of that Truth.
