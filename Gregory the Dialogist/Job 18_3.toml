3.  It is natural to the human mind to suppose that the thing that it does is done to itself.  Thus they believe themselves to be despised, who are used to despise the ways of the good; and whereas in such things as are capable of being understood by reason, the Church proves against heretics that what they make up is unreasonable, they imagine themselves to be counted as ‘beasts’ in her view.  On which supposition of their being despised, they directly break out in disdain, and are urged to abuse of that Church.
