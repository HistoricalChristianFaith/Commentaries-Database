You have heard, dearest brothers, that at the voice of a single command, Peter and Andrew, leaving their nets, followed the Redeemer. They had seen him perform no miracles yet, they had heard nothing from him about the reward of eternal recompense; and yet at one command of the Lord they forgot what they seemed to possess. How many of his miracles do we see, with how many scourges are we afflicted, by how many harsh threats are we deterred, and yet we disdain to follow him when he calls? He who admonishes us about conversion already sits in heaven; he has already subjected the necks of the nations to the yoke of faith, he has already laid low the glory of the world, he already announces, as its ruins multiply, that the day of his strict judgment draws near; and yet our proud mind does not wish to abandon willingly what it loses daily against its will. What then, dearest ones, what shall we say at his judgment, we who are neither bent by commands nor corrected by blows from the love of the present age?

But perhaps someone may say to himself in silent thoughts: At the Lord's voice, what or how much did each of these fishermen leave behind, who had almost nothing? But in this matter, dearest brothers, we ought to weigh the affection rather than the wealth. He left much who retained nothing for himself; he left much who, however little it was, abandoned everything. Certainly we both possess what we have with love, and seek from desire those things we do not have at all. Therefore Peter and Andrew left much, since each also abandoned the desires of having. He left much who renounced his longings along with the thing he possessed. Therefore those who followed gave up as much as could be desired by those who did not follow. Let no one therefore, even when he sees that certain people have left many things behind, say to himself: I want to imitate these despisers of the world, but I have nothing to leave behind. You leave many things, brothers, if you renounce earthly desires. For our external possessions, however small, are sufficient for the Lord. For he weighs the heart, not the substance; nor does he consider how much is offered in his sacrifice, but from how much it is brought forth. For if we weigh external substance, behold, our holy merchants purchased the perpetual life of angels by giving up their nets and boat. Indeed it has no estimation of price, yet the kingdom of God is worth as much as you have. For it was worth half his substance to Zacchaeus, because he reserved the other half to restore fourfold what he had unjustly taken. It was worth the abandoned nets and boat to Peter and Andrew; it was worth two small coins to the widow; it was worth a cup of cold water to another. The kingdom of God, therefore, as we said, is worth as much as you have.
