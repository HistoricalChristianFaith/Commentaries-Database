"And its vestibule looked toward the outer court, and carved palm trees on its front on this side and on that, and its ascent was by eight steps." Behold, the ancient and new Fathers agree with one another in one spirit concerning the resurrection of the flesh. Behold, Truth itself first taught by word what it afterward demonstrated by deed concerning the resurrection of the flesh, and yet still the weakness of some does not have faith while standing in the house of faith. But they are accustomed to wonder how flesh can come back to life from dust. Let them wonder, therefore, at the height of heaven, the mass of the earth, the depths of the waters, all things that are in the world, and the angels themselves created from nothing. It is far less to make something from something than to have made all things from nothing. The elements themselves, the very forms of things, proclaim to us an image of the resurrection. For the sun dies daily to our eyes, and daily rises again. The stars set for us in the morning hours, and rise again in the evening. We see trees full of leaves, flowers, and fruits in summer times, which in winter time remain bare of leaves, flowers, and fruits, and as if dried up, but when the spring sun returns, when moisture has risen from the root, they are clothed again in their beauty. Why then is there distrust concerning human beings, when what is seen to happen in trees is observed? But often they look upon the dust of rotting flesh and say: Whence will bones and marrow, whence will flesh or hair be able to be restored in the resurrection? Therefore, let those who ask such things look at the small seeds of immense trees, and if they can, let them say: Where in them lies hidden such a mass of strength, such diversity of branches, such multitude and greenness of leaves, such beauty of flowers, such abundance, flavor, and fragrance of fruits? Do the seeds of trees have the fragrance or flavor which the trees themselves afterward bring forth in their fruits? If therefore from the seed of trees what cannot be seen can be produced, why is there distrust concerning the dust of human flesh, that from it a form which is not seen can be restored?

But they are accustomed often to raise a vain little question, by which they say: A wolf ate the flesh of a man, a lion devoured the wolf, the lion dying returned to dust; when that dust is raised up, how is the flesh of the man separated from the flesh of the wolf and the lion? To these what else ought we to respond, except that they should first consider how they came into this world, and then they will discover how they rise again? Certainly you, O man, who say this, were once a foam of blood in your mother's womb; for there you were a small and liquid mass from your father's seed and your mother's blood. Tell me, I ask, if you know, how that moisture of seed hardened into bones, how it remained liquid in the marrow, how it was solidified into sinews, how it grew into flesh, how it was stretched out into skin, how it was distinguished into hair and nails, so that the hair would be softer than flesh, and the nails more tender than bones, harder than flesh? If therefore so many and such great things from one seed were distinguished into different forms, and yet remain joined in one shape, what wonder is it if Almighty God in that resurrection of the dead can distinguish the flesh of a man from the flesh of beasts, so that one and the same dust both does not rise again insofar as it is the dust of a wolf and lion, and yet does rise again insofar as it is the dust of a man? See therefore, O man, how you came to life, and do not at all doubt how you may return to life. But why do you wish to comprehend by reason how you return, you who do not know how you came? Grant to the power of your Creator what you cannot comprehend about yourself. For certainly because you were made from earth, and earth from nothing, you were created from nothing. Therefore, lest you despair about the resurrection of your flesh, consider prudently that it is less for God to restore what existed than to have made what did not exist.
