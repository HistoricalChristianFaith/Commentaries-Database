And because the true faithful were saddened by their striking down, there follows: "And the men of Beth-shemesh said: Who is able to stand in the sight of the Lord, this holy God?" For it is as though the true faithful, yet simple ones, were saying: If such wise men and philosophers are deceived in the knowledge of the highest truth, when can the unlearned and simple come to the knowledge of Him? But even if they lack confidence in their own measure, nevertheless they do not lack confidence that the gift of divine knowledge is present to the Church. Wherefore it is also added: "And to whom shall He go up from us?"

31. For the Lord ascends from us when that which is hidden from us concerning the knowledge of Him is preached through the voice of the chosen faithful. For His ascending from us is, as it were, to reveal to lofty hearts through humility what He has hidden from the simpler or weaker ones concerning eternal contemplation. What then does it mean to say, "To whom shall He ascend from us," except to seek a worthy teacher who so preaches divine things that he does not stray from the way of truth? In these words also, if we seek the historical sense, we clearly recognize that those who died because they looked upon the ark of the Lord were indeed not worthy of that vision. Rightly therefore, those who behold the stricken say: "Who shall be able to stand in the presence of this holy Lord God?" For if those who are unworthy die by seeing, how shall those who handle sacred things live? The Bethshemites in the holy Church are dead priests and reprobate ministers of the sacred altar, because they are of the house of the Sun of justice by the dignity of their ministry, not by the virtue and grace of holiness. They are indeed Bethshemites, because through the office of sacred oblation they dwell in the house of God; but they are to be struck with all the sharper condemnation inasmuch as they dare not only to look upon the sacred mysteries but to handle them, inasmuch as they no longer merely gaze upon the ark of the Old Testament, but—what surpasses all—they unworthily thrust themselves upon the body and blood of the Redeemer; that they are struck down Paul indicates, saying: "He who eats and drinks unworthily eats and drinks judgment to himself" (1 Cor. 11:29). For the truly faithful say: "Who shall be able to stand in the presence of this holy Lord God?" For they consider the loftiness of so great a ministry and tremble at the dignity of so great a sacrament. But while they fear to undertake the office of so great a thing, they seek worthier persons who may be able to perform it. Whence it also follows: "And to whom shall He ascend from us?" As if, therefore, humbly fleeing the sacred mysteries, they were to say: "Because we are struck down by our weak manner of life, ministers must be sought from a higher life, whom a lofty manner of living raises to the highest sanctification of virtues, so that they may stand before God through the office of so great an oblation."

2. Because we said above that the cart is Sacred Scripture, the ark is its spiritual knowledge, and the chosen cows are elect souls, the fear of the Bethshemites, which we showed to be present in the elect at the offering of the sacrament, can also be referred to the burden of prelacy. For no lesser holiness is fit for instructing souls than for offering the sacred mysteries. And therefore the Bethshemites are said to have been struck down: because many who live well as subjects die as prelates. For the ark of God also has an outward beauty, which if a weak minister looks upon not for spiritual veneration but for worldly desire, he by no means lives. Rightly therefore the cause of their being struck is declared when it is said: "Because they looked upon the ark of God." For what does "they looked" mean, except that by looking they coveted its glory? But now, by God's doing, the glory of holy Church is abundant throughout the whole world. Because this glory is sought in a worldly manner by reprobate priests, the men of Beth-shemesh die by looking upon the ark of God from the outside. For they do not seek its spiritual honor for the sake of the inward glory of virtues, but so that they might seize the splendor of God's ark and bear the radiance of ecclesiastical prelacy in the flower of the world for their own display. The ark of God is also looked upon wrongly from the outside, to one's destruction, when wicked leaders, overcome by the outward appearance of persons under their charge, are drawn into carnal desire. The men, beholding with fear the vast multitude laid low by the weapon of desire, say: "Who shall be able to stand in the sight of the Lord, this holy God?" For he stands in the sight of God who is strong in the order of divine ministry. Indeed, to stand is a matter of fortitude; to minister is a matter of service. He is therefore said to stand in the sight of God who arranges the order of heavenly office at the height of a worthy way of life; who in the ministry he performs is deceived by no appetite for ecclesiastical honor, and is overcome by no carnal desire. But because such fit ministers are rarely found, they rightly say: "Who shall be able to stand in the sight of the Lord, this holy God?" And because the little ones of Christ leave so great a burden to stronger men, they add: "And to whom shall it go up from us?" Now, how they sent to the inhabitants of Kiriath-jearim, how they brought the ark of God into the house of Abinadab, and how they sanctified Eleazar, we do not change from what was set forth above.
