How is it said in this place that the Lord makes the hypocrite to reign when through the prophet he complains especially about that, saying, “They have reigned but not of me: they have become princes, and I know them not”? For who that thinks rightly can say that the Lord does that of which he knows nothing? But because God’s knowledge is approval, his ignorance is disapproval.… In a marvelous manner then does God make hypocrites to reign and knows them not. He makes them by forbearance; by rejecting them he knows them not. Thus it is necessary, with reference to everything which is desired in this life, that the inner will should be first inquired into. And when the ear of the heart is anxious to catch its sound, let it know that it speaks not in words but in deeds. When then a post of authority is offered, it is necessary for a man first to question with himself whether his conduct is suited to the place, whether his doings are at variance with the distinction it confers, lest perhaps the just Ruler of all should afterward not regard his prayers in tribulation, because God “knows not” his very entering on that high office which is the source of all his tribulation.
