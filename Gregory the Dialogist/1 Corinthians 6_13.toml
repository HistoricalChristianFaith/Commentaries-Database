Wherefore, lest either gluttonous appetite throw the one sort off their guard, or the afflicted flesh trip up the other by elation, let the former hear this from the mouth of the Truth, "And take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be overcharged in surfeiting and drunkenness and cares of this world." And in the same place there is added a profitable fear; "And so that day come upon you unawares. For as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the face of the whole earth." Let the latter hear, "Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that which cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man." Let the former hear, "Meat for the belly, and the belly for meats; but God shall destroy both it and them." And again, "Not in rioting and drunkenness." And again, "Meat commendeth us not to God."
