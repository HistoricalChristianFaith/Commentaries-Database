But amid these things we must understand that zeal for righteousness should be exercised against the wicked deeds of our neighbors in such a way that the virtue of gentleness is by no means abandoned in the fervor of severity. For the anger of a priest ought never to be hasty and disturbed, but rather tempered with the gravity of deliberation. And so we ought both to bear with those whom we correct and to correct those whom we bear with, lest if one of these two be lacking, the priestly action fail either in fervor or in gentleness. For this is why in the service of the temple, lions and oxen and cherubim were carved by sculptural work on the bases of the temple. For cherubim signifies fullness of knowledge. But what does it mean that on the bases lions are not made without oxen, nor oxen without lions? For what else do the bases in the temple represent but priests in the Church? Who, while they bear the burden of governance, carry, as it were in the manner of bases, a weight placed upon them. Therefore cherubim are depicted on the bases, because it is certainly fitting that the hearts of priests be filled with fullness of knowledge. By lions, moreover, the terror of severity is symbolized, while by oxen the patience of gentleness is represented. And so on the bases neither lions without oxen nor oxen without lions are depicted, because in the priestly heart the virtue of gentleness must always be preserved along with the terror of severity, so that gentleness may season anger, and that same gentleness, lest it perhaps become lax, may be kindled by zeal for severity.
