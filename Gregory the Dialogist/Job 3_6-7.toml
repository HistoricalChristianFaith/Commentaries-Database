The year of our illumination will be accomplished at the appearing of the eternal Judge of the holy church when the life of its pilgrimage is completed. [The church] then receives the recompense of its labors when, having finished this season of warfare, [it] returns to its native country. Hence, the prophet says, “You shall bless the crown of the year with your goodness.” For the “crown of the year” is, as it were, “blessed” as the reward of virtues is bestowed when the season of toil comes to an end. But the days of this year are the several virtues, and its months the many deeds of those virtues. Moreover, note that when the mind is erected in confidence, it has a good hope that when the Judge comes it will receive the reward of the mind’s virtues. All the evil things [the church] has done are also remembered. It greatly fears lest the strict Judge, who comes to reward virtues, should also examine and weigh exactly those things that have been unlawfully committed. Thus, when “the year” is completed, the “night” is also reckoned.… There are some people that not only have no remorse for what they do but unceasingly uphold and applaud their actions. Truly, a sin that is upheld is doubled. One writer correctly condemns this attitude by saying, “My son, have you sinned? Don’t add on to what you have done.” For a person “adds sin to sin” who, over and above what he has done, justifies his error. He does not “leave the night alone” who also adds vindication’s support to the darkness of his fault. Thus, the first man Adam, when questioned concerning the night of his error, would not allow his “night” to remain alone. God’s questioning called Adam to repentance, but Adam responded by justifying himself, saying, “The woman whom you gave to be with me, she gave me fruit from the tree, and I did eat.” Adam covertly blames his Maker for the fault of Adam’s transgression. It was as if Adam said, “You provided me with an occasion for sin, because you gave me the woman.” Therefore, the branch of this sin remains manifest in the human race up to the present time. We continue to justify our misdeeds.
