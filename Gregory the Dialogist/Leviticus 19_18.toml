A person who does not divide with his needy neighbor what is necessary to him proves that he loves him less than himself. The command is to share two tunics with oneâ€™s neighbor: he could not have spoken of a single tunic, since if one is shared no one is clothed. Half a tunic leaves the person who receives it naked, as well as the person who gives it.
