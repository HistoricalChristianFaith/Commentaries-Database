Whether it be heretics, of whom we have said that the friends of blessed Job bore an image, or whether any of the evil ones, they are as much to blame in their admonitions as they are immoderate in their condemnation. For Eliphaz says, “Who ever perished being innocent? Or where were the righteous cut off?” Since it often happens that in this life both “the innocent perish” and the “righteous are” utterly “cut off,” yet in perishing they are kept for glory eternal. For if innocent people never perished, the prophet would not say, “The righteous perishes, and no man lays it to heart.” If God in his providential dealings did not carry off the righteous, Wisdom would never have said of the righteous person, “Yes, he was taken away quickly, to prevent wickedness from altering his understanding.” If no visitation ever struck the righteous, Peter would never foretell it, saying, “For the time has come that judgment must begin in the house of God.” They, then, are genuinely righteous who produce the love of the heavenly country to meet all the ills of the present life. For all who fear enduring ills in this life are clearly not righteous people. They have forgotten they suffer for the sake of eternal blessings. But Eliphaz does not take into account either that the righteous are cut off or that the innocent perish here. For people often serve God not in the hope of heavenly glory but for an earthly recompense. They make a fiction in their own head of that which they are seeking. Thinking themselves to be instructors in preaching earthly immunity, they show by all their pains what is the thing they love. - "Morals on the Book of Job 5.34"

34.  Whether it be heretics, of whom we have said that the friends of blessed Job bore an image, or whether any of the froward ones, they are as blameable in their admonitions, as they are immoderate in their condemnation.  For he says, Who ever perished being innocent? or where were the righteous cut off?   Since it often happens that in this life both ‘the innocent perish,’ and ‘the righteous are ‘utterly cut off,’ yet in perishing they are reserved to glory eternal.  For if none that is innocent perished, the Prophet would not say, The righteous perisheth, and no man layeth it to heart. [Is. 51, 1]  If God in His providential dealings did not carry off the righteous, Wisdom would never have said of the righteous man, Yea, speedily was he taken away, lest that wickedness should alter his understanding. [Wisd. 4, 11]  If no visitation ever smote the righteous, Peter would never foretell it, saying, For the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God. [1 Pet. 4, 17]  They then are really righteous, who are furnished forth by the love of the Country above to meet all the ills of the present life.  For all that fear to endure ills here, for the sake of eternal blessings, clearly are not righteous men.  But Eliphaz does not take account either that the righteous are cut off, or that the innocent perish here, in that oftentimes they that serve God, not in the hope of heavenly glory, but for an earthly recompense, make a fiction in their own head of that which they are seeking after, and, taking upon themselves to be instructors, in preaching earthly immunity, they shew by all their pains what is the thing they love.
