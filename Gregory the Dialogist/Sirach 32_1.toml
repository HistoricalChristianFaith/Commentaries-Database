Directors of souls should remain firm in that exterior attitude they assume in view of the good of others, while preserving in their heart that disposition that makes them fear nothing so much as a high estimation of themselves. Those under them, however, should be able to perceive, from certain indications of a sober spontaneity, that they are humble, and in this way see both what they must fear of their authority and what they must imitate of their humility. For this reason, the greater their power appears outwardly to others, the more superiors must not cease to ensure that they inwardly keep it under control. They cannot let it overcome their thoughts or let their hearts be carried away by its delights, lest the mind prove unable to control the very thing it submits itself to, due to a lust for domination. In fact, so that the heart of the superior not be carried away to the point of exaltation over pleasure in his power, a wise man rightly said, "They have made you a leader. Do not exalt yourself but be among them as one of them." For this reason Peter also says, "Not as masters over those assigned to you, but be an example to the flock." The Truth, therefore, inviting us to the highest merits of virtue, says, "Know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and those who are greater make their power felt. It shall not be this way among you, but the one who wants to be the greatest will be your servant, and the one who wants to be first among you will be your slave"like the Son of man, who did not come to be served but to serve." This is the meaning of the words referring to that servant who was exalted by the power he had received, but afterward punishments await him, "And if that wicked servant says in his heart, "My master is delayed in coming," and begins to beat his fellow servants, and to eat and drink with drunkards, then the master of that servant will come on a day that he does not expect and an hour he does not know, and he will cut him off, and his fate will be that of the hypocrites. And one is rightly considered a hypocrite who, under the pretext of discipline, turns the ministry of governance into an exercise of power. - "Pastoral Rule 2.6"
