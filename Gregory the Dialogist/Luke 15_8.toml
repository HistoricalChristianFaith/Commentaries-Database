There follows: "Or what woman having ten drachmas, if she loses one drachma, does she not light a lamp, and sweep the house, and search diligently until she finds the drachma she had lost?" He who is signified by the shepherd is also signified by the woman. For He Himself is God, He Himself is also the wisdom of God. And because an image is imprinted on a drachma, the woman lost a drachma when man, who had been created in the image of God, by sinning departed from the likeness of his Creator. But the woman lit a lamp, because the wisdom of God appeared in humanity. For a lamp is a light in an earthen vessel: and a light in an earthen vessel is divinity in flesh. Concerning which earthen vessel of His body, Wisdom Himself says: "My strength is dried up like a potsherd." For because a potsherd is hardened in fire, His strength dried up like a potsherd, because He strengthened the flesh He had assumed unto the glory of resurrection through the tribulation of His passion. And when the lamp was lit, she swept the house, because as soon as His divinity shone forth through the flesh, our whole conscience was shaken. For the house is swept when the human conscience is disturbed by consideration of its own guilt. This word "swept" does not disagree with what is read in other manuscripts as "cleansed," because indeed a wicked mind, unless it is first overturned through fear, is not cleansed of its accustomed vices. Therefore, with the house swept, the drachma is found, because when the conscience of man is disturbed, the likeness of the Creator is restored in man.
