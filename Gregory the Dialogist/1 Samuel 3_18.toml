25. He who considers this response of Eli more simply than he ought thinks that he responded as rightly as he did humbly. For as it is heard outwardly, what could he have responded more humbly, he who heard his own reprobation and offered to God who was threatening—indeed, promulgating the sentence of his reprobation—whatever He wished to do concerning him? But certainly if this humility of response is examined more carefully, it is not true humility. For that is recognized to be true humility which accompanies the good of obedience in carrying out the commands of a superior. He would therefore truly have been humble if he had offered himself for the amendment of the fault for which he was being rebuked. But perhaps he would have been even more truly humble if, when rebuked, he had not responded at all, but had applied to his wicked sons the correction he had neglected—if even then he had persisted with pastoral zeal and had punished the crimes of the flagitious priests with fitting vengeance. Therefore, when he says, "He is the Lord; let Him do what is good in His eyes," he is recognized to have uttered a word of his own choosing rather than a response of humility, because indeed he preferred to incur the causes of God's threats rather than condemn his sons for the iniquities they had committed. Oh, how many are still imitators of Eli, who, though they daily perceive from sacred Scripture that Almighty God threatens them, nevertheless tremble at displeasing men and do not fear to incur the threats of divine indignation, and while they dread the enmities of men as though they were implacable, they presume upon God's mercy even while sinning!

26. But disordered confidence can have a place of vengeance before almighty God, yet cannot obtain pardon. For to an uncorrected sinner, persisting in the purpose of his fault, what is it to say concerning God who threatens him, "It is the Lord; let Him do what is good in His eyes," except to trust in a disordered way in the most ordered mercy of God? For he trusts in an ordered way in the mercy of almighty God who corrects by repenting what he committed by sinning, and wipes it away by weeping. Therefore, to sin and to presume upon the clemency of God the Creator is to be exposed to the deep of His justice. Thus indeed, not to wipe away sins committed by repenting, and to presume upon God's mercy, is to stumble into the judgment of His severity. Therefore, while Eli's life is described as a pattern of reprobate preachers, not only is the fault of his fall shown, but also the false security in the headlong rush of fault. For he who could have appeased the greatness of divine indignation by the fear of repentance, while he neglected what he heard, incurred what he deserved.

27. For Almighty God, although He is just in equity, is nevertheless believed to be more abundantly compassionate in mercy. Whence it is also said through the Prophet: "His mercies are over all His works" (Psalm 144:9). Hence it is that through the prophet Jonah He brought forth threats of overthrow against the Ninevites, and yet spared the penitent from the punishment of destroying the city (Jonah 3:1, 2, ff.). Hence it is also that to King Hezekiah (IV Kings 20:1, ff.) the punishment of death was promised through the oracle of the prophet (Isaiah 38:1, ff.), but because the king, fearing death, afflicted himself before the Lord with tears of repentance, he did not find the death by which he was to die with Him whom he feared. And above indeed the Lord declared that He had spoken so that the house of Eli and of his father should minister in His sight forever, but He who had spoken good things concerning one who acted well changed His sentence concerning the house now become reprobate, saying: "But now far be it from me" (1 Kings 2:30). If therefore Almighty God revokes good things promised, because those to whom He had promised them are changed for the worse, how much more does He withdraw the execution of threats, when He sees those well converted to whom He had announced the punishment of retribution for their committed iniquities? What then do we say to these things, we who sin daily and are unconcerned in the bondage of our guilt? Therefore this very thing, that we do not apprehend the severity of divine justice, is greatly to be feared by us, because behold, he who is cast off by divine indignation is reported to have been troubled by no fear for the fault of his perpetrated negligence. But since we have learned of the reprobate preacher's rejection unto fear, let us hear of the progress of the elect. For there follows: (Verse 19.) "And Samuel grew, and the Lord was with him."

And he indeed responded, saying: (Verse 18) "It is the Lord; let him do what is good in his eyes."

26. By these words, indeed, what else is more clearly recognized than the faithlessness of the Jewish people? For he who calls the almighty God Lord still considers himself to be serving Him. When therefore his rejection is made known to the Jewish people by the doctors of the holy Church, he says: He is the Lord; let Him do what is good in His eyes. Because while he believes himself to please God through the old institution, he is in no way frightened by the threats of the holy Church. For it is as if Jewish faithlessness were to assert with a more open voice, and were to say to the preachers of the holy Church who threaten them: You strike no terror into us by your threats, inasmuch as we believe ourselves to minister in faith to Him from whose grace you proclaim we have fallen. When therefore he adds: Let Him do what is good in His eyes, he mocks the doctors of the holy Church rather than offering himself to the divine judgment. As if he were speaking with another intention, and saying: He does no such thing to us, inasmuch as He is our Lord, the very one whom you set before us for vengeance. There follows: (Verse 19.) And Samuel grew, and the Lord was with him.
