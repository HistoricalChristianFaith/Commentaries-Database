But nevertheless it is our duty to pray for such people. For let us hear what the vinedresser says: "Lord, let it alone this year also, until I dig around it." What does it mean to dig around the fig tree, except to rebuke unfruitful minds? For every ditch is in the low ground. And certainly rebuke humbles the mind by showing it to itself. Therefore, as often as we correct someone for their sin, we dig around the unfruitful tree as if from the duty of cultivation. But after the digging, let us hear what is said: "And I will put a basket of dung." What is a basket of dung, except the memory of sins? For the sins of the flesh are called dung. Hence it is also said through the prophet: "The beasts have rotted in their dung." For the beasts to rot in their dung is for carnal people to end their lives in the stench of luxury. Therefore, as often as we rebuke a carnal mind for its sins, as often as we bring back to its memory the vices of the past, we pour out a basket of dung, as it were, to the unfruitful tree, so that it may recall the memory of the evils it has done and grow fat, as it were, from the stench toward the grace of compunction. Therefore a basket of dung is placed at the root of the tree when the conscience of its depravity is touched by the memory of thought. And when the mind rouses itself through penitence to lamentation and reforms itself to the grace of good works, the root of the heart returns to fruitfulness of works as if by the touch of dung: it laments what it remembers having done, it is displeased with itself for what it recalls having been; it directs its intention against itself and kindles its spirit toward better things. Therefore from the stench the tree revives to fruitfulness, because from consideration of sin the soul raises itself to good works.
