30. For it was fitting that by rebuking he should first beat down the swelling of earthly wisdom, and by instruction afterwards pass on to words replete with mysteries.  Thus by ‘giants,’ either apostate Angels, or all proud men may without objection be understood.  For hence it is said by the Prophet, The dead shall not live, the giants shall not rise up again. [Is. 26, 14]  For whom does he call ‘the dead’ saving sinners, and whom does he designate ‘giants’ save those, who over and above take pride in sin.  Now the former do ‘not live,’ because by sinning they have forfeited the life of righteousness; these latter too ‘cannot rise up again’ after death, because, after their transgression being swoln with pride, they do not have recourse to the remedies of penitence.  Hence it is written again, The man that wandereth out of the way of understanding shall remain in the congregation of the dead. [Prov. 21, 16]  For whosoever forsakes the way of righteousness, to whose number does he join himself, saving to the number of the proud spirits?  Now it is well said in opposition to the high-minded, Lo, the giants groan under the waters.  As if it were expressed in plain speech; ‘Wherefore on the score of knowledge should man be proud, when the abyss of ignorance keeps at the bottom the very proudest of the spirits of the Angels?’
31. But if by the name of ‘the giants’ the powerful ones of this world are denoted, in ‘the waters’ we may have the multitudes represented, as John beareth witness, who saith, The waters, which thou seest, are peoples. [Rev. 17, 15]  Now against him that is filled with pride it is well spoken; Lo, the giants groan under the waters; because all that are high and lifted up, while in this life they long to attain the highest pitch of honours, groan under the burthens of peoples.  For in proportion as a man is the higher lifted up here, he is burthened with so much the heavier cares.  And to those very same people in mind and thoughts he is put under, whom in dignity he is put over.  And by these words it is well shown in brief that all pride lies prostrate on the ground by the mere act by which it lifts itself up on high, so as to be the more effectually bowed down beneath all things from the same cause, that it would fain be set above all.  For man when he is lifted up in high stations, bears so many in number over him, as he rules persons put beneath him.  But those, that are associated with such persons, are by fellowship in their labour themselves also weighed to the ground.  For together with them they likewise bear the toilsomeness of the burthen, whilst along with them they go after the gloriousness of the honour.  Hence whereas he said, Lo, the giants groan under the waters; he directly added;
And they that dwell along with them.
32.  As though he said; ‘Equally with them do they groan,’ who by taking delight are associated to their glory.  Now the very employment of worldly dignities is borne down with readier vices in proportion as it is charged with heavier cares.  For would that the mind of man even at rest might be able to see and eschew sins!  And so because he saw that the longed for heights of affairs cannot be administered without sins, and because it is not hidden from the wrath of God, whatsoever is committed of an unlawful kind.
