92. That the hawk casts off its old feathers every year, as the new grow up, and gets a plumage without intermission, hardly any one is ignorant. But that time of plumage, when it is clothed in the nest, is not here spoken of; because, namely, at that time, being doubtless yet but young, it is not able to stretch its wings towards the South. But that annual plumage is described, which is renewed, as the old feathers become loose. And for domesticated hawks, moist and warm spots are sought out, for them to get their plumage the better. But it is the custom, with wild hawks, to stretch their wings, when the south wind blows, in order that by the mildness of the wind their limbs may become warm, so as to loosen the old feathers. But when there is no wind, they make for themselves a warm air by stretching and flapping their wings against the rays of the sun, and when the pores have thus been opened, either the old feathers fall out, or the new ones grow up. What is it then for the hawk to get its plumage in the south, except that every Saint glows, when he is touched by the breath of the Holy Spirit, and, casting off the habit of his old conversation, assumes the form of the new man? Which Paul advises, saying, Stripping yourselves of the old man with his deeds, and putting on the new man. [Col. 3, 9] And again; Though that outward man of ours be corrupted, yet that which is within is renewed day by day. [2 Cor. 4, 16] But to cast off the old feathers, is to give up the inveterate pursuit of crafty conduct; and to assume the new, is, by good living, to maintain a gentle and simple feeling. For the feather of old conversation weighs down, and the plumage of the new change raises up, to render it the lighter for flight, as it makes it newer.
93. And He well says, It stretches its wings towards the South. For to stretch out our wings towards the South, is, by the coming of the Holy Spirit, to open our hearts in confession, so as no longer to take pleasure in concealing ourselves by defence, but in exposing ourselves by accusation. The hawk, therefore, then gains its plumage, when it has stretched out its wings towards the South, because every one then clothes himself with the feathers of virtues, when, by confession, he subjects his thoughts to the Holy Spirit. For he, who lays not open his old deeds by confession, brings not forth the works of a new life. He who knows not how to lament that which weighs him down, is unable to produce that which raises him up. For the very power of compunction opens the pores of the heart, and pours forth the plumage of virtues. And, when the mind studiously convicts itself of a sluggish old age, it gains the fresh newness of youth. Let it be said then to blessed Job, Doth the hawk get plumage by thy wisdom, stretching her wings towards the South? That is, Hast thou conferred understanding on any of the Elect, to expand the wings of his thoughts, at the breath of the Holy Spirit, in order to cast off the weight of the old conversation, and assume the feathers of virtues for the purpose of a fresh flight? In order, namely, for him to gather from hence, that the vigilance of sense which is in him he has not of himself, who is unable to confer it from himself on others. But, by this hawk the renewed Gentile people can also be designated. As if it were plainly said to blessed Job; Behold the future plumage of virtues in the Gentiles, and cast off the old feathers of pride.
