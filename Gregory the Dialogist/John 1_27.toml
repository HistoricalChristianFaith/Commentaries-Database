It was a custom among the ancients that if someone was unwilling to take the wife he should be taking, he who should have come to her as bridegroom by right of relationship would undo his sandal. How did Christ appear among men and women if not as the bridegroom of his holy church? John said of him that “he who has the bride is the bridegroom.” Since people considered John the Christ, a fact that he denied, he was right to declare his unworthiness to undo the strap of Christ’s sandal. It is as if he was saying, “I am not able to lay bare the footsteps of the Redeemer, because I am not unrightfully usurping for myself the name of bridegroom.”We can also interpret this verse in another way. We all know that sandals are made from dead animals. Our Lord came in the flesh; he appeared as if shod in sandals because he assumed in his divinity the dead flesh of our corrupt condition.…
The human eye is not able to grasp the mystery of Christ’s incarnation. In no way can we discover how the Word took on a body, how the supreme life-giving Spirit came to life in his mother’s womb, how he who has not beginning both is and is conceived. The sandal strap is the bond of a mystery. John is not able to undo the strap of his sandal because not even he who recognized the mystery of the Lord’s incarnation through the spirit of prophecy can subject it to investigation.
