As far as regards the literal meaning, Elihu proves to us, when he speaks, how proudly he remained silent. For when he says, “For I waited for your words, and I was thinking that you would say something,” he plainly shows that he remained silent, while the aged were speaking, with the desire of judging rather than with the wish of learning from them. Though these expressions are even a better description of the conduct of proud people, who, when at length brought within holy church, are accustomed to looking at its opponents to consider not so much the years of their age as the intention of their words. Regardless of how much older the heretics may be than these same haughty people, they boldly overbear those persons in whose words they reprove false doctrine.
