But on the contrary, those who are accustomed to taking pride in false justice look down on all others, show no mercy in condescending to the weak; and because they do not believe themselves to be sinners, they become sinners all the more grievously. The Pharisees certainly belonged to this number, who, judging the Lord because he received sinners, with their dry hearts criticized the very fountain of mercy.

But because they were sick in such a way that they did not know they were sick, the heavenly physician heals them with gentle remedies so that they might recognize what they were; he presents a kind parable and presses upon the swelling of the wound in their heart.
