For he whom the grace of charity does not fall upon looks upon his neighbor as a stranger, even though he has himself begotten him to God. Doubtless all are hypocrites whose minds in truth, while ever aiming at outward objects, become insensible within. While they are ever seeking their own, in everything they do they are not softened by any compassion of charity for the feelings of the neighbor.… But hypocrites do not know these gut level feelings of charity. Because the more their mind is let loose on outward subjects by worldly concupiscence, the more it is hardened inside by its lack of affection. And it is frozen by a benumbing torpor within, because it is softened by fatal love outside. It is unable to reflect upon itself, because it does not strive to think of itself. A mind cannot think on itself which is not entirely at home in itself. It is unable to be entirely at home in itself, because by as many lusts as it is hurried away, by as many objects as it is distracted from itself and scattered, it lies below, though with collected strength it may rise, if it willed, to the greatest heights.…“God has deprived it of its wisdom, nor has he given it understanding.” Although to deprive is one thing and “not to give” is another, yet his first expression, “deprived,” he repeated by subjoining “has not given.” As if he were saying, My expression “deprived” means not that he has unjustly taken away wisdom but that he has justly not given it. Hence the Lord is described as having hardened the heart of Pharaoh, not because he himself inflicted hardness or, in accord with the demands of his deserts, because he softened it by a sensibility of heavenly infused fear. But now, because the hypocrite pretends that he is holy and conceals himself under the semblance of good works, he keeps down peace of the holy church and is therefore, before our eyes, arrayed with the appearance of religion. But if any temptation of his faith springs up, the rabid mind of the wolf strips itself of its garb of sheep’s skin and shows by persecution how greatly it rages against the holy.

In every step of the fall, the beginning is represented by the lighter faults that later, with the increase of guilt, become more and more serious. Here the evilness of this hypocrite is analyzed through his progressive iniquities. First, he presents himself as a righteous person, which he is not at all. Then, he scorns the righteous. Finally, he even insults the Creator. Indeed, the soul never stays in the place where it fell, because, after falling voluntarily, the weight of its evilness leads it to worse and worse actions. And so, by precipitating [the fall], it is submerged more and more deeply. Let the hypocrite then go now and seek for his own praises. Later he will oppress the life of his neighbor, and one day he will even scorn his own Creator. The more he devises arrogant attitudes, the more he sinks into atrocious punishments as a result.
