We must observe that in the spiritual building one entrance lies open to the east, another to the north and another to the south. Just as the cold of the north denotes sinners, so the southern way stands for the fervent in spirit who, kindled by the heat of the Holy Spirit, grow up in virtues as in the noonday light. Then let the gate lie open to the east so that those who, after the beginning of heat and light, have relapsed in the coldness and darkness of their sins may through the work of penitence return to pardon and recognize what is the true rejoicing on inward recompense. Let the gate lie open to the south so that those who burn in virtues with holy desires may daily penetrate the mysteries of inward joy with spiritual understanding.

We strive the more freely towards the kingdom because, as it were, we travel light.

The excellent preacher has a palm on this side and on that, because abundance does not lead him astray to pride, nor does need lead him to avarice.
