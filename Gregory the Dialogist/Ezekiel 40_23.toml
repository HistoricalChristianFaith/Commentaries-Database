"And the gate of the inner court opposite the gate to the North and to the East."

In this place "contra" [against/opposite] is placed not for opposition, but for straightness; for the gate of the inner court was shown to be positioned such that the gate of the North and of the East extended to it by a straight approach. What therefore does it mean that the inner gate is shown positioned in a straight path opposite the gate of the East and of the North, except that it is openly given to understand that whether to the Jewish or Gentile people, or to the righteous and to sinners, but those converted after sins, the entrance to the heavenly kingdom is equally opened? For the mercy of our Creator is abundant. And the inner gate looks not only upon the gate of the East, but also of the North, because the joys of the inner court are opened not only to those who remain in innocence, but also to sinners condemning their sins through penance, so that they may recognize the ineffable mysteries of the heavenly homeland, thirsting by recognizing, running by thirsting, arriving by running. He who said knew these secrets of inner joy: "My soul has thirsted for the living God, when shall I come and appear before the face of God?" The preacher of the Gentiles was yearning for this entrance to the heavenly kingdom when he said: "I desire to be dissolved and to be with Christ." The bride who said knew these secrets of hidden exultation: "My beloved put his hand through the opening, and my belly trembled at his touch." For the beloved puts his hand through the opening when our Lord strikes our soul by his power through subtle understanding. And the belly trembles at his touch, because our weakness, through being touched by the understanding of heavenly joy, is disturbed by its very exultation, and there arises fear with gladness in the mind, because it now senses what it loves concerning heavenly joy, and yet fears lest it not receive what it barely and faintly senses. What therefore remains except that all who recognize those joys of the heavenly homeland should direct themselves to the course of the life of perfection? Whence here also is fittingly added: "And he measured from gate to gate one hundred cubits."

The number one hundred, because it is produced by ten times ten, we have already said above is perfect. Therefore, he who sees the entrance of the inner court must necessarily run through the life of perfection, and arrive from the gate of beginning to the entrance of consummation. Let the inner court therefore be measured, which extends from the outer gates to the inner gate, at one hundred cubits, so that he who has begun to enter by loving may have the breadth of perfection in mind, so that in him whom he loves neither adversities may constrain him nor prosperities exalt him, but, despising all transitory things, until he arrives at the secret joys, he may run through the court of perfection. For there are many who have already entered the entrance of the outer gate by seven steps, according to a certain manner of heavenly dispensation: humble through the fear of God, merciful through the pursuit of piety, discerning through knowledge, free through strength of mind, cautious through counsel, prudent through understanding, mature through wisdom; but, still bound by certain necessities, they serve the cares of this world, and where they have already for the most part shaken off their mind, there they are still held unwillingly. And while they bear the burdens of earthly occupation imposed upon them, they are less exercised in the heavenly precepts. There is no leisure to yearn from the depths of their heart for the eternal homeland; their very desires in some way grow weak in them, because indeed, hindered by temporal cares, it is not permitted to love the true joys that they have come to know as much as they would wish. These often shake off the yoke of the world from the neck of their mind, abandon all things, lay down the burdens of earthly care, and in order to open more widely the bosom of their soul to heavenly desire, they seek a secluded life, and intent on holy prayers, devoted to sacred meditations, they afflict themselves with daily weeping, and melt the oldness of their heart in the fire of love, and renew themselves by kindling themselves toward heavenly joy. These often, enkindled in their very desire, now long to depart from the flesh, and do not wish to return to the present life after weeping. But nevertheless they are delayed, so that their deferred love may profit from its very deferral, and may grow with ardent desire as if for what is denied. Thus in the region of the Gerasenes, he who had been freed from the legion of demons already wished to go with the Lord, but nevertheless it is said to him: "Return to your house, and tell how great things the Lord has done for you." Thus the bride in the Song of Songs, anxious with holy desires, speaks, saying: "In my little bed through the nights I sought him whom my soul loves. I sought him, and did not find him." For she seeks the beloved in her little bed, when in that very rest and leisure which she desires, the soul now longs to see the Lord, now desires to go out to him, now yearns to be free of the darkness of the present life. But she seeks him and does not find him, because although she desires with great love, it is still not granted to her to see him whom she loves.

Such minds of the saints, therefore, what else do they do in this desire except run from the outer gates through the inner court to the gate? It often happens to them that when they have seen themselves pierced with the great gift of heavenly grace, they now consider themselves perfect and think themselves obedient; but because there is no one who commands hard things, they believe themselves to be patient, but because no one strikes them through insults and adversities. And it frequently happens that they undertake spiritual ministry even unwillingly, and are led to the governance of the faithful. When they have been struck on all sides by great tribulations, troubled in mind, they find themselves imperfect, who when not struck believed themselves to be perfect. From this matter it comes about that they gather themselves to themselves, and silently blush at the reproach of their own weakness before themselves, and, strengthened from their very confusion, they set patience against adversities, and profit from tribulation, who previously in leisure grew sluggish from their very security. And they truly begin to be such as they previously thought themselves to be in vain. Therefore when these are carried from the outer gates all the way to the inner gate through the court of good zeal, this same court is measured in them at a hundred cubits, because by holy delay and exercise they daily advance toward perfection. For to advance daily in the mind through desires is, as it were, to measure the inner court at a hundred cubits. Therefore from the gates to the gate there are a hundred cubits, so that the very delay of living may be, as it were, a certain pause of going, through which one daily grows in virtues, so that one may arrive more perfectly at the inner entrance.
