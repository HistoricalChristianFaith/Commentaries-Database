To this light, indeed, faith is the way. Hence rightly it is immediately answered to the blind man as he is enlightened: "Receive your sight, your faith has saved you." But to these things carnal thinking says: How can I seek spiritual light, which I cannot see? How is it certain to me that it exists, since it does not shine upon my bodily eyes? To which thought, indeed, anyone may briefly respond that even these very things which he perceives, he thinks not through the body but through the soul. And no one sees his own soul, yet he does not doubt that he has a soul which he does not see. For the visible body is governed by the invisible soul. But if what is invisible is taken away, immediately that which seemed to stand visibly collapses. Therefore from an invisible substance one lives in this visible life, and is the existence of an invisible life doubted?
