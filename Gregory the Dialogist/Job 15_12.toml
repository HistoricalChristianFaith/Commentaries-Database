35.  Often the mind of the righteous is so suspended in contemplating things on high, that outwardly their face seems to have been struck with stupefaction.  But because Heretics are not taught to enforce the power of contemplation in secret, they think that it is done by the just, and those that are imbued with a right understanding, more in hypocrisy than in truth, in that what they cannot themselves obtain the possession of, they do not suppose exists in others in a genuine way.
