"For you are not sent to a people of deep speech and unknown tongue, to the house of Israel; nor to many peoples of deep speech and unknown tongue whose words you cannot understand. And if you were sent to them, they would listen to you. But the house of Israel will not listen to you, because they will not listen to me."

In the very beginning of the command by which the prophet is sent to preach, both the calling of the Gentiles and the rejection of the Israelites are clearly indicated. For when it is said: "You are not being sent to many peoples of deep speech and unknown tongue whose words you cannot understand," and immediately it is added: "And if you were sent to them, they would hear you," the obedience of the Gentiles is clearly declared, who would one day follow the voices of the preachers without delay.
