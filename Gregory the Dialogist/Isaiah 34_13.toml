Which conduct the Lord by the prophet well reproves, under the character of Babylon, saying, “Thorns and nettles shall spring up in her houses, and the bramble in their fortresses.” For what do we understand by “nettles” but the irritations of thoughts, and what by “thorns” but the piercing of sins? Nettles therefore and thorns spring up in the houses of Babylon, because in the disorder of a reprobate mind there arise longings of thoughts that exasperate and sinful deeds that wound.
