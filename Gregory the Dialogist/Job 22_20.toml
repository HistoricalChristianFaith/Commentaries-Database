19.  For here the wicked are erected, in that they are lifted up in bad deeds.  For they both do wickedly, and yet for their wicked deeds they are not stricken.  They sin and thrive, they add to their sins, and multiply earthly good.  But ‘their erecting is cut down’ then, when they are either dragged from the present life to destruction, or from the sight of the Eternal Judge to the eternal burning of hell.  Which people, though here they quit their dead flesh, yet that same in the resurrection they receive again, that together with that flesh they may burn, in which flesh they did their sin.  For as their sin was in mind and body, so the punishment shall be in spirit and flesh alike.  Therefore, whereas not even that shall be quit of torment to them, which here they leave dead, it is rightly said now, the remnant of them the fire hath consumed.
