35. For Eli first contradicted Hannah while she was praying by uttering insults, but afterward he took pleasure in her devotion to him. What is this, except that the Jewish priesthood both opposed the preaching Church through some ministers of its office, and through others finally consented to the recognized truth of our faith? For concerning those who opposed, it is said that they flogged the apostles and commanded them not to speak any further in the name of Jesus (Acts 5:40). But concerning those who consented, the same Luke recalls, saying: "A great multitude of priests were obedient to the faith" (Acts 6:7). Therefore Eli prayed for the vow of Hannah's fruitfulness when that great multitude of priests, obedient to the faith, desired that the number of the elect be multiplied through the preaching of the holy Church. He certainly wished her to go in peace, because he desired her to obtain the fruit of preaching without the pain of suffering. And because the holy Church took pleasure in their vow, it follows: (Verse 18) "May your handmaid find grace in your eyes." As if to say: According to the gaze of your desire, may the grace of divine dispensation follow the work of my ministry. It follows: (Verse 18) "And the woman went her way, and she ate and drank, and her countenance was no longer changed in various ways."
