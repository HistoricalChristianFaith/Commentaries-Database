41.  And at once they leap out in praise of them, and boast that they had been as it were the only rulers of the Church.  Hence it is yet further added, Unto whom alone the earth was given, and the stranger passed not among them.  They think that ‘the earth was given to their fathers alone,’ in that the masters of their erroneous teaching alone really had rule in the Church.  And who is termed ‘the stranger,’ but the Apostate Angel?  Whence too it is said by the Psalmist concerning all the wicked spirits together; For strangers are risen up against me, and oppressors seek after my soul. [Ps. 54, 3]  And so Heretics, because they think that the hearts of their doctors were not subject to the Apostate Angel, say that ‘the stranger passed not among them.’  For which same stranger to pass through each individual, is his putting wicked thoughts into his heart.  And hence it is said by the voice of the Prophet of the evil spirits arrayed against the soul standing erect, Which have said to thy soul, Bow down, that we may go over. [Is. 51, 23]  But whereas Eliphaz the Temanite, when going to tell some things, wishes to be heard, though he knows many things which were proper to be said, and yet does not know that they were not proper to be said to blessed Job, let us hear the sentences which he uttered against blessed Job.  For neither ought we to consider the person to whom, but only what it was that he said.
