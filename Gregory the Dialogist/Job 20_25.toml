For you may often see the bad person, who is set in earthly power, agitated with furious passion and executing all that his rage suggests. When his fury is gone, then lust directly ravages his soul. When lust is stopped for a time, his continence produces self-exaltation that immediately occupies his heart. So that others may fear him, he aims to present himself as an object of terror. But when the occasion requires that he should say anything deceitfully, he seems to lay aside the horror of his pride and flatters with an easy address. When he ceases to show himself proud, he does not dread to act deceitfully again. And so it is rightly said of him, in whose mind one vice takes the place of another, “Terrible ones come and go upon him.” Since all the evil habits weigh him down with their coming and going in taking each other’s place, his soul is, as it were, overrun by as many evil spirits departing and returning. - "Morals on the Book of Job 15.33"

31.  This wicked man lays plots in arts of robbery on his neighbours.  And whilst he is plotting mischief in the thoughts of his heart, it is as if ‘the sword were still in its sheath;’ but when he wickedly executes the mischief, which he has contrived, he ‘cometh out of his sheath,’ in that he is brought out to view, from the secresy of his thoughts, in the wickedness of evil doing.  He is shown to light in the deed, such as he was, hidden from view, in the thought.  And observe that he says, drawn and cometh out; i.e. ‘drawn’ by the deceiver, but ‘coming out’ by the act of his own free will.  For he that is ‘drawn’ unquestionably follows one that draws him.  But he that ‘cometh forth,’ seems to act according to his own will.  That man, then, who is at once drawn to the several wicked practices by our old enemy, and yet fast bound in the desire of them by his own free will, is described as ‘drawn and coming forth from his sheath,’ since this thing, that he issues forth from the bad thought to the worst enacting, belongs at once to the wickedness of that spirit that prompted, and of him that consented by an act of his own will.
32.  The terribleness of whose power is further shown, where it is immediately added, Yea, lightening in his bitterness.  For when the lightning comes suddenly from above, when it shines with terribleness before our eyes, it displays shining brightness, and strikes the object  before it.  Thus, thus is it with the wicked man, when he has secured to himself the glory of the present life: by the same cause by which he is shown to view bright by power in the present world, it is brought to pass that he is blasted at the last.  For the wicked man’s as it were ‘lightening,’ is his shining in this life’s honour; but whereas the splendour of that glory is consigned to the eternal woes of hell, it is rightly said in this place, ‘Yea, lightening in his bitterness.’  For he that now seems as though he took delight in striking by terribleness and brightness, for this cause afterwards undergoes punishments for everlasting.  And indeed it is written of a certain rich man that he ‘fared splendidly’ every day.  Now it is one thing to show ‘splendidly,’ and another to ‘lighten;’ for sometimes there is splendour without striking, but splendour with striking is described by the title of ‘lightning.’  He then who being placed in power does injury to others, is not unaptly entitled ‘lightening,’ in that from the same means whereby he is himself exalted against the good, as it were by the light of glory, the life of the good is made to feel torture.  It goes on;
Terrible ones shall come and go over him.
33.  Who are here called ‘terrible ones’ except evil spirits, who are to be feared and avoided by godly minds?  And whereas those same evil spirits are to be believed to attach themselves severally to certain particular vices, when this wicked man seems to quit for a moment one set of faults, and begins to commit another, then surely ‘the terrible ones come and go over him,’ in that the soul of the bad man though one set of bad habits abandons, yet another takes possession of it.  For you may often see the bad man, who is set in earthly power, agitated with furious passion, and executing all that his rage suggests; and when his fury is gone, then directly lust ravages his soul; when lust is stopped for a time, self-exaltation as on the ground of continency is immediately made to take its place in his heart, and that he may be feared by others, he aims to show himself as an object of terror.  But when the occasion requires that he should say any thing with double-dealing, laying aside in a certain sort the terribleness of pride, he flatters with an easy address, and when he ceases to show himself proud, he does not dread to turn double-dealing.  And so it is rightly said of him, in whose mind one vice continually takes the place of another, Terrible ones come and go upon him; since for all the evil habits that he is borne down with departing and taking each other’s place, his soul is as it were overrun by as many evil spirits going and returning.  But it is these things which he does in act, that issue outwardly by parts and pieces, for on his soul he has all things bad tied fast at once and together.
