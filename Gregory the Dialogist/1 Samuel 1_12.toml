26. What was it for the holy Church to multiply prayers before the Lord out of desire for giving birth, except to persist in constant prayers for the conversion of the Synagogue? And what was it for the Jewish priesthood to watch her mouth, except to lie in wait against the preaching of the holy Church? For it watched her mouth, because it strove vehemently to criticize the right preaching of the faith. And it is rightly said to have watched her mouth when she was multiplying prayers, because the more it recognized her greater desires in the urgency of her preaching, the more cunningly it strove to harm her. Finally, it would not have watched but would have heeded her mouth, if it had wished to hear the preaching of our faith for the fruit of its own salvation. It follows: (Verse 13.) Now Hannah was speaking in her heart, and only her lips moved, and her voice was not heard at all.

(Moral Exposition) But because we have said these last things about the history, we are not acting amiss if we examine our learning somewhat more carefully in these words of sacred history. If therefore the order of events is sought, she first ate and drank, then had a bitter spirit, prayed to the Lord weeping abundantly, afterward made a vow, and multiplied her prayers. What does the multiplication of Anna's prayers signify, except that perfection of the elect to which the excellent Teacher exhorts us, saying: "Pray without ceasing" (1 Thess. 5:17)? For no one can pray without ceasing except a perfect man; for to pray without ceasing is to always stand before the Creator through the affection of supplication. But he who is still weighed down by the weakness of imperfection does not beseech the Lord without ceasing, because even in the very time of prayer he slips away from His sight through wandering of mind. And rightly the holy woman is said to have made a vow before the multiplication of prayers, because unless someone shows himself entirely heavenly through the rigor of resolution, he is drawn away from the affection of supplication all the more often, as he is turned by the mobility of mind into the whirl of worldly intention, and is not held in the Lord's sight through strong guardianship. But the elect mind will be able to vow itself to heavenly joys through spiritual resolution, if it already knows how to weep abundantly, if through abundance of tears it has already learned to taste the savor of heavenly sweetness, and, occupied in the joy of that inner refreshment of itself, disdains to look upon earthly things. Therefore Anna is openly described as having wept abundantly before her vow, because no one will be able to show himself entirely heavenly by forgetting earthly things, unless, inflamed with great weeping, he knows how to receive the sweetness of intimate delight in the consolation of a mind already dead to the world. And because this consolation of tears is not received in the joy of the soul, unless one first afflicts oneself through the bitterness of compunction, and pierces with the dagger of salutary sorrow whatever lives in oneself from fleeting joy. Anna is reported to have wept first with a bitter spirit, and thus to have been able to weep abundantly. Which Solomon rightly suggests, saying: "The heart that knows the bitterness of its own soul, in its joy a stranger does not meddle" (Prov. 14:10). For a stranger is one who still has intention of delight from exterior goods. He certainly is not received into the joy of an embittered heart, because he cannot experience what interior joy is, unless he who perfectly cares to despise exterior things. But it should still be noted that before all these things she is reported to have risen, and before she rose, to have eaten and drunk. What is the food of the elect soul, except according to the voice of truth: "Every word that proceeds from the mouth of God" (Matt. 4:4)? And what is it for her to rise, except to raise oneself to the state of heavenly intention? Therefore she is said to have risen before she had a bitter spirit, and to have eaten and drunk before she rose, because the elect soul cannot grieve over the misery of present life, if it does not stretch itself toward those things which it has lost in heaven; and it does not elevate itself to those highest things, if it fasts from the nourishment of Sacred Scripture. Therefore that we may rise, we eat and drink, because we are raised to the height of heavenly love when we are strengthened by the profound and plainer meanings of Sacred Scripture. Then if we rise, we acquire bitterness of heart, because while we are carried upward through love, the things that are below do not offer us the blandishments of joy, but the harshness of affliction. But now from a bitter spirit we ascend to the streams of tears, because when we are pierced through with continual and strong compunction, we are more copiously able to weep over the evils that we incur in this valley of tears, and the future things that we fear, and the eternal goods that we have lost. From this indeed we proceed to the secrets of making vows, because while the abundance of tears buries us from everything that pleases outwardly, it shows us, as if made entirely heavenly, to the sight of those above, and we make vows by which eternal goods please us so much that our mind defiles itself by no earthly or carnal things. Then the multiplication of prayers follows our progress, because we now more gladly, more frequently, and more earnestly seek eternal things by praying, the more we breathe only in the consolation of future goods. And in the morning they worship, and return to their city.
