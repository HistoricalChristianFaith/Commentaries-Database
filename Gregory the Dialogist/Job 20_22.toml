27.  For first he had sorrow in the mere wearying of his own concupiscence how to snatch hold of the things coveted, how to secure one sort by arts of flattery, another sort by means of threats; but after that having possessed himself of the gifts of fortune he has attained his desire, another annoyance wears him down, viz. that it is with fear and anxiety he keeps safe that which he remembers it cost him infinite trouble to acquire.  On every side he dreads conspirators, and fears to be himself subjected to the very thing that he has done to others.  One more powerful he is afraid of, lest he be exposed to violence from him; a poor man, when he sees one, he looks on as a thief.  The things themselves which he has hoarded up, he is at great pains about, lest by the failure of their own inherent nature they be consumed by neglect.  In all these particulars then, because fear by itself is punishment, the unhappy wretch suffers things as great as he fears to suffer.  And after this he is yet further brought to hell, and given over to eternal torments.  Therefore ‘every woe cometh down upon him,’ who is at once consumed first here by the punishment of coveting, afterwards by the trouble of safe keeping, and there at some future time by the punishment of retributive wrath.
28.  But it is wonderful security of the heart, not to seek what does not belong to us, but to rest content with each day’s sustenance day by day.  From which same security it is that the Rest everlasting also arises, seeing that from a good and quiet frame we pass to eternal delights.  Contrariwise lost sinners are at once worn down here in desires, and there in torments.  And from the labour of taking thought there arises to them the labour of pain, in that by the fever of avarice they are drawn into the fire of hell.  And because, as we have already often said, it often happens that the wicked man, the sooner he attains his object, is the more easily carried off to torment.
