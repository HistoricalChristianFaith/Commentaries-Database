18.  For then, persecution forcing thereto, she sees multitudes of the frail fall from her, whom now as a mother she cherishes as her little ones within the bosom of peace, and keeps close within the quiet cradles of faith, seeing that being mixed with the strong they are nurtured by the very tranquillity of the faith.  But then many such are destined to fall, and through the bowels of charity, whatever it sustains in the damage of the little ones, the mind of the perfect laments that itself undergoes.  For every damage of the weak is by compassion made to pass to the hearts of the strong, Whence it is said by Paul, Who is weak, and I am not weak? who is offended, and I burn not? [2 Cor. 11, 29]  For a man is perfect in such proportion as he perfectly feels the sorrows of others.  Whence Holy Church, being brought to a pass by the weak ones falling at that time, shall say with right, As in the days when God preserved me; because herself she then accounts to fall in those, who now sees herself in these to be kept safe.  And it is well said, When His lamp shined upon my head, and when by His light I walked through darkness.  For by the term of a ‘lamp’ the light of Holy Scripture is represented, whereof the Shepherd of the Church himself saith, We have also the word of prophecy more sure; whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a lamp that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn and the day-star arise in your hearts. [2 Pet. 1, 19]  And the Psalmist saith, Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path. [Ps. 119, 105]  Now because our topmost part is the mind, the mind is rightly styled by the designation of ‘head.’  Whence it is said by the Psalmist, Thou hast anointed my head with oil. [Ps. 23, 5]  As if he said in plain terms, ‘Thou hast filled my soul with the fatness of charity.’  And so now ‘the lamp shines upon the head’ of the Church, because the sacred Oracles enlighten the darkness of our minds, that in this darksome place of the present life, whilst we receive the light of the word of God, we should see what things are to be done.  Now she ‘walks by His light in darkness,’ because the Holy Church Universal, though it penetrate not the secrets of another’s thought, because as it were it does not know the face in the night, yet it sets the steps of good practice, being governed by the light of Heavenly Revelation.
