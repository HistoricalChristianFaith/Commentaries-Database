It is well said by Solomon, “He that hides corn shall be cursed among the people.” To hide corn is to retain with oneself the words of sacred preaching. Among the people any such one is cursed, since, for the fault of mere silence, he is condemned in the punishment of the many whom he could have corrected. .
