20. Behold how great were the things he lost, who, as he supposed, despised nothing. Behold, for seven days he waited for the prophet; but when he ceased to await him at the end of the day, he lost the glory of so great a dignity. Whence it is also said through the prophet: 'Woe to those who have lost patience' (Sirach 2:16). Indeed, those lose patience who do not bring to completion the good things they have begun. To whom assuredly woe is pronounced: because they not only lose the reward of the labor they began, but are also struck with the punishment of their apostasy. Moreover, the punishment of the proud and disobedient king is declared when it is said: 'If you had not done this, the Lord would already have prepared your kingdom over Israel from now and forever; but it shall not stand.' From now and forever the kingdom is prepared for the elect: because those who rightly order temporal things prepare for themselves the height of eternal glory. Indeed, the kingdom of the elect is prepared now, when through divine grace their ministries are rightly administered. Which advances from now and forever: because from the lofty action of this present time, they merit that still loftier glory of eternity in heaven. And so finally it is said to the reprobate king: 'Your kingdom shall by no means stand any longer.' As if to say: Since he falls short of temporal righteousness, he does not attain to the height of eternity. Or for this reason it is said literally that it shall not stand: because it fell with him, and after him it did not remain in his sons. But, so that he may be struck with the punishment of envy, he is compelled to hear not only his own rejection, but also the election of another. For the prophet, continuing, says: (Verse 14) 'The Lord has sought for Himself a man after His own heart, and has commanded him to be leader over His people Israel.'
