The hearts of sinners were the place of the evil spirit, but when in their anger at themselves they return to life through penitence, they become the place of the glory of the Lord. For now they turn on themselves, now with tears of repentance they censure the evils that they have committed. Therefore the blessing of glory in praise of the Lord is heard where before resounded the injury of the Creator from love of this present age. And the hearts of sinners, which before had been an alien and sinful place, now become to the Lord his dwelling place. For those who are converted from their sins to the Lord not only bewail with tears the wicked deeds they have committed but also move on to the heights, through wondrous works, so that they become sacred creatures of almighty God. They are therefore able to fly to the heights on signs and virtues, so that they abandon the earth completely, and with the gifts that they have received, they reach for the heavens through sheer desire.
