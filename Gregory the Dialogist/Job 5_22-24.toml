In holy Scripture complete peace is described in one way and initial peace in another. For “Truth” gave to his disciples peace from the beginning, when he said, “Peace I leave with you; my peace I give unto you.” And Simeon desired to have perfect peace. He sought it saying, “Now let your servant depart in peace, according to your word.” Our peace begins in longing for the Creator, but it is perfected by clarity of vision. Our peace will be perfect when our mind is neither blinded by ignorance nor moved by the assaults of the body. Forasmuch as we touch upon its first beginnings, when we either subject the soul to God or the flesh to the soul, the “tabernacle” of the righteous person is said to “have peace.” The body he inhabits through his mind is restrained from the evil motions of its desires under the controlling hand of righteousness. But what advantage is it to restrain the flesh by continence if the mind has not been taught to expand itself through compassion in the love of our neighbor? For the body’s chasteness is worth nothing if not recommended by sweetness of spirit.
