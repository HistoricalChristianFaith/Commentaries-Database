This other Consoler of humanity, who himself is invisible, inflames each person that he has filled so that he too longs after invisible things. And because worldly hearts are only focused on what is seen, they do not receive him because their minds are not elevated to what is unseen. As secular minds broaden their horizons by focusing on the outward things [of this world], they constrict the ability of the arteries of the heart to admit the Spirit.
