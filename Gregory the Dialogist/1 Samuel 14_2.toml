Gibeah, as we said, is interpreted as "hill"; Migron is said to mean "from the throat." Now holy preachers are very exalted, not only in works, but also in contemplation. The outer part of this loftiness, therefore, is that of works, while the inner part is that of contemplation. Through this outer part of their exaltedness, they are seen by us as an example; but through the inner part, they are joined to the Creator in great love. The prophet shows them to us as worthy of admiration through the outer part of their loftiness, when he says: "Who are these who fly like clouds, and like doves to their windows?" (Isaiah 60:8). They fly indeed like clouds: because they are light from the weight of sin, and swift in good works by the grace of the Holy Spirit. They are like doves at their windows, because through good works they extend themselves to us as an example, as if through openings, yet they are by no means caught by the desire for praise on account of the purity of life they have displayed. But the king also sits under the pomegranate tree; because the preacher has rest in the shadow of the Redeemer. He is indeed wearied by great labor, but he is refreshed by the consolation of the Lord's words. Hence the same tree is said to remain in that place which is called "from the throat." For what is more fittingly signified by "from the throat" in this place than the sweetness of the holy Gospel? For thus we can now remain in the shadow of the Redeemer, if namely we receive his words for consolation from the meditation of the Gospels. But preachers can rest more quietly in this, who the more deeply and closely they receive that word of the divine mouth, the more sweetly they are nourished. This is also the reason why King Saul is said not to stand, nor to sit, but to remain under the pomegranate tree in Migron; because the perfect teacher is teachable by God: and while he strives to feed others with food, he himself is satisfied with the sweetness of manifold spiritual delights. For while he gazes uniquely upon the delights of the Redeemer, he rises to a wondrous contemplation of virtues: and as if from one rind he gathers very many seeds, while through all those things which he recalls concerning the Redeemer, he gladly leads his mind into delight. In this delight of the Redeemer the bride glories that she has rested, she who says: "I sat under his shadow, whom I had desired" (Song of Songs 2:3). To sit in his shadow is indeed to rest in contemplation of him. His contemplation is certainly a shadow, because in the vision of him we are protected, lest we be darkened by diabolical temptation as if by the burning heat of the sun. Those therefore who rest so loftily can usefully bring assistance to those who consult them. But nevertheless some chosen subordinates, while they fear their own weakness, while they seek God alone as the witness of their struggle, flee the judgments of such great men, so that they may be seen by God alone in their good action. Therefore it is well said both that Saul remained in the outermost part of Gibeah under the pomegranate tree, and that Jonathan did not indicate to him his purpose of battle: because as long as we cannot perfectly guard against pride, the good from which it can arise ought to be hidden from all. There follows: (Verse 2) "The people with him were about six hundred men."

We said above that by this number strong men are designated in good work, who are reported to be with the king: because through their zeal for good work, they are in harmony with the life of their teacher. But the preachers of the Church have under them not only those who do great things, but also fellow ministers of the word who teach the highest truths. They have leaders who strengthen those burning for battle, they have those who run boldly, they have those who protect powerfully. Therefore it is well added: (Verse 3.) Ahiah the son of Ahitub, brother of Ichabod, the son of Phinehas, who had been born from Eli the priest of the Lord in Shiloh. He was wearing the Ephod.
