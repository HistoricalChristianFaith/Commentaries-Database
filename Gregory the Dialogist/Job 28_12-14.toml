“And it is not found in the land of those that live sweetly.” What is denoted in this passage by the title of the “land,” except the soul of man? Concerning which the psalmist says, “My soul thirsts after you, as a land without water.” But this wisdom cannot “be found in the land of those that live sweetly,” because the person who is still fed with the pleasures of this life is severed from the perception of eternal Wisdom. For if he were truly wise-minded, being banished from the interior delights, he would mourn over that blind estate of his exile into which he has fallen. Thus Solomon says, “He that adds knowledge, adds pain also.” For the more a person begins to know what he has lost, the more he begins to bewail the sentence of his corruption that he has received. For he sees how he has fallen and how that from the joys of paradise he has come to the woes of present life, from the company of the angels to caring for necessities. He considers in what a number of perils he now lies prostrate, who before without peril disdained to stand. He bewails the exile that being accursed he undergoes. He sighs after the state of heavenly glory that he might be enjoying in security, if he had not had a mind to commit sin.… “The bottomless pit says, ‘It is not with me.’ ” What does he call the “bottomless pit?” The hearts of people who by their fall are now floating in darkness and the murkiness of double dealing. Wisdom does not reside in this “bottomless pit.” In this way the wicked mind, while it longs to be wise in a carnal way, shows itself foolish as to things spiritual. Which same “bottomless pit” declares that his Wisdom “is not with” it; because the wicked mind, while it longs to be wise in a carnal way, shows itself foolish as to things spiritual. Paul testifies, “The wisdom of this world is foolishness with God.” Thus, so much the more completely is everyone rendered foolish within, as he endeavors to appear wise outside.… “And the sea says, ‘It is not with me.’ ” For what is there denoted by the name of the sea except the bitter disquietude of worldly minds, which while they fall foul of one another in enmities by turns, dash themselves together like encountering waves? The life of worldly persons is rightly called “a sea,” because, while it is agitated by the tempestuous stirrings of actions, it is parted from the tranquility and steadfastness of interior Wisdom. The opposite of this condition was well said by the prophet, “Upon whom shall my spirit rest but upon him who is humble and quiet and who trembles at my words?”
