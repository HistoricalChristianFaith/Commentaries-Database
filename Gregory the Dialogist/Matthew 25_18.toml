But he who had received one talent went away, dug in the earth, and hid his lord's money. To hide the talent in the earth is to involve the received ability in earthly activities, not to seek spiritual profit, never to lift the heart from earthly thoughts. For there are some who have received the gift of understanding, but nevertheless think only of the things of the flesh. Of whom it is said through the prophet: They are wise to do evil, but they do not know how to do good.
