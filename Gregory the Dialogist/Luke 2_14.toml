An angel announces the King's birth, and choirs of angels join their voices with his, and rejoicing together they cry out: Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace to men of good will. Indeed, before our Redeemer was born in the flesh, we were at discord with the angels, from whose brightness and purity we stood far distant through the guilt of the first sin and through our daily transgressions. For since by sinning we were estranged from God, the angels, citizens of God, regarded us as strangers from their fellowship. But because we have come to know our King, the angels have recognized us as their fellow citizens. For since the King of heaven assumed the earth of our flesh, that angelic majesty no longer despises our weakness. The angels return to peace with us, they set aside the intent of their former discord; and those whom they had previously despised as weak and cast off, they now honor as companions. This is why Lot and Joshua worshipped angels and were not forbidden to worship; but John in his Apocalypse wished to worship an angel, yet that same angel restrained him from worshipping him, saying: See that you do not do this, for I am your fellow servant and of your brethren. Why is it that before the Redeemer's coming angels are worshipped by men and remain silent, but afterward they refuse to be worshipped, unless it is that our nature, which they had previously despised, they now fear to see prostrate before them after they behold it assumed above themselves? Nor do they now dare to scorn as weak what is beneath them, since they venerate it above themselves in the King of heaven. Nor do they disdain to have man as a companion, since they adore man as God above themselves.
