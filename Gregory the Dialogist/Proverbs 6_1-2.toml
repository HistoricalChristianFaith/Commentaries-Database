To be surety for a friend is to take charge of the soul of another on the surety of oneâ€™s own behavior. Your hand is bound to a stranger, and your mind is bound with the care of a responsibility which you previously did not hold. But you are snared with the words of your mouth and caught with your own speeches, because, while you are compelled to speak good things to those who are committed to you, you must yourself observe the things that you say. You are therefore snared with the words of your mouth, being constrained by the requirement of reason not to let your life be relaxed to what agrees not with your teaching. Thus before the strict Judge you are compelled to accomplish as much in deed as it is plain you have required of others by your words.
