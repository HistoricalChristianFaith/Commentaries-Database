15.  As if he said in plain terms, ‘What wonder is it, if he who has received so many blessings upon earth should behave without offence in return for them?  He would then be really innocent, if he continued good in adversity; but why is he to be called great, whose every work has its recompense attending upon him, in all this abundance of good things?’  For the crafty adversary, when he bethinks himself that the holy man had acted well in prosperity, hastens by means of adversity to prove him guilty before the Judge.  Whence it is well said by the voice of the Angel in the Apocalypse, The accuser of our brethren is cast down, which accused them before God day and night. [Rev. 12, 10]  Now holy Scripture is often used to set the day for prosperity, and the night for adversity.  Accordingly he ceases not to accuse us by day and by night; forasmuch as he strives to show us to be chargeable one while in prosperity, another while in adversity.  In the day he accuses us, when he slanders us that we abuse our good fortune; in the night he accuses us, when he shows that we do not exercise patience in adversity; and therefore because no strokes had as yet touched blessed Job, he was as it were still wholly without that whereof he might be able to accuse him by night, but because in prosperity he had thriven in a great holiness, he pretended that it was in return for his good fortune that he had done well, lying in the crafty assertion, that he did not keep his substance for the profit [usum] of the Lord, but that he served the Lord for the profit [usum] of his substance.  For there are some who, to enjoy God, dea1 with this life like stewards, and there are some who to enjoy this life would make use of God by the bye.  When then he describes the gifts of Divine bounty, he thinks to make light of the acts of the resolute doer, that he might impeach [addicat] the heart of him as though on the score of secret thoughts, whose life he was unable to reprove on the score of works; falsely asserting that whatever outward innocence of life there might be, was in compliance not with the love of God, but with his longing after temporal prosperity.  And so knowing nothing of the powers of blessed Job, and yet being well aware that everyone is most truly tried by adversity, he demands him for trial, that he who throughout the day of prosperity had walked with unfailing foot, at least in the night of adversity might stumble, and by the offence of impatience might be laid low before the eyes of his commender.

The old enemy knew that the Redeemer of mankind was come to be the conqueror of himself; and hence it is said by the man possessed in the Gospel, What have we to do with Thee, Jesus, Thou Son of God?  Art Thou come hither to torment us before the time? [Mat. 8, 29]  Yet before, when he perceived Him to be subject to passion, and saw that He might suffer all the mortal accidents of humanity, all that he imagined concerning His Divinity became doubtful to him from his exceeding pride.  For savouring of nothing else but pride, whilst he beheld Him in humility, he doubted of His being God; and hence he has recourse to proof by temptation, saying, If Thou be the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread. [Matt. 4, 3]  In this way, because he saw that He was subject to passion, he did not believe Him to be God by birth, but to be kept by the grace of God.
