Some people consider the commandments of the Old Testament stricter than those of the New, but they are deceived by a shortsighted interpretation. In the Old Testament, theft, not miserliness, is punished: wrongful taking of property is punished by fourfold restitution. In the New Testament the rich man is not censured for having taken away someone elseâ€™s property but for not having given away his own. He is not said to have forcibly wronged anyone but to have prided himself on what he received.
