His coming means his return from the judgment to his kingdom. The Lord comes to us after the judgment, because he lifts us up from his human appearance in the contemplation of his divinity; his coming means that he leads us to the vision of his glory. We see in his divinity after the judgment the one we beheld in his humanity at the judgment. At the judgment he comes in the form of a servant and appears to everyone, since it is written, “They will look on him whom they pierced.” When the condemned fall down to their punishment, the righteous are led to the brightness of his glory, as is written: “The wicked is taken away, so that he will [not] see the glory of the Lord.”
