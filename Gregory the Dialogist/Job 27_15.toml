22.  Doubtless’ the persons left’ of that tribe of heretics ‘are buried in death,’ for whereas they return not to the light of truth, assuredly they are sunk down in everlasting punish.  ment by an earthly perception.  And because it is sometimes the case, that whilst the leader of the common herds in error is carried off to punishment, the common herds that were led astray are new set to a knowledge of the truth, and then the persons under them return to true knowledge, when these persons are brought to eternal punishments, who had been wrongly set over them, it is fitly added;
And his widows shall not weep.
23.  Whom do we take for ‘his widows’ but the subject common herds left deserted for their happiness by his death?  For oftentimes, as has been said, when the preacher of error is carried off to everlasting punishments, his subject multitudes are brought back to the grace of a true acquaintance.  For these multitudes the wicked preacher was set over like a husband, because the seducer of the soul did cleave joined to them for the worse.  Or, indeed, ‘the widows do not weep,’ because whilst continuing in their erring belief, whereas they hold their preacher to have been holy, they are beguiled by a deceitful hope, that they should not mourn.
