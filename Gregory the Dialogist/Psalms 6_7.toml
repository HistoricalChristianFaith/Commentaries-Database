In quarrels the very light of the soul, the light of good intent, is blocked. Whence the psalmist says, “My eye is troubled because of anger.”

There are many things that are allowed and legitimate, and yet we are to some extent defiled in the doing of them; as often we attack faults with anger and disturb the tranquility of our own mind. And, though what is done is right, yet it is not to be approved that the mind is therein disturbed. For instance, he had been angry against the vices of transgressors who said, “My eye is disturbed because of anger.” For, since the mind cannot, unless it is tranquil, lift itself up to the light of contemplation, he grieved that his eye was disturbed in anger, because, though assailing evil doings from above, he still could not help being confused and disturbed from contemplation of the highest things. And therefore his anger against vice is laudable, and yet it troubles him, because he felt that he had incurred some guilt in being disturbed.
