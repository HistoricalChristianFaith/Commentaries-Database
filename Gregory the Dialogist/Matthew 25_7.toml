"Then all the virgins rise," because both the elect and the reprobate are awakened from the sleep of their death. "They trim their lamps," because they count up their works with them, for which they expect to receive eternal blessedness. But the lamps of the foolish virgins are extinguished, because their works, which had appeared outwardly bright to men, are inwardly darkened at the coming of the judge. And they find no recompense from God, because for those works they received from men the praises which they loved.
