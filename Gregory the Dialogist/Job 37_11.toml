54. For what are all the Elect, but the corn of God, to be treasured up in the heavenly garners? Which now bear with the chaff in the threshing of the floor; because in this purification of Holy Church, they endure the contrary habits of the reprobate, till the inward Husbandman separates them with His fan of judgment, and taking His Elect, as grains now cleaned, into the heavenly habitations, consigns the chaff to eternal fires. Whence it is well said by John, Whose fan is in His hand, and He will throughly purge His floor, and will gather the wheat into His barn, but He will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire. [Matt. 3, 12] But this corn, till it attain to the perfection of its fruits, looks for the rains of the clouds, in order to its growth. Because the mind of good men is watered with the words of preachers, lest it should be drained of the moisture of charity by the sun of carnal desires. The heavenly Husbandman had beheld this corn growing up in the world, and desiring the clouds, when He was saying, The harvest indeed is plenteous, but the labourers are few. But pray ye the Lord of the harvest, to send forth labourers into His harvest. [Matt. 9, 37. 38] Those therefore which here are called ‘corn,’ are there called ‘harvest,’ but they who are here called ‘clouds,’ are there called ‘labourers,’ because holy preachers are both clouds and labourers; clouds, namely, by their doctrine, labourers by their life; clouds because they flow into us by their words, labourers, because they cease not to do what they speak. Whence it is subjoined;
And the clouds scatter their light.
55. For, for clouds to scatter their light, is for holy preachers to spread abroad examples of conduct, both by their words and actions. But though they scatter the light of their inward message, yet they do not attain to the conversion of all the hearts which they desire.

“Wheat desires the clouds.” What else are the elected but God’s wheat destined to be stored in the heavenly barn?… But this wheat, up until it reaches the perfection of fruits, waits for the rain of the clouds in order to grow. The souls of the righteous are watered by the words of the preachers, in order that the sun of carnal desires may not dry the lymph of charity.…“And the clouds spread their light.” The clouds spread their light in the sense that the holy preachers, by speaking and living, divulge models of life. Even though they diffuse the light of the call to salvation, they cannot convert all the hearts that they would like to convert.
