“Wheat desires the clouds.” What else are the elected but God’s wheat destined to be stored in the heavenly barn?… But this wheat, up until it reaches the perfection of fruits, waits for the rain of the clouds in order to grow. The souls of the righteous are watered by the words of the preachers, in order that the sun of carnal desires may not dry the lymph of charity.…“And the clouds spread their light.” The clouds spread their light in the sense that the holy preachers, by speaking and living, divulge models of life. Even though they diffuse the light of the call to salvation, they cannot convert all the hearts that they would like to convert.
