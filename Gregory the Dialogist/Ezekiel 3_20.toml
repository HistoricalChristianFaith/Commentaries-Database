Because the preacher remained silent toward the just man who fell into sin, he is held guilty of his blood. And he who did not strive to be diligent in preaching has become a participant in damnation. But when it is said: "He will die in his sin, and his acts of justice which he performed will not be remembered," we must especially consider this: that when we commit evil deeds, we recall our past good deeds to memory in vain, since in the perpetration of evil there should be no confidence in past good deeds. But it can be asked whether preaching should be done to the just man after he has fallen, or also before he falls? The preacher must be vigilant lest he come to a fall—without doubt, even before he falls.

But in all these things which have been said about the just man turned to iniquity, this is difficult to speak of, this is greatly to be feared: that the Lord says, "I will place a stumbling block before him." For He says: "If the just man, having turned from his justice, shall commit iniquity, I will place a stumbling block before him." For we say that if he commits iniquity, he stumbles, and what we say is entirely true. Why then does almighty God place a stumbling block before him whom He already sees to have struck against it and fallen through the iniquity he has committed? But the judgments of almighty God are strict; and He who long waits for the sinner to return, places before the one who does not return and who shows contempt yet another place where he may stumble more grievously.

For indeed a sin which is not quickly wiped away through repentance is either a sin and a cause of sin, or a sin and a punishment for sin, or a sin that is simultaneously both a cause and a punishment for sin. For everything that is first committed is a sin. But if it is not quickly cleansed through repentance, by just judgment almighty God permits the bound mind of the sinner to fall into yet another fault, so that the one who refused to amend what he had done through weeping and correction begins to heap sin upon sin. Therefore the sin which is not washed away by the lament of repentance is simultaneously a sin and a cause of sin, because from it arises that by which the sinner's soul is bound still more deeply. But the sin which follows from sin is simultaneously a sin and a punishment for sin, because, as blindness increases, it is generated from the retribution of the prior fault, so that the very increases of vices become, as it were, certain punishments in the sinner. Indeed it sometimes happens that one and the same sin is both a sin and a punishment for sin, and simultaneously a cause of sin. For let us place before our eyes someone who coveted a neighbor's property, which because he could not obtain openly, he seized by theft, but when accused of the theft, he denied under oath that he had taken it. For this man, covetousness was a sin and a cause of sin, because through it he arrived at robbery. But the very theft by which he seized the coveted property both became a sin for him and a punishment for sin, because from the retribution of the concupiscence that was not repressed, it came about that he proceeded to theft, and the fault of the heart grew into action through the vengeance of blindness. But because he took care to cover the theft with perjury, from sin he again begot sin. Therefore the theft which proceeded from covetousness and produced perjury became both a sin and a punishment for the preceding fault, and a sin and a cause of sin for the subsequent fault, because having been born from the former, it generated the latter. This Paul rightly suggested concerning certain ones who understood God but did not honor him, saying: "Although they knew God, they did not glorify him as God or give thanks, but became vain in their thoughts." Behold, there is a sin and a cause of sin. What follows from this cause he adds: "And their foolish heart was darkened. For claiming to be wise, they became fools; and they exchanged the glory of the incorruptible God for the likeness of an image of corruptible man, and of birds, and of four-footed beasts, and of serpents." Behold, there is a sin and a punishment for sin. But it would be only a sin and a punishment for sin if yet another sin did not follow from this sin. For after their unbelief it is added: "Therefore God handed them over to the desires of their hearts, to uncleanness, so that they dishonor their own bodies among themselves." Those therefore who, knowing God, did not glorify him as God, from that sin which was also a cause of sin were brought to this point as well, that they slipped into the worship of serpents and birds. But because through this blindness they also fell into uncleanness and the disgraces of the flesh, their very blindness of unbelief is both a sin and a punishment for sin in relation to their preceding understanding, but in relation to the subsequent uncleanness it became a sin and a cause of sin. But because these matters have been treated at length in the books of the Morals, we must not linger on them longer now.

But this we must consider with trembling: how the just and almighty God, when He is angry at preceding sins, permits the blinded mind to fall also into others. Hence Moses says: "The sins of the Amorites are not yet complete." David also says: "Add iniquity upon their iniquity, that they may not enter into Your justice." Another prophet also says: "Cursing and lying and murder and theft and adultery have overflowed, and blood has touched blood." For blood touches blood when sin is added to sin, so that before the eyes of God the soul is bloodied by accumulated iniquities. The Apostle Paul says: "That they may fill up their sins always." To John also it is said through the angel: "Let him who does harm do harm still; and let him who is filthy be filthy still." Hence now also the Lord says: "If the just man turns from his justice and commits iniquity, I will place a stumbling block before him." As if He were saying openly: Because he was unwilling to see through repentance where he had already stumbled, I, abandoning him by just judgment, will cause him to stumble elsewhere as well. Yet this placing by the Lord is by no means to press him toward sinning, but to be unwilling to free him from sin; just as it is said of Pharaoh: "I will harden his heart." For the Lord does not harden the heart of the one sinning, but He is said to harden when He does not free from hardness. For the merciful God grants us time for repentance; but when we turn the patience of His grace toward an increase of guilt, that very time which He mercifully arranged for sparing us He turns more strictly toward striking us, so that when someone has been unwilling to return even after receiving a space of time, through this very thing he increases his evils to his condemnation, through which he could have washed them away if he had been willing to convert. Hence it is written: "Do you not know that the kindness of God leads you to repentance? But according to your hardness and impenitent heart, you are storing up wrath for yourself on the day of wrath and of the revelation of the just judgment of God." Therefore from the kindness of almighty God the reprobate stores up wrath for himself on the day of wrath, because while time is received for repenting and is used for sinning, he turns the very remedy of grace into an increase of guilt. Hence also almighty God, because He sees that the remedies He has bestowed are being drawn toward an increase of guilt, turns that very kindness which He bestowed into the strictness of judgment, so that afterward He may strike more heavily from the source whence He now waits more patiently. And because man is unwilling to abandon evil that he may live, he increases the means by which he may die. But whether the just man falls into guilt or the sinner into death, the watchman must fear lest the guilt of those sinning equally entangle him through his silence.
