44. Because the Psalmist says, Thou shalt wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow; [Ps. 51, 7] what do we understand by snow in this place, but the hearts of the Saints made white by the light of righteousness? But waters are taken up, and congealed above, in order to become snow. But when this snow descends to the earth, it is changed again into liquid waters. Waters therefore are the minds of preachers; which are confirmed in a higher sense of things, when they raise themselves to contemplate heavenly objects. And when they are hurried along in the consideration of lofty things, they receive the strength of confirmation. But because they are still retained on earth by love of the brethren, they bring themselves down from their lofty understanding, and preaching humbly to the weak, they melt like snow, and water their thirsty hearts. Snow then descends to the earth, when the lofty hearts of the Saints, which already feast on solid contemplation, condescend to humble words of preaching through love of the brethren. For as snow covers the ground, when it lies on it, but waters it, when it melts; so the virtue of the Saints protects the life of sinners by its strength with God, and by its condescension melts, as it were, and waters the thirsty earth, to bear fruits. And because water is first brought up from below, that it may afterwards be returned in showers from above; so do holy men, when placed on the lofty eminence of their virtues, consider from whence they are elevated, for fear of despising the meanness of othersâ€™ infirmity. Waters, then, return, as it were, to the earth from which they have been raised, when righteous men, condescending to sinners, cease not to remember what once they were. Paul had certainly been hitherto but water on the earth, when he knew the Law carnally. But when raised up to heavenly knowledge, he was converted into snow; because he changed his former feeble knowledge into the solidity of true wisdom; and yet, condescending to his brethren, he returned as snow to the earth. For even after his heights of virtue, he acknowledges how unworthy he was, saying, Who was before a blasphemer and a persecutor, &e. [1 Tim. 1, 13] Behold how considerately he calls to mind his own weakness, so as to bear with equanimity the weaknesses of others. For Paul returned, as water, after being in heaven, to the earth from which it had been taken, when, after the great secrets of his contemplation, he called to mind that he was a sinner, in order that he might benefit sinners by his humility. Let us see therefore how this water, which is to be turned into solid snow, is drawn up to its highest level. He says, Whether we be beside ourselves, it is to God. [2 Cor. 5, 13] Let us see how the snow returns to the ground, to water it, while melting. He says, Or whether ice be sober, it is for your cause. [ibid.] Let us see with what hand it is guided, and can be raised up, when low, and be brought back again when raised up. He says, For the love of Christ constraineth us. [ibid. 14] Because therefore the love of Christ, which raises the minds of Saints to heavenly things, shapes them by its considerate control even to humble condescension, for the love of the brethren, it is rightly said, Who ordereth the snow to descend on the earth. Where it is also fitly subjoined, And the rains of the winter, and the shower of His strength.
45. For this present life is indeed winter: in which though hope even now raises us up to things above, yet the cold torpor of our mortality still binds us. Because it is written, The corruptible body weigheth down the soul, and the earthly habitation presseth down the sense that museth on many things. [Wisd. 9, 15] But this winter has rains, which are doubtless the preachings of rulers. Of which rains it is in truth said by Moses, Let my speech be expected as the rain, and my words descend as the dew. [Deut. 32, 2] These rains doubtless are suited to the winter, and will cease in the summer; because now that the heavenly life is hidden from the eyes of the carnal, it is necessary for dew to be poured on us by the preachings of holy men. But when the heat of eternal judgment has glowed, no one will then find the words of preachers necessary. Because every one is brought back to his own conscience, on the coming of the Judge, so as to understand what is holy, when he cannot any longer perform it, and to learn from the punishment of his perverseness the right which he ought to have pursued. Whence it is well said by the Prophet, Gather them together as a flock for a sacrifice, and sanctify them in the day of slaughter. [Jer. 12, 3] For the reprobate are sanctified in the day of slaughter: for they then perceive the holiness, which they ought to have pursued, when they cannot now avoid the punishments which their depravity deserves. But since holy preaching will cease with this present life, that is the rains with the winter; to the soul which is departing, and hastening to the summer regions of eternal happiness, it is rightly said by the voice of the Bridegroom persuading it; Arise, haste, my beloved, my fair one, and come: for the winter hath past, the rain hath passed and is gone. [Cant. 2, 10. 11.] For as the winter passes away, the rain departs: because when the present life is over, in which the torpor of the corruptible flesh had surrounded us with a mist of ignorance, all the ministry of preaching ceases. For we shall then behold that more clearly with our own eyes, which we now hear more obscurely by the voices of the Saints. The Lord therefore orders the snow, and the rains of the winter, to descend on the earth, while He humbles the hearts of the Saints to the ministry of preaching, for the correction of sinners, by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit. Where it is rightly added, And the shower of His strength.
46. For the shower of the strength of God, is the preaching His Godhead; for the shower of His weakness is the preaching His Manhood, of which it is said by Paul, The weakness of God is stronger than men. [1 Cor. 1, 25] And again, Though He was crucified through weakness, yet He liveth by the power of God. [2 Cor. 13, 4] But holy men so preach the weakness of His Manhood, as to pour also into the hearts of their hearers the strength of His Godhead. Let us hear, through the thunder of the cloud, the shower of His strength; In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. [John 1, 1] Let us hear also the shower of His weakness; The Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us. [ibid. 14] Let us hear the shower of His strength; All things were made by Him, and without Him was not any thing made that was made. What was made in Him was life. [ibid. 3] Let us hear also the shower of His weakness; He came unto His own, and His own received Him not. [ibid. 11] He commands therefore the shower of His strength to descend on the earth, because He so preaches to us the weaknesses of His Manhood by the voices of His Saints, as to make known to us also the wonders and the strength of His Godhead. But when we hear the power of our Maker, we are immediately brought back to our own hearts by the compulsion of fear, and, considering that so great a Judge is over us, we examine what we have done (worthily, and what) [Mss. vary.] unworthily.
