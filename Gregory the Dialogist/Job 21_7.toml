45.  For except the patience of God bore with them, they would never live long in their sins.  For they are ‘lifted up by riches,’ when they first begin to be powerful, but they are ‘strengthened,’ when they are permitted to continue long in this life.  Since those whose substance uplifts them, length of days strengthens in the pride of their power.  Or surely they are said to be lifted up and strengthened, in that they are ‘lifted up’ by honours, ‘strengthened’ by substance.  But there are very many, who while they are both ‘lifted up’ by honours and ‘strengthened’ by riches, are vouchsafed the things which they covet in this life, but deprived of the succession of children.  To these their very power is punishment, when they see themselves possessed of a large inheritance, but not possessed of heirs to whom they may leave it.  What good then, if every thing be forthcoming, but children be wanting who may become their heirs?
