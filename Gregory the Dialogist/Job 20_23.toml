29.  The Lord ‘rains His war’ upon this hypocrite, when he smites his deeds with the swords of His judgments.  Thus for God to ‘rain war,’ is His pressing hard to destruction the life of the wicked man by His strict sentences from on high.  God ‘raining war’ is His smiting the hearts that are lifted up against Himself, and His wounding the blasted soul with the darts of His judgments, as with a kind of thickening drops of rain, that when he is now carried off to judgment, one while he should remind himself how he coveted wickedly, and more wickedly set himself to heap together the things he coveted, at another time grieve that he is parted from the things thus heaped together, and one day feel the very fire of retribution, which, that he might not live well, he was too indifferent to foresee.
