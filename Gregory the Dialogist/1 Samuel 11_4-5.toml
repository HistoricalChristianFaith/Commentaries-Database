6. Gibeah, as we have already said above, is interpreted as "lofty." And because the height of merits is not equal among all the elect, messengers are said to have come to Saul at Gibeah, so that we may be taught by spiritual meaning that when we are driven by powerful temptations, we should have recourse to the counsels of our preachers. But we are also instructed by the affliction of the weeping people, so that we may be joined to the needs of our brothers by inward compassion of mind. Now Saul saw the people weeping and asked for what reason they wept, because the chosen teacher makes the need of his subjects his own through compassion, and desires to relieve it. Indeed, he came from the field, because he goes forth from the secret place of his fertile heart. He came from the field in the morning, because in the rising splendor of the true light he inquires into the concerns of his subjects. And he follows the oxen, because strong affections of charity go before him. For he has, as it were, two oxen before him, because he is both joined to his neighbors through love and inflamed with divine charity, and therefore loves his neighbor in right order, because the love of God powerfully kindles him. Wherefore the Lord also says through Moses: "You shall not plow with an ox and a donkey together" (Deut. 22:10). For the donkey is carnal love, because he who carries those he loves is like a strong animal; and because he loves the same ones inordinately, not for God's sake, it is a wanton one. Therefore one cannot plow with an ox and a donkey, because the soul is not cultivated with the fruit of eternal reward if the purity of love by which it is joined to God is defiled by disordered love of neighbor. Saul, then, coming from the field, follows the oxen, because the chosen teacher retains both affections of charity whole in his fruitful heart, from which he can prepare for himself abundant fruits of eternal recompense. And he comes in the morning, because when he goes out to his subjects, he opens the day of his virtue. But now, having learned the needs of the people, let us hear what he did. For the text continues: (Ibid., and verses 6, 7.) And they told him the words of the men of Jabesh. And the Spirit of the Lord rushed upon Saul when he heard these words, and his anger was kindled exceedingly. And taking both oxen, he cut them in pieces and sent them throughout all the borders of Israel by the hands of messengers, saying: Whoever does not come out and follow Saul and Samuel, so shall it be done to his oxen.
