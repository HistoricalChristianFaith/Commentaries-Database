42.  In this place, ‘the innocent’ is taken for the as yet imperfectly righteous, who, as yet but commencing in good ways, though he is not minded to do mischief to others, yet is not at all able himself to do things that are perfect; and because the hearts of the little ones, while they see the wicked flourishing in the present life, are set on fire with the brands of envy; (for a man the more envies others present good in proportion as he less despises it himself.  Since of that which cannot be possessed by all men all of it together, what this one has would be so much lacking [‘desit’ al. ‘defit,’ or ‘deficit’] to the other.)  Now ‘the innocent is kindled against the hypocrite,’ when even he who is not used to injure anyone, envies the glory of the dissembler.  But if in this passage the innocent means any one perfect in goodness, ‘the innocent is moved against the hypocrite;’ when he both sees him flourishing, and contemns him and all his flourishing, and by preaching the things that are right plainly says that he ought to be despised by others, the more in proportion as he sees him eagerly in quest of things, which cannot abide with him for long.
