For what does the name “the heavens” denote but this deeply heavenly life of those who preach, of whom the psalmist speaks, “The heavens declare the glory of God.” Thus the same persons are recorded to be the heavens, and the same to be the sun. Indeed they are the heavens, because they protect by praying for all; they are the sun, because they show the power of light by preaching. And so, as the “earth was shaken,” “the heavens were spread out.” For when Judea fed greedily on the violence of persecution, the Lord spread about the life of the apostles, so that all the Gentiles might acquaint themselves with them.… For what is denoted by the title of “the sea” but this world’s bitterness raging in the destruction of the righteous? The psalmist also speaks concerning this: “He gathers the waters of the sea together as in a skin.” For the Lord “gathers the water of the sea together as in a skin” as he disposes all things with wonderful governance. He restrains the carnal threats pent up in their hearts. Thus “the Lord treads upon the waves of the sea.” When the storms of persecution lift up themselves, they are dashed to pieces in astonishment at his miracles. Since he that brings down the swellings of humanity’s madness, as it were, treads the waters as they stand in a heap.
