Let us therefore despise whatever good we do; let no work of ours puff us up, let neither abundance of possessions nor glory exalt us. If we swell inwardly from any good things that abound to us, we are despised by God. On the contrary, the Psalmist says of the humble: "The Lord preserves the little ones." Because he calls the humble "little ones," after he brought forth this statement, he adds counsel; for as if we were asking what he himself would do about these things, he added: "I was humbled, and he delivered me."
