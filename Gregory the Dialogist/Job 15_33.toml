As often as we do alms after sin, we, as it were, pay a price for bad actions. Wherefore, the prophet says concerning him who does not do these things, “He will not give God his propitiation or the price of the redemption of the soul.” But sometimes the rich, being elated, oppress those below them and seize the things of another. Yet, in a certain way they give some things to others. And while they oppress multitudes, they sometimes render defensive support to particular persons; for the iniquities that they never abandon they seem to offer a price. But the price of alms then frees us from sins, when we lament and renounce things of which we are guilty. For he who is both always sinning, and, as it were, always bestowing alms, pays a price in vain, in that he does not redeem his soul, which he does not keep from evil habits. Hence it is now said, “Let him not believe, being vainly deceived, that he is to be redeemed with any price.” For the alms of the rich and proud person has no efficacy to redeem him, seeing that his robbery of the poor person committed simultaneously will not allow his alms to rise up before the eyes of God.… Very commonly we see persons that both lead wicked lives and attain to the very extreme of old age. How then is it said, “Before his days are fulfilled, he shall perish,” when, in the case of particular persons we often see that their limbs already fail from age, and yet their passions do not cease to carry out their wickedness? For there are some, who after losing their way in life, come to their senses, and with their conscience accusing them, they forsake their evil ways, alter their actions, resist their old wickedness, flee earthly courses and pursue heavenly aims. However, before they become firmly rooted in those holy aims, from deadness of mind they return to the things from which they began to pass sentence, and they fall back to the evil habits that they had determined to shun. For it often happens that for the profit of many, even holy people bow their necks to external actions and are busied with the governance of a people. The weak observing this, and from their former pride still within them, seeking to follow their example, they set themselves in outward ways of action. But in proportion, for they do not come to their actions well imbued with the things of the Spirit, and they execute them in a carnal manner. For until the heart is first confirmed in heavenly desires by long application and a habitual manner of living, when the heart is poured back again for the executing of things exterior, it is rooted out from all its standing in good practice. - "Morals on the Book of Job 12.57–59"

60.  It is to be observed that the Divine Word so speaks of this wicked man in general terms, that yet it comes down to his particular wickedness.  For he that on saying, His cluster shall be spoilt like a vine in the first flower, and like an olive casting its flower; directly adds, For the congregation of the hypocrite shall be barren, plainly makes it appear that in this wicked man it is against his hypocrisy that he passes sentence of condemnation.  Now we have to consider how it is that the hypocrite is ‘spoilt like a vine in the first flower, or like an olive casting its flower.’  If the vine in flowering be touched by excessive cold in an inequality of the weather, it forthwith makes it dry of all moistness of verdure.  And there are some, who after bad courses long to follow ways of holiness, but before that good desires are confirmed in them, as we have said, some piece of good fortune of the present life comes upon them, which entangles them with outward concerns, and whilst it withdraws their mind from the heat of interior love, as it were puts it out by cold, and whatever seemed to be shewing itself of the blossom of virtue in them, it kills.  For in earthly courses of action the mind grows very cold, if it be not yet by the interior gifts firmly settled.  Whence it follows that higher stations or exterior works, which are intended to be of use to the necessities of man, those persons should take upon them to put them in execution, who have skill to judge of them, and to force them to bow beneath themselves in the power of interior virtue.  For when any frail person is drawn away either to the post of government or to execute exterior employments, in proportion as he is as it were carried out of himself, he is rooted up, in that the tree, which does not first send roots deep below, is the sooner laid low by the impulse of the winds, if it lifts itself on high in its top; and is the more speedily brought down to the very lowest, in proportion as it grew higher in the air without roots.  But sometimes the vine in flower is dried, not by the cold but by the heat, and when it is touched by excessive heat, its flower being shed, the cluster is made to wither.  And it very often happens that they who do not come to good works with a right intention, when they see that they please their fellow-creatures, are the more vehemently inflamed to execute the same good works, anxiously set themselves to do what is calculated to please the eyes of men, and are as it were heated in a holy devotedness.  What then but heat in the time of the blossom has come upon these, whom the appetite of human applause has made bare of fruit?  Hence it is well added, And like the olive casting his flower.  For when the olive is in flower, If it be touched by an immoderate fog, it is bared of the fulness of fruit.  And as often as people that are entering on good works, begin to be extolled by, those that behold them, and to take delight in the commendations of themselves, there is caused a mist of the understanding in the thoughts, that they can now no longer discern with what intention they do a thing, and lose the fruit of practice as it were by the fog of applause.  Hence it is well said by Solomon, Let us get up early to the vineyards; let us see if the vines flower, if the blossoms bear fruit.  ‘The vines flower,’ when the minds of the faithful put forth good works; but they do not ‘bear fruit,’ if in what they may have purposed, they are disabled, from being overcome by certain erring practices.
61.  We have not then to look whether the vines flourish, but if the blossoms are strong for the bearing of fruit, in that it is not any thing to admire if a man begins good works, but it is much to be admired, if with a right intention he holds on in good works.  Whence it very often happens that if in good practice a right intention is not kept, even the very work itself which is supposed good is lost.  For we have often seen persons abandon the earthly things which they possessed, and henceforth seek nought transitory, and be mixed up with no jarrings for the sake of this life.  When then the believing mind exhibits this in itself, it is as if the olive put forth blossom, but when any of this sort begin to seek the glory of the world which they, had contemned, and to pant with insatiable desire after the earthly things which they appeared to have disdained, to give themselves to brawls, to seek out mischiefs upon their neighbours; then indeed the olive has cast her flower, which she put forth, in that she never brought to perfect works the beginnings of a good purpose.  But we are to bear in mind that such things are often happening to those who do not follow God with a pure and single aim.
