57.  For He so forsakes us that He guards us, and so guards us that by the permitted case of temptation, He shows us our state of weakness.  And he immediately went forth from before the face of the Lord, and by smiting him whom He had thus gotten he wounded him from the sole of his foot even to his crown.  Thus, viz. in that when he receives permission, beginning with the least, and reaching even to the greater points, he as it were rends and pierces all the body of the mind [corpus mentis] with the temptations which he brings upon it, yet he does not attain to the smiting of the soul [animam], in that deep at the bottom of all the thoughts of the heart, the interior purpose of our secret resolution holds out, in the midst of the very wounds of gratification which it receives, so that although the enjoyment may eat into the mind, yet it does not so bend the set intent of holy uprightness as to bring it to the very softness of consenting.  Yet it is our duty to cleanse the mere wounds of enjoyment themselves by the sharp treatment of penance, and if aught that is dissolute springs up in the heart to refine it with the chastening hand of rigorous severity.

29.  What fool even would believe that the Creator of all things was given up into ‘the hands of Satan?’  Yet who that is instructed by the Truth can be ignorant that of that very Satan all they are members who are Joined unto him by living frowardly?   Thus Pilate showed himself a member of him, who, even to the extremity of putting Him to death, knew not the Lord when He came for our Redemption.  The chief priests proved themselves to be his body, who strove to drive the world's Redeemer from the world, by persecuting Him even to the cross.  When then the Lord for our salvation gave Himself up to the hands of Satan's members, what else did He, but let loose that Satan's hand to rage against Himself, that by the very act whereby He Himself outwardly fell low, He might set us free both outwardly and inwardly.  If therefore the hand of Satan is taken for his power, He after the flesh bore the hand of him, whose power over the body He endured even to the spitting, the buffetting, the stripes, the cross, the lance; and hence when He cometh to His Passion He saith to Pilate, i.e. to the body of Satan, Thou couldest have no power at all against Me except it were given thee from above; [John 19, 11] and yet this power, which He had given to him against Himself without, He compelled to serve the end of His own interest within.  For Pilate, or Satan who was that Pilate's head, was held under the power of that One over Whom he had received power; in that being far above He had Himself ordained that which now condescending to an inferior condition He was undergoing from the persecutor, that though it arose from the evil mind of unbelievers, yet that very cruelty itself might also serve to the weal of all the Elect, and therefore He pitifully ordained all that within, which He suffered Himself to undergo thus foully without.  And it is hence that it is said of Him at the supper, Jesus knowing that the Father had given all things into His hands, and that He was come from God, and went to God; He riseth from supper, and laid aside His garments. [John 13, 3]  Behold how, when He was about to come into the hands of those that persecuted Him, He knew that those very persecutors even had been given into His own hand.  For He, Who knew that He had received all things, plainly held those very persons by whom He was held, that He should Himself inflict on Himself, for the purposes of mercy, whatsoever their permitted wickedness should cruelly devise against Him.  Let it then be said to him, Behold, he is in thine hand, in that when ravening thereafter he received permission to smite His flesh, yet unwittingly he rendered service to the Power of that Being.
30.  Now he is ordered to ‘save the life of the soul,’ not that he is forbidden to tempt it, but that he is convicted of being unable to overcome it.  For never, as we that are mere men are oftentimes shaken by the assault of temptation, was the soul of your Redeemer disordered by its urgency.  For though our enemy, being permitted, took Him up into an high mountain, though he promised that he would give Him the kingdoms of the earth, and though he showed Him stones as to be turned into bread, yet he had no power to shake by temptation the mind of the Mediator betwixt God and man.  For He so condescended to take all this upon Himself externally, that His mind, being still inwardly established in His Divine Nature, should remain unshaken.  And if He is at any time said to be troubled and to have groaned in the spirit, He did Himself in His Divine nature ordain how much He should in His Human nature be troubled, unchangeably ruling over all things, yet showing Himself subject to change in the satisfying of human frailty; and thus remaining at rest in Himself, He ordained whatsoever He did even with a troubled spirit for the setting forth of that human nature which He had taken upon Himself.
31.  But as, when we love aright, there is nothing among created things that we love better than the life of our soul, and like as we say that we love those as our soul toward whom we strive to express the weight of our love, it may be that by the life of His Soul [per animam], is represented the life [vita] of the Elect.  And while Satan is let loose to smite the Redeemer's flesh, he is debarred the soul, forasmuch as at the same time that he obtains His Body to inflict upon it the Passion, he loses the Elect from the claims of his power, And while That One's flesh suffers death by the Cross, the mind of these is stablished against assaults.  Let it then be said, Behold, he is in thine hand; but save his life.  As if he had heard in plain words, ‘Take permission against His Body, and lose thy right of wicked dominion over His Elect, whom foreknowing in Himself before the world began He holdeth for His own.’

6.  Here again, the safeguard of protection goes along with the permission to smite, and the dispensation of God both while guarding, forsakes his elect servant, and while forsaking, guards him.  A portion of him He gives over, a portion He protects.  For if he had left Job wholly in the hand of so dire a foe, what could have become of a mere man?  And so with the very justice of the permission there is mixed a certain measure of pity, that in one and the same contest, both His lowly servant might rise by oppression, and the towering enemy be brought down by the permission.  Thus the holy man is given over to the adversary's hand, but yet in his inmost soul he is held fast by the hand of his Helper.  For he was of the number of those sheep, concerning whom Truth itself said in the Gospel, Neither shall any man pluck them out of My hand. [John 10, 28]  And yet it is said to the enemy, when he demands him, Behold, he is in thine hand.  The same man then is at the same time in the hand of God, and in the hand of the devil.  For by saying, he is in thine hand, and straightway adding, but save his life, the pitiful Helper openly showed that His hand was upon him whom He yielded up, and that in giving He did not give him, whom, while He cast him forth, He at the same time hid from the darts of his adversary.
7.  But how is that it is said to Satan, but save his life [animam]?  For how does he keep safe, who is ever longing to break in upon things under safe keeping?  But Satan's saving is spoken of his not daring to break in, just as, conversely, we petition The Father in prayer, saying, Lead us not into temptation; [Matt. 6, 13] for neither does the Lord lead us into temptation, Who is ever mercifully shielding His servants there from.  Yet it is as it were for Him ‘to lead us into temptation,’ not to protect us from the allurements of temptation.  And He then as it were ‘leads us not into the snare of temptation,’ when He does not let us be tempted beyond what we are able to bear.  In like manner then as God is said to ‘lead us into temptation,’ if He suffers our adversary to lead us thereinto, so our adversary is said to ‘save our soul [animum, same as above],’ when he is stayed from overcoming it by his temptations.
