Behold, there comes to mind what the Jews said in mockery to the crucified Son of God: "If he is the King of Israel, let him come down from the cross, and we will believe him." If he had then come down from the cross, yielding to the mockers, he would not have demonstrated to us the virtue of patience. But he waited a little, endured the insults, bore the ridicule, preserved his patience, and deferred their amazement; and he who was unwilling to come down from the cross rose from the tomb. Therefore it was a greater thing to rise from the tomb than to come down from the cross. It was a greater thing to destroy death by rising than to preserve life by coming down. But when the Jews did not see him come down from the cross at their taunts, when they saw him dying, they believed they had conquered him; they rejoiced that they had, as it were, extinguished his name. But behold, from his death his name has grown throughout the world—that death by which the faithless crowd believed they had extinguished it; and the one whose killing they celebrated, they now grieve as dead, because they recognize that he has attained his glory through suffering.
