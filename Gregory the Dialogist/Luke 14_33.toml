Certainly when he set forth new commandments to those following him, he said: "Unless someone renounces all that he possesses, he cannot be my disciple." As if he were saying openly: You who through your old life covet what belongs to others, through the pursuit of a new way of life give away even your own things. But let us hear what he says in this reading: "Whoever wishes to come after me, let him deny himself." There it is said that we should deny our possessions; here it is said that we should deny ourselves. And perhaps it is not difficult for a person to leave behind his possessions, but it is very difficult to leave behind himself. For it is a lesser thing to deny what one has, but it is a very great thing to deny what one is.

To those coming to him, the Lord commanded that we renounce our possessions, because all of us who come to the contest of faith take up a struggle against evil spirits. But evil spirits possess nothing of their own in this world. Therefore we must wrestle naked against those who are naked. For if someone clothed wrestles with someone naked, he is thrown to the ground more quickly because he has something by which he can be seized. For what are all earthly things except certain garments of the body? Therefore, whoever hastens to the contest against the devil should cast off his garments lest he be overcome. Let him possess nothing in this world by loving it; let him seek no pleasures of passing things, lest where he is covered according to his wish, he be seized for his fall from that very thing.

Many of you, dearest brothers, knew Cassius, bishop of the city of Narni, whose custom it was to offer daily sacrifices to God, so that scarcely any day of his life passed without his immolating a victim of propitiation to almighty God. His life also greatly accorded with his sacrifice. For giving all that he had in alms, when the hour for offering the sacrifice came, as if flowing entirely in tears, he would slay himself with great contrition of heart. I learned of both his life and his death from a certain deacon of venerable life who had been raised by him. For he said that on a certain night the Lord appeared in a vision to his priest, saying: "Go and tell the bishop: Do what you are doing, work what you are working, let not your foot cease, let not your hand cease; on the birthday of the apostles you will come to me, and I will give you your reward." The priest arose, but because the birthday of the apostles was near at hand, he was afraid to announce to the bishop the day of his death being so close. On another night the Lord returned, vehemently rebuked his disobedience, and repeated the same words of his command. Then the priest arose to go, but again weakness of heart became an obstacle to revealing the vision; and he became hardened against going even after the repeated admonition of the command, and neglected to make known what he had seen. But because great kindness, when despised, is usually followed by greater wrath of vengeance, the Lord appearing in a third vision now added blows to words, and he was beaten with such severe stripes that the wounds of his body softened the hardness of his heart. Therefore, instructed by the beating, he arose and went to the bishop, and found him already standing according to custom near the tomb of the blessed martyr Juvenal to offer the sacrifice. He asked for privacy from those standing around, and prostrated himself at his feet. When the bishop could scarcely raise him up as he wept profusely, he endeavored to learn the causes of his tears. But he, about to relate the order of the vision, first let his garment slip from his shoulders and revealed the wounds of his body, witnesses, so to speak, of truth and of fault, showing with what severity of punishment the blows received had furrowed his limbs with inflicted bruises. As soon as the bishop saw these, he was horrified, and with voices of great astonishment inquired who had presumed to do such things to him. But he replied that he had suffered these things on his behalf. Amazement grew with terror; but now the priest, adding no more delays to his inquiry, opened the secret of the revelation, and narrated to him the words of the Lord's command as he had heard them, saying: "Do what you are doing, work what you are working, let not your hand cease, let not your foot cease; on the birthday of the apostles you will come to me, and I will give you your reward." When he heard these things, the bishop prostrated himself in prayer with great contrition of heart, and he who had come at the third hour to offer the sacrifice prolonged it until the ninth hour because of the greatness of his extended prayer. And from that day the gains of his piety increased more and more; and he became as strong in work as he was certain of the reward, since he had already begun, from that promise, to have as his debtor the one to whom he himself had been indebted. Now it had been his custom to come to Rome each year on the birthday of the apostles; but now, suspicious because of this revelation, he was unwilling to come according to custom. Therefore at that time he was anxious, and in the second and third years as well he was held in suspense in expectation of his death; similarly in the fourth, fifth, and sixth years. He might have despaired of the truth of the revelation, if the blows had not given credence to the words. But behold, in the seventh year he arrived unharmed at the sacred vigils of the awaited birthday; but a mild fever touched him during the vigils, and on the very birthday itself he declined to perform the solemnities of Mass for his children who awaited him. But they, because they were equally suspicious about his departure, all came to him together, binding themselves unanimously that they would by no means consent to the solemnities of Mass being celebrated on that day unless their same bishop approached the Lord as intercessor for them. Then he, compelled, celebrated Mass in the oratory of the episcopal residence, and with his own hand gave the Lord's body and peace to all. When the entire ministry of the offered sacrifice was completed, he returned to his bed, and lying there, when he saw his priests and ministers standing around him, as if saying a last farewell, he admonished them about preserving the bond of charity, and proclaimed with what great concord they ought to be united among themselves. When suddenly, in the midst of those very words of holy exhortation, he cried out in a terrible voice, saying: "The hour has come." And immediately he gave to those assisting him with his own hands the linen cloth, which according to the custom for the dying was to be stretched over his face. When it was stretched out, he gave up his spirit, and thus that holy soul, arriving at eternal joys, was released from the corruption of the flesh. Whom, dearest brothers, whom did this man imitate in his death, if not him whom he had contemplated in his life? For saying "The hour has come," he departed from the body, because Jesus also, when all things were accomplished, when he had said "It is finished," bowing his head, gave up his spirit. What therefore the Lord did by his power, the servant did by his calling.

Behold how that embassy sent with daily sacrifices, almsgiving, and tears made so great a peace of grace with the coming King. Therefore let him who can abandon all things. But he who cannot abandon all things, while the King is still far off, let him send an embassy, let him offer the gifts of tears, alms, and sacrifices. For He who knows that He cannot be endured when angry wishes to be appeased by prayers. The reason He still delays His coming is that He awaits an embassy of peace. For He would have come already if He wished, and would have slain all His adversaries. But He both indicates how terrible He will be when He comes, and yet delays His coming, because He does not wish to find any whom He must punish. He announces to us the guilt of our contempt, saying: "So therefore, every one of you who does not renounce all that he possesses cannot be my disciple"; and yet He bestows the remedy of hoped-for salvation, because He who cannot be endured in His wrath wishes to be appeased through an embassy seeking peace. Wash therefore, dearest brothers, the stains of your sins with tears, wipe them away with alms, cleanse them with holy sacrifices. Do not possess through desire what you have not yet abandoned in practice. Fix your hope in the Redeemer alone, pass over in mind to the eternal homeland. For if you no longer possess anything in this world through love, you have abandoned all things even while possessing them.
