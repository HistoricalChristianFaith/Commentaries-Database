The fact that the disciples were slow to believe in the Lord's resurrection was not so much their weakness as, so to speak, our future strength. For the resurrection itself was demonstrated to them through many proofs while they doubted: and when we recognize these things as we read them, what else happens but that we are strengthened by their doubt? For Mary Magdalene, who believed more quickly, did less for me than Thomas, who doubted for a long time. For by doubting he touched the scars of the wounds, and cut away the wound of doubt from our hearts.

To establish the truth of the Lord's resurrection, we should also note what Luke reports, saying: "Eating together with them, he commanded them not to depart from Jerusalem." And a little later: "While they were watching, he was lifted up, and a cloud received him from their sight." Note the words, mark the mysteries. Eating together he was lifted up. He ate, and he ascended, so that through the act of eating the truth of his flesh might be made evident.

Mark, however, recalls that before the Lord ascended to heaven, he rebuked the disciples for their hardness of heart and unbelief. In this matter, what should be considered except that the Lord rebuked the disciples at that time when he was leaving them bodily, so that the words he spoke as he departed might remain more deeply impressed upon the hearts of his hearers?
