“Set your face toward it and let it be in a state of siege.” What does it mean to set the face toward Jerusalem that is portrayed on a brick, except that the master should not reveal the vision of heavenly peace or show himself too forgiving or merciful toward a soul if he sees it still uncertain in its deeds? For thus it is written: “Do you have daughters? Be concerned for their chastity, and do not show yourself too indulgent with them.” Evil souls that are inclined toward worldly desires are sometimes better served through severity. A fixed gaze accompanied by severe vigilance that offers no hope for any frivolous indulgence frightens the wayward soul and rigorously pulls it away from any enticement toward vice. But even as a master does this, he must always preserve in his heart tenderness and humility toward him in so far as he must have a great deal of love for the individual and should never use his position of authority against him through pride. Nevertheless, he still must refrain from revealing his love and tender regard for the individual’s own good.
