Again he says, “Watchman, what of the night? Watchman, what of the night? The watchman said, ‘The morning comes, and also the night.’ ” For “the watchman came by night,” in that the guardian of the human race even showed himself manifest in the flesh, and yet Judea, being close pressed by the darkness of its faithlessness, never knew him. Where it is well added in the voice of the watchman, “The morning comes, and also the night.” For by his presence has a new light shone out upon the world, and yet the former darkness remained in the hearts of unbelievers. And it is well said, “They shall grope in the noonday as in the night,” for we search out by groping that which we do not see with our eyes. Now the Jews had seen his undisguised miracles, and yet they still went on seeking him, as it were groping for him, when they said, “How long do you make us to doubt? If you be the Christ, tell us plainly.” See, the light of miracles was before their eyes, yet stumbling in the darkness of their own hearts, they continued to grope in seeking for him.”
