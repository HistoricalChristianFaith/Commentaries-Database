All who are perfect do not cease to marvel at the power and wisdom of almighty God in all things that have been made or are being made. Hence the Psalmist too, pressing on with divine praises, says: "God is wonderful in His saints; the God of Israel Himself will give power and strength to His people; blessed be God" (Ps. 67:36). Hence Moses confesses to the same Lord, saying: "Who is like You among the gods, O Lord? Who is like You, glorious among the saints, wonderful in majesty, working wonders?" (Exod. 15:11). He is indeed called wonderful in His saints because the more loftily they behold divine things, the more wondrously they are struck with amazement, for assuredly in the highest contemplation they see things at which they marvel, not things they can comprehend by reason. Therefore, whenever certain new things occur beyond ordinary experience that carnal and simple people wonder at, a miracle is said to happen among the fields. For in comparison with the saints, they are like rustic people who do not know how to marvel at so many ancient works of the Creator, so many arrangements of times, and so many orders of creatures. Rightly, then, all are generally included under that same dullness of rusticity, when it is added: (Verse 15.) "But also all the people of their garrison who had gone out to plunder were struck with astonishment."

What garrison do they call, if not that of the Philistines? What is it then that the Philistines marvel at, except that sometimes other sinners, astonished, behold the conversion of sinners, and while they recognize the goodness of God in their visitation, they are kindled to a similar resolve of conversion? For the people of the garrison go out to plunder when they do not fear to act perversely. For what anyone dares to do while God forbids it, while the Scriptures threaten, while teachers oppose it, he strives as if by violence to seize for his own uses. If anyone wishes to understand demons by this people, he may, because they go out to plunder when they bring violent temptations and lead captive the souls of sinners. This people is certainly said to be astonished, because they do not understand by what grace converted sinners receive a penitent heart, which demons cannot possess. But while sinners come to their senses, they benefit both themselves and others, because many are corrected by their example. Whence it is also added: (Verse 15.) And the earth was shaken.

While common men behold new wonders, the earth is disturbed, because it often happens that while some are converted through outward miracles, the hardness of others is moved by certain incentives toward the purpose of good work. For the earth is badly tranquil when the life of carnal men lies secure in the pleasures of the world, when the perishable things which it ardently desires sweetly delight it. But the earth is truly disturbed when the carnal mind is shaken from its evil firmness, and begins to think in a wavering manner, between the evils which it rejects and the goods which it loves. For to be disturbed is then for the mind to cloud over the serenity of evil pleasure with the purpose of Christian religion. But carnal affection is shaken so that spiritual life may be revealed. Whence it is also added: (Ver. 15.) And it happens as a miracle from God.

For when the mind of man is weighed down by carnal delight, its vision is certainly dulled, so that it deserves to remain ignorant of spiritual goods. But when it begins to grow weak in its carnal things, it gradually grows strong in spiritual things, so that by advancing it sees heavenly things, and by forgetting it leaves behind what is weak. Indeed, the progress of a converted mind is shown, because first the earth is said to be disturbed, then the miracle is recorded as having come about as if from God. A miracle truly from God is what God does without man. For when the Lord rained manna in the desert for the children of Israel (Exod. 16), when He provided birds to those who desired them (Exod. 14), God certainly performed a miracle without man; but when He wished to divide the sea, He commanded Moses to touch it with a rod, so that He might display a miracle which He would demonstrate to the people through a man. So indeed the rock is struck with a rod so that streams of water might be brought forth (Num. 20), because the miracle He wished to display He performed through a man, not by Himself, so that by rendering the man venerable, the Israelite people would have been bound to submit humbly to him and obey devoutly. What then does it mean that the miracle is asserted to have come about as if from God after the earth is disturbed, unless that when the Holy Spirit moves the mind to conversion, He introduces to the stirred mind the examples of the elect, which it may both regard with reverence and devoutly desire to imitate? This miracle is indeed understood according to the historical sense as meaning that many were slain. But now in the holy Church sinners are converted to the religious life, and others follow them as examples of virtue. The Holy Spirit indeed draws them, and because they are drawn He shows them to others, so that He may draw those who have been drawn, and insert those who see into the company of the drawn, so that through the generosity of His grace He may encompass both. For when He works this in the hearts of the faithful without man, by Himself, the miracle certainly does not come about as if from God, but from God. But when He accomplishes this through the preaching of doctors of eternal life, the miracle is as if from God, because He displays His wondrous ministers so that those who behold them may be able to imitate them devoutly.
