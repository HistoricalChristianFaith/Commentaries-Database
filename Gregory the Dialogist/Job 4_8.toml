35.  To ‘sow griefs’ is to utter deceits, but to ‘reap griefs’ is to prevail by so speaking.  Or, surely, they ‘sow griefs,’ who do froward actions, they ‘reap griefs,’ when they ate punished for this forwardness.  For the harvest of grief is the recompense of condemnation, and whereas it is immediately introduced that they that ‘sow and reap griefs,’ ‘perish by the blast of God,’ and are ‘consumed by the breath of His nostrils,’ in this passage the ‘reaping of grief’ is shown to be not punishment as yet, but the still further perfecting of wickedness, for in ‘the breath of His nostrils’ the punishment of that ‘reaping’ is made to follow.  Here then they ‘sow and reap griefs,’ in that all that they do is wicked, and they thrive in that very wickedness, as is said of the wicked man by the Psalmist, His ways are always grievous; Thy judgments are far above out of his sight: as for all his enemies, he puffeth at them. [Ps. 10, 5]  And it is soon after added concerning him, under his tongue is labour and grief.  So then he ‘sows griefs,’ when he does wicked things, he ‘reaps griefs,’ when from the same wickednesses he grows to temporal greatness.  How then is it that they ‘perish by the blast of God,’ who are for the most part permitted to abide long here below, and in greater prosperity than the righteous?  For hence it is said of them again by the Psalmist, They are not in trouble as other men, neither are they plagued like other folk. [Ps. 73, 5]  Hence Jeremiah saith, Wherefore doth the way of the wicked prosper? [Jer. 12, 1]  For because, as it is written, For the Lord is [Vulg.] a long-suffering rewarder [Ecclus. 5, 4], He oftentimes for long bears with those, whom He condemns for all eternity.  Yet sometimes He strikes quickly, in that He hastens to the succour of the pusillanimity of the innocent.  Therefore Almighty God sometimes permits the wicked to have their own way for long, that the ways of the righteous may be more purely cleansed.  Yet sometimes He slays the unrighteous with speedy destruction, and by their ruin He strengthens the hearts of the innocent.  For if He were now to smite all that do evil, on whom would He yet have to show forth the final Judgment?  And if He never at any time smote any man, who would ever have believed that God regarded human affairs?  Sometimes then He strikes the bad, that He may show that He does not leave wickedness unpunished.  But sometimes He bears with the wicked for long, that He may teach the heedful what judgment they are reserved for.
36.  Thus this sentence of the cutting off of the wicked, if it be not spoken of all men in general at the end of this present state of being, is undoubtedly to a great degree made void of the force of truth; but it will then be true, when iniquity shall no longer have reprieve.  And perchance it may be more lightly taken in this sense, since neither ‘the innocent perishes’ nor ‘the upright is cut off,’ in that though here he is worn out in the flesh, yet in the sight of the eternal Judge he is renewed with true health.  And they that ‘sow and reap griefs,’ ‘perish by the blast of God,’ in that in proportion as they go on here deeper in doing wickedly, they are the more severely stricken with the damnation to follow.  But whereas he premises this sentence with the word, Remember, it is clearly evident that something past is recalled to mind, and not any thing future proclaimed.  Then therefore Eliphaz would have spoken more truly, if he had believed that these things were wrought on the head of the wicked in general by final vengeance.
37.  But this point, that God is said to ‘breathe,’ claims to be more particularly made out.  For we, when we ‘breathe,’ draw the air from the outside within us, and, thus drawn within, we give it forth without.  God then is said to ‘breathe’ in recompensing vengeance, in that from occasions without He conceives the purpose of judgment within Him, and from the internal purpose sends forth the sentence without.  When God ‘breathes’ as it were, somewhat is drawn in from things without, when He sees our evil ways without, and ordains judgment within.  And again as if by God ‘breathing,’ the breath is sent forth from within, when from the internal conception of the purpose, the outward decree of condemnation is delivered.  And so it is rightly said that they, that ‘sow griefs,’ perish ‘by the breath of God,’ for wherein they execute wicked deeds outwardly, they are deservedly stricken from within.  Or, surely, when God is said to  ‘breathe,’ in that the breath of His wrath is immediately introduced, by the designation of His ‘breathing’ may be denoted that very visitation of His.  For when we are wroth, we kindle [d] with the breath of rage.  To show the Lord then meditating vengeance, He is said to ‘breathe’ in His indignation, not that in His own Nature He is capable of turning or change, but that after long endurance, when He executes vengeance upon the sinner, He, Who continueth tranquil in Himself, seems in commotion to them that perish.  For whereas the condemned soul sees the Judge arrayed against its doings, He is exhibited to it as troubled, in that it is itself troubled by its own guiltiness before His eyes.  But after he had in appearance exhorted him with clemency.
