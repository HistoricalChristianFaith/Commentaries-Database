(Hom. xxiv.) It may be asked, why after His resurrection He stood on the shore to receive the disciples, whereas before He walked on the sea? The sea signifies the world, which is tossed about with various causes of tumults, and the waves of this corruptible life; the shore by its solidity figures the rest eternal. The disciples then, inasmuch as they were still upon the waves of this mortal life, were labouring on the sea; but the Redeemer having by His resurrection thrown off the corruption of the flesh, stood upon the shore.

It can also be asked why, when the disciples were laboring on the sea, the Lord stood on the shore after His resurrection, though before His resurrection He had walked on the waves of the sea before His disciples. The reason for this matter is quickly understood if the cause that was then present is considered. For what does the sea signify except the present age, which dashes itself against the tumults of affairs and the waves of corruptible life? What is figured by the solidity of the shore except that perpetuity of eternal rest? Because the disciples were still amid the waves of mortal life, they were laboring on the sea. But because our Redeemer had already passed beyond the corruption of the flesh, after His resurrection He was standing on the shore. As if He were speaking the very mystery of His resurrection to His disciples through these things, saying: I no longer appear to you on the sea, because I am not with you in the waves of disturbance. Hence it is that in another place after His resurrection He says to these same disciples: "These are the words which I spoke to you while I was still with you." For He was not absent from those to whom He appeared bodily present, yet He denies that He is still with them, from whose mortal body He was separated by the immortality of His flesh. What He there, while placed with them, confesses—that He is not with them—this He also indicates here by the position of His body, when, while they are still sailing, He shows Himself to be already on the shore.
