For in sacred language teachers are sometimes called prophets in that, by pointing out how fleeting are present things, they make manifest the things that are to come. And such the divine discourse convinces of seeing false things, because, while fearing to reprove faults, they vainly flatter evildoers by promising security; neither do they at all dissolve the iniquity of sinners, since they refrain their voice from chiding. For the language of reproof is the key of discovery, because by chiding it discloses the fault of which even he who has committed it is often unaware. Hence Paul says, “That he may be able by sound doctrine even to convince the gainsayers.” Hence through Malachi it is said, “The priest’s lips keep knowledge, and they shall seek the law at his mouth.” Hence through Isaiah the Lord admonishes, saying, “Cry aloud to spare not, lift up your voice like a trumpet.” For it is true that whosoever enters on the priesthood undertakes the office of a herald, so to walk, himself crying aloud, before the coming of the judge who follows terribly.
