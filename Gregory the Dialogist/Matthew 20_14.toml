Hence the same householder says: "I wish to give to this last one even as to you." And because the very reception of the kingdom is the goodness of His will, He rightly adds: "Or is it not lawful for me to do what I wish?" For it is a foolish complaint of man against the kindness of God. For there would be no cause for complaint if He does not give what He does not owe, but only if He did not give what He owed.
