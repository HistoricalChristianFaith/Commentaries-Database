7. What do we say in these words, except that the weaknesses of the saints, and those things which seem carnal, are not weak and carnal, but spiritual and mighty? For we are accustomed to rebuke excessive anger in religious men, but behold, before Saul could become exceedingly angry, the Spirit of the Lord first rushed upon him. How fearful, then, the anger of the saints must be, we perceive, if we consider the Spirit of the Lord rushing upon them—if, while we observe them outwardly angry, we equally attend to the Spirit stirring them within. Therefore, as often as we are corrected by the zeal of our superiors, we may rightly tremble greatly under their indignation, if we believe their impulse to be a movement of the Holy Spirit. And because Saul cut both oxen into pieces, sent them throughout all the borders of Israel, and put forth threats that thus it would be done to the oxen of all who refused to follow him and Samuel—what else does this suggest, except that those who are more sluggish in providing aid to their neighbors must not only be invited, but compelled? Whence it is also immediately added: (Verse 7.) 'Therefore the fear of the Lord fell upon the people, and they came out as one man.'

8. For since we are commanded to love our neighbors as ourselves, we offer them assistance in right order when we are not compelled by fear to render these services, but are prompted by love. But when we lose the effect of this owed love, it pertains to the zeal of our preachers that we rise up to help our brothers out of fear. Therefore it is well said: "The fear of the Lord fell upon the people, and they went out as one man," because we are often lukewarm in love of our neighbors; but we are raised up to a state of devotion by the threats of our prelates, and we undertake a good work out of fear, yet from the beginning of fear we are led to the bond of great charity. Hence it is well said that fear fell upon the people, yet all are reported to have gone out as one man. For many cannot go out as one man unless they ascend to an equal unity of love. For hence it is also said of the perfect disciples of the Redeemer: "They were of one heart and one soul" (Acts 4:32). There follows: (Verse 8.) And he numbered them in Bezek; and the children of Israel were three hundred thousand, and the men of Judah thirty thousand.
