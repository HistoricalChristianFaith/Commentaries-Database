But because a comparison has been given concerning the construction of a building, now a similitude is added from lesser to greater, so that greater things may be weighed from the smallest matters. For it follows: "Or what king, going to wage war against another king, does not first sit down and consider whether he is able with ten thousand to meet him who comes against him with twenty thousand? Otherwise, while the other is still far away, he sends an embassy and asks for terms of peace." A king comes to battle against another king on equal terms, and yet if he perceives that he cannot be sufficient, he sends an embassy and seeks terms of peace. With what tears, then, ought we to hope for pardon, we who in that dreadful judgment do not come to trial on equal terms with our King, whom our condition, weakness, and cause show to be inferior?

But perhaps we have already cut off the faults of evil works, we already outwardly avoid all wicked things; yet are we sufficient to render an account of our thoughts? For he is said to come with twenty thousand against whom he who comes with ten thousand is by no means sufficient. Ten thousand to twenty thousand is indeed as one to two. But if we make much progress, we barely keep our outward works in righteousness. For even if the lust of the flesh has been cut off, nevertheless it has not yet been cut off completely from the heart. But he who comes to judge examines both outward and inward things together, weighs deeds and thoughts equally. Therefore he comes with a double army against a single one, who examines us, scarcely prepared in works alone, concerning both our works and our thoughts at once.
