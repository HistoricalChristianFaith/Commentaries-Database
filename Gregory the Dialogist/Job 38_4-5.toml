In the holy Scriptures the foundations represent the preachers. The Lord first put them in the church, and on them the structure of the building was developed. That is the reason why the priest, by entering the tabernacle, had to wear twelve stones on his breast, because our high priest, who offers himself for us, giving us from the beginning firm preachers, wore twelve stones under his head in the upper part of his body. And so the holy apostles are the stones that constitute the main ornament of the breast and are the foundations that make the building firm on the ground.â€¦ When holy Scripture does not speak of different foundations but of a single foundation, it refers to the Lord himself, who supports our weak and fickle hearts with the power of his divinity.
