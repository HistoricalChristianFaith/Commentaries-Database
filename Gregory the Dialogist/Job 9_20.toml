If I desire to justify myself; mine own, mouth shall condemn me; if I say I am perfect, it shall also prove me perverse.

As if it were in plain words; 'Why should I speak about others, when I cannot bear testimony concerning myself?' But whereas thou art not competent to witness to thine own innocency, dost thou know the fact that thou art innocent?
