These scales of sinners are both hardened and joined together, so as not to be penetrated by any breath of life from the mouth of preachers. For those whom a similar guilt associates with one another, the same perverse defensiveness crowds them together in obstinate agreement, in order that they may protect each other with mutual defense for their sins. For everyone fears for himself when he beholds another admonished or corrected. Therefore, he arises with similar defensiveness against the words of those who reprove, because, in protecting another, he protects himself. It is thus well said, “One is so near to another that no air can come between them,” because while they mutually shield each other in their iniquities by their proud defense, they do not permit the breath of holy exhortation to reach them in any way. He added more plainly to their deadly agreement by saying, “They are joined one to another; they clasp each other and cannot be separated.” For they who might be corrected if divided, persevere when united in the obstinacy of their iniquity. They are day by day the more easily separable from the knowledge of righteousness, the more they are not mutually separated from each other by any reproach.
