31.  For what was to follow he saw as present in Him, Whom neither things future come to, nor things past go from; but all things are present at once and together before His eyes.  And because the very things that were to come he saw were part in works and part in words, it is rightly said, All this mine eye hath seen, mine ear hath heard.  But words are without use, if they lack the understanding of them.  Whence it is fitly added, And I have understood every whit.  For when any thing is shewn or heard, if the understanding of it be not bestowed, it is little of a prophecy.  Thus Pharaoh saw in a dream things that were to come upon Egypt, but, because he could not understand what he saw, he was no prophet.  King Balthasar ‘saw the fingers of the hand that wrote’ upon the wall; but he was no prophet, because he did not attain to the understanding of that thing which he saw.  Therefore, that blessed Job might testify that he had the spirit of prophecy, he declares not only that he had ‘seen and heard,’ but also that he had ‘understood all this.’  And that he is not elated on the grounds of such understanding, his words subjoined bear witness.
