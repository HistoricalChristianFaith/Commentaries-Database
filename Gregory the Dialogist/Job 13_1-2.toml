For Job saw what was to follow as present in him; it was not as if future things came to Job or things from the past; but all things are present at once and together before his eyes. And because he saw the very things that were to come were in part works and in part words, it is rightly said, “My eye has seen and my ear has heard all this.” However, words are without use if those who use them do not understand them. Hence it is fitly added, “And I have understood it.” For if something is shown or heard but the understanding of it is not bestowed, it is insignificant as prophecy. Thus Pharaoh saw in a dream things that were to come upon Egypt, but because he could not understand what he saw, he was no prophet. King Belshazzar “saw the fingers of the hand that wrote” on the wall, but he was no prophet, because he did not attain to the understanding of that which he saw. Therefore, in order that blessed Job might testify that he had the spirit of prophecy, he declares not only that he had “seen and heard” but also that he had “understood all this.” Yet Job is not elated on the grounds of such understanding; his appended words bear witness when he says, “What you know, I also know; I am not inferior to you.” By these same words, he made known what exceeding humility he had, who says that he was “not inferior” to them. Job by far surpassed them in holiness of life. For he proves that “what they knew he knew,” who by knowing all things of heaven transcended their earthly thoughts through the spirit of prophecy.
