And there are some who do not think that the wearing of fine and costly garments is a sin. But if indeed it were not a fault, the Word of God would never so carefully express that the rich man who is tormented in hell had been clothed in fine linen and purple. For no one seeks exceptional garments except for vainglory, that is, to appear more honorable than others. For the thing itself testifies that more costly clothing is sought only for empty glory, because no one wishes to be clothed in precious garments where he cannot be seen by others. We can better understand this fault also from the opposite: for if the lowliness of cheap clothing were not a virtue, the evangelist would not carefully say of John: "He was clothed with camel's hair."
