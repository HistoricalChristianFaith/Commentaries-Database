27.  The minds of the lost are ever awake to evil imaginations, but very often the Providence above counteracts them, and though not even when they are crushed with adversities do they amend the wickedness of their counsel, yet that they may never prevail against the good, He puts a check upon their power.  And against these it is brought to pass by marvellous retribution, that whilst the effect of their evil doing is lacking to them, still conscience gives them over convicted to the just sentence of the Judge.  Whereas then they devise evil things, they show what they themselves are about; but, whereas they cannot ‘perform their enterprize,’ they, against whom it was imagined, are protected.
