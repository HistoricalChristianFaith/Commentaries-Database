63.  For they had imagined him a wicked man, whom they saw, his substance gone, in a temporal way ruined.  But the holy man judges them with a lofty review in proportion as amidst the losses which he had met with, he was standing with undiminished uprightness.  For how had his losses of substance without hurt him, who had not lost That Being, Whom he loved within?
64.  But this that is said, They shall lie down alike in the dust, and the worms shall cover them, if anyone wish to take in the way of allegory, we may shortly accomplish [see cap. xvi. of this Book.] it, if what has been already said concerning this bad rich man, we repeat again.  Thus it is said, His inwards are full of fatness, and his bones are moistened with marrow. [v. 30.]  For as ‘fat’ arises from much food, so does pride from abundance of goods, which fattens his mind in his riches, while his spirit is lifted up in his proud behaving.  For the pride of the heart is like a kind of richness of fat.  Whence, because very many commit sins from abundance, it is said by the Prophet, Their iniquity has come out as it were from fatness. [Ps. 73, 7]  It follows, And his bones are moistened with marrow.  The lovers of this life have ‘bones’ as it were, when in this world they possess the strong stay of dignities.  But if in the outward dignity there lack earthly private wealth, as to their judgment they have ‘bones’ indeed, but ‘marrow’ in the bones they have not.  Whereas then that lover of this world is so stayed up by outward power that he is likewise at the same time stuffed to the full with the inward abundance of his earthly house, it is said, And his bones are moistened with marrow.  Or otherwise the ‘bones’ of the rich man are bad and stubborn practices, but the ‘marrow in the bones’ are the mere desires of bad living alone, which not even in the satisfying of wickedness are filled to the full.  Which marrow as it were moistens the bones, when bad desires keep on their evil habits in the gratification of pleasures.
65.  And there are some that in this world have not riches, but long to have, and seek to be exalted, though in this world they are unable to get the thing they desire, and whilst they have no substance or dignity to support them, yet by bad desires conscience declares them guilty in the sight of the interior Judge.  For every such person is very often in this accounted distressed, because he cannot be rich and carry himself proudly.  Concerning whom it is also added, And another dieth in the bitterness of his soul, and without any wealth.  Observe from the same cause whence the rich man emptily rejoices with a proud heart, another that is poor more emptily sorrows with a proud heart.  Now it is rightly added concerning both, And yet they shall lie down together in the dust, and the worms shall cover them.  For to ‘lie down in the dust’ is to close the eyes of the mind in earthly desires; hence it is said to every individual living in sin, and lying asleep in his wickedness, Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light. [Ep. 5, 14]  But the ‘worms’ that spring from the flesh cover them alike, in that carnal cares overlay the mind whether of the rich man or of the poor man carrying himself proudly.  For in the things of earth the poor and the rich children of perdition, though they be not sustained by a like share of prosperity, are yet troubled by a like degree of solicitude, in that what the one already possesses with alarm the other longs for with anxiety, and because he is unable to get it he is grieved.  So let it be said; They shall lie down together in the dust, and the worms shall cover them.  In that though they be not alike lifted up by temporal good things, yet in care of temporal good things they are both alike lulled asleep by insensibility of mind.  And the worms cover them together, because whether this one, that he may possess what is coveted, or that one, that he may not lose what is possessed, carnal thoughts overlay both.
66.  But blessed Job, who neither when he had substance was elated, nor when it was taken from him sought it with anxiety, as he was devoured by no thoughts of outward loss, had no worms of the heart covering him;’ and because he had not sunk his mind in earthly care, he did not ‘lie asleep in the dust.’  It goes on; Behold I know your thoughts, and your wrongful sentences against me. [1 Cor. 2, 11]  As it is written, For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him? on what principle is it said here, Behold I know your thoughts?  But the spirit of a man is then unknown to another, when it is not shewn forth either by words or deeds.  For whereas it is written, Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them; [Matt. 7, 20] it is by the thing that is done outwardly that whatever lies concealed within is brought to sight.  Whence too it is rightly said by Solomon, As in water the faces of beholders shine bright, so the hearts of men are plain to the wise. [Prov. 27, 19]  Again blessed Job, when he declared that he knew the thoughts of his friends who were talking with him, thereupon added, and your unjust sentences against me: that by a thing open to view he might shew he had found out that which lay concealed in them.
