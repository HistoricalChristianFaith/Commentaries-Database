80.  For sitting betokens one at ease, but rising, one in a conflict.  His rising, then, when he heard the evil tidings, is setting the mind more resolutely for conflicts, after the experience of temptations, by which very temptations even the power of discernment is the gainer, in that it learns the more perfectly to distinguish good from evil.  And therefore it is well added,
And rent his mantle.
81.  We ‘rend our mantle,’ whenever we review with a discriminating eye our past deeds; for unless with God our deeds were as a cloak that covered us, it would never have been declared by the voice of an Angel, Blessed is he that watcheth, and keepeth his garments, lest he walk naked, and they see his shame [Rev. 16, 15]; for ‘our shame’ is then ‘seen,’ when our life, appearing worthy of condemnation in the eyes of the righteous in judgment, has not the covering of after good practice.  But because, as often as we are tempted with guilt, we are prompted to mourning, and being stirred by our own lamentations, open the eyes of the mind to the more perfect perception of the light of righteousness, we as it were rend our mantle in grief, in that in consequence of our weeping discretion being strengthened, we chastise [r] all that we do with greater strictness, and with wrathful hand.  Then all our high-mindedness comes down, then all our overcunningness is dropped from our thoughts; and hence it is added,
And shaved his head, and fell down upon the ground, and worshipped.
82.  For what do we understand in a moral sense by hair, but the wandering thoughts of the mind?  and hence it is elsewhere said to the Church, Thy lips are like a thread of scarlet; and thy speech is comely; [Cant. 4, 3] for a thread [vitta Vulg.] binds the hairs of the head.  So the lips of the Spouse are like a thread, in that by the exhortations of Holy Church all dissipated thoughts in the minds of her hearers are put in bands, that they may not roam at large, and be spread abroad amongst forbidden objects, and thus spread abroad, lie heavy on the eyes of the mind, but may as it were gather themselves to one direction, in that the thread of holy preaching binds them.  Which also is well represented to be of scarlet; for the preaching of the Saints glows only with charity.  And what is signified by the head, but that very mind, which is principal in every action?  Whence it is elsewhere said, And let thy head lack no ointment [Eccl. 9, 8]; for ointment upon the head is charity in the heart; and there is lack of ointment upon the head, when there is a withdrawal of charity from the heart.  The shaving of the head then is the cutting off all superfluous thoughts from the mind.  And he shaveth his head and falls upon the earth, who, restraining thoughts of self-presumption, humbly acknowledges how weak he is in himself.
83.  For it is hard for a man to do great things, and not to harbour confident thoughts in his own mind on the score of his great doings.  For from this very fact, that we are living in strenuous opposition to our vices, presumptuous imaginations are engendered in the heart; and while the mind valorously beats down the evil habits without her, she is very often inwardly swoln within herself; and now she accounts herself to have some special merits, nor ever imagines that she sins in the conceits of self-esteem.  But in the eyes of the severe Judge she is so much the worse delinquent, as the sin committed, in proportion as it is the more concealed, is well nigh incorrigible; and the pit is opened the wider to devour, the more proudly the life we lead glories in itself.  Hence, as we have often said before, it is brought to pass by the merciful dispensations of our Creator, that the soul that places confidence in itself is struck down by a providential temptation; that being brought low it may find out what it is, and may lay aside the haughtiness of self-presumption.  For as soon as the mind feels the blow of temptation, all the presumption and swelling of our thoughts abates.
84.  For when the mind is lifted up in pride, it breaks out as it were into usurpation [s].  And it has for the attendants of its tyrannical power, its own imaginations that flatter it.  But if an enemy assaults the tyrant, the favour of those attendants is speedily at an end.  For when the adversary finds entrance the attendants fly, and fall away from him in fear, whom in time of peace they extolled with cunning flattery.  But, when the attendants are withdrawn, he remains alone in the face of the enemy; for when high thoughts are gone, the troubled mind sees itself only and the temptation, and thus upon healing of evil tidings, the head is shaved, whensoever under the violent assault of temptation the mind is bared of the thoughts of self-assurance.  For what does it mean that the Nazarites let their hair grow long, saving that by a life of special continency proud thoughts gain ground?  And what does it signify, that, the act of devotion over, the Nazarite is commanded to shave his head, and cast the hair into the sacrificial fire, but that we then reach the height of perfection, when we so overcome our external evil habits, as to discard from the mind even thoughts that are superfluous?  To consume these in the sacrificial fire is, plainly, to set them on fire with the flame of divine love; that the whole heart should glow with the love of God, and burning up every superfluous thought, should as it were consume the hair of the Nazarite in completing his devotion.  And observe that he fell upon the earth and worshipped; for he sets forth to God the true worship, who in humility sees that he is dust, who attributes no goodness to himself, who owns that the good that he does is from the mercy of the Creator; and hence he says well and fitly,

55.  When his sons were destroyed in the ruin of the house, Job arose, because when Judaea was lost in unbelief, and when the Preachers were fallen in the death of fear, the Redeemer of mankind raised Himself from the death of His carnal nature; He shewed in what judgment He abandoned His persecutors to themselves.  For His rising is the shewing with what severity He forsakes sinners, just as His lying down is the patient endurance of ills inflicted.  He rises then, when He executes the decrees of justice against the reprobate.  And hence He is rightly described to have rent his mantle.  For what stood as the mantle of the Lord, but the Synagogue, which by the preaching of the Prophets clung to the expectation of His Incarnation?  For in the same way that He is now clothed with those by whom He is loved, as Paul is witness, who says, That He might present it to Himself a glorious church, not having spot nor wrinkle [Eph. 5, 27]; (for that which is described as having neither spot or wrinkle is surely made appear as a spiritual robe [vestis rationalis]; and at once clean in practice, and stretched in hope;) so when Judaea believed Him as yet to be made Incarnate, it was no less a garment through its clinging to Him.
56.  But because He was looked for before He came, and coming, taught new truths, and teaching, wrought wonders, and working wonders, underwent wrongs, He rent His mantle, which He had put on Him, seeing that in Judaea some he withdrew from unbelief, whilst some He left therein.  What then is the rent mantle but Judaea divided in contrary opinions?  For, if His mantle had not been rent, the Evangelist would not have said that, at the preaching of our Lord, there arose strife among the people; For some said, He is a good man; others said, Nay, but He deceiveth the people. [John 7, 12]  For that mantle of His was rent, in that being divided in opinions it lost the unity of concord.  It proceeds; And shaved his head, and fell down upon the ground, and worshipped.
57.  What is signified by the hair that was shorn but the minuteness [sublilitas] of Sacraments?  what by the head but the High Priesthood?  Hence too it is said to the prophet Ezekiel, And thou, son of man, take thee a sharp knife, take thee a barber's razor, and cause it to pass upon thine head, and upon thy beard; [Ezek. 5, 1] clearly that by the Prophet's act the judgment of the Redeemer might be set out, Who when He came in the flesh ‘shaved the head,’ in that he took clean away from the Jewish Priesthood the Sacraments of His commandments; ‘and shaved the beard,’ in that in forsaking the kingdom of Israel, He cut off the glory of its excellency.  And what is here expressed by the earth, but sinful man?  For to the first man that sinned the words were spoken; Dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return. [Gen. 3, 19]  By the name of the earth then is signified the sinful Gentile world; for whilst Judaea thought herself righteous, it appears how damnable she thought the Gentile world, as Paul is witness, who saith, We who are Jews by nature, and not sinners of the Gentiles. [Gal. 2, 15]  Therefore our Mediator, as it were, shaved His head, and fell down upon the earth, seeing that in forsaking Judaea, whilst He took away His Sacraments from her Priesthood, He came to the knowledge of the Gentiles.  For He ‘shaved the hair from His Head,’ because He took away from that His first Priesthood the Sacraments of the Law.  And He fell upon the earth, because He gave Himself to sinners for their salvation; and while He gave up those who appeared to themselves righteous, He took to Himself those, who both knew and confessed that they were unrighteous.  And hence He Himself declares in the Gospel, For judgment I am come into this world, that they that see not might see, and that they which see might be made blind. [John 9, 39]  And hence the pillar of the cloud, which went before the people in the wilderness, shone with a radiant flame of fire not in the day but in the night; for this reason, that our Redeemer, in giving guidance to those that followed Him by the example of life and conduct, yielded no light to such as trusted in their own righteousness, but all those who acknowledged the darkness of their sins, He shone with the fire of His love.  Nor, because Job is said to fall on the earth, let us account this to be an unworthy representation of our Redeemer.  For it is written, The Lord sent a Word into Jacob, and it hath fallen [E.V. lighted] upon Israel. [Is. 9, 8]  For Jacob means one that overthrows another, and Israel, one that sees God.  And what is signified by Jacob but the Jewish people, and by Israel but the Gentile world?  For in that very One Whom Jacob aimed to overthrow by the death of the flesh, the Gentile world, by the eyes of faith, beheld God.  And thus the Word, that was sent to Jacob, lighted upon Israel; for Him whom the Jewish people rejected when He came to them, the Gentile world at once owned and found.  For concerning the Holy Spirit it is written, The Spirit of God fell upon them. [Acts 11, 15]
58.  And for this reason either the Word of God or the Holy Spirit is said to fall in Holy Scripture, to describe the suddenness of His coming.  For whatever rushes down or falls, comes to the bottom directly.  And therefore it is as if the Mediator had fallen upon the earth, that without any previous signs He unexpectedly came to the Gentiles.  And it is well said, that He fell down upon the earth and worshipped, in that whilst He Himself undertook the low estate of the flesh, He poured into the hearts of believers the breathings of humility.  For He did this, in that He taught the doing of it, in the same way that it is said of His Holy Spirit, But the Spirit itself maketh request [Vulg. postulat] for us with groanings which cannot be uttered. [Rom. 8, 26]  Not that He petitions, Who is of perfect equality, but He is said to make request for no other reason than that He causes those to make request whose hearts He has filled: though our Redeemer, moreover, manifested this in His own Person, Who even besought the Father when He was drawing nigh to His Passion.  For what wonder if, in the form of a servant, He submitted Himself to the Father by pouring out His supplications to Him, when in the same He even underwent the violence of sinners, to the very extremity of death.

There are some who account it a high degree of philosophical fortitude, if, when corrected by severe discipline, they are insensible to the strokes, and to the pains of those stripes.  And there are some who feel to such excess the infliction of the blows, that under the influence of immediate grief, they even fall into excesses of the tongue.  But whoever strives to maintain true philosophy, must go between either extreme, for the weightiness of true virtue consists not in dulness of heart, as also those limbs are very unhealthy from numbness which cannot feel any pain even when cut.  Again, he deserts his guard over virtue, who feels the pain of chastisement beyond what is necessary; for while the heart is affected with excessive sorrow, it is stirred up to the extent of impatient reviling, and he who ought to have amended his misdeeds by means of the stripes, does his part that his wickedness should be increased by the correction.  Agreeably to which, against the insensibility in the chastised, the words of the Prophet are, Thou hast stricken them, but they have not grieved; Thou hast consumed them, but they have refused to receive correction. [Jer. 5, 3]  Against the faintheartedness of the chastened the Psalmist hath it, They will never stand fast in adversity; [Ps. 140, 10. Vulg.] for they would ‘stand fast in adversity,’ if they bore calamities with patience, but so soon as they sink in spirit, when pressed with blows, they as it were lose the firmness of their footing, amidst the miseries inflicted on them. Thus because blessed Job observed the rule of the true philosophy, he kept himself from either extreme with the evenness of a marvellous skill, that he might not by being insensible to the pain contemn the strokes, nor again, by feeling the pain immoderately, be hurried madly against the visitation of the Striker.  For when all his substance was lost, all his children gone, he rose up, and rent his mantle, and shaved his head, and fell down upon the ground, and worshipped.  In that he rent his mantle, in that he shaved his head and fell down upon the ground, he shows, we see, that he has felt the pain of the scourge; but in that it is added that he worshipped, it is plainly shown that even in the midst of pain, he did not break forth against the decree of the Smiter.  He was not altogether unmoved, lest by his very insensibility he should show a contempt of God; nor was he completely in commotion, lest by excess of grief he should commit sin.  But because there are two commandments of love, i.e.  the love of God, and of our neighbour; that he might discharge the love of our neighbour, he paid the debt of mourning to his sons; that he might not forego the love of God, he performed the office of prayer amidst his groans. There are some that use to love God in prosperity, but in adversity to abate their love of Him from whom the stroke comes. But blessed Job, by that sign which he outwardly showed in his distress, proved that he acknowledged the correction of his Father, but herein, that he continued humbly worshipping, he showed that even under pain he did not give over the love of that Father.  Therefore that he might not show pride by his insensibility, he fell down at the stroke, but that he might not estrange himself from the Striker, he so fell down as to worship.  But it was the practice of ancient times for everyone, who kept up the appearance of his person by encouraging the growth of his hair, to cut it off in seasons of mourning; and, on the other hand that he who in peaceful times kept his hair cut, should in evidencing his distress cherish its growth. Thus blessed Job is shown to have preserved his hair in the season of rest, when he is related to have shaven his head for the purpose of mourning, that whereas the hand of the Most High was fallen upon him in all the circumstances of his condition, the altered mien of penance might even by his own act overcloud him. But such an one, spoiled of his substance, bereft of his children, that rent his mantle, that shaved his head, that fell down upon the ground.
