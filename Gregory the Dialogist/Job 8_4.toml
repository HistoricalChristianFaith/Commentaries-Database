61.  As if the preachers of falsities were to say to afflicted Catholics, ‘Provide for your lives, and learn what wrong things ye maintain from the condemnation of those that are dead from among you.  For except your misbelief were displeasing to the Creator of all things, He would never take from you such numbers [k] by destruction let loose to rage against them.’  For he says, If thy children have sinned against Him, and He have left them in the hand of their transgression.  As though he said in plain speech, ‘They are left in the hand of their own wickedness, that refused to follow the life of our right rule.’  Yet if thou wilt arise to God at dawn, and make thy supplication to the Almighty.  For inasmuch as heretics think that the light of truth rests with themselves, they bid and summon Holy Church, as being in the night of error, to come to the dawning of the truth, that in the knowledge of God it may be led to rise, as in the dawning light, and by the prayer of penitence wash off past misdeeds.  If thou wilt walk pure and upright; that is to say, pure in thought, upright in practice.  Surely now He will awake for thee.  As if it were in plain words, ‘that He, Who now forbears to put forth the power of His protecting hand to thy tribulations, is as if asleep to the succouring of one going wrong.’  And make the habitation of thy righteousness at peace, i.e. ‘does away with the crosses of the present life, and vouchsafes without delay security in repose.’  For because men that are bad reckon temporal enjoyment as a special blessing of Divine recompensing, what they themselves go after with solicitous concern, they promise to others as something great.  Hence it very often happens that they either pledge themselves to regain them when lost, or draw on the minds of their hearers after still greater rewards of this world.
