"You gave me no kiss; but she, from the time she entered, has not ceased to kiss my feet." A kiss is indeed a sign of love. And that faithless people did not give God a kiss, because they did not wish to love him out of charity, whom they served out of fear. But the Gentiles, once called, do not cease to kiss the footsteps of their Redeemer, because they continually sigh in love for him. Hence also in the voice of the bride concerning this same Redeemer it is said in the Song of Songs: "Let him kiss me with the kiss of his mouth." Rightly does she desire the kiss of her Creator, who prepares herself to serve him through love.
