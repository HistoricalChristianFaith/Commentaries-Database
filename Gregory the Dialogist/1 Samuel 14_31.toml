The day of the mind is the splendor of instruction. But those whom the arrogant teach, because they are inflamed by the ambition of temporal glory, receive a semblance of light, not the truth. When therefore that day is spoken of, what else is signified, except that often by the aim of temporal glory, mighty deeds seemed to be accomplished? For in that day, that is, by the teaching or example of the proud, they strike, because they serve in the ministry of preaching for this purpose: to obtain the splendor of temporal glory. And because they desire to become known to all, it says: From Magmas to Aion. Magmas, as has already been sufficiently stated, is interpreted as "humility," while Aion is interpreted as "my mourning brother." By the humble in this place, the little ones and simple people in the holy Church are designated. And the mourning brother—whom else does he suggest, except those whom the Lord praises in the Gospel, saying: Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted (Matt. 5:5)? For he who has already learned to despise all temporal things and to long for eternal things with great desires, while he dreads being held in the body and groans that he is not yet in that joy of eternal life, is rightly called "my mourning brother." Brother indeed, because he has already begun to be a co-heir of Christ, for whose most blessed and most joyful inheritance he groans with all his desires. He is called mourning, so that the unspeakable grief of the perfect may be designated. To mourn, moreover, is not to weep in just any manner, but to weep most deeply. For because they are filled with the grace of the Holy Spirit, they have reached that abundance of tears which the distinguished teacher affirms, saying: The Spirit himself intercedes for us with inexpressible groanings (Rom. 8:26). He is also called mourning brother because the perfect are joined to the Redeemer in great intimacy. For he whom the Redeemer loves singularly, whom he nourishes with singular dignity for the possession of the perpetual inheritance, when he is called his brother, is designated in the singular number. Whence he also says to Moses as to a singular friend: I know you by name (Exod. 33:12). Hence it is that it is said of John in the Gospel: This is that disciple whom Jesus loved (John 21:20). For he who greatly loved all his disciples, when he is said to love this one, the brother is indicated in the singular number. In that day from Magmas to Aion they strike the arrogant Philistines, because in order to receive the light of worldly glory, they preach not only small things to the little ones, but lofty things that the more perfect may recognize. And because while they harm themselves through the perversity of their intention and some little ones in Christ, they benefit many who are more perfect by their speaking, they are said not to fight but to strike from Magmas to Aion. To strike the Philistines indeed is to destroy the snares of demons or the tyranny of vices from the heart of the elect. But often proud teachers benefit others through their word, and receive none of the praises for that same word which they desire. Whence it also frequently happens that while they do not see themselves being praised and exalted, they fall silent as if wearied by great labors. Therefore it is also added: (Verse 31) But the people were exceedingly weary. It is also the custom of the proud that when another's tongue is silent from their praises, their own self-estimation is not silent. While others indeed are silent, they cry out, because they carry the proclamations of their own self-estimation in their heart. Well therefore it is added concerning the same people: (Verse 32) And the people turned to the spoil, and took sheep, and oxen, and calves, and slaughtered them on the ground, and the people ate with the blood.
