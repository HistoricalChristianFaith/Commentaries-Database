10. For all the wicked are in truth shadows of the devil: for while they give themselves up to imitate his iniquity, they derive, as it were, a form of resemblance from his body. But as the reprobate are his ‘shadows’ in the plural number, so each separate sinner is his ‘shadow’ in the singular. But when the wicked gainsay the teaching of the just, when they do not permit any wicked person to be corrected by them, the shadows of this Behemoth cover his shadow; because sinners, whenever they are conscious to themselves of sin, support another sinner in the same course. His shadows cover his shadow, when the more wicked support by their misdirected patronage the doings of the most wicked. And this they doubtless do with this object, that, while the fault, with which they themselves are bound, is corrected in others, they may not at last be reached themselves. They cover themselves therefore, when they protect others, because they foresee that their own conduct is attacked, by the same means as they see others confounded with bold reproof. And thus it happens, that while the aggregate of sins is defended, it is also increased, and that the guilt of each person is more easy of commission, the more difficult it is of punishment. For the evil doings of sinners derive so much greater increase, the longer they are permitted, through the defence of the powerful, to remain unpunished. But such persons, whether they seem to be within or without Holy Church, display themselves more openly as the enemies of God, the greater patrons they are of sins. For in defending themselves they fight against Him, Who is displeased with those doings, which they multiply, by defending them. Which conduct the Lord by the Prophet well reproves, under the character of Babylon, saying; Thorns and nettles shall spring up in her houses, and the bramble in the fortresses thereof. [Is. 34, 13] For what do we understand by ‘nettles,’ but the irritations of thoughts, and what by ‘thorns,’ but the piercings of sins? Nettles therefore and thorns spring up in the houses of Babylon, because in the disorder of a reprobate mind there arise longings of thoughts which exasperate, and sinful deeds which wound. But they who act thus have others also more wicked than themselves as their defenders. Whence he there fitly subjoined immediately, And the bramble in the fortresses thereof. For the bramble is crowded with such a circle of thorns, that it can hardly be touched from its roughness. The nettle and the thorn therefore spring up within, but both of them are fortified without by the bramble: because, namely, smaller offenders commit any kinds of evil, but greater and most abandoned ones defend them. Whence it is here also well said, His shadows protect his shadow. For whilst a greater sinner defends a wicked person, a shadow, as it were, darkens a shadow, that it be not irradiated with the light of truth. It follows;
The willows of the brook will compass him about.
11. ‘Willows’ are trees which bear indeed no fruit; but are of such great greenness, as hardly to dry up, even when cut off by the roots and torn up. Whence in Holy Scripture by the name ‘willows,’ the good are sometimes designated, from their greenness, and sometimes the reprobate from their sterility. For unless by their continual greenness they typified the life of the Elect, the Prophet would not have said concerning the children of Holy Church, They shall spring up among the grass, as willows by the water courses. [Is. 44, 4] For the children of Holy Church spring up as willows among the grass, when amidst the withering life of carnal men, they last on in manifold numbers, and perpetual greenness of mind. And they are well said to spring up by the water courses, because each of them derives its fruitful productiveness from the teaching of Holy Scripture, which runs along in this temporal state. And again, if the life of sinners were not signified by the sterility of willows, the Psalmist would not have said against Babylon by the voice of preachers; We hanged our instruments upon the willows in the midst thereof. [Ps. 137, 2] For the willows are described as being in the midst of Babylon, doubtless because the unfruitful, and those estranged from the love of their heavenly country, are rooted with all the affections of their heart in this confusion of the world. Whence also holy preachers do not play, but hang their instruments in these willows, because when they see minds unfruitful and reprobate, they display not the power of their preaching, but rather weep and are silent. What also is expressed by the brook except the course of this mortal life? Of which it is said again by the Prophet, He shall drink of the brook in the way, therefore shall he lift up his head. [Ps. 110, 7] Because, namely, our Redeemer tasted the punishment of mortal life, as though in a passage through it, and therefore did not long abide in that death to which he had yielded of his own accord. Whence on the third day he lifted up at His resurrection that Head which He had laid down at His death. What then is the meaning of that which is said of this Behemoth, the willows of the brook will compass him about? except that lovers of this mortal life, unfruitful in good deeds, cleave the closer to him, the more abundantly the delight of transitory pleasure waters them. For a brook waters them, as it were, at their roots, when the love of a carnal life intoxicates them in their thoughts. And like willows they bring forth in truth no fruit, but are green in their leaves, because they sometimes utter words of propriety, which are not burdensome to be said, but display by their good works no weight of life. It is therefore well said, The willows of the brook will compass him about, because when they who bear no fruit devote themselves to the love of this temporal life, they comply too familiarly with the depraved customs of the ancient enemy. But since we have heard what is rendered him by his clients, let us now hear what he works in them.
