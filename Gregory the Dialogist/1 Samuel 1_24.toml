46. For what is signified by a calf in this place, if not the purpose of imitating the life of the perfect? But it is a calf when it arises in the heart of one making progress, yet it becomes an ox when through the strength of virtue it is brought to the disposition of a great conversion. In this place it must be carefully inquired why not one calf, but three are reported to have been brought to the tabernacle. But in the three calves the infant being carried is shown, so that he might suggest the pattern of those who are being trained for the ministry of preaching. For the perfect teacher watches over both the conversion of sinners and the guarding of the just. For like a farmer of the supreme head of the household, he yokes both oxen to the plows, so that he may not only watch over those standing lest they fall, but also raise up the fallen so they may stand firm. But let him who has two oxen in the care of those subject to him, that he may be able to be perfect, yoke a third ox in divine contemplation, so that he may both open the hearts of his neighbors with a complete yoke, by speaking as if by plowing, and always extend himself through the singular strength of love toward the vision of his Creator. Therefore Samuel is led to the house of the Lord with three calves, when anyone making good progress proposes that through the labor of preaching he may be able to benefit his neighbors, and through the secret of quiet cling to the intimate vision of the Creator. And because an unskilled mind will never be able to exhibit this well, he is also offered with three measures of flour. For when loaves are made from flour, the preparation of refreshment is completed. But because he is offered not in loaves but in measures of flour, a good devotion proposing doctrine is shown, not exhibiting the benefit of doctrine itself. Therefore a measure of flour signifies the preparation for holy preaching. But the infant is brought with three measures of flour, because when we propose to preach, we prepare the word of knowledge for sinners unto conversion, for the just unto the state of perseverance, and for ourselves unto heavenly contemplation; or certainly one measure is, as we have said, for the conversion of the sinner, another for the instruction of the married, and the third for the excellent purity of the continent. And they are called measures on account of the measure of discretion. Whence also the blessed Paul declares, saying: Not to think more highly than one ought to think, but to think with sobriety (Rom. 12:3).

47. Indeed, what the order of preachers, chosen from among the nations as circumstances required, possessed—not from the fickleness of vanity but from the virtue of good intention—follows: "And a jar of wine." The virtue of good intention is the charity of God, which is poured into the hearts of the elect through the gift of the Holy Spirit. This gift of charity is rightly figured by the name of wine, because it occupies the mind and alienates it from earthly affections, so that it has no intention toward the world, which it inflames toward desiring heavenly things alone. But so that not the perfection but the beginning of this virtue might be designated, it is shown to have been a jar of wine and not a cup. For we store in a jar what we will someday serve through a cup. Hence it is that he who had tasted the perfection of heavenly charity confessed to almighty God, saying: "You have anointed my head with oil, and my inebriating cup, how excellent it is!" (Psalm 22:5). Samuel is shown to have been offered with a jar of wine, because every elect person, when he is prepared for the ministry of evangelical preaching, proposes the good of that preaching to be expended not for the vain ambition of this world, but for charity alone. Therefore he is brought with calves for the purpose of fortitude, with measures of flour for the doctrine of the word, with a jar of wine for the intention of charity.

48. Where indeed these beginnings of virtues are to be perfected, he teaches when he adds: "And she brought him into the house of the Lord in Shiloh." The house of the Lord is rightly understood as the holy Church, which indeed is said to be situated in Shiloh. Now Shiloh is the place where the ark of God is said to have remained. What else, therefore, does Shiloh signify in this place than the tradition of the old law? For it contains, as it were, the ark of God, while it displays outwardly the carnal letter, which holds spiritual knowledge enclosed in its secrets. What then does it mean that the house of the Lord is said to be situated in Shiloh, except that the holy Church is known to be founded in the sacrament of the Scriptures as in a place? Samuel is said to have been brought there, offered there, because apart from the holy Church there is no place where the merits of virtues may grow and come to the summit of perfection. But when he who was brought is mentioned, the reason for his delay is also recalled, when it is added: (Verse 24.) "But the boy was still a little child." For if he had not then been a little child, while he could come by himself, it would not have been necessary for him to be led here by another. It follows: (Verse 25.) "And they sacrificed a calf, and offered the boy to Eli."

(Moral Exposition) Now the boy is led to the tabernacle with three calves, because for the abundance of spiritual gifts we ought to give thanks to the supreme Trinity. Concerning these calves the prophet beseeching the Lord says: "Take away all iniquity, and receive the good, and we will render the calves of our lips" (Hosea 14:3). As if to say: For the abundance of gifts we will render sacrifices of praise, through the service of our lips. The boy is brought to be offered in the house of the Lord, when the progress of a holy mind is revealed to the teachers of Holy Church, so that while it is examined through consultation with the wise, it may in no way be stained by the fraud of the cunning enemy. The house of the Lord can also designate the eternal homeland. Of this indeed the Psalmist says exulting: "Blessed are they who dwell in your house, O Lord, they will praise you forever and ever" (Psalm 84:5). The boy is brought into the house of the Lord, when the chosen mind is raised up on high, and strives to give thanks to almighty God for all in which it makes spiritual progress, from whom it recognizes the gifts of its advancement have been bestowed upon it. And rightly one calf is sacrificed, though three are brought, because although the Trinity of persons is sung in divine praises by the confession of the faithful, the inseparable unity of those same persons is proclaimed. But what kind, or how great is praise, if it is not devout? Therefore fittingly three measures of flour are joined to three calves, so that we may be satisfied through devotion by what we say with our mouth in praises of God. For he offers a calf without flour, who in the praises of God indeed utters words, but with a wandering mind does not attend to what he speaks. But if speaking the words of God in praising or praying, we rejoice, while we mix joy with understanding, we join an amphora of that wine which gladdens the heart of man to the flour. This indeed he suggests, who longing says: "May God bless us, our God bless us, may God bless us, and may all the ends of the earth fear him" (Psalm 67:7-8). He led as it were three calves to the tabernacle, who praising God, by repeating the name of his divinity, set forth the properties of the persons. But when he said "may they fear," he said not "them" but "him," certainly he who brought three calves sacrificed one. And because he mixed flour with the calves, and wine with the flour, he glories, saying: "To him I cried with my mouth, and I exulted under my tongue" (Psalm 66:17). For while he cried out, he led as it were a calf of sacrifice to be immolated, but he could not exult under his tongue, if he did not understand the lofty words of his prayer. When therefore he cried out, he understood what he cried out, and when he exulted in the oblation of almighty God, he had not only a calf, but also measures of flour, and an amphora of wine. Therefore the calf, the flour and the wine are the praise of God, the understanding of praise, and the joy of a devout mind. But why are the measure and amphora named in the oblation to God, unless because they are names of measures? Paul also explains what this spiritually indicates, saying: "Each one has his own gift from God, one indeed in this way, another in that way" (1 Corinthians 7:7). Hence the Truth says: "A good measure, pressed down, shaken together, and running over, they will give into your lap" (Luke 6:38). Sacred Scripture has commanded us to guard this measure, saying: "Do not lift a burden above yourself." But the chosen soul must take great care to offer these three things to almighty God with the ardor of pious devotion and with the zeal for manifest truth. Hence also the son of the same Anna is declared to have been offered to the priest. Which indeed we also do, if when we make progress in holy conduct, when with minds now fruitful we bring forth the fruit of spiritual joys, we lead to the examination of our prelates everything that is generated in us from heavenly contemplation. And because chosen men amid their sublime gifts do not abandon the good of their humility, there follows: (Verse 28.) "And they worshiped the Lord there."
