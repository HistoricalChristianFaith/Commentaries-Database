14.  In that God is set forth as ‘higher than heaven,’ ‘deeper than hell,’ ‘longer than the earth,’ and ‘broader than the sea,’ this must be understood in a spiritual sense, inasmuch as it is impious to conceive any thing concerning Him after the proportions of body.  Now He is ‘higher than heaven,’ in that He transcends all things by the Incomprehensibility of His spiritual Nature.  He is ‘deeper than hell,’ in that in transcending He sustains beneath.  He is ‘longer than the earth,’ in that He exceeds the measure of created being by the everlasting continuance of His Eternity.  He is ‘broader than the sea,’ in that He so possesses the waves of temporal things in ruling them, that in confining He encompasses them beneath the every way prevailing presence of His Power.  Though it is possible that by the designation of ‘Heaven’ the Angels may be denoted, and by the term ‘hell,’ the demons, while by the ‘earth’ the righteous, and by the ‘sea’ sinners are understood.  Thus He is ‘higher than the heaven,’ in that the very Elect Spirits themselves do not perfectly penetrate the vision of His infinite loftiness?  He is ‘deeper than hell,’ in that He judges and condemns the craft of evil spirits with far more searching exactness than they had ever thought, He is ‘longer than the earth,’ in that He surpasses our long-suffering by the patience of Divine long-suffering, which both bears with us in our sins, and welcomes us when we are turned from them to the rewards of His recompensing.  He is ‘wider than the sea,’ in that he every where enters into the doings of sinners by the presence of His retributive power, so that even when He is not seen present by His appearance, He is felt present by His judgment.
15.  Yet all the particulars may be referred to man alone, so that he is Himself ‘heaven,’ when now in desire he is attached to things above; himself ‘hell,’ when he lies grovelling in things below, confounded by the mists of his temptations; himself ‘earth,’ in that he is made to abound in good works through the fertility of a stedfast hope; himself ‘the sea,’ for that on some occasions he is shaken with alarm, and agitated by the breath of his feebleness.  But God is ‘higher than heaven,’ in that we are subdued by the mightiness of His power, even when we are lifted above our own selves.  He is ‘deeper than hell,’ in that He goes deeper in judging than the very human mind looks into its own self in the midst of temptations, He is ‘longer than the earth,’ in that those fruits of our life which He gives at the end, our very hope at the present time comprehends not at all.  He is ‘wider than the sea,’ in that the human mind being tossed to and fro throws out many fancies concerning the things that are coming, but when it now begins to see the things that it had made estimate of, it owns itself to have been too stinted in its reckoning.  Therefore He is made ‘higher than heaven,’ since our contemplation itself fails toward Him.  Hence the Psalmist too had set his heart on high, yet he felt that he had not yet reached unto Him, saying, Thy knowledge is too wonderful for me, it is mighty, I cannot attain unto it. [Ps. 139, 6]  He knew One deeper than hell, who when sifting his own heart, yet dreading His more searching judgment, said, For I know nothing by myself, yet am I not hereby justified: but He that judgeth me is the Lord. [1 Cor. 4, 4]  He saw One ‘longer than the earth,’ when he was brought to reflect that the wishes of man’s heart were too little for him, saying, Now unto Him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think. [Eph. 3, 20]  He had beheld One ‘broader than the sea,’ who considered whilst he feared that the human mind may never know the immeasurableness of His severity, however it may toss and fret in enquiring after it, saying, Who knoweth the power of Thine anger, and for fear can tell Thy wrath? [Ps. 90, 11]  Whose Power the inimitable teacher rightly gives us the knowledge of, when he briefly says, That ye may be able to comprehend with all Saints what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height. [Eph. 3, 18]  For God has ‘breadth,’ in that He extends His love even to gathering in the very persecutors.  He has ‘length,’ in that He leads us onwards by bearing with us in long-suffering to the country of life.  He has ‘loftiness,’ in that He far transcends the understanding of the very beings themselves that have been admitted into the heavenly assemblage.  He has ‘depth,’ in that upon the damned below He displays the visitation of His severity in an incomprehensible manner.  And these same four attributes He exercises towards each one of us, that are placed in this life, in that by loving, He manifests His ‘breadth;’ by suffering, His ‘length;’ by surpassing not only our understanding, but even our very wishes, His ‘height;’ and His ‘depth,’ by judging with strictness the hidden and unlawful motions of the thoughts.  Now His height and depth how unsearchable it is no man knows saving he, who has begun either by contemplation to be carried up on high, or in resisting the hidden motions of the heart to be troubled by the urgency of temptation.  And hence the words are spoken to blessed Job, He is higher than heaven what canst thou do? deeper than hell, whence canst thou know?  As if it were said to him in open contempt, ‘His depth and excellency when mayest thou ever discover, who are not taught either to be lifted up on high by virtue, or to deal severely with thyself in temptations.
