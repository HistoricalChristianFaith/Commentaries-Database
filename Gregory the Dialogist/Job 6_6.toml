15.  For the words and the practices of the carnal introduce themselves like food into our minds, so as to be swallowed up in the belly of complacence.  But any of the Elect eateth not that which is ‘unsavory,’ for setting apart in judgment the words and the deeds of the froward, he puts them away from the mouth of his heart.  Paul forbade unsavoury meat to be offered for the food of souls, when he said to his disciples, Let your speech be alway with grace, seasoned with salt. [Col. 4, 6]  And to the Psalmist also the words of the children of perdition tasted unsavoury in the mouth of the heart, when he said, The wicked have related tales to [so V.] me which are not after Thy Law. [Ps. 119, 85]  But often, when the words of the wicked press themselves with importunity into our ears, they beget in the heart a war of temptation.  And though both reason reject and the tongue censure them, yet that is with difficulty mastered within, which without is sentenced with authority.  Whence it is necessary that that should never even reach the ears, which the mind must keep off from the avenue of the imagination by exercising watchfulness.  Holy men, then, whereas their hearts pant with aspirations after Eternity, lift themselves to such an exalted elevation of life, that to hear any longer the things that are of the world they account to be a grievous burthen bearing them down.  For they reckon that to be impertinent and insufferable, which does not tell of what their hearts are full of.
16.  Now it often happens that the mind is already transported to the realms on high in desire, is already entirely parted asunder from the foolish converse of earthly men, but is not yet braced to prefer the crosses of the present life for the love of God; already it seeks the things on high, already it contemns the grovelling follies below, but it does not yet turn itself to the endurance of the adversity which it has to bear.  And hence it is added,
Or can anyone taste that, which by being tasted brings death?
17.  For it is hard to seek after that which torments, to follow that which makes life depart.  But very often the life of the righteous stretches itself up to such a height of virtue, that both within it rules in the citadel of interior reason, and without, by bearing with it, brings the folly of some to conversion; for we must needs bear with the weaknesses of those, whom we are striving to draw on to strong things.  For neither does any man lift up one that is fallen, save he, who in compassion bends the uprightness of his position.  But when we compassionate the weakness of another, we are the more strongly nerved as to our own; so that, from love of the things of futurity, the soul prepares itself to meet the ills of the present time, and looks out for the hurts of the body, which it used to fear.  For its heavenly aspirations being enlarged, it is more and more straitened, and when it sees how great is the sweetness of the eternal land, it fervently loves for the sake of that the bitter tastes of the present life.  Whence after the disdain of ‘unsavoury meat,’ after the impossibility of the tasting of death.

8.  In the Law, the virtue of the hidden meaning is the salt of the letter.  Whosoever, then, being intent upon carnal observances, refused to understand it in a spiritual sense, what else did he but eat ‘unsavoury food?’ But this ‘salt,’ ‘Truth,’ on being known, put into the food, when He taught that the savour of a hidden sense lay at the bottom of the Law, saying, For had ye believed Moses, ye might [Vulg. forsitan] have believed Me, for he wrote of Me. [John 5, 46]  And again, Have salt in yourselves, and have peace one with another. [Mark 9, 50]  But because before our Redeemer's coming, Judaea held the Law in a carnal way, the Gentile world refused to bend themselves to its precepts, which enjoined hard things.  Thus it would not eat unsavoury meat.  For before that it got the relish of the Spirit, it shrunk from keeping the force of the letter.  For which of the Gentiles would bear this, which is therein enjoined, to cut their children's flesh for a religious service? to cut off the sins of speech by death?  And hence it is well added yet further;
Or can anyone taste, what by being tasted brings death? 
9.  For the Law, if tasted in a carnal way, ‘brought death,’ in that it seized the misdeeds of transgressors with a severe visitation; it ‘brought death,’ in that both by the injunction it made known the sin, and did not by grace put it away, as Paul testifies, saying, The Law made nothing perfect.  And again, Wherefore the Law is holy, and the commandment holy and just and good.  And soon after, But sin, that it might appear sin, working death in me by that which is good.  But the Gentile world, when turned to Christ, in that it understands Him to be sounding in the words of the Law, being straitened by its desires looks for Him, Whom it ardently loves, in a spiritual way amongst carnal precepts.  And hence in the voice of the Church it is immediately added by the Prophetic Spirit.

“Can anyone taste poisonous food without dying?” For it is hard to seek that which torments or to follow that which destroys life. But very often the life of the righteous stretches itself to such a height of virtue that it rules within in the citadel of interior reason. It also rules without. By bearing with it, reason leads the folly of some to conversion. For we must bear with the weakness of those we are striving to draw on to strong things. No one can lift up another without bending down from the uprightness of his position. But when we empathize with the weakness of another, we are strongly encouraged to face courageously our own weaknesses. The result is that from the love of future things, the soul prepares itself to meet the ills of present times and watches for the hurts of the body that it used to fear. For the soul is increasingly straitened as its heavenly aspirations are enlarged. When it perceives how great is the sweetness of the eternal land, it fervently loves for the sake of the present life’s bitter tastes.
