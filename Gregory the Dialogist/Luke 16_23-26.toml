From the words of Scripture, we gather that the soul suffers from the burning heat not only through its sense of sight but also by actually experiencing the pain. We know from Christ’s words that the rich man was burned in hell. His prayer to Abraham declares that his soul was held in fire. He says, “Send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue. I am tormented in this flame.” Since Christ describes the condemned sinner Dives surrounded by the flames of hell, no one with understanding would deny that fire holds fast the souls of the wicked.
