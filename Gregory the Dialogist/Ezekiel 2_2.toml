"And the spirit entered into me after he spoke to me, and set me upon my feet." Behold, the divine voice commanded the prophet lying down to rise. But he could not rise at all unless the spirit of almighty God had entered into him, because from the grace of almighty God we can indeed strive toward good works, but we cannot fulfill them unless he who commands also helps. Thus Paul, when he admonished his disciples, saying, "Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling," immediately added who was working these very good things in them, saying: "For it is God who works in you both to will and to accomplish according to his good pleasure." Hence it is that the Truth itself says to the disciples: "Without me you can do nothing."

But in these matters concerning "the spirit entered into me and set me upon my feet" it must be considered that if our good deeds are gifts of almighty God in such a way that there is nothing of ours in them, why do we seek eternal reward as if for merits? But if they are ours in such a way that they are not gifts of almighty God, why do we give thanks to almighty God for them? But it must be known that our evil deeds are ours alone; our good deeds, however, are both almighty God's and ours, because he by inspiring goes before us so that we may will, and by helping follows after so that we may not will in vain, but may be able to fulfill what we will. Therefore, with grace going before and good will following, that which is the gift of almighty God becomes our merit. Paul explains this well in a brief statement, saying: "I labored more than all of them." Lest he seem to have attributed to his own virtue what he had done, he added: "Yet not I, but the grace of God with me." For because he was preceded by the heavenly gift, he recognized himself as if a stranger to his own good work, saying: "Yet not I." But because the preceding grace had made his free will inclined to good, and by that free will he followed that same grace in his work, he added: "But the grace of God with me." As if he were saying: In good work I labored, not I, but also I. For in this respect, that I was preceded by the Lord's gift alone, not I; but in this respect, that I followed the gift with my will, also I. Therefore, having briefly said these things against Pelagius and Coelestius, let us return to the order of exposition.
