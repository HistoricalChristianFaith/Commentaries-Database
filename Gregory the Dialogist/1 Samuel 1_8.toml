19. Therefore, as if the Redeemer speaks to the mind of the teacher through the consolation of inner inspiration: You complain in vain about the lost gain of preaching, you who receive more abundant fruit the more you extend the affection of charity even to enemies. Therefore you grieve over that which should have made you rejoice. And because He Himself is the reward of the elect, He asks saying: Am I not better to you than ten sons? For Anna would have borne ten sons if the primitive Church had begotten the Jewish people, placed under the Decalogue of the Law, in faith. And because some benefit others by preaching, who in many ways displease the Creator, it is shown by reason that Anna's husband is better than ten sons. Moreover, by this inquiry as to why she weeps, the perdition of Judea itself can be signified. As if to say: She is mourned over uselessly, she who is by no means pardoned through the prayer of the righteous. Therefore when He subsequently asks: Why do you not eat? Certainly joy over the conversion of the Gentiles is intimated to her. As if to say: Since you must give birth to the whole world, you do not rejoice in vain that she who was cast off does not abandon the darkness of error. There follows: (Verses 9 and 10.) Therefore Anna rose up after she had eaten and drunk in Shiloh, while Eli the priest was sitting on a seat before the doorposts of the temple of the Lord, and being bitter in soul she prayed to the Lord, weeping copiously.

(Moral Exposition) To these banquets indeed he was exhorting his weeping spouse when he said: "Why are you sad, O my soul, and why do you trouble me? Hope in God, for I shall yet praise him, the salvation of my countenance and my God" (Psalm 43:5). This same exhortation is recognized here as well, because she is asked by her husband why she weeps, and why she does not eat, and why she has an afflicted heart. As if he were saying: Why are you saddened about not having attained the perfection of contemplation, which if you do not obtain while still a beginner, you will obtain as you progress? Hence she who, afflicted by her rival, had refused to eat, when encouraged by her husband did eat; because she who by sounder counsel despises lowly things, holds the perfection of contemplation in hope, which she does not yet hold in the power of experience. For to contemplation that is nearly failing and collapsed, the joy of renewed hope is food. Therefore at the voice of her husband Anna is refreshed, when the intention of contemplation, shaken by temptation, is roused to hope of her progress by him who had begun to love her. Wherefore, having taken food, she rose, poured out prayers to almighty God, and vowed to him a male child, if she should deserve to receive one from him.
