Those who are endued with might in the love of their Maker are those who are strengthened in the love of God as the object of their desire. Yet they become in the same degree powerless in their own strength. The more strongly they long for the things of eternity, the more they are disenchanted with earthly objects. The failure of their self-assertive strength is wholesome. Hence the psalmist, wearied by the strength of his love, said, “My soul has fainted in your salvation.” For his soul did faint while making way in God’s salvation, in that he panted with desire for the light of eternity, broken of all confidence in the flesh. Hence he says again, “My soul longs, yes, even faints for the courts of the Lord.” Now when he said “longs,” he added correctly, “and faints,” since that longing for the divine Being is small indeed if not similarly followed by a fainting in one’s self. For it is fitting that one who is inflamed to seek the courts of eternity should be weakened in his love of his temporal state. He should become cold to the pursuits of this world in proportion as he rises with a soul more inflamed to the love of God.… Who else is to be understood by the title of the “taskmaster” other than that insatiate prompter who for once bestowed the coin of deceit upon humanity and from that time has not ceased daily to claim the debt of death? Who lent the man in paradise the money of sin, and by the multiplying of wickedness is daily exacting it with usury? Concerning this taskmaster, the truth is spoken in the Gospel, “And the Judge deliver you to the officer.” Therefore, when we hear the voice of this accuser, we are struck with this temptation. But the temptation does not have effect if we resist the one who accuses us.… And it is well added that “the slave is free from his master.” For it is written, “Everyone that sins is the slave of sin.” For whoever yields himself up to evil desire bends the neck of his mind that previously was free to the dominion of wickedness. When we struggle against the evil by which we had been taken captive, when we forcibly resist the bad habit, when we tread under all such desires, we withstand this taskmaster. When we strike our sin with penitence and cleanse the pollution with our tears, we uphold the right of our inborn liberty against this slavery.
