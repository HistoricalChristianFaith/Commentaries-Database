Mor., xxxv. 6: In “sackcloth” is the roughness which denotes the pricking of the conscience for sin, “ashes” denote the dust of the dead; and both are wontto be employed in penitence, that the pricking of the sackcloth may remind us of our sins, and the dust of the ash may cause us to reflect what we have become by judgment.
