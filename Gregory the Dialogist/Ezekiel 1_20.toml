"Wherever the spirit went, the wheels were equally lifted as the spirit went there, following it."

For wherever the spirit of the reader tends, there the divine utterances are also lifted up, because if you seek something lofty in them by seeing and understanding, these same sacred utterances grow with you, ascend with you to higher things. And it is well said of these same wheels: Following him. For if the spirit of the reader seeks to know something moral or historical in them, the moral sense of history follows him. If something typological, the figurative speech is immediately recognized. If something contemplative, at once the wheels as it were receive wings and are suspended in the air, because in the words of sacred utterance heavenly understanding is opened. Therefore wherever the spirit went, there as the spirit went the wheels were likewise lifted up, following him. For the wheels follow the spirit, because the words of sacred utterance, as has often been said already, grow in understanding according to the perception of the readers.

In one and the same sentence of Scripture, one person is nourished by history alone, another seeks the typical meaning, and yet another seeks the contemplative understanding through the type. And it often happens that, as has been said, in one and the same sentence all three can be found together. For when Moses had been called from the burning bush, he drew nearer to see the sight, and behold, the bush was burning and was not consumed. This is a great miracle. If you seek only the history in it, there is something by which the mind of the reader may be nourished, so that you see fire burning in wood and not consuming it. But if you seek the typical understanding, what does the flame signify but the law, of which it is written: "In his right hand a fiery law"? And what did that bush designate but the Jewish people, beset with the thorns of their sins? But the burning bush could not be consumed, because the Jewish people both received the fire of the law and yet did not abandon the thorns of their sins, nor did the flame of the divine word burn up their vices. Perhaps in this event another person desires to contemplate greater things through the type. Because his understanding grows, the wheels are likewise raised. For among men the only-begotten Son of God became perfect man, who had no sins of his own but took upon himself the thorns of our wickedness, and deigned to be humbled even to the passion for us, and to receive in himself the fire of our tribulation. But he burned and did not burn, because he both died according to his humanity and yet remained immortal according to his divinity. He received from us that by which a sacrifice might be made for us, and yet remained impassible and unchangeable in his own nature, so that he might change us from our condition. Perhaps one person seeks morality through history, and another seeks contemplation through allegorical understanding. According to history, what is written in the law is clear to all: that when a turtledove is offered for sin, its head should be turned back to its wings, so that it clings to the neck and is not completely broken off. In these words the historical sense is not doubtful to readers. But if you seek to understand these things morally, the wheel is set in motion when the sentence of the sacred word is brought to moral understanding. For we ourselves ought to be a turtledove in the sacrifice of almighty God, so that our head is turned back to the wings, that is, our mind to the virtues. For not without reason do we understand the mind by the head, because just as the head rules the body, so the mind rules actions. But the head is commanded to be turned back to the wings, so that you do what you say and join your mouth to your works. Nor should the head be cut off in such a way that it is separated from the body, but when partially cut, it is commanded to cling to its body, because clearly our mind must be cut away from carnal pleasure, but must not be cut away from necessary care of the flesh. For hence it is written: "Make no provision for the flesh in its lusts." What is therefore forbidden to be done in lusts is without doubt permitted in necessity. The head of the turtledove, therefore, is partially cut off and partially clings, so that, as has been said, our mind is both cut away from the will of the flesh and yet is not cut off from necessity. What if another person seeks this kind of sacrifice for contemplation under the typical understanding of our Redeemer? Let the mind ascend to higher things, let the living creatures be raised up, so that the wheels may likewise be raised up. For who is our head but the Redeemer of the human race? Of whom it is written: "He gave him as head over all the Church, which is his body." When the Jews persecuted him, they tried to destroy his name from the earth. And when they saw him crucified and buried, they believed they had separated him from the love of all. But the head of the turtledove was both cut and yet not separated from its body, because from the fact that he endured death for us, he more truly joined all of us to himself in his very death; and through the fact that he visibly withdrew himself from our eyes, he invisibly rooted himself in our minds. The head of the turtledove, therefore, when cut, clung to the body, because our Redeemer indeed suffered for us, but was not separated from us through his passion. Since therefore the words of sacred speech grow with the spirit of the readers, it is rightly now said: "Wherever the spirit went, there the wheels were likewise raised up as the spirit went, following it." And it is added: "For the spirit of life was in the wheels."

In the wheels there is the spirit of life, because through the sacred utterances we are vivified by the gift of the spirit, so that we may drive away deadly works from ourselves. It can also be understood that the spirit goes when God touches the mind of the reader in various ways and orders, when arousing him now through the words of sacred utterance to zeal, He raises him to vengeance, now softens him to patience, now instructs him in preaching, now pierces him to the lamentations of penitence. But let us run briefly through these same words which we have spoken, and let us see how the wheels follow the spirit, which is called the spirit of life, and is said to be within the wheels. Certainly if the spirit of life has touched the mind of the reader in the fervor of zeal, immediately in the sacred utterances he sees that Moses, returning to the camp and recognizing that the people had sinned through idols, laid them low with swords through the fervor of the spirit; that Phinehas, by pursuing lust, appeased the wrath of the Lord with the sword; that Peter struck down and killed those who lied to him with a word; that Paul threatens negligent disciples with the rod.

If the spirit of life touches the soul of the reader to maintain patience, immediately the wheels also follow, because in the sacred scriptures he finds that Moses and Aaron, when speaking rightly they suffered persecution from the people, ran to the tabernacle, praying for the very people whom they were fleeing. Their holy mind both endured the swelling pride of the arrogant, and yet did not burst forth against them into hatred. For true patience is that which loves the very one whom it bears. For to tolerate but to hate is not the virtue of meekness, but a covering for fury. In those same scriptures he finds that Samuel, cast down from leadership, confesses that he even prayed for those who cast him down; that none of the saints arrived at heavenly glory except by maintaining patience; that the very author of the human race endured spitting, blows, a crown of thorns, the cross, and the lance, and yet prayed for his persecutors.

If the spirit of life rouses the reader's mind to zeal for preaching, immediately the wheels follow as well, because in the sacred Scriptures he finds how Moses, at the Lord's command, raised himself up against the king of Egypt with such words of free preaching; what Stephen said to the faithless Jews: "You have always resisted the Holy Spirit," and he did not fear even amid the stones; what Peter, beaten with rods and told not to speak in the name of Jesus, replied with great boldness: "We must obey God rather than men"; that Paul is bound with the chains of fetters, yet nevertheless the word of God is not bound.

If the spirit of life stirs one to the laments of repentance, the wheels immediately follow, as the words of Holy Scripture present David repenting; because when he was rebuked by the prophet, since he had not been subject to the heavenly King, he was not ashamed to confess to the rebuking subject what he had done; because the publican, who recognized the guilt of his wickedness, even though he came to the temple unjust, returned from the temple justified; because Peter washed away the stains of his denial with tears; because the thief who recognized his guilt on the cross found pardon in death itself.
