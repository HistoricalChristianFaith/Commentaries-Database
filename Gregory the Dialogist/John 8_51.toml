But when the perversity of the wicked increases, not only should we not cease to preach but we should even intensify our efforts. The Lord counsels us to do this by his example. After he was said to have a demon, he extended the benefits of his preaching when he said, “Truly, truly, I say to you, if anyone keeps my word, he will not see death forever.”
