18. For he also brought forth lamentations of his own sorrow, saying: "I have great sadness, and continual sorrow in my heart: for I could wish that I myself were accursed from Christ for my brethren, who are my kinsmen according to the flesh" (Rom. 9:2, 3). And because he did not receive joy from their conversion, it is added: (Verse 7.) And she did not take food. She would indeed have taken food if she had received the refreshment of joy from the complete conversion of Judea. Therefore she who wept did not receive food, because she who grieved over the perishing of Judea did not receive joy from its salvation. But the food of joy, which is not given to the holy Church from the conversion of the Jews, is offered through the encouragement of the bridegroom. For the words of his preaching, even if reprobate hearers do not receive them, nevertheless are not without the reward of recompense. For Almighty God both rewards what is bestowed upon the reprobate without the benefit of the reprobate; and what they inflict upon the elect preachers by way of adversity, He weighs out to them through the balance of just examination as the gain of recompense. Whence it is fittingly added: (Verse 8.) Therefore Elkanah her husband said to her: Anna, why do you weep? And why do you not eat? And why is your heart afflicted? Am I not better to you than ten sons?

(Moral Exposition) For in weeping the burning desire for divine contemplation is shown, while in the disdaining of food the contempt for passing joy is displayed. For the mind that desires inward things with fervent longings, while it rejects the enticement of earthly joy, while with urgent groans it seeks the pleasantness of supernal light to be poured into it, surely weeps and does not take food. For he who said was loathing this food: "My soul refused to be comforted" (Psalm 77:3). But he who disdained to take the food of solace from the delight of created things, because he found the banquet of his delights in the Creator alone, says: "I remembered God and was delighted" (Ibid., 4).
