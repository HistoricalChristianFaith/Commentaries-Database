The question also arises as to why, after his resurrection, the Lord stood on the shore while his disciples were laboring in the sea, when before his resurrection he walked on the waves of the sea in his disciples’ sight.… What does the sea indicate but this present age, which is tossed about by the uproar of circumstances and the waves of this corruptible life? What does the solidity of the shore signify but the uninterrupted continuity of eternal peace? Therefore since the disciples were still held in the waves of this mortal life, they were laboring on the sea. But since our Redeemer had already passed beyond his perishable body, after his resurrection he stood on the shore.

Why was Peter the one who brought the net to land? Our holy church had been entrusted to him. It was to him individually that it was said, “Simon, son of John, do you love me? Feed my sheep.” What was afterward disclosed to him in words was now indicated to him by an action. Because the church’s preacher was to part us from the waves of this world, it was surely necessary that Peter bring the net full of fish to land. He dragged the fish to the firm ground of the shore because by his preaching he revealed to the faithful the stability of our eternal home. He accomplished this by his words and by his letters, and he accomplishes it daily by his miraculous signs.… When the net is said to be full of large fish, we are told how many, namely, 153.

Seven and ten multiplied by three make fifty-one.… The fiftieth year was a year of rest to the whole people from all their work. In unity is true rest. For where division is, true rest cannot be.
