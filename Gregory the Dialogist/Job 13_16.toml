49.  Whereas we know that the Judge, when He cometh, will set the sheep on His right hand, but the goats on His left, with what reason is it now said, ‘that the hypocrite shall not come before Him,’ when, if he be among the goats, he will appear on the left hand of the Judge?  But we are to bear in mind that we come before the Lord in two ways.  One, whereby taking exact account of our offences here we punish and judge ourselves before Him with weeping.  For as often as we recall to our perception the power of our Creator, we as often, as it were, stand before Him.’  Hence too it is well said by Elijah, the man of God, The Lord God of Israel liveth, before Whom I stand [1 Kings 17, 1].  In another way we ‘come before God,’ when at the last Judgment we present ourselves before His Tribunal.  And thus the hypocrite in the last reckoning does come before the Judge, but because now he shuts his eyes to consider and bewail transgressions, he refuses to ‘come before’ the Lord.  For as righteous men, when they fix their eyes on the severity of the Judge that shall come, recall their sins to remembrance, bewail the things that they have done, and judge themselves severely that they be not judged; so hypocrites, as they outwardly please the world, hence omit to look inwardly into themselves, and wholly engross themselves in the words of their neighbours, and account themselves to be holy, because they consider that they are so accounted by their fellow-creatures.  And when they have dissipated their mind in the words that sound their own praises, they never recall it to the cognizance of sin, never mark wherein they offend the interior Judge, entertain no fears concerning His severity, for they believe that they have pleased Him as they have their fellow-creatures.  Yet if they but brought His terribleness to mind, this very circumstance, that fixed in a wrong bias they are making themselves pleasing to their fellow-creatures, would cause them to fear the more.  Therefore it is well said, For an hypocrite shall not come before Him; in that he does not set before his eyes the severity of God, so long as he is ambitious to please the eyes of men.  Who, if he set himself in the presence of God in searching his own conscience, would then assuredly no longer be a hypocrite.
