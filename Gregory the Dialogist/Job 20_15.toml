The hypocrite desires to know the revelations of God, yet [he does] not to practice them. He would speak sagely but not live so. For this reason, then, he does not do what he knows, and even that which he knows he loses. For since he does not unite wholesome practice with his knowledge, despising purity of right practice, he loses the knowledge also. Therefore, the “riches” of the sacred law that he “swallowed” in reading, he vomits in forgetting. And God “casts them out of his belly,” in that what he fails to do is by a righteous judgment rooted altogether out of his memory. God will not allow him to keep the precepts of God with his words only, but which he did not practice in his life. Hence it is said by the prophet, “But to the wicked God said, ‘Why should you declare my statutes? For what reason should you take my covenant in your mouth?’ ” If at any time the hypocrite should seem to retain these words of instruction in his mouth until the end, he will be condemned the more on those very grounds; whereas not even a bad person is ever deprived of the good gift of God. For it is written, “To those who remember his commandments.” … He then that keeps his commandments in mind but never does them, holds in the words of instruction the very sentences by which he is condemned. - "Morals on the Book of Job 15.17"

17.  The hypocrite desires to know the revelations of God, yet not to practise them.  He would speak sagely, but not live so.  For this reason, then, that he does not do what he knows, even that which he knows he loses, that forasmuch as he does not unite pure practice with his knowledge, contemning purity of right practice he loses the knowledge also.  Therefore the ‘riches’ of the Sacred Law, which he ‘swallowed’ in reading, he vomits in forgetting, and God ‘casts them out of his belly,’ in that what he would not observe to do, by a righteous judgment He roots out of his recollection, that at all events he should not keep the precepts of God in the tongue, which he kept not in his life.  Whence it is said by the Prophet; But unto the wicked God saith, What hast thou to do to declare my statutes, and that thou shouldest take my covenant in thy mouth? [Ps. 50, 16]  Which words of instruction if it ever at any time chance that the hypocrite should seem to retain in his mouth until the end, he will be condemned the more on the very grounds, whereon not even a bad man is ever deprived of the good gift of God.  For it is written; To those that remember His commandments to do them. [Ps. 103, 18]  He then that keeps His commandments in mind, but never does them, such an one holds in the words of instruction the sentences whereby he is condemned.
18.  For hence it is written in Zechariah; What seest thou, Zechariah?  And I answered, I see a flying roll; the length thereof is twenty cubits, and the breadth thereof ten cubits.  This said he to me; This is the curse that goeth over the face of the whole earth.  For everyone that stealeth shall be judged as on this side according to it. [Zech. 5, 2. 3.]  For what is a ‘flying roll’ saving Holy Writ, which whilst it tells us of heavenly themes, lifts up the bent of the mind to things on high; for while we see that it is above us, we leave minding, i.e. desiring things below.  And it is described as having ‘a breadth of ten cubits’ and a ‘length of twenty cubits,’ in that the breadth of our practice is single, and the long expectance of hope is extended to double, since in return for our good practice both here there is peace of mind, and there eternal joys in store for us, as Truth bears witness, Who saith; And everyone that hath forsaken houses or lands, &c. shall receive an hundredfold, and shall inherit everlasting life. [Matt. 19, 29]  For the number one hundred is completed by the number ten multiplied ten times.  Thus he gets back an hundredfold [perhaps ‘an hundredfold here.’  (reading Hic.)], who, though he has nothing, by the mere perfection of his mind alone, no longer seeks to possess any thing in this world.  And in this way, since by this same we have a double measure paid back to us for a single one, that roll is justly drawn out through twenty cubits in length, which is carried out in breadth through ten.  But because these very sacred oracles stand for eternal condemnation to those who either will not acquaint themselves with them, or in any wise when made acquainted with them set them at nought, it is rightly said of this roll, This is the curse, which goeth forth over the face of the whole earth.  And wherefore it is called a curse is added; For everyone that is a thief, as it is therein written, shall be judged.  Therefore the hypocrite, as he cares not to live after the words of the law which he knows, and seeks golden opinions by store of instruction, will be ‘a thief to be judged,’ since by this, that he speaks just words, he usurps to himself the praise of the just man’s life.
