With the truth of history preserved, the divine utterances sometimes designate causes from time, sometimes from place, which they do not indicate by open speech. From time indeed, as when the Lord was preaching to the Jews it is said through the evangelist: "It was winter." For among those mysteries which the Truth was speaking, what was the reason for adding the name of winter, unless to show through the quality of the time the coldness of heart? Because even when they were receiving the words of truth, the hearts of the Jews remained cold. Sometimes indeed from place, as when to the carnal Israelite people, with Moses descending from the mountain, the law was given in the plains; and to the holy apostles the Lord sitting on the mountain spoke the highest and spiritual precepts, so that from the places it might be shown that to those as carnal ones the least commandments were given in the valley of the earth, and these as spiritual and holy ones might hear the heavenly commandments on the mountain, so that it might be openly shown that those ascending in heart to heavenly things would leave behind the lowest things of the world and would stand on the summit of the mind. Hence now the prophet Ezekiel describes what he did in places at God's command, so that through the qualities of places he might indicate what would follow in the future concerning the mysteries of the prophecy. For behold he says: "The hand of the Lord came upon me, and he said to me: Arise, go out into the plain, and there I will speak with you."

What is the meaning of this, that previously the Lord had spoken to His prophet in the midst of the Israelites, and yet afterward He says: "Go out into the plain, and there I will speak with you," unless that He deigned both to pour out the grace of His prophecy first upon Judea, and afterward to demonstrate it in the breadth of the Gentiles? For not without reason is the Gentile world designated by the plain, which extends far and wide, that is, throughout the entire world.

For what is it that the prophet is commanded to go out to the plain, except that everyone who preaches, on account of those placed outside himself whom he corrects and restrains from iniquity, goes out to the plain by speaking? And there he sees the glory of the Lord, because he receives the grace of teaching all the more abundantly as he extends himself in the labor of preaching out of love for his neighbors. Therefore by going out he is led into a lofty vision, because from that source by which he illuminates the blindness of ignorance in the hearts of others through the ministry of his speech, from that same source heavenly grace exalts him to a higher understanding.
