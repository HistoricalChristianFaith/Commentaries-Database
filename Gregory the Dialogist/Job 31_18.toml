28. For though commiseration was a thing at his own command, that it should gain growth with himself, yet it is plain that it was not a thing at his own command that it should ‘come forth from the womb along with himself.’ Therefore it is plain that he attributes nothing to his own goodness, in that surely he bears witness that he received this same by the gift of his creation. The good then which he implies that he had derived from his creation, it is assuredly plain that he tells to the praise of the Creator, showing that it was from Him and no other that he had obtained that he should he pitiful, from Whom he obtained that he should be; because as by his own act he was not created in the womb, so neither by his own goodness was he full of pity from the womb. But it is to be taken thought of by us that he declares; it grew up with me. For there are some who as they grow to years, go off from innocency. But whilst to the Elect the age of the body increases without, within, if it may be allowed to say so, the age of virtue increases.
