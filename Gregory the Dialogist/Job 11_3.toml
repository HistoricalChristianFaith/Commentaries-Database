3.  The uninstructed mind, as we have said, is sorely galled by the sentences of truth, and reckons silence to be a punishment; it takes all that is said aright to be the disgrace of mocking at itself.  For when a true voice addresses itself to the ears of bad men, guilt stings the recollection, and in the rebuking of evil practices, in proportion as the mind is touched with consciousness within, it is stirred up to eagerness in gainsaying without; it cannot bear the voice, in that, being touched in the wound of its guilt it is put to pain, and by that which is delivered against the wicked generally, it imagines that it is itself attacked in a special manner; and what it inwardly remembers itself to have done, it blushes to hear the sound of without.  Whence it presently prepares itself for a defence, that it may cover the shame of its guilt by words of froward gainsaying.  For as the righteous, touching certain things which have been done unrighteously by them, account the voice of rebuke to be the service of charity so the froward reckon it to be the insult of mockery.  The one sort immediately prostrate themselves to show obedience, the other are lifted up to show the madness of self-defence.  The one sort take the helping hand of correction as the upholding of their life, by means of which whilst the sin of the present life is corrected, the wrath of the Judge that is to come is abated; the other, when they find themselves assailed by rebuke, see therein the sword of smiting, in that whilst sin is unclothed by the voice of chiding, the conceit of present glory is spoilt.  Hence ‘Truth’ says by Solomon in commendation of the righteous man, Give instruction to a wise man, and he will hasten to receive it [Prov. 9, 9]; hence he makes nothing of the obstinacy of the wicked, saying, He that reproveth a scorner getteth to himself wrong [ver. 7].  For it generally happens that when they cannot defend the evils that are reproved in them, they are rendered worse from a feeling of shame, and carry themselves so high in their defence of themselves, that they rake out bad points to urge against the life of the reprover, and so they do not account themselves guilty, if they fasten guilty deeds upon the heads of others also.  And when they are unable to find true ones, they feign them, that they may also themselves have things they may seem to rebuke with no inferior degree of justice.  Hence Zophar, for that it stung him to be as it were mocked at by reproof, forthwith subjoins with lying lips.
