37. But this ought to be so understood, as to be referred to his body also; because all wicked men who fear not the strictness of Divine justice, flatter themselves in vain on His compassion. And He presently returns to console us, and foretels his coming destruction at the last judgment, saying; And in the sight of all he shall be cast down. For he will be cast down in the sight of all, because when the eternal Judge then terribly appears, when legions of Angels stand at His side, when the whole ministry of heavenly Powers is attending, and all the Elect are brought to behold this spectacle, this cruel and mighty monster is brought captive into the midst, and with his own body, that is, with all reprobates, is consigned to the eternal fires of hell, when it is said, Depart from Me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, which was prepared for the devil and his angels. [Matt. 25, 41] O what a spectacle will that be, when this most huge monster will be displayed to the eyes of the Elect, which at this time of contest, could he but be seen, might have too much terrified them! But it is so ordered by the secret and wonderful judgment of God, that he is now conquered by His grace, though not seen by the combatants, and that then he is beheld by the joyful victors as already captive. But they then learn more fully how much they are indebted to the Divine assistance, when they have once seen so mighty a beast, whom they have now conquered in their weakness; and behold in the huge size of their enemy, how much they owe to the grace of their Defender. For our soldiers then return from this battle bringing back the trophies of their virtues; and when, having recovered their bodies, they are now about to obtain, in that judgment, an admission to the heavenly kingdom, they behold first the most monstrous strength of this ancient serpent, that they may not esteem lightly the danger they have escaped. It is therefore well said; And in the sight of all he will be cast down, because the sight of his death then causes joy, whose life, being now endured, daily engages with tortures in contest with the just. But as if we should immediately complain on hearing these things, and should say to the Lord, ‘O Lord, Who art not ignorant that this Leviathan is of such great strength, why dost Thou arouse him to engage in contest with our weakness?’

He will fall down before everybody’s eyes, because, when the Judge appears in his awesome aspect, before the eyes of the angelic legions, before the eyes of the entire court of the heavenly powers and before the eyes of all the elect summoned to this spectacle, this cruel and strong beast will be brought among them in chains, and together with its body, that is, all the wicked, will be condemned to the eternal fire of Gehenna. - "Morals on the Book of Job 33.37"

“Will you fill nets with its skin and the cabin of fish with its head?” What is designated by “nets” or a “cabin of fish” except the churches of the faithful that make one universal church? Hence it is written in the Gospel, “The kingdom of heaven is like a net cast into the sea and gathering of every kind of fish.” “Will you fill nets with its skin and the cabin of fish with its head?” What is designated by “nets” or a “cabin of fish” except the churches of the faithful that make one universal church? Hence it is written in the Gospel, “The kingdom of heaven is like a net cast into the sea and gathering of every kind of fish.” The church is in truth called the kingdom of heaven, for while the Lord exalts its conduct to things above, it already reigns herself in toward the Lord by heavenly conversation. And the church is also rightly compared with a net cast into the sea, gathering every kind of fish, because when cast into this Gentile world, it rejected no one but caught the wicked with the good, the proud with the humble, the angry with the gentle and the foolish with the wise. By the “skin” of this Leviathan, we understand the foolish, and by “its head,” the wise ones of its body. Or certainly by the “skin,” which is outermost, are designated those who serve it as inferiors in these lowest offices, but by the “head” those placed over them. And the Lord observing the proper order rightly declares that he will fill these “nets” or “cabin of fish,” that is, his church, and the wishes of the faithful with its “skin” first and then with its “head.” - "Morals on the Book of Job 33.34"
