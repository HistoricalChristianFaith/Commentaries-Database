52. Divine grace bestows upon the children of the holy Church for this purpose: that it may instruct them in the doctrine of truth, adorn them with good morals, watch over them with pious guardianship, make them perfectly turn away from evil, and prepare a sufficient abundance of good works for the eternal homeland. These indeed are the duties of pastoral ministry, but the chosen preacher doubts that he can fulfill them by his own strength. Therefore, since he cannot beget any through the Gospel by his own virtue, nor guard those whom he begets, rightly through Anna in the type of the Church it is now said: "I prayed, and the Lord gave me my petition which I asked of him. Therefore I also have lent him to the Lord, for all the days that he shall be lent to the Lord." For she implores that she may be able to beget; and that those whom she obtains by praying may remain in holy conduct, she likewise commends them to almighty God through prayers. And because she never ceases from these prayers, she says that she commends her son to God for all days. For to commend a son to the Lord for all days is to supplicate him for the salvation of those whom she begets throughout all the time of this life. For the days in which we are commended to the Lord signify the times of the present life. In which days indeed we need the aids of divine protection all the more strongly, the more heavily we are attacked by the temptations of malignant spirits. But since in many codices it is read not "commended" but "lent," this is not without good meaning. For sons are lent by mother Church in this life. But whatever we lend, we expect to be returned to us in the faith of the one receiving it. The days are indeed the brilliances of spiritual virtues. In which days certainly Anna's son is lent to the Lord, because the holy Church offers the elect to him in the brilliance of virtues, so that almighty God may afterward present them to himself for the increase of his eternal joy in the splendors of rewards. And it should be noted that he is declared commended for all days, so that nothing may be lacking to him of what must be had from spiritual conduct, whom the chosen preacher will not be able to receive in eternal life as darkened in any part. There follows:
