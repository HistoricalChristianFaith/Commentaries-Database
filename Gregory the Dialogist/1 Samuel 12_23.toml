Why is it that Moses and Samuel are preferred to all the other fathers in this matter of making requests if it is not that these two alone in the whole history of the Old Testament are said to have prayed earnestly even for their enemies? One of them the people attacked with stones, and yet he prayed to his Lord for those who were stoning him. The other was deposed from his position of leadership, and yet when he was asked to make supplication he yielded, saying, “Far be it from me that I should sin against the Lord by ceasing to pray for you.”
