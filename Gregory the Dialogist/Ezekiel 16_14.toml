Since it often happens when preaching is abundantly poured forth in fitting ways that the mind of the speaker is elevated in itself by a hidden delight in self-display, the preacher may exercise great care, lest he who prescribes remedies for the diseases of others should himself succumb through neglect of his own health, lest in helping others he desert himself, lest in lifting up others he fall. For to some the greatness of their virtue has often been the occasion of their perdition. causing them, while inordinately secure in their own strength, to die unexpectedly through negligence. For as virtue strives with vices, the mind flatters itself with a certain delight in it. And it comes to pass that the soul of a well-doer casts aside cautious circumspection and rests secure in self-confidence. And now while the well-doer is in a lazy state, the cunning seducer enumerates all things that it has done well and encourages him in his pride to think himself superior in all beside.â€¦The mind is lifted up by confidence in its beauty, when, glad for the merits of its virtues, it glories within itself in security. But through this same confidence it is led to play the harlot, because, when the soul is deceived by its own thoughts, malignant spirits, which take possession of it, defile it through the seduction of innumerable vices.
