Hom in Ev. vi. 2: This He proposes, not to assert, but to deny. For if but abreath of air touch a reed, it bends it one way or other; a type of the carnal mind, which leans to either side, according as the breath of praise or detraction reaches it.A reed shaken by the wind John was not, for no variety of circumstance bent him from his uprightness. The Lord’s meaning then is.
Hom in Ev., vi., 3: Let no one suppose that there is nothing sinful in luxury and rich dress; if pursuit of such things had been blameless, the Lord would not have thus commended John for the coarseness of his raiment, nor would Peter have checked the desire of fine clothes in women as he does, “Not in costly raiment.” .
Hom. in Ev., vi. 5: The office of a prophet is to foretel things to come, notto show them present. John therefore is more than a prophet, because Him whom he had foretold by going before Him, the same he showed as present by pointing Him out.
Also John was not “clothed in soft raiment,” that is, he did not encourage sinners in their sinful life by speaking smooth things, but rebuked them with sharpness and rigour, saying, “Generation of vipers”
