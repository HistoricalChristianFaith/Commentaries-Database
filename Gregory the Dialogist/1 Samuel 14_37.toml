What does it mean that the words of the consulting king, which the people praise, the priest declares must be brought before the Lord, except that obscure and great matters, which escape the simple, are never rightly ordered if we do not seek their outcome in the sanctuary of the mind through careful meditation? For to approach the Lord is to know His will through secret contemplation. And it is rightly called an approach, because we move from external things to internal ones when we try to know the outcome of our work in the divine will. For he who seeks hidden and inward things yet does not leave behind external things does not find those things which he does not know how to reach. Therefore, when counsel is sought from us concerning hidden matters, let us approach the Lord, so that what must be done is set forth only when it is known in the divine will. For many things seem to be good and are not. Many things indeed must be done, but they are done more profitably if they are reserved for the fitting time. Some things, moreover, certain people ought to do, while others ought not. If any chosen one neglects to see these things in the secret place of meditation, he certainly does not arrange them in right order. But on the contrary, he who is accustomed to examine these things or to act upon them through meditation knows not only what must be done but also what must be avoided. Whence it is also rightly said: Saul consulted the Lord, and the Lord did not answer him on that day.

The day is a thought of the mind which is considered good and is not recognized for what it truly is. For while it pretends to be good, it carries, as it were, light. In that day, therefore, the Lord did not answer the one consulting him, because the word of God cannot agree with evil deliberation. Indeed, through the answer of a word we are accustomed to reveal the sense of our innermost will. In that day, therefore, the Lord does not answer, because almighty God is not discerned in the feigned light of thought — he who is always found in the brightness of truth. And it should be noted that he who gave the counsel of approaching the Lord was a priest. For what is holier than the counsel of approaching God? We are therefore priests as often as we minister good counsels to our brothers. For nothing more sacred can be given than that by which each person ought to go to the Creator. But since we are describing the order of spiritual warfare, we ought to connect what came before with what follows.

The word of Saul was indeed such that he would so devastate the Philistines that he would not leave a single man among them. This can also be understood as follows: because he wished to destroy the Philistines in such a way that none of them would be able to wage war any further. Great indeed is this day of the mind, in which eternal things are so sought that no temporal enemy is left alive from the slaughter. But because it is granted to no one to conquer so completely in time that he need not fight at all times, it is rightly said: "The Lord did not answer him on that day." The answering of God pertains not only to His intimate word, but also to His grace and gift. For when He graciously grants what is piously requested, He is said to answer. Therefore the Lord does not answer on that day, because He indeed permits the elect to conquer, but He leaves their enemies, as it were, alive, so that they may find those against whom they must always fight. Yet if this is said because Jonathan's fault is being concealed, a great fear is struck into those who hold authority. The son sins, and He denies a response to his father. One man is also found to have transgressed, yet on account of the fault of one, all are afraid to pursue their enemies. What is signified by this event, except that the sins of subjects harm not only themselves, but also their superiors and those living in community with them? But since this hidden fault is investigated by the king, let us now see with what loftiness all hidden things are sought out.
