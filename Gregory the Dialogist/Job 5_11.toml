“Those below are set on high,” in that they, who are now despised for the love of God, shall return as judges along with God. The “Truth” pledges this which we have just named to the same humble ones, saying, “You who have followed me, in the regeneration, when the Son of man shall sit on the throne of his glory, you also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.” Then “those that mourn the Lord safely exalt,” because the desire for him is inflaming them; they flee prosperity, endure crosses, undergo tortures at the hands of persecutors, chasten their own selves with grieving. They are then promised a safety so much the more exalted that they now, from devout affection, consider themselves dead to all the joys of the world. Hence it is said by Solomon, “The heart knows his own soul’s bitterness, and a stranger does not meddle impertinently with his joy.” For the human mind “knows its own soul’s bitterness.” When inflamed with aspirations after the eternal land, it learns by weeping its pilgrimage’s sorrow. But “the stranger does not meddle impertinently with his joy” in that he, who is now a stranger to the grief of compunction, is not then a partaker in the joy of consolation.
