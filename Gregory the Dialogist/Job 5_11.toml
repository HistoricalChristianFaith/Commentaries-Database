26.  It is well said then, Who setteth up on high those that be low.  And it is fitly added, And those which mourn He exalteth with safety.  Oftentimes in this world even any that be glad of heart are ‘exalted,’ whilst they are swoln by the mere gloriousness of their fortune, but ‘those that mourn, the Lord exalts to safety,’ in that he raises His sorrowing children to glory by the solid substance of true joy; for they are exalted by safety, and not by madness, who, set fast in good works, rejoice with a sure hope in God.  For there are some, as we have said, who both do misdeeds, and yet do not cease to rejoice.  Of whom Solomon saith, Who rejoice to do evil, and delight in the things that be froward. [Prov. 2, 14]  And again, There be wicked men, who are as secure, as though they had the deeds of the righteous. [Ecc. 8, 14. Vulg.]  These, truly, are not ‘exalted by safety,’ but by foolishness, which same are full of pride when they ought to be loaded with sorrow, and for the very reason that these wretched persons let themselves out in exultation, they are wept over by all good men.  Verily not unlike to the senses of madmen, they account that insanity, in which they surpass others, to be strength.  They know not that it comes from disease, that they are able to do more than the sane, and they as it were esteem themselves to have increased in powers, whilst they are drawing near to the end of life by accessions of sickness.  These because they have no perception of reason, are wept for, and they laugh, and they expand in an extraordinary exultation of heart, in the very same proportion that from insensibility they are ignorant of the evil they are undergoing.  Those then that ‘mourn’ the Lord ‘exalts with safety,’ in that the mind of the Elect is full of joy, derived, not from the madness of the present life, but from the certain prospect of eternal salvation.

“Those below are set on high,” in that they, who are now despised for the love of God, shall return as judges along with God. The “Truth” pledges this which we have just named to the same humble ones, saying, “You who have followed me, in the regeneration, when the Son of man shall sit on the throne of his glory, you also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.” Then “those that mourn the Lord safely exalt,” because the desire for him is inflaming them; they flee prosperity, endure crosses, undergo tortures at the hands of persecutors, chasten their own selves with grieving. They are then promised a safety so much the more exalted that they now, from devout affection, consider themselves dead to all the joys of the world. Hence it is said by Solomon, “The heart knows his own soul’s bitterness, and a stranger does not meddle impertinently with his joy.” For the human mind “knows its own soul’s bitterness.” When inflamed with aspirations after the eternal land, it learns by weeping its pilgrimage’s sorrow. But “the stranger does not meddle impertinently with his joy” in that he, who is now a stranger to the grief of compunction, is not then a partaker in the joy of consolation.
