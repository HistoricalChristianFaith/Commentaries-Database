But the mind of unbelievers suffered grave scandal in him when they saw him dying even after so many miracles. Hence Paul also says: "But we preach Christ crucified, to the Jews indeed a scandal, but to the Gentiles foolishness." For it seemed foolish to men that the author of life should die for mankind; and from this, man took scandal against him, from which he ought rather to have become more indebted. For God is to be honored by men all the more worthily, the more he undertook even unworthy things for mankind. What therefore does it mean to say: "Blessed is he who is not scandalized in me," except to signify openly the abjection and humility of his death? As if he were plainly saying: I indeed do wondrous things, but I do not disdain to suffer humble things. Therefore, since I follow you in dying, men must take great care not to despise in me the death, while they venerate the signs.
