26.  For when the several mystical truths are recognised in the secret words of the Prophets by them that believe, what else is it, than that ‘deep things are discovered out of darkness?’  Whence too ‘Truth’ Himself, speaking in parables to the disciples, saith, What I tell you in darkness, that speak ye in light. [Matt. 10, 27]  For when by explaining we unravel the mystical knots of allegories, then we as it were ‘speak in light, what we have heard in darkness.’  Now ‘the shadow of death’ was the hardness of the old Law, which made every one that sinned liable to be punished with the death of the body.  But when our Redeemer tempered by mildness the harshness of the sanctions of the Law, nor any longer ordained death of the flesh to be inflicted for sin, but showed how greatly the death of the spirit was to be dreaded, then, surely, ‘He brought out to light the shadow of death.’  For this death, wherein the flesh is severed from the soul, is a ‘shadow’ of that death, wherein the soul is severed from God, and so ‘the shadow of death is brought out to light,’ when, upon the death of the spirit being understood, the death of the body is no whit feared.  Which may likewise be understood in another sense also.
For those are not unjustly called ‘princes,’ who with great judiciousness of counsel rule the thoughts of their hearts at all times, and by the power of wisdom keep down all the motions of folly.  But it very often happens that the mind is in secret lifted up on the grounds of its very wisdom to the topmost pitch of pride, and is brought to the ground under those evil habits, over which it was rejoicing to have gained the victory.  Therefore it is well said, He poureth contempt upon princes.  But because it sometimes happens that they who appear to lie prostrate in evil ways have recourse to tears of penitence, and gather themselves up against the sins, to which they were subjected, it is fitly added, And lifteth up those that were oppressed.  For there are some, who, being enlightened by the gift from on high, see in what exceeding filthiness of their sinful doings they lie grovelling, wash with tears the stains of their misdeeds, and henceforth keep down beneath them the motions of the flesh, by which they were aforetime weighed to the ground.
27.  Which same is brought to pass by the excellent disposal of Almighty God, that so in this life every thing should be accounted uncertain, and no man be set up for possessing chastity, seeing that He poureth contempt upon princes, and no man despair from his evil habits weighing him down, seeing that He lifteth up those that were oppressed.  And because, when these things are done, there is brought forth out of the secret counsels of God an open sentence upon each individual, it is lightly subjoined, And revealeth deep things out of darkness.
28.  For the Lord ‘revealeth deep things out of darkness,’ when He manifests an open sentence from His secret counsels, so as to show what He thinks concerning each individual.  For because now the Creator seeth all things, and Himself is not seen in His counsels, it is well said of Him by the Psalmist, He made darkness His secret place. [Ps. 18, 11]  But it is as if He issued out from that darkness into light, when He shows what are His thoughts concerning the actions of each individual.  And whereas when he, who was sunk down by the weight of his sins, is brought to the setting up of uprightness, he for the first time sees that very death, wherein he was going on ruining himself, and at the same time too blind to take account of it; it is lightly added, And bringeth out to light the shadow of death.  For ‘the shadow of death’ is evil doing, which is drawn as if in bodily lineaments by a copy of our old enemy.  Concerning whom too, in the character of a certain one, it is said, And his name was Death. [Rev. 6, 8]  And it very often happens that his evil instigation escapes the minds of men, and by this circumstance, that it is not known, is the more successful.  And so ‘the shadow of death is brought to light,’ in that the evil doing of our old enemy is revealed to the minds of the Saints that it may be made an end of.
