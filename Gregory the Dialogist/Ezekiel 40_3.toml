The translators of the Septuagint do not have a “line of flax” but a “builders’ line.” If in this verse we use their translation for exposition, what shall we take as builders but holy teachers who by speaking spiritual words arrange living stones, that is, the souls of the elect, into a heavenly building? Then whatever the early fathers, the prophets, the apostles, the successors of the apostles said, what was it but the arrangement of stones in this building of the saints, a building that is constructed daily?

He who already stands at the door of his cave and hears the words of God in the ears of his heart must veil his face, because when we are led through heavenly grace to understanding of higher things, the more subtly we are lifted, the more often we should through humility restrain ourselves in our understanding, lest we try to be more wise than is right for us, but to be wise to the point of sobriety.
