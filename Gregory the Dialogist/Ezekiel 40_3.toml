And behold a man, whose appearance was like the appearance of bronze.

He Himself is signified in the man who is figured on the mountain. Moreover, this man is said to measure the building. And rightly is the Lord signified by the man and the mountain, because He Himself arranges all things within holy Church by judging, and He Himself bears that same holy Church, and by bearing it raises it up to heavenly things. So also in the holy Gospel our same Redeemer speaks, saying: "He who enters by the door is the shepherd of the sheep." And shortly after: "I am the door." And again after a little He adds: "I am the good shepherd." If therefore He Himself is the shepherd, and He Himself is the door, and the shepherd enters through the door, why is it not understood in this place that He Himself is both the mountain and the man who measures the building on the mountain?

But we must ask why it is said of this man, "Whose appearance was like the appearance of bronze." Now we all know, brothers, that the metal bronze is very durable, and altogether sonorous. What then does it mean that the appearance of the Mediator of God and men is compared to the appearance of bronze, unless it is what we openly know, that the only-begotten Son, taking the form of a servant, transformed the frailty of human flesh through the glory of his resurrection into eternity, because in him flesh was made now enduringly without end? For rising from the dead he dies no more, death shall no longer have dominion over him. But what does it mean that his very incarnation is compared to a sonorous metal, unless that through that same assumption of our humanity the glory of his majesty resounded to all? And he has, as it were, the appearance of bronze in his body, because God became known to the world through flesh. Hence also through John it is said: "He had written on his garment and on his thigh: King of kings, and Lord of lords." For what is his garment, except the body which he assumed from the Virgin? Yet his garment is not one thing and he himself another. For our garment too is called flesh, yet we ourselves are the flesh with which we are clothed. But Isaiah, beholding this garment of his long before, bloodied with blood through the cross of the passion, said: "Why is your apparel red, and your garments like those of one treading in the winepress?" To which he himself answered: "I have trodden the winepress alone, and of the nations there is no man with me." For he alone trod the winepress in which he was trodden, who by his own power conquered the passion which he endured. For he who suffered even unto the death of the cross rose from death with glory. And it is well said: "And of the nations there is no man with me," because those for whom he had come to suffer ought to have been partakers of his passion, and since at that time they had not yet believed, he complains about them in his passion, whose life was being sought in that passion. By the thigh indeed is meant the propagation of flesh. Because therefore through the propagation of the human race, as the orders of generations are described by Matthew or Luke narrating, he came into this world from a virgin, and through the mystery of his incarnation indicated to all nations everywhere that he was King and Lord, he had written on his garment and on his thigh: "King of kings, and Lord of lords." For where he became known in the world, there he impressed the knowledge of reading about himself. Therefore his preaching through flesh is like a certain sound from bronze. Let it therefore rightly be said: "Whose appearance was like the appearance of bronze."

"And a linen cord in his hand."

In the Septuagint translators, a linen cord is not found, but a mason's cord. If we hold to their translation in this verse for the purpose of exposition, what else do we understand by masons than holy teachers, who, by speaking spiritual things, assemble living stones, that is, the souls of the elect, for the heavenly building? For whatever the ancient fathers spoke, whatever the prophets, whatever the apostles, whatever the successors of the apostles spoke—what else was it but the arrangement of stones in this construction of the saints that is built daily? Now with a mason's cord, this is customarily done: that the evenness or straightness of the rising wall may be recognized; and if a stone is too far inward, it may be cast outward; if it projects too far outward, it may be called back inward. And certainly the preaching of teachers does this daily: that any soul for whom it is perhaps not expedient to undertake the burdens of governance, even if it desires to appear outwardly, may be called back inward; and again, one who wishes to remain hidden and care only for itself, if it can be useful to itself and to many, even when it desires to remain hidden, may be brought forth outwardly to appear. And so it happens that the order of holy stones is maintained, since often one wishing to come to honor is repelled, and one fleeing honor is elevated to the height of sacred office. But since, as we have learned through our translator, the Hebrew text does not have "of masons," but "a linen cord in his hand," we ought to expound what is held more certainly among us. Now we know that a linen cord is finer than if cords were made from something else. And what should we understand by the linen cord except the more refined preaching, that is, the spiritual? For the censure of the law was a cord, but it was not linen, because it restrained an uncultivated people not with refined preaching, in which through the sentence of punishment it cut off not sins of thought but of deed. But after the Lord through himself bound even the thoughts of men by preaching, and made known that sin is complete even in the heart, he held a linen cord in his hand. For he says: "You have heard that it was said to those of old: You shall not commit adultery; but I say to you that whoever looks at a woman to lust after her has already committed adultery with her in his heart." Therefore the linen cord is the refined preaching that binds the mind of the hearer, lest it dissolve itself even in wretched thought. And it should be noted that it says the cord is in his hand, that is, preaching is in action. For he showed in himself everything that he taught, as it is written: "What Jesus began to do and to teach."

And because he also committed to Scripture the very things he said, so that they might be handed down to posterity, it is rightly added: "And a measuring reed in his hand."

The Lord promises concerning holy Church through another prophet, saying: "There shall spring up in her the greenness of the reed and the rush." I remember having explained this in another place, that by the reed we should understand writers, and by the rush, hearers. But since both rush and reed are accustomed to grow near the moisture of water, and both spring forth from one and the same water, and the reed indeed is taken up for writing, while with the rush one cannot write, what should we understand by the rush and the reed, except that there is one doctrine of truth which irrigates many hearers? But some who are irrigated advance in the word of God even to the point that they also become writers, that is, like reeds; but others hear the word of life, maintain the greenness of good hope and right works, yet cannot advance to writing at all. What are these in the water of God except certain rushes, so to speak? They indeed advance by growing green, but they cannot express letters at all. Our Redeemer, therefore, because He granted that the words which He spoke should also be written through the zeal of teachers, held a reed in His hand. This reed is called a reed of measure, because the very zeal of teachers is held under a certain dispensation of hidden judgment, so that it may benefit some who read, and may not be able to benefit others who read. Hence the holy apostles, when they asked the master of truth speaking to them more openly why He spoke to the crowds in parables, heard: "Because it is given to you to know the mystery of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not." Or certainly it is a reed of measure, because in that sacred eloquence of His which has been written for us, we recognize that there are hidden dispensations of His. For through His incomprehensible judgment, one is sent within the measure of the elect, and another is left outside, so that he may in no way deserve to belong to the number of the elect. He has therefore a measuring cord, He has in His hand a reed of measure. For he who measures a place with a cord draws the cord to one spot, withdraws it from another, and leads here what he removes from elsewhere. Thus indeed, thus does our Redeemer act in the gathering of men, while He leads some out from their iniquities, and leaves others in their iniquity. For in those whom He has deigned to gather, He drew the cord of hidden measure, and from those whom He judged should be abandoned, what else did He do but withdraw the cord? So that the good may be held within the measure of the heavenly building, and the evil may remain outside the building, in whom the good things that are supposed are not, as if without measure.

Our Redeemer held this cord and measuring reed in His hand when He deigned to admonish the apostle Paul through a man of Macedonia appearing to him, so that this same Macedonian man said: "Come over and help us." And yet when the apostles wished to go into Asia to preach, the Spirit of Jesus did not permit them. What does it mean that the holy apostles are both called to go where perhaps they had not thought to proceed, and are forbidden to go where they desired to proceed, except that the cord of hidden judgment and the measuring reed is held in the hand, so that some may hear the words of life, while others may by no means deserve to hear? Therefore there is a cord of measure, which was drawn to one place and withdrawn from another.

We have also learned from the testimony of the Holy Gospel that one came who said: "Master, I will follow You wherever You go." To whom the answer was given: "Foxes have dens, and birds of the sky have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay His head." Another came who said: "Master, let me first go and bury my father." To whom it is said: "Let the dead bury their dead, but you follow Me and proclaim the kingdom of God." What does it mean that the one who promises to go is abandoned, while the other who wishes to return home is nevertheless commanded to follow? The former is not received, the latter is not released from service even for a moment. Therefore, by the internal dispensation of hidden judgment, the measuring line and the measuring rod are drawn out, by which this one is drawn in and that one is left behind, so that the heavenly structure may be built not without a devout and just examination.

The measuring rod can also be understood as Sacred Scripture for this reason: that whoever reads it measures himself in it—either how much he advances in spiritual virtue, or how far removed he remains from the good things that are commanded; how much he now rises up to do good, how much he still lies prostrate in wicked deeds.

And he stood in the gate.

Whoever stands in a doorway is partly inside and partly outside, because one part of him is seen outside while another part is hidden within. And so our Redeemer, mercifully incarnate for us, stood as if in a doorway before human eyes, because through his humanity he appeared visible, yet kept himself invisible in his divinity. Hence the Jews, who had awaited him according to the promise of the prophets, were troubled by the confusion of their own faithlessness, because they saw as mortal the one whom they had believed would come for their deliverance. Therefore he who stands in a doorway, as was said above, is seen partly outside and partly inside. Hence even the faithlessness of the Jews was not left without a display of divine power. For seeing his miracles, they were drawn to believe, but then again, weighing his sufferings, they disdained to believe that he was God whom they saw mortal in the flesh; whence it came about that they doubted in their knowledge of him. For they saw him hungering, thirsting, eating, drinking, growing weary, sleeping, and they supposed him to be merely a man. They saw him raising the dead, cleansing lepers, giving sight to the blind, casting out demons, and they perceived him to be more than human. But his humanity, considered in their hearts, disturbed their understanding of his miracles. Hence holy Church, in the voice of the bride, desiring now to see him openly, says: "Behold, he stands behind our wall." For he who showed to human eyes what he assumed from mortal nature, and remained invisible in himself, stood as if behind a wall for those seeking to see him, because he did not offer himself to be seen with his majesty revealed. For he stood as if behind a wall, who showed the human nature which he assumed but hid the divine nature from human eyes. Hence it is added there: "Looking through the windows, gazing through the lattices." For whoever looks through windows or through lattices is neither entirely hidden nor entirely seen. Just so, indeed, our Redeemer appeared before the eyes of doubters, because if while working miracles he had suffered nothing as a man, he would have appeared fully to them as God; and again, suffering human things, if he had done nothing as God, he would have been thought merely a man. But because he both did divine things and suffered human things, he looked out to humanity as through windows or lattices, so that as God he would both appear through miracles and be hidden through sufferings, and as man he would be perceived through sufferings, yet be recognized as more than man through miracles.

But since this man is said to stand in the doorway, we must ask whether his face was toward the inside and his back toward the outside. In this matter, if we consider what precedes and what follows, we quickly discover how he stood. For first it says: "There was something like a building of a city facing toward the south, and he led me there." And a little later it is added about this same man: "And he was standing in the doorway." And immediately it is added: "And the same man spoke to me."

For he who spoke to the prophet when he was introduced into the building, standing in the gate, certainly stood with his face inward and his back outward. But the prophet who was introduced, to whom the man standing in the gate spoke, without doubt held his face toward the gate, from where he heard the words of the speaker. What does it mean, then, that the man looks inward while the prophet looks outward? What does it mean that the face of that same man is toward the building, but the eyes of the prophet are toward the gate, except that the Only-begotten of the Father became incarnate for this reason: that he might introduce us into the spiritual building, that is, into faith in the holy Church? His eyes always look upon his building, because they unceasingly observe how much each person advances in virtues. But the prophet looks toward the gate, because he who hears the words of God must always place the eyes of his heart upon his departure, and meditate without ceasing on when he will leave this present life and reach eternal joys. For God became incarnate for this very reason: that he might introduce us to faith and lead us back to the sight of his vision. Hence also in the holy Gospel, Truth speaks, saying: "If anyone enters through me, he will be saved, and will go in and go out, and will find pasture." He will go in, namely, to faith; he will go out to sight; and he will find pasture in eternal satisfaction. Hence also the Psalmist says: "May the Lord guard your entrance and your departure." For the Lord guards the entrance of each soul, by which it enters into faith, and also the departure by which it goes out to sight, so that neither when entering the Church is it tripped up by errors, nor when departing from this temporal life to the eternal is it snatched away by the ancient enemy. Concerning this departure of ours, which we ought to meditate upon daily in our mind, the Apostle speaks of our Redeemer, saying: "That he might sanctify the people through his own blood, he suffered outside the gate. Let us therefore go out to him outside the camp, bearing his reproach. For we do not have here a lasting city, but we seek the one to come." The man who appeared, therefore, stood in the gate and spoke in this way, because the Mediator between God and men, Christ Jesus, even in the very time of his passion gave precepts of life to his disciples, so that those who believe in him might always look toward the gate, and, weighing his passion with careful consideration, might not turn the eyes of their heart away from their own departure. We also, when we have already begun to despise the confines of the flesh, to pass through the straits of our mortality through the desire for immortality, to reach toward the freedom of the supernal light, to yearn for the joys of the heavenly homeland—we hold our eyes toward the gate, because while we desire to pass from temporal sacraments to eternal ones, we have, as it were, already turned our backs on the present life, and we have the face of our heart fixed on the desire of our departure. For it is written: "The body that is corrupted weighs down the soul, and the earthly dwelling oppresses the mind thinking many things." Thus, therefore, through contemplation we already stretch the mind beyond the straits of the flesh; yet we are still held within the gate by that very carnal constraint in the sacraments which we have come to know.

For often the mind is so suspended in divine contemplation that it now rejoices to perceive something of that eternal liberty which eye has not seen nor ear heard, through a certain image; yet nevertheless, struck back by the weight of its mortality, it slips back to the depths, and is held bound by certain chains of its punishment. Therefore he strains toward the gates who beholds the joys of his true liberty, and now desires to go out, but is not yet able. Hence it is that the Hebrew people, freed from the servitude of Egypt, when they beheld the pillar of cloud as God spoke, each one stood at the doors of his tabernacle and worshiped. Of whom it is said a little earlier: "When Moses went out to the tabernacle, all the people rose up, and each one stood at the door of his tent." For we stand there where we fix the eyes of our mind. Whence Elijah says: "The Lord lives, in whose sight I stand." He surely stood there where he had fixed his heart. But what is it for the people to gaze upon the pillar of cloud and to stand at the doors of their tabernacle and worship, except that when the human mind somehow beholds those higher and heavenly things in an enigma, it now exits the enclosures of its bodily habitation through uplifted thought, and humbly adores him whose substance it cannot see, yet now marvels at his power through the illumination of the spirit? And when Moses enters the tabernacle, the people gaze upon his back, and stand at the doors of their tents, because when any holy preacher speaks lofty things about God, he somehow enters the tabernacle of the heavenly dwelling. Though the weak cannot fully weigh the power of his preaching, nevertheless they gaze upon his back as it were, because they follow through understanding the last things they are able to grasp. But even in those very small things which they are able to comprehend, they now go out from their tents as it were, and stand at the doors, because they strive both to leave the dwellings of the flesh and to advance toward those joys of eternal life which they hear. Hence also Elijah, when he heard the voice of the Lord speaking with him, is described as having stood at the door of his cave and veiled his face, because when through the grace of contemplation the voice of heavenly understanding comes into the mind, the whole man is no longer within the cave, because care of the flesh does not possess his soul, but he stands at the door, because he meditates on escaping the straits of mortality.

But now he who stands in the entrance of the cave and perceives the words of God in the ear of his heart must cover his face, because while we are led through heavenly grace to understand higher things, the more subtly we are raised up, the more we must always press ourselves down through humility in our understanding, lest we strive to be wiser than we ought to be wise, but to be wise unto sobriety; lest while we examine invisible things too much, we go astray; lest in that incorporeal nature we seek something of corporeal light. For to extend the ear and cover the face is to hear the voice of the inner substance through the mind, and yet to turn away the eyes of the heart from every corporeal form, lest the soul fashion for itself anything corporeal in that which is everywhere whole and everywhere uncircumscribed. Therefore, dearest brothers, we who have already learned of eternal joys through the death and resurrection of our Redeemer, and his ascension into heaven, we who know that our fellow citizens the angels appeared outwardly in testimony of his divinity, let us long for the King, let us desire the citizens whom we have come to know, and standing in this edifice of holy Church let us keep our eyes on the door; let us turn our back of the mind to this corruption of temporal life, let us direct the face of our heart toward the freedom of the heavenly homeland. But behold, there are still many things that press upon us from the care of corruptible life. Therefore, since we cannot go out perfectly, let us at least stand in the entrance of our cave, destined to go forth prosperously someday through the grace of our Redeemer, who lives and reigns with the Father in the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, through all ages of ages. Amen.
