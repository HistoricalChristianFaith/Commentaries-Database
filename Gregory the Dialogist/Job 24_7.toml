63.  As garments cover the body, so do good works the soul.  Whence it is said to one, Blessed is he that watcheth and keepeth his garments, lest he walk naked, and they see his shame. [Rev. 16, 15]  So Heretics, when in the minds of any they destroy good works, manifestly take away the garments of clothing; and it is well said, who have no covering in the cold.  For ‘covering’ has relation to righteousness, ‘cold’ to sin.  And there are some that in some points commit sin, but in some points follow good works.  He then that does wrong by one set of actions, and practises righteousness by another, what is this man but clothed in the cold?  He is cold, and he is covered, in that in one part of practice he is made warm for righteousness, in another he is made cold for sin.  But whenever Heretics take away their good works from such persons, they bring it to pass that they have not in the cold wherewith to clothe themselves.  Therefore it is rightly said, They send men away naked, taking away their garments, who have no covering in the cold; that is, for the cold of sin by itself to kill those whom the warmth of a different practice in some degree covered.  But it may be, that by the cold there is denoted desire, by the garment practice.  And there are great numbers who are still agitated with wrong desires, but striving with themselves in the spirit, they fight against themselves by right works, and with good actions cover that which they perceive through temptation to spring against them of the wrong sort.  And so these from the cause that they desire what is evil are cold, and by the act by which they practise what is good, they are clothed.  But when Heretics by wrong statements do away with the works of a right faith, what else do they bring to pass but that those that still feel the cold of carnal desires should die without the clothing of good works?
