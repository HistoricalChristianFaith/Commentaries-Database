"And Samuel said: Do not fear. You have done all this evil. Nevertheless, do not turn aside from following the Lord. And serve the Lord with all your heart."

11. The mind of the penitent is then rightly directed if it fears the divine judgments and trusts in the mercy of almighty God. Fear without hope indeed casts one headlong into despair, but when it is joined with hope, it works the salvation of the mind. Therefore the excellent teacher must watch with the utmost zeal to terrify the one who sins, and to lead the one who has been terrified back to the hope of pardon: so that through fear he may cease to sin, and through hope of obtaining forgiveness, he may seek the harbor of divine mercy. Samuel, therefore, raising his terrified subjects to the virtue of hope, says: "You have done all this evil; yet do not turn aside from following the Lord." As if to say: If you cease to sin, you can more quickly arrive at obtaining pardon for what you have committed. Do not therefore turn aside from following the Lord. Concerning the praise of the just, it is promised: "For you shall go before the face of the Lord to prepare His ways" (Luke 1:76). Hence Elijah says: "The Lord lives, in whose sight I stand" (1 Kings 17:1). Hence the Psalmist says: "Let the just exult in the sight of God" (Psalm 68:4). To stand in the sight of the Lord, or before the Lord, is to presume upon the love of the Creator by the testimony of a good conscience. Those indeed stand in His sight who, by the merit of great action, are secure in the heavenly grace of their Creator. But sinners, when they commit evil, flee from the face of the Lord; yet when they resolve to return through penance, they are, as it were, behind the Lord's back: because they neither wish to depart further, and yet cannot presume upon God as friends. Hence it is that the sinful woman is said to have stood behind Him, so that she might deserve to kiss the Lord's feet (Luke 7:38). Behind Him also stood that woman who touched the hem of His garment and deserved to be healed of her flow of blood (Matthew 9:20). She stands behind indeed out of shame for her sin, but she touches through the power of hope. Because, therefore, we must always blush for the iniquities we have committed, and avoid those things in which we are confounded, Samuel commands sinners not to turn aside from following the Lord. But because it is not sufficient for the conversion of a sinner that he merely not commit sins, he subsequently added: "And serve the Lord with all your heart."

12. For we can merit pardon when we cease to sin and devote ourselves to good works. To serve the Lord with the whole heart is to retain no intention of sinning in the heart. The whole heart is bent to the service of the Creator when we so perform good deeds that we hold fast to no evil by deliberate purpose.
