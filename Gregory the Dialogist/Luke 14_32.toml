What then must be done, brothers, except that while we see that we with a single army cannot prevail against his double one, we send an embassy while he is still far off, and ask for terms of peace? For he is said to be far off because he is not yet seen as present through judgment. Let us send to him as our embassy our tears, let us send works of mercy, let us sacrifice upon his altar victims of propitiation, let us recognize that we cannot contend with him in judgment; let us weigh the power of his might, let us ask for terms of peace. This is our embassy, which appeases the coming king. Consider, brothers, how kind it is that he who has the power to crush us by his coming delays to come. Let us send to him, as we said, our embassy, by weeping, by giving, by offering sacred victims. For the victim of the sacred altar, offered with tears and kindness of mind, singularly avails for our absolution, because he who rising again from the dead dies no more, still through this mystery suffers again for us. For as often as we offer to him the victim of his passion, so often do we renew his passion for our absolution.

Many of you, most beloved brethren, as I believe, happened to know what I wish to recall to your memory by narrating it. It is reported to have happened not long before our times that a certain man was captured by enemies and carried off far away; and when he was held in chains for a long time, since his wife did not receive him back from that captivity, she thought him dead. On his behalf, as though he were already deceased, she took care to offer sacrifices every week. His chains were loosened in captivity as many times as sacrifices had been offered by his wife for the release of his soul. For returning after a long time, he told his wife with great wonder that on certain days, every week, his chains were loosened. When his wife examined those days and hours, she recognized that he had been released whenever she remembered that the sacrifice had been offered for him. From this, therefore, most beloved brethren, from this gather by certain consideration how much the sacred sacrifice offered by us is able to loose the bond of the heart in us, if offered by one person it was able to loose the chains of the body in another.
