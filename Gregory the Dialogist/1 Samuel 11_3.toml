4. Who are the inhabitants of Jabesh, that is, of "the dried," except those who maintain the discipline of an emaciated flesh through long practice of virtue? For many begin to resist gluttony, but when they start to grow weary from the labor of abstinence, they incline themselves back to the habit of their accustomed greediness. They desire, as it were, to enter the city of Jabesh and become its citizens, but since they cannot endure the torment of dried and hungering flesh, they can by no means become its inhabitants. Therefore those inhabit Jabesh who hold the attenuation of the body through strength of mind as a right of possession, and are surrounded, as it were, by the walls of dryness, since through the very fact that they emaciate the body they are protected from the fiery darts of lust. When they are wearied by the most powerful rising stings of gluttony, they seek a truce of seven days, during which, if help does not come, they will go out to Nahash. But we explain this war of the Ammonites better if we observe in it the weakness of the flesh caught out and the sagacity of the trained mind. We see this more clearly too if we attend more closely to the opposite case in the foolish and weak. For certain people within holy Church are devout in desire, but slack through their habitual weakness of vices. They can indeed propose good things, but because they are unable to carry out what they propose, they are both overcome by present concupiscence and trust that they can recover in the near future the good which they abandon in the present. Often indeed they resolve to fast, but when they are conquered by habitual gluttony, they judge that they must eat on that day and fast on days to come. And since the ferocity of gluttony is always present to them, and present too is the desire for future goodness, it is brought about by the serpent's deceit that the good which is proposed is never found. For "tomorrow," which is always promised, is never reached. But since this is done by those whose mind is weak and flesh strong, let us see how those whose mind is strong but flesh weak make a mockery of the serpent. For concerning this same serpent the Psalmist says to the Lord: "This dragon, which you formed, to make sport of him" (Ps. 103:27). For he is never more fittingly conquered than when his cunning is overcome by a holy deception. Hence also the Redeemer, reproaching blessed Job with the cleverness of His own wisdom, says: "In his eyes, as with a hook, you shall catch him" (Job 40:10). For He caught the serpent, as it were with a hook before his eyes, who displayed to him flesh but concealed divinity; and while the serpent seized what he desired, he was caught and destroyed by what he did not see.

5. Holy men, therefore, in order to mock the enemy, maintain the rigor of their way of life in present virtue; as a deception of weakness, they promise the flesh a certain comfort in the future. For the things they do are often enormous, but on account of the weakness of the flesh, they do not presume to always do hard things and to promise austere things. Indeed they endure these same hardships all the more easily, inasmuch as they do not see the burdens of them as binding upon themselves in a perpetual commitment. But while they live most excellently, and strive daily to advance and not to fall back, that permitted indulgence of the flesh, which they cannot despair of, they always promise to the flesh in a future reckoning; yet they by no means cease to inflict upon it the pain of the affliction already begun. Therefore, through the fact that hope is left to the flesh in its desire, the spirit, as it were, promises the presence of its coming for the future good of that same flesh. But because it does not abandon by failing the accustomed rigor of self-restraint, the flesh has the promise of pleasure in the future, and the chosen mind has the strength of virtue in the present. Here it should be noted that they promise to go out to Nahash under a condition, but they are fortified by the walls of the city without condition: because those who practice abstinence, even in that in which they are weak according to the flesh, trust to be strengthened through divine mercy. And because they are eager to overthrow the vice of gluttony by deceiving it, they say: "Grant us seven days." For it is as if time is granted by gluttony, when it is restrained with the expectation that its desires will at some point be served. During which space of days, Nahash indeed awaits the coming out to him of the besieged citizens, but the citizens of Jabesh await reinforcements: because indeed the appetite of gluttony desires to be refreshed from the weak flesh, but the chosen mind desires to be strengthened in the virtue of abstinence. In seven days reinforcements are sought, when against the darkness of temptations we are raised up by every light of the heart, when against wicked counsels we find whatever we can by our own reason, and we are fortified by the rays of light which we do not perceive in ourselves from the instruction of others. For while we look to the ways of life of the perfect for the strengthening of our virtue, we find, as it were, through seven days the aids of defense. We indeed seek a truce, because we fight with Nahash, that is, the serpent, whose poisons are so hidden that we must seek all the more subtle counsels. Hence they also promise that they will send messengers into all the borders of Israel: because chosen men, for the benefit of their own edification, are aided by the examples of all who see God. But in what is said, "If there is no one who defends, we will come out to you," in the voice of the elect, not doubt of reinforcements but certainty is shown. As if mocking the adversary who persuades with cunning words, they bring forth words by which they grant him hope and by no means take away their own confidence. For those who say, "If there is no one who defends, we will come out to you," grant a certain hope of their coming out. But because those who say this are certain of help, they deceive their enemies by promising. But where these same reinforcements are now to be found, he explains saying: (Verses 4 and 5.) Therefore the messengers came to Gibeah of Saul, and they spoke these words in the hearing of the people, and all the people lifted up their voice and wept. And behold, Saul was coming in the morning, following the oxen from the field, and he saw the people weeping, and said: "What is the matter with the people, that they weep?"
