21. For he is before shewn to have been heard in behalf of his friends, when the circumstance, which we before mentioned, is stated; They did according as the Lord had spoken, and the Lord accepted the face of Job. But when it is immediately observed, The Lord also was turned at the penitence of Job, when he prayed for his friends; it is plainly shewn, that a penitent has deserved to be heard the more quickly in his own behalf, the more devoutly he has interceded for his friends. For he makes his prayers more powerful in his own behalf, who offers them also in behalf of others. For that sacrifice of prayer is more willingly received, which, in the sight of the merciful Judge, is flavoured with love for one’s neighbour. And a person then truly adds to its amount, if he offers it even for his enemies. For hence is that, which the Truth Who is our Teacher says; Pray for them that persecute and calumniate you. [Luke 6, 28] Hence again He says, When ye shall stand to pray, forgive if ye have ought against any, that your Father also Who is in heaven may forgive you your sins. [Mark 11, 25] But how much he obtained for himself, who interceded for others, is immediately pointed out, when it is subjoined,
The Lord added all that had been to Job, twofold.
22. He received twofold all that he had lost, because through the tenderness of the merciful Judge the assistance of consolations far surpasses the loss of our temptation. But the temptation tries us less than the reward consoles us; in order that he, who used from the weight of the blow to consider that he had suffered some heavy trial, may learn from the recompense he has earned [‘retributionis merito’], that what he endured was but light. Whence it is said also to afflicted Judæa; For a small moment have I forsaken thee, and in great mercies will I gather thee. [Is. 54, 7] But sometimes the measure of consolation is dispensed in proportion to the weight of affliction. Whence it is written elsewhere, According to the multitude of my sorrows in my heart, Thy comforts have rejoiced my soul. [Ps. 94, 12] For he, who exclaims that he had been made joyful according to the multitude of his sorrows, points out that he was consoled in the same measure as he had been afflicted. But the reader is not slightly instructed, if he considers the very order of the remuneration. For correction follows excess, penitence correction, pardon penitence, gifts pardon. But because he who had been smitten by permission of Divine Providence, was afflicted also by the words of his friends, when he is consoled by the gifts of the Divine mercy, he deserves to be cherished also with human love; in order that to him, whom the sorrows and adversities of pains wounded on every side, the joys of consolation may on every side correspond.

But when the text immediately adds, “And the Lord turned to the penitence of Job, when he had prayed for his friends,” it clearly shows that through penitence he deserved to have his prayers fulfilled promptly, because he had interceded for others. He held that his prayers were effective for him, as he had offered them for others. The merciful Judge more favorably receives the sacrifice of prayer when it is accompanied by the love of neighbor, and one enriches it even more truthfully when he offers it for his enemies as well. - "Morals on the Book of Job 35.21"
