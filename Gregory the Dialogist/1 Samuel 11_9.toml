10. Such perhaps is what is said to us by the counsel of that wise man: "If the spirit of one having power rises up against you, do not quickly abandon your place" (Eccles. 10:4). The place of each elect person is the position of a good way of life. But when it is permitted, the attacking spirit can have power, because he could in no way assault the hearts of the elect unless the divine dispensation permitted it. He therefore commands that we not abandon our place, because if we are strong amid the brief darkness of temptations, the divine light will quickly be present, at whose coming the power of darkness vanishes. Well therefore is it said: "For tomorrow, when the sun has grown hot, there will be salvation for you." The exhortation of holy preachers is day, because when it touches the tempted hearts of the lesser ones, it raises them to the hope of victory. But night follows this, because even if divine aids are withdrawn, still the rushing darkness of carnal desires does not depart. What then is the morrow but the coming of divine visitation? For it is called the morrow because the splendor of divine help is very near to the tempted elect. Whence also through the prophet the Lord says: "I am a God nearby, and not a God from afar" (Jer. 23:23). Hence the Psalmist says: "The Lord is near to all who call upon him in truth" (Ps. 144:18). Hence likewise the Lord himself promises, saying: "Before you call upon me, I will say: Behold, I am here" (Isa. 58:9). The first day, then, is the light of preaching; the morrow is that of divine grace. But it should be noted that he said: "When the sun has grown hot," so that the brightness of day might illuminate the obscurity of understanding, and the heat of the sun might kindle the love of the heart; so that the mind might see through light the good that it desires, and might long through the heat of the mind for what it sees. For this twofold remedy of the mind is presented against the double warfare of the devil. For the malign spirit, in order to overcome the minds of the elect by tempting them, first casts before them the darkness of evil thoughts, then kindles the flames of concupiscences, because unless he has first blinded the mind, he does not drive it to the depravity of concupiscence. But when the elect mind is permitted to be tempted, its state is disturbed in both respects, because it can feel the troubles of concupiscences to the extent that, with God permitting, it cannot cast away from itself the darkness of evil thoughts. But because it is permitted by God to be tempted, at the coming of his grace it is relieved from both evils: since against the darkness it receives light, and through the heat of the arriving Spirit, it casts off the coldness of mind. For the one who was unable to raise the mind from carnal things begins to see heavenly things, and what he looks upon lovingly he desires ardently. Well therefore is it said: "Tomorrow there will be salvation for you, when the sun has grown hot," because if we manfully bear the powerful assaults of the ancient enemy, we are raised up by the swiftness of divine grace to the light of the heart and the power of great charity. And because the elect hearts of subjects gratefully receive this counsel of the holy preachers, there follows: (Verse 9.) "Therefore the messengers came and announced to the men of Jabesh. And they rejoiced." But let us also hear what they reply to the Ammonites, even though help has been promised to them. For there follows: (Verse 10.) "And they said: Tomorrow we will come out to you, and you shall do to us whatever pleases you."
