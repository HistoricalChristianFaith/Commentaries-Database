For through punishment he falls into the outer darkness who through his own fault willingly fell into inner darkness; and there he suffers unwillingly the darkness of vengeance, who here willingly endured the darkness of pleasure.

It must be known that no lazy person is secure from this receiving of the talent. For there is no one who can truly say: "I have received no talent at all, there is nothing for which I can be compelled to give account." For by the name of talent, even this very thing will be reckoned to any poor person—that he received even the least thing. For one person received understanding; he owes the ministry of preaching from his talent. Another received earthly substance; he owes the distribution of his talent from his possessions. Another received neither understanding of interior things nor abundance of possessions, but nevertheless learned an art by which he is fed; that very art is reckoned to him as the receiving of a talent. Another has attained none of these things, but nevertheless has perhaps earned a place of familiarity with a rich person; he has certainly received the talent of familiarity. If therefore he says nothing to him on behalf of the needy, he is condemned for retaining his talent. Therefore let him who has understanding take care by all means not to be silent; let him who has abundance of possessions watch lest he grow sluggish in the generosity of mercy; let him who has an art by which he is governed strive greatly to share its use and benefit with his neighbor; let him who has a place of speaking with a rich person fear condemnation for the retained talent if, when he is able, he does not intercede with him on behalf of the poor. For the coming Judge will require from each one of us as much as He gave. Therefore, that each person may be secure concerning the accounts of his talent when the Lord returns, let him consider daily with trembling what he has received. For behold, He who departed on a journey is now near to returning. For He went as if on a journey when He departed far from this earth on which He was born; but He certainly returns to settle accounts for the talents, because if we grow sluggish from good action, He judges us more strictly concerning those very gifts which He bestowed. Let us therefore consider what we have received, and let us be vigilant in their distribution. Let no earthly care impede us from spiritual work, lest if the talent is hidden in the earth, the lord of the talent be provoked to anger. For the lazy servant lifts the talent from the earth when the Judge is now examining his faults, because there are many who only withdraw themselves from earthly desires or works when they are already being dragged to eternal punishment by the judgment of the Judge. Let us therefore be vigilant beforehand concerning the account to be rendered for our talent, so that when the Judge now looms to strike, the profit we have made may excuse us.
