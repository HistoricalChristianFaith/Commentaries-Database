54.  If this proud man had been minded to turn back from sin to righteousness, he might ‘depart out of darkness.’  But because he seeks not the light of righteousness, he does not depart out of darkness.  After whose example, those likewise, who ‘attach themselves to him out breathe themselves in making earthly advancements, are kindled with the torches of avarice, and scorched with the fires of carnal desires.  And hence it is added,
The flame shall dry up his branches.
55.  For if he united to himself any that were searching after the Eternal Country, he would have green ‘branches’ in himself.  But because they that are joined to him, are also heated with earthly passions, and the flame of passions kindles the hearts of his followers, it doth surely ‘dry up his branches,’ that they should not bear the fruit of good works, seeing that for the chace after the lowest objects they pant in wickedness.  And it is well added,
And by the breath of his mouth shall he be taken away.
56.  For the proud man, in proportion as he is more strong in this life, the more shamelessly lets loose for himself the reins of his tongue, so as to utter bad things of every sort, to apprehend no man for his words, to wound these with insults, to cast at those with curses.  But sometimes he is carried away into blasphemy against his Creator, as it is said by the Psalmist of such persons, They set their mouths against the heavens, and their tongue walketh through the earth. [Ps. 73, 9]  And hence the rich man, being set in the fire, implores to have water dropped for him on his tongue by the finger of Lazarus.  By which circumstance it is perceived that in that part where a man has sinned most, there he was the more fiercely burned.  Therefore it is rightly said now, And by the breath of his mouth shall he go away; in that he received sentence of smiting, in proportion as he did not restrain the breath of his mouth under the fear of God.
