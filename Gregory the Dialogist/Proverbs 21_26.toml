When the soul does not direct its efforts to higher things, neglecting itself, it stoops to concern itself with low desires, and when it does not restrain itself by aiming vigorously at higher things, it is wounded by the hunger of a base cupidity. Consequently, as it neglects the constraints of discipline, it is the more distracted in its craving for pleasure. Therefore, it is written by the same Solomon, “The slothful man is given utterly to desires.” .
