For you have heard that the Holy Spirit appeared upon the disciples in tongues of fire and gave them knowledge of all languages. What indeed was signified by this miracle, except that the holy Church, filled with the same Spirit, would speak with the voice of all nations? Those who attempted to build a tower against God lost the communion of one language, but in these who humbly feared God all languages were united. Here therefore humility merited virtue; there pride earned confusion.

But we must ask why the Holy Spirit, coeternal with the Father and the Son, appeared in fire; why in fire and tongues together; why He is shown sometimes in a dove, sometimes in fire; why He appeared over the only-begotten Son in the form of a dove, and over the disciples in fire—so that He neither came upon the Lord in fire nor was shown over the disciples in a dove. Let us therefore return by solving these four questions we have proposed. For the Spirit, coeternal with the Father and Son, is shown in fire because God is incorporeal, ineffable, and invisible fire, as Paul attests: "Our God is a consuming fire." God is indeed called fire because through Him the rust of sins is consumed. Of this fire the Truth says: "I came to cast fire upon the earth, and what do I desire except that it burn?" For earthly hearts are called earth, which, while they always heap up base thoughts within themselves, are trampled by malignant spirits. But the Lord casts fire upon the earth when He kindles the hearts of carnal people with the breath of the Holy Spirit. And the earth burns when the carnal heart, cold in its wicked pleasures, abandons the desires of the present age and is set ablaze with love of God. Rightly therefore the Spirit appeared in fire, since from every heart He fills He shakes off the torpor of coldness and kindles it with desire for His eternity. Moreover He was shown in tongues of fire because the same Spirit is coeternal with the Son, and tongue has the greatest kinship with word. For the Son is the Word of the Father. And because the Spirit and the Word are of one substance, the same Spirit had to be shown in a tongue. Or certainly, because word proceeds through the tongue, the Spirit appeared in tongues because whoever is touched by the Holy Spirit confesses God's Word, that is, the only-begotten Son, and cannot deny God's Word because he now has the tongue of the Holy Spirit. Or certainly the Spirit appeared in tongues of fire because all whom He fills He makes both burning and speaking at once. Teachers have tongues of fire because, when they preach that God is to be loved, they set the hearts of their hearers aflame. For the speech of a teacher is idle if it cannot provide the fire of love.
