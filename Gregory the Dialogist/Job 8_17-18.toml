Therefore, pay attention. Because they are called “rocks” but are not in any wise called “living stones,” the lost and the elect may be mixed together by the bare appellation of “stones.” Therefore this plant, “which lives among stones, wraps its roots around the heap of rocks,” in that every hypocrite multiplies the thoughts of his heart in seeking out human admiration. For in all that hypocrites do, seeing that in their secret thoughts they look out for the applauses of their fellow-creatures, like rushes, as it were, they “send out roots into the heap of the rocks.” For when they are about to act, they imagine the praises of others, and when applauded, they dwell upon these praises secretly within themselves in the thoughts of their heart. They rejoice that they have distinguished themselves first and foremost in the esteem of people; while they are puffed up and swollen in themselves by human applause, they often secretly wonder what they are. They long to appear day by day higher than they really are and grow to a height by practicing their extraordinary arts. As habits of virtue weaken everything bad, so presumption strengthens evil.… The hypocrite is “destroyed from his place” when death intervenes and he is separated from the applause of the present life.… When justly condemning the life of the pretender, “Truth” does not know him or recognize the good works he has done, for the pretender never acted with a right purpose in mind. Thus, when Christ comes to judge, he will say to the foolish virgins, “Truly, I say to you, I do not know you.” While he perceives a corrupt mind, he condemns even the corruption of the flesh. But would that hypocrites’ own ruin alone were enough for them and that their wicked pains did not vehemently urge others to a life of duplicity.… Hence according to the hypocrites’ perspective, every degree of simplicity of character is criminal. For they sit in judgment on people whose character is transparent. Purity of heart they term stupidity … and believe they have enlightened those persons whom they have forced to surrender the fortress of wisdom, purity of heart.
