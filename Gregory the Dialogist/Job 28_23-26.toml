For God’s “looking” is the renewing to his grace the things that were lost and undone. Hence it is written, “A king that sits in the throne of judgment scatters away all evil with his eyes.” For by his very glance he restrains the evils of our lightness and imparts the great value of maturity. Hence it is further added, “When he gave to the wind its weight.” In the holy Scripture, by the rapidity and subtlety of the winds, souls used to be denoted, as it is spoken by the psalmist of God, “Who walks above the wings of the winds,” that is, “who passes above the virtues of souls.” Accordingly “He made the weight for the winds,” in that while Wisdom from above fills souls, it renders them weighty with imparted maturity. This is not the same weightiness of which it is said, “You children of men, how long with a heavy heart.” For it is one thing to be weighty in relation to good counsel and another to be weighed down in relation to sin. It is one thing to be weighty by faithfulness, another to be weighty by wrongdoing. For this latter weightiness has the weight of burden, the other weight of merit. Therefore, souls receive weight that they should not from this day forward with light motion move away from their aim at God, but be made to settle into him with immoveable weightiness of constancy.
