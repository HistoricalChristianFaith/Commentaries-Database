It is sweet to be among human beings, except for one who has tasted none of the joys of heaven, because the less he understands the eternal, the more delightfully he rests amid the temporal. But if anyone has already tasted with the mouth of his heart that sweetness of heavenly rewards, those choirs of angels singing hymns, the incomprehensible vision of the holy Trinity, for him what he sees within becomes sweeter the more that all he sustains outside turns bitter.
