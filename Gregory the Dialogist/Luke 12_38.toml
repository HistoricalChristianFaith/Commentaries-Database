But what if servants are negligent in the first watch? For the first watch is the guarding of the first age. But even so, one should not despair or cease from good work. For the Lord, suggesting the patience of his long-suffering, adds: "And if he comes in the second watch, and if he comes in the third watch, and finds them so, blessed are those servants." For the first watch is the earliest time, that is, childhood. The second is adolescence or youth, which according to the authority of sacred Scripture are one, as Solomon says: "Rejoice, young man, in your adolescence." The third, however, is understood as old age. Therefore, he who was unwilling to keep watch in the first watch should guard at least the second, so that he who neglected to turn from his wickedness in childhood may awaken to the ways of life at least in the time of youth. And he who was unwilling to watch in the second watch should not lose the remedies of the third watch, so that he who did not awaken to the ways of life in youth may at least come to his senses in old age. Consider, dearest brothers, that the mercy of God has enclosed our hardness. There is nothing left for a person to find as an excuse. God is despised, and he waits; he sees himself scorned, and he calls back; he receives injury from contempt of himself, and yet he still promises rewards to those who eventually return. But let no one neglect this long-suffering of his, because he will demand justice at the judgment all the more strictly, the longer the patience he extended before the judgment. For Paul says about this: "Do you not know that the kindness of God leads you to repentance? But according to your hardness and impenitent heart, you are storing up wrath for yourself on the day of wrath and revelation of the just judgment of God." About this the Psalmist says: "God is a just judge, strong and long-suffering." For about to call him long-suffering, he first said just, so that you may know that he whom you see patiently bearing the sins of transgressors for a long time will also at some point judge strictly. About this it is said through a certain wise man: "For the Most High is a patient rewarder." He is called a patient rewarder because he both endures and repays the sins of men. For those whom he tolerates for a long time so that they may convert, if they do not convert, he condemns more harshly.
