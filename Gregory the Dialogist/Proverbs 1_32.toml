Hence Solomon says, "The turning away of the simple shall slay them, and the prosperity of fools shall destroy them." Hence Paul admonishes, saying, "They that buy, as though they possessed not; and they that use this world, as though they used it not." So may the things that are supplied to us be of service to us outwardly to such extent only as not to turn our minds away from desire of supernal delight; and thus the things that afford us succour in our state of exile may not abate the mourning of our soul's pilgrimage; and we, who see ourselves to be wretched in our severance from the things that are eternal, may not rejoice as though we were happy in the things that are transitory.
