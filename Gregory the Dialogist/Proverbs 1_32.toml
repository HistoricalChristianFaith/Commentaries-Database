Solomon says, “The turning away of the simple shall kill them, and the prosperity of fools shall destroy them.” So Paul admonishes, saying, “They that buy will be as though they possessed not; and they that use this world, as though they used it not.” So may the things that are supplied be of service to us outwardly only so as not to turn our minds away from desire of supernal delight; and thus the things that afford us comfort in our state of exile may not abate the mourning of our soul’s pilgrimage. May we, who see ourselves wretched in our severance from the things that are eternal, not rejoice as though we were happy in the things that are transitory.
