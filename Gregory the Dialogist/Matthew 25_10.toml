"But while they went to buy, the bridegroom came," because while they seek testimony of their life from their neighbors, the judge comes, who is witness not only of works but also of hearts. "And those who were ready entered with him to the wedding, and the door was shut."

Oh, if wisdom in the palate of the heart could taste what wonder lies in the words: "The bridegroom comes!" What sweetness in: "They entered with him to the wedding feast!" What bitterness in: "And the door was shut!" For he comes whose arrival shakes the elements, at whose presence heaven and earth tremble. Whence also through the prophet he says: "Yet once more, and I will shake not only the earth, but also heaven." Before his judgment all the human race is brought. To him for the punishment of the wicked and the reward of the good, angels, archangels, thrones, principalities, and dominions render service.

Consider, dearest brothers, before the presence of so great a judge what terror there will be on that day when there will be no remedy in punishment, what confusion will befall the one whom his own guilt compels to blush with shame in the assembly of all the angels and men, what dread to see him angry whom the human mind cannot comprehend even when he is calm. Gazing upon this day, the prophet rightly says: "A day of wrath, that day, a day of tribulation and distress, a day of calamity and misery, a day of darkness and gloom, a day of cloud and whirlwind, a day of trumpet and clamor."

Consider therefore, dearest brothers, with what harshness the prophet saw the last day of judgment embitter the hearts of the reprobate, which he cannot express with so many names. But how great will be the joy of the elect, who merit to rejoice in the sight of him at whose presence they see all the elements tremble, to enter with him together to the wedding feast! They both rejoice at the wedding of the bridegroom and yet are themselves the bride, because in that bridal chamber of the eternal kingdom God is joined to our sight. This vision will never again be torn from the embraces of its love for all eternity.

Then the door of the kingdom will be closed to those who mourn, which now is opened daily to the penitent. For there will be repentance then too, but it will no longer bear fruit, because he who now wastes the time fit for pardon will by no means find forgiveness then. Hence Paul says: "Behold, now is the acceptable time, behold, now is the day of salvation." Hence the prophet says: "Seek the Lord while he may be found, call upon him while he is near."
