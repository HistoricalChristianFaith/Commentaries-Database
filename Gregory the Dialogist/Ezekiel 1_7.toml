What is designated by feet if not the steps of actions? Therefore the feet of the four living creatures are described as being straight, because the works of the holy evangelists and of all the perfect are not twisted to follow iniquity. But those do not have straight feet who are bent back to the evils of the world which they had abandoned. Of whom it is written: "The dog returned to his own vomit, and the sow that was washed to her wallowing in the mire." The distinguished teacher grieved over certain ones because they had twisted the straightness of their feet backward, to whom he said by way of rebuke: "How do you turn again to the weak and beggarly elements, which you desire to serve again? You observe days, and months, and seasons, and years. I fear for you, lest perhaps I have labored among you in vain." He who admonishes others, saying: "Therefore lift up the hands that hang down, and the weakened knees, and make straight steps with your feet." But in order that gravity of life, fortitude, and discretion might be shown in these same holy preachers, it is rightly added: "The sole of their foot was like the sole of a calf's foot."

For the holy preachers are designated by the name of oxen, as Paul the Apostle teaches, explaining the testimony of the law: "You shall not muzzle the ox that treads out the grain." In the holy preachers, therefore, the sole of the foot is that of a calf, namely proceeding with maturity, and strong, and divided, because each preacher has both reverence in maturity, and strength in work, and division of the hoof in discernment. For his preaching is not easily received if he appears to be frivolous in his conduct. And there will be no display of maturity if strength of work is not present against all adversities. Moreover, the strength of work itself loses the merit of virtue if it is not discerning in understanding. For behold, we read Sacred Scripture: if we understand everything according to the letter, we have lost the virtue of discernment; if we lead everything toward spiritual allegory, we are similarly bound by the folly of indiscretion. For the holy preachers read the sacred words, and sometimes they accept the letter in its historical sense, sometimes indeed they seek the spirit through the meaning of the letter. And at times they imitate the good deeds of the preceding fathers just as they find them according to the letter; at times they understand spiritually certain things that are not to be imitated according to history, and they strive toward advancement. What else, therefore, do the holy preachers do in their work but divide the hoof in their foot? Concerning whom it is still fittingly added: "And sparks like the appearance of glowing bronze."

Bronze is a very resonant metal. And rightly are the voices of preachers compared to bronze, because their sound has gone out into all the earth, and their words to the ends of the world. Moreover, bronze is fittingly called glowing, because the life of preachers both resounds and burns. For it burns with desire and resounds with the word. Glowing bronze, therefore, is preaching set on fire. But sparks come forth from glowing bronze, because from their exhortations flaming words proceed to the ears of the hearers. Rightly, moreover, are the words of preachers called sparks, because they set on fire those whom they touch in the heart. It should also be considered that sparks are very fine and thin, because when holy preachers speak of the heavenly fatherland, they are not able to reveal as much by their word as they can burn with desire. From their tongue, therefore, certain sparks as it were come to us, because from the heavenly fatherland scarcely something faint is known through their voice, which nevertheless is not faintly loved by them. For they are neither able to see the heavenly glory as great as it is, nor able to speak as much as they see. Glowing bronze, therefore, casts forth sparks when the preacher is scarcely able to speak faintly of that by which he himself is powerfully set on fire. But by divine mercy it is brought about that from these very faint sparks the soul of the hearer is inflamed, because there are some who, when they hear small things, are filled with greater desire; and from that source they burn perfectly in the love of God, from which they have received only the faintest sparks of words.

The word of preaching is indeed a seed in the heart of the hearer. And the good hearer afterwards brings forth from it a great harvest of knowledge, from which he had previously received only a small seed of speech. To this matter the miracle performed by the prophet Elisha for the widow fittingly corresponds, who, lest she lose her two sons when the creditor took them away, obeyed the prophet's words, and from the little oil she had, she poured it out through empty vessels, which were all afterwards filled to the brim, and from their filling the woman was freed from her debt to her creditor. What else does this woman signify but the holy Church, mother of two peoples, that is, the Jewish and the Gentile, as if of two sons? She had previously received from the creditor, as it were, a certain coin of sin through the persuasion of the cunning spirit by perverse work, and she feared to lose the two sons whom she had begotten in faith. But obeying the prophet's words, that is, the precepts of Sacred Scripture, she poured from the little oil she had into empty vessels, because when the empty minds of many hear something small about the love of the Divinity from the mouth of one teacher, with grace abounding, they are filled to the brim with the ointment of divine love. And now many hearts, which were previously empty little vessels, are full of the ointment of the Spirit, which seemed to have been poured only from a small quantity of oil. While this is given to some and to others, and faith is received by the hearers, the woman of Zarephath, namely the holy Church, is no longer held under debt to her creditor.
