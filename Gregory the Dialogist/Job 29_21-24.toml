For this awe of those under him we unquestionably believe to have been directed toward blessed Job. But, as we have already often said, holy church, being driven to extremities by the inflictions of heretics or carnal persons, remembers the times past, in which all that is spoken by it is listened to with fear by the faithful. Lamenting the evilness of its adversaries, [the church] says, “They listened to me, and waited and kept silence for my counsel.” It is as though it expressed itself in plain speech, “Not like these evil and swollen ones, who while they refuse to admit the words of truth, do it as if in teaching they could forestall the sentences of my preaching.” These disciples now “intent upon its counsel keep silence,” because its words they dare not impugn but take on faith. For they may be able to profit by these same words; they hear them, doubtless not with a view to judge them but to follow them. Of them it is rightly added, “To my words they did not dare to add anything.” The wayward teachers, free of all check, are in their freedom the most mischievous. They “dare to add something to the words [of Scripture].” They busy themselves as if to correct the rightness of [the church’s] preaching. Concerning the good hearers, Job adds: “And my word dropped upon them.” By this dropping of word, what else is understood but the gauge of holy preaching? Thus it is required that the boon of exhortation is bestowed to each according to the capacity of his parts.…“They waited for me as for the rain; they opened their mouths as for the latter rain.” Of this “latter rain” it is elsewhere written, “I will give you rain, both the early and the latter rain.” For he “gave the early rain,” because in the former period he bestowed on his elect the knowledge of the law. He “gave the latter rain,” because he caused the mystery of his incarnation to be preached in the last days. In this same mystery, holy church does not cease to tell it forth day by day. It waters the mouth of its hearers’ hearts as it were by “the latter rain.” …
“If I laughed on them, they did not believe it; and the light of my countenance did not fall on the earth.” These words agree perfectly with the words of our Redeemer in the last part of the sentence where it is said, “And the light of my countenance did not fall on the earth.” For what is styled “the ground” but the sinner? He is the same one to whom it was said earlier, “Earth you are, and to earth you shall return.” So “the light of the Lord’s countenance does not fall to the earth,” because the brightness of his vision does not appear to sinners. Thus it is written, “Let the ungodly man be removed away that he may not see the glory of God.” For light would, as it were, fall upon the earth, if when he comes in the last judgment, he manifests the brightness of his majesty to sinners.
