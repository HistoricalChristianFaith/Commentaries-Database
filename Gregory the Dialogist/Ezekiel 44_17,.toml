Woolen garments are thicker. When the priest approaches the holy ministry, when through compunction he enters within, he must be vested in a finer understanding, as with a linen garment. But when he goes outside to the people, he has to lay aside the garments in which he had ministered within and appear to the people dressed in other clothing, because if he restrains himself in the rigor of his compunction, if he perseveres in the solemnity that he held at the time of prayer, he does not admit to accept the words of external things. And what is the flock to do about necessities if their shepherd refuses to hear and ponder what this present time requires? Therefore a priest who goes out before the people puts on thicker garments in order to compose the habit of his mind for the benefit of his children, even to bear earthly cares. Think, I ask you, dearest brothers, how much toil there is for the watchman, both to extend his heart to the sublime and suddenly to recall it to the depths, and to refine the spirit in the heights of inward understanding and because of the exterior causes of his neighbors, so to speak, suddenly thicken in contemplation.
