But we know that one who, even when acting rightly, forgets to see the virtues of his betters, extinguishes the eye of his heart by the darkness of pride. But, on the other hand, one who carefully weighs the good qualities of others enlightens his own deeds by a powerful ray of humility, because when he sees the things he has done himself done by others also, and he keeps down that swelling of pride that strives to break forth from within from singularity. Hence it is said by the voice of God to Elijah, when thinking that he was solitary, “I have left me seven thousand men who have not bent their knees before Baal.” This was said so that by learning he did not remain solitary, that he might avoid the boasting of pride that might arise in him from his personal uniqueness. Blessed Job, therefore, is not blamed for having done anything perversely, but he is informed of the good deeds of others besides, in order that while he considers that he has others also equal to him, he may humbly submit himself to him who is specially the Highest.
