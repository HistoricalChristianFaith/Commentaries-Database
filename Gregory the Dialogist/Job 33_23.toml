Who is this angel but the one the prophet calls “the angel of mighty counsel”? To declare is called “evangelize” in Greek, and the Lord in announcing himself to us is called “angel.” And he well says, “If there should be a messenger [or angel] speaking for him one of like things to show the righteousness of man.” For, as the apostle says, he even intercedes for us. But let us hear what he says for us, “One of like things.” It is the way with medicine to cure disease sometimes by similar, some times by contrary remedies. For it has frequently been wont to cure the hot by warm and the cold by cold applications; and on the contrary, the cold by warmth, hot by cold. Our Physician then, on coming to us from above and finding us oppressed with such great disease, applied to our case something of a like and something of a contrary nature, for he came to us as Man to humanity, as well as a just One to those who were in sin. He agreed with us in the truth of his nature; he differed from us in the power of his righteousness. For sinful humankind could not be amended except by God.
