Again, the breast of the victim together with the shoulder are assigned to him for eating, so that he may learn to immolate to the Giver of all things those parts of himself which correspond to the parts of the sacrifice which he is ordered to take. Not only in his heart must he have right thoughts, but also he must invite those who behold him, by the shoulder of his deeds to sublime heights. He may not covet the good things of this present life nor fear any adversity. He must despise the blandishments of the world by heeding the fear they inspire in his conscience yet despise all fears in view of the sweet delights which his conscience holds out to him.
