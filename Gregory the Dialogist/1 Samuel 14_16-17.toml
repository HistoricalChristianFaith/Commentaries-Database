But because we said above that Saul signifies the chief priests, and Jonathan his son represents the subordinate persons of preachers, if we attend to what follows, we find in the chief pontiffs the apostolic solicitude which they maintain. About which blessed Paul indeed speaks, saying: "Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who is scandalized, and I am not on fire? Besides those things which are external, my daily urgency, the care of all the churches" (2 Cor. 11:29). He who indeed bore the care of all the churches was vigilant not only over the little ones but also in examining the deeds of the greater ones.

The watchmen of Saul observe the battle of Jonathan, because the supreme pontiffs not only examine the deeds of their subjects, but also the doctrine of their prelates. The former indeed they investigate, whether they act well; but the latter, whether they teach rightly. Often they hear of the conduct of others, but they fear lest they not be well instructed. For what else is meant by the inquiry into where someone has gone, except that he who is sent to preach ought to be such that the burden of ministry may be safely imposed upon him; so that the mind of the one sending may waver with no doubt that he teaches rightly, and that he demonstrates the words of doctrine through his works. And because the prelates of the churches are innumerable, Jonathan is observed by the watchmen, because the supreme height of the universal Church so appoints preachers throughout the world that it has ministers around itself, through whom it may examine their doctrine and diligently investigate their works. But those who carry out the ministry and legation of the supreme height are elevated to a lofty seat of life and knowledge. Whence also it is well recorded that those same watchmen were in Gibeah of Benjamin. For Gibeah of Benjamin is called the hill of the son of the right hand. On the hill of the son of the right hand indeed are those who, through their sublime life and through their lofty knowledge, seem already to attain to conformity with the Redeemer. These indeed behold the deeds of the victors from on high, because they merit, from the loftiness of their life and the perfect learning of the highest knowledge, to approve the life of the good and to examine the wicked. They find that Jonathan is not present, because they consider the gains of preaching to be best when they approve the praiseworthy person of the preacher.
