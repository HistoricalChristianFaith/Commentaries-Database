The high mountain is the summit of doctrine and practice. Let one rise up who hurries to anoint the king. Let him reach into the heights. Let him rise up in lofty practice, in lofty contemplation, in the wisdom of the Word, in the power of love. He who is the One anointed by preaching is so great that he can be scarcely reached, even by the highest places.â€¦ The highest heights are the power of perfect conversation, and this is achieved by many perfectly. - "Six Books on 1 Kings 6.114"
