Indeed of one kind is the small flower of the grape, because great is the virtue and belief of the preachers that inebriate the minds of hearers; another is the smell of the olive flower, because sweet is the work of pity, which revives and glows like olive oil; another is the smell of the rose, because wondrous is its fragrance, which shines and is redolent with the blood of the martyrs; another is the smell of the lily, because its fleshly life is white with the incorruption of virginity; another is the smell of the violet, because great is the virtue of the humble who, preferring to occupy far-off places through humility, do not raise themselves from the earth to the heights and serve in their minds the purple of the heavenly kingdom; another is the smell of spikenard when it is led to maturity, because the perfection of good works is prepared for the satisfaction of those who thirst for justice.
