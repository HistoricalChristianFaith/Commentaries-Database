But what does the wheel signify except sacred Scripture, which turns from every side toward the minds of its hearers, and is held back from the way of its preaching by no corner of error? It turns from every side because amid adversity and prosperity it proceeds rightly and humbly. For the circle of its precepts is now above, now below, since what is spoken spiritually to the more perfect suits the weak according to the letter; and the very things that little ones understand according to the letter, learned men raise to the heights through spiritual understanding. For which of the little ones, in the deed of Esau and Jacob—that the one is sent to hunt so that he might be blessed, while the other is blessed by his father through his mother's substitution—is nourished except according to the history of sacred reading? In which history, if one is drawn a little more subtly to understanding, he sees that Jacob did not seize the blessing of the firstborn through fraud, but received what was owed to him, which he had purchased from his consenting brother for the price of lentils given.

But if anyone thinking more deeply should wish to discuss the deeds of both through the mysteries of allegory, he immediately rises from history into mystery. For what does it mean that Isaac desired to eat from the hunting of his elder son, except that almighty God desired to be fed by the good works of the Jewish people? But while that one delayed, Rebecca substituted the younger, because while the Jewish people sought good works outside, mother grace instructed the gentile people to offer the food of good work to the almighty Father and to receive the blessing of the elder brother. He provided those same foods from domestic animals, because the gentile people, not seeking to please God through external sacrifices, says through the voice of the Prophet: "In me, O God, are your vows, which I will pay, praises to you." What does it mean that the same Jacob covered his hands and arms and neck with goatskins, except that a goat was customarily offered for sin? And the gentile people indeed slaughtered the sins of the flesh in themselves, but were not ashamed to confess themselves covered with carnal sins. What does it mean that he was clothed in the garments of the elder brother, except that he was clothed in good work with the precepts of sacred Scripture which had been given to the elder people? And the younger uses in the house those things which the elder, going out, left inside, because the gentile people hold in mind those precepts which the Jewish people could not have, while they attended only to the letter in them. And what does it mean that Isaac did not know the son whom he blessed, except what the Lord said concerning the gentile people through the Psalmist: "A people whom I did not know served me; at the hearing of the ear they obeyed me"? What does it mean that he did not see him present, and yet saw what would come to him in the future, except that almighty God, when through his prophets he foretold that grace was to be bestowed upon the gentiles, both did not see them in the present through grace, because he then left them in error, and yet because he would someday gather them, he foresaw them through the grace of blessing? Hence also to the same Jacob, bearing the figure of the gentile people, it is said in blessing: "Behold, the smell of my son is like the smell of a full field, which the Lord God has blessed." For just as Truth says in the Gospel, "The field is this world," and because the gentile people brought to faith are fragrant with virtues through their elect throughout the whole world, the smell of the son is the smell of a full field.

For the flower of the grape smells one way, because great is the virtue and reputation of preachers who intoxicate the minds of their hearers; the flower of the olive smells another way, because sweet is the work of mercy which, like oil, refreshes and gives light; the flower of the rose smells another way, because wondrous is the fragrance that gleams and is fragrant from the blood of martyrs; the flower of the lily smells another way, because the chaste life of the flesh comes from the incorruption of virginity; the flower of the violet smells another way, because great is the virtue of the humble, who from desire hold the lowest places, and do not raise themselves up from the earth on high through humility, and preserve the purple of the heavenly kingdom in their mind; the ear of grain gives off its fragrance another way, when it is brought to maturity, because the perfection of good works is prepared for the satisfaction of those who hunger for justice. Therefore, because the Gentile people is scattered throughout the world in its elect, and from those virtues which it practices fills all who understand with the fragrance of good reputation, let it rightly be said: Behold, the smell of my son is as the smell of a full field. But because he does not have these same virtues from himself, let him add: Which the Lord God has blessed.

And since the same people of the elect rise through certain ones even into contemplation, but through certain others grow fat only in the works of the active life, rightly it is added there: "May God give you of the dew of heaven, and of the fatness of the earth." For dew falls from above and subtly. And we receive of the dew of heaven as often as through the infusion of intimate contemplation we see something finely from above. But when we also do good works through the body, we are enriched from the fatness of the earth.

But what does it mean that Esau returns late to his father, except that the Jewish people return late to pleasing the Lord? To whom this also is said in the blessing: And the time will come when the yoke shall be loosened from your neck. Because the Jewish people will be freed from the servitude of sin at the end, as it is written: Until the fullness of the Gentiles should enter in, and so all Israel should be saved.

Which person would the evangelical history itself not refresh among the little ones in the working of the miracle, because the Lord commanded empty water jars to be filled with water, and immediately turned that same water into wine? But when the more vigilant in understanding hear these things, they both venerate the sacred history by believing, and they seek what it signifies inwardly. For he who was able to change water into wine was also able to fill the empty water jars immediately with wine. But he commands the water jars to be filled with water, because first our hearts must be filled through the history of sacred reading. And he turns the water into wine for us, when that very history is changed for us into spiritual understanding through the mystery of allegory. Therefore the wheel is dragged as if along the ground, because it agrees with the little ones in humble speech, and yet pouring forth spiritual things to the great, it raises as if a circle on high; and it is raised upward from the very place where it seemed to touch the ground a little before.

Because it builds on all sides, it runs as if in a circle like a wheel. Hence it is also written in the Law: "You shall make a lampstand of hammered work from the purest gold, its shaft and branches, cups and spheres and lilies proceeding from it." Who is designated by the lampstand but the Redeemer of the human race? He who in the nature of humanity shone with the light of divinity, so that he might become the lampstand of the world, in order that in his light every sinner might see in what darkness he lay. Because he assumed our nature without guilt, the lampstand of the tabernacle is commanded to be made from the purest gold. Now hammered work is produced by striking, because our Redeemer, who from conception and birth existed as perfect God and man, endured the sufferings of the passion, and thus arrived at the glory of the resurrection. Therefore the lampstand was hammered work from the purest gold, because he both had no sin, and yet his body advanced to immortality through the insults of the passion. For according to the virtues of the soul, he had absolutely nothing by which he could have advanced through blows. But in his members, which we are, he daily advances through blows, because while we are struck and afflicted so that we may deserve to be his body, he himself advances. Concerning his body it is written: "From whom the whole body, supplied and constructed through joints and connections, grows into the increase of God." For we all are his body. Through joints and connections the body is bound together, because while the chest is joined to the head, while the arms are joined to the chest, while the hands are joined to the arms, the fingers to the hands, and the other members adhere to the members, the whole body is completed—just as the holy apostles, because they stood close to our Redeemer, were like the chest adhering to the head. Because the martyrs followed them, they were like arms joined to the chest. When pastors and teachers were joined to these through good works, the hands adhered to the arms. But this whole body of our Redeemer is daily supplied in heaven through joints and connections, because when chosen souls are led there to him, his members are bound together to him. Concerning this it is well said: "Supplied and constructed, it grows into the increase of God," because God almighty, our Redeemer, who has nothing in himself by which he might advance, still daily has increase through his members. Hence it is written again: "Until we all meet in a perfect man, in the measure of the age of the fullness of Christ." The shaft of this same lampstand should be understood as the Church itself, which is his body, because it stands free amid so many adversities. The branches that proceed from the shaft are the preachers, who produced a sweet sound in the world, namely the new song. Cups are usually filled with wine. What then are the minds of the hearers but cups, which are filled by the holy preachers with the wine of knowledge? And what is the sphere but the mobility of preaching? For a sphere is rolled from every side. And preaching, which can neither be held back by adversity nor lifted up by prosperity, is a sphere, because it is both strong amid adversities and humble amid prosperity, and has neither the corner of fear nor of pride. Therefore it cannot be fixed in its course, because it rolls itself through all things.

When we follow through on the example we have set forth, lilies are fittingly described on the lampstand after the reeds, cups, and spheres, because after the grace and fluency of preaching which we have mentioned, that verdant homeland follows, which blooms with eternal flowers for holy souls. The spheres therefore pertain to labor, the lilies to recompense. And so just as in Moses the sphere is understood as the teaching of preaching, so here the sacred Scripture itself is signified by the wheel. Therefore when the prophet saw the living creatures, he added: "And as I beheld the living creatures, there appeared one wheel upon the earth."

On this matter it must be asked, since the wheels are described below, why is one wheel said to have appeared first, unless because to the ancient people only the Old Testament was given, which would turn like a wheel to instruct their mind? And rightly is the same wheel said to have appeared upon the earth. For to sinning man it was said: You are earth, and into earth you will go. Therefore the wheel appeared upon the earth, because almighty God gave the law upon the hearts of sinners. But since these winged living creatures designate the holy evangelists, as we said before, how is it that the living creatures are seen first and afterward one wheel, when the Old Testament came first and the holy evangelists followed afterward? But we can understand in these things that those were seen first by the prophet who transcend in merit. For as much as the holy Gospel excels the Old Testament, so much also ought its preachers to have been given precedence in the prophetic description.

Although there is still something else that ought to be considered in this description, because the spirit of prophecy gathers together within itself things prior and posterior simultaneously in such a way that the prophet's tongue cannot utter these things simultaneously. But the vast things which he sees flow forth from divided discourses, and now he speaks the last things after the first, now indeed the first things after the last. Hence the prophet Ezekiel, under the figure of the holy universal Church, both sees the glory of the evangelists through the likeness of the four living creatures, and yet suddenly adds those things which were done in earlier times, so that he might openly indicate that he saw simultaneously what the tongue of flesh would not suffice to say simultaneously. But since we have said that all the perfect are also signified by the four living creatures, it must also be considered that certain of the saints existed even before the law, who lived strictly by natural law and were pleasing to the almighty Lord. Therefore the wheel is described after the living creatures, because many of the elect were perfect before the almighty Lord even before the law. But if we ought to take the living creatures as referring to the Evangelists alone, as we have said, there is still something else that we ought to consider. For the holy prophet was seeing that these very words which he was uttering wrapped in obscurities would be opened not to the Jewish people but to the Gentiles. Therefore, speaking to us, he ought to have described the living creatures first and the wheel afterward, because we, coming to faith by the Lord's bounty, learned the law not through the law but through the holy Gospel. But where or what kind of wheel appeared, he adds when he says: "Beside the living creatures having four faces."

What is this, that when one wheel was spoken of, shortly after it is added, "As if there were a wheel in the middle of a wheel," unless that in the letter of the Old Testament the New Testament lay hidden through allegory? Hence the same wheel which appeared beside the living creatures is described as having four faces, because Sacred Scripture through both Testaments is distinguished into four parts. For the Old Testament consists in the Law and the Prophets, while the New consists in the Gospels and the Acts and sayings of the Apostles. Now we know that where we direct our face, there we see what is necessary. The wheel therefore has four faces, because first it saw through the Law the evils to be cut away in the peoples, afterwards it saw through the Prophets, more subtly through the Gospel, and finally through the Apostles it beheld those things which were to be cut away from the faults of men. It can also be understood that the wheel has four faces on account of the fact that Sacred Scripture, extended through the grace of preaching into the four parts of the world, became known. Hence the same wheel is well described as having first appeared as one beside the living creatures and afterwards as having four faces, because unless the Law agreed with the Gospel, it would not become known in the four parts of the world.
