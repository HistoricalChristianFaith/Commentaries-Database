Those who are over others are to be warned that through prudence they should attain watchful eyes within and round about and strive to become living creatures of heaven. For the living creatures of heaven are described as full of eyes round about and within. So it is fitting that those who are over others should have eyes within and round about, so that in striving to please the inward judge and in serving outwardly as examples of life, they may detect the things that should be corrected in others.

What is it that in the words of Sacred Scripture these three things are said to be present, so that they are mentioned as having stature, height, and a horrible appearance, that is, a terrible one? We must greatly inquire what is called the stature of divine Scripture, what is its height, what is its horrible appearance. Therefore it must be known that to stand corresponds to the life of one who works well. Hence it is said through Paul: Let him who stands take heed lest he fall. He who also says to his disciples: So stand in the Lord, beloved. And the prophet, who saw himself standing before the Lord in life and conduct, said: The Lord lives, in whose sight I stand. Height, however, is the promise of the heavenly kingdom. Which is reached when all corruption of mortal life is now subdued. The horrible appearance, however, is the terror of hell, which tortures the reprobate without end, and always preserves them in torment. Therefore stature is in the rectitude of precept, height in the loftiness of the heavenly promise, and horrible appearance in the threats and terrors of the punishment that follows. Sacred Scripture therefore has stature, because it directs conduct toward standing, so that the minds of hearers may not be bent toward earthly desire. It has height, because it promises the joys of eternal life in the heavenly homeland. It also has a horrible appearance, because it threatens all the reprobate with the punishments of hell. Therefore it shows its stature in the building of conduct, it shows its height in the promise of rewards, it shows its horrible appearance in the terrors of punishments. For it is upright in precepts, lofty in promises, horrible in threats. It has stature when it says through the prophet: Cease to do evil, learn to do good, seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge the orphan, defend the widow. And again: Break your bread for the hungry, and bring the needy and wandering into your house; when you see the naked, cover him, and do not despise those of your own flesh. It has height when it says through the same prophet: The sun shall no longer be your light by day, nor shall the splendor of the moon illuminate you; but the Lord shall be your everlasting light, and your God shall be your glory. It has a horrible appearance when, describing hell, it says: The day of vengeance of the Lord, the year of retribution for the judgment of Zion; and its torrents shall be turned into pitch, and its soil into sulphur; and the land shall be burning pitch, day and night it shall not be extinguished forever. Which blessed Job also describes, saying: A land of darkness and covered with the mist of death, a land of misery and darkness, where is the shadow of death, and no order, but everlasting horror dwelling there. It has stature when through it the Lord graciously promises, saying: As the new heavens and the new earth, which I make to stand before me, says the Lord; so shall your seed and your name stand. For they truly stand before the Lord who do not waste their life in wickedness. It has height when it immediately adds: And there shall be month after month, and Sabbath after Sabbath, and all flesh shall come to worship before my face, says the Lord. What is a month but the perfection of days? And what is the Sabbath but rest in which servile work is not permitted? Therefore month after month means that those who live perfectly here are led to the perfection of glory there. And Sabbath after Sabbath means that those who cease from wicked work here rest in heavenly reward there. It also has a horrible appearance when it immediately adds: And they shall go out and see the corpses of the men who have transgressed against me. Their worm shall not die, and their fire shall not be extinguished. For what can be said or thought more horrible than to receive the wounds of damnation, and never to end the pains of the wounds! Of this horrible appearance of the wheels it is well said through Zephaniah, when the day of judgment is announced as coming upon hard hearts: The great day of the Lord is near, near and exceedingly swift. The voice of the day of the Lord is bitter, the strong man shall be troubled there. That day is a day of wrath, a day of tribulation and distress, a day of calamity and misery, a day of darkness and gloom, a day of cloud and whirlwind, a day of trumpet and clamor.

But since we have set forth the statements about the outer wheel, it remains now that we should also present the stature, height, and terrifying appearance of the inner wheel. Indeed, the inner wheel has its stature when through the holy Gospel it forbids us to bend toward earthly desires, saying in the words of our Redeemer: "Take heed lest your hearts be weighed down with carousing and drunkenness, or with the cares of this life." It has height when it promises concerning the same Redeemer, saying: "But as many as believed in him, he gave them power to become sons of God." For what can be said to be higher than this power, what more sublime than this height, in which every created being is made a son of the Creator? It has a terrifying appearance when it speaks of the reprobate, saying: "These shall go into everlasting punishment." It has stature when the Truth admonishes the disciples, saying: "Sell what you possess and give alms. Make for yourselves purses that do not grow old." It has the height of promise when it says: "They shall come from the East and the West, and shall recline with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven." It has a terrifying appearance when it adds: "But the sons of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer darkness; there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth." To whom again it is said by the voice of Truth: "You shall die in your sins." It has stature when it says in the words of the first pastor: "Supply in your faith virtue, and in virtue knowledge, and in knowledge self-control, and in self-control patience, and in patience godliness, and in godliness brotherly love, and in brotherly love charity." It has height when shortly after it says: "For so an entrance shall be ministered to you abundantly into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ." Who again promises to good pastors, saying: "When the chief Shepherd appears, you shall receive the unfading crown of glory." It has a terrifying appearance when it says: "But the day of the Lord will come as a thief, in which the heavens shall pass away with great violence, and the elements shall be dissolved with heat. Since all these things are to be dissolved, what manner of persons ought you to be in holy conduct and godliness, looking for and hastening unto the coming of the day of God, whereby the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with the ardor of fire?" It has stature when through Paul it raises us from earthly desires, saying: "Mortify your members which are upon the earth: fornication, uncleanness, lust, evil desire, and covetousness, which is the service of idols." It has height when it promises, saying: "Your life is hidden with Christ in God. For when Christ your life shall appear, then you also shall appear with him in glory." It has a terrifying appearance when it threatens, saying: "In the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ from heaven, with the angels of his power in a flame of fire, giving vengeance to those who do not know God, and who do not obey the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ, who shall suffer eternal punishments from the face of the Lord and from the glory of his power." It has stature when it admonishes us, saying: "See that no one renders evil for evil to anyone, but always pursue what is good toward one another and toward all." It has height when it promises, saying: "If we die with him, we shall also live with him; if we endure, we shall also reign with him." And again: "The sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the future glory that shall be revealed in us." It has a terrifying appearance when it threatens, saying: "A certain fearful expectation of judgment, and the fury of fire which shall consume the adversaries." Who again says: "It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God." All of which it also draws together in a brief statement, saying: "That you may be able to comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth, and length, and height, and depth." For charity is broad, because it encompasses even the love of enemies, and through that charity by which Almighty God loves us broadly, he also bears with us patiently. Therefore we ought to show to our neighbors what we see being shown to us who are unworthy by our Creator. And so breadth and length pertain to stature, because through love it enlarges our conduct, so that charity may patiently bear the faults of the brethren. But height is that reward of eternal prizes, of whose immensity it is said: "Eye has not seen, nor ear heard, nor has it entered into the heart of man, what things God has prepared for those who love him." Therefore it has height in its sublimity, because the eternal joys of the saints cannot now be penetrated by any thought. The depth also is that inestimable condemnation of punishments, which plunges those whom it receives into the lowest depths. In these things the sacred words have a terrifying appearance, because they strike inestimable terror into those who hear, when they speak of the punishments of hell. Rightly therefore it is said: "There was also stature in the wheels, and height, and terrifying appearance," because Sacred Scripture in both Testaments is upright in admonishing, lofty in promising, and terrible in threatening. Let it suffice, dearest brethren, for us to have said these things on this day by the Lord's bounty, so that we may return refreshed by rest to discuss the things that follow, trusting in God the author of all things and our Lord Jesus Christ, who lives and reigns with the Father in the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, through all ages of ages. Amen.

As you know, dearest brothers, it is the custom of prophecy to look now at this, now at that, and suddenly to turn words from one thing to another, as the Psalmist, when speaking of the Lord, said: "God is a just judge, strong and patient; is He angry every day? Unless you are converted, He has brandished His sword, He has bent His bow and made it ready; and in it He has prepared instruments of death, He has made His arrows for those who burn"; suddenly he adds: "He conceived sorrow and brought forth iniquity; he opened a pit and dug it out, and fell into the hole he made." Behold, when he was narrating the Lord's justice, as if without changing his voice, he suddenly introduced the guilt of the sinner. Let it suffice that I have said this one example by way of illustration, because whoever has practice in reading the prophets knows how frequently they do this. Hence now the prophet Ezekiel, when he was speaking about the wheels, added: "And the whole body was full of eyes around the four of them."

For he who said "of them" (masculine) rather than "of them" (feminine) clearly indicates that his speech suddenly returned from the wheels to the living creatures. By these, as was said before, all perfect persons are designated. Therefore the bodies of the living creatures are described as full of eyes, because the action of the saints is circumspect on every side, desirously providing for good things, skillfully guarding against evil things. And this is more laborious where the mind of the saints vigilantly watches lest evils hide themselves before their eyes under the appearance of good things. Therefore the life of the saints is circumspect, lest it be so free as to be proud, because often pride exceeds in words, and desires to appear as the freedom of purity. Lest it be so humble as to be fearful, because sometimes fear constrains the mind and does not presume to speak what is right, yet in that same timid thought it pretends to be humility. Lest it be so sparing as to be grasping, because very often greed desires to be considered frugality, so that it may seem to hold justly and necessarily whatever it does not wish to mercifully expend upon a needy neighbor. Lest it be so merciful as to be wasteful, because sometimes it thinks wastefulness to be mercy. For it is one thing to give necessities to neighbors from the zeal of piety, and another to scatter what one possesses without intention of reward. Therefore whatever is done must be weighed in the root of intention, by what merit it may be held at the judgment of the Creator. Hence the same Creator says: "If your eye be simple, your whole body will be full of light." Calling the eye, of course, intention, and the body, action. Because if our intention is simple before God, our action will not be dark in His judgment. Therefore, because holy men skillfully watch so that they may look upon themselves from every side and guard themselves everywhere, lest they either desire evils for their own sake, or do these same things under the appearance of good things—namely, lest vices deceive them into thinking they are virtues—they have the whole body full of eyes round about, because all their action is both filled and surrounded by the providence of solicitude.

Hence it is that the Apostle Paul, when he perceived that the Corinthians wished to show mercy to a certain penitent for a crime he had committed, says: "If you have forgiven anyone anything, so have I. For what I have forgiven, if I have forgiven anything, I have done for your sake in the person of Christ, lest we be outwitted by Satan. For we are not ignorant of his designs." For if pardon was to be granted, why did that excellent teacher associate himself with such humility to the will of his disciples, so that neither he himself seemed divided from his disciples, nor they from him, in the matter of compassion, unless because with the watchful eye of providence he observed that very often when one pardons, another grows angry? And what kind of sacrifice of mercy is that which is offered together with discord toward one's neighbor? Hence he rightly says: "Lest we be outwitted by Satan. For we are not ignorant of his designs." Because, that is to say, from the very source where he sees one person performing a work of piety, he is accustomed to cast the evil of strife into another's heart. For the good is imperfect which is done in such a way that no attention is paid lest some evil creep up on it from another side, unless perhaps it would be a fault not to do that which cannot be done without giving offense to someone.

We say this, however, to make known to your love that in our good work we must sometimes beware of scandalizing our neighbor, but sometimes it must be despised as nothing. We learned this from our own Author, who, when tribute was sought from Peter after inquiry, first proposed an example through which he answered that he owed nothing, saying: "The kings of the earth, from whom do they receive tribute or tax—from their own sons, or from strangers?" When he was told "From strangers," he immediately replied: "Therefore the sons are free." But after he showed that he was free, lest perhaps he cause scandal to anyone, he added: "But so that we may not scandalize them, go to the sea and cast a hook, and take the first fish that comes up, and when you open its mouth you will find a coin; take that and give it to them for me and for you." Again, when he said that everything which enters the mouth does not defile a man, then the disciples came and said to him: "Do you know that the Pharisees, having heard this word, were scandalized?" But he answered and said: "Every plant which my heavenly Father has not planted will be uprooted. Leave them alone; they are blind, and guides of the blind." Behold, the Master Truth, lest scandal be generated in the hearts of some, paid the tribute that he did not owe; and again, because he saw that scandal against truth was being generated in the hearts of some, he allowed them to remain in their scandal.

From which matter we must consider that, insofar as we are able without sin, we ought to avoid giving scandal to our neighbors. If, however, scandal is taken from the truth, it is more profitable to permit scandal to arise than for truth to be abandoned. Therefore the bodies of the living creatures are full of eyes when they cautiously look around themselves on every side.

But we must know that often, while we are attending to some things, it happens that we neglect others; and where we neglect, there without doubt we do not have an eye. For that Pharisee who had gone up to the temple to pray, as the Gospel attests, we have recognized what he said. For he said: God, I thank you. And rightly he gave thanks to God, from whom he had received the good things he had done. He also added: That I am not like the rest of men, robbers, unjust, adulterers, even like this Publican; I fast twice on the Sabbath, I give tithes of all that I possess. Behold, the Pharisee had an eye for displaying abstinence, for bestowing mercy, for giving thanks to God, but he did not have an eye for guarding humility. And what does it profit if a city is carefully guarded almost entirely against the ambushes of enemies, if one opening is left exposed through which enemies may enter? What then does a guard profit that is placed almost everywhere around, when the whole city is opened to enemies through the neglect of one place? But the Pharisee who practiced fasting, gave tithes, returned thanks to God, as it were kept watch almost completely around in guarding his city. But because he did not attend to one opening of pride in himself, there he suffered the enemy, where through negligence he closed his eye. Because therefore the minds of the saints keeping watch examine themselves on every side, and in all their work lead around the eye of fear and solicitude, lest they either do wrong things, or fail to do right things that are commanded, or having completed good actions, become swollen in their thoughts, and offend all the more grievously the more they appear righteous outwardly and sin more secretly, it is rightly said: Their whole body is full of eyes round about.

It should also be known that in the old translation it does not read: "Their whole body was full of eyes round about," but rather it says: "Their backs were full of eyes." This statement, of course, does not depart from the sense of edification. For sinful people are often accustomed to guard those things which are in front. But righteous men, because they guard themselves even in those things which are not readily seen and in front, are said to have eyes in their backs. Therefore those who examine even the things that are hidden, and guard themselves from those very things that lie concealed, certainly have eyes in their backs. This, however, can also be understood in another way: because we see the things that are before our face, but another person sees our backs in us, and we ourselves cannot see them. But since holy men carefully examine themselves in those matters by which they can be judged by others, and strictly see themselves just as they are often strictly seen by others—they who are not ignorant even of those things in themselves that could remain hidden—they carry light on their back.
