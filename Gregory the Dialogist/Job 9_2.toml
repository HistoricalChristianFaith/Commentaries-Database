2.  For man being put under God receives righteousness; being put with God he loses it: for everyone that compares himself with the Author of all good things, bereaves himself of the good which he had received.  For he that ascribes to himself blessings vouchsafed to him, is fighting against God with His own gifts.  Therefore by whatsoever means he being in contempt is lifted up, it is meet that being so set up he be brought to the ground by the same.  Now because he sees that all the worth of our goodness is evil if it be strictly accounted of by the Judge of the interior.
