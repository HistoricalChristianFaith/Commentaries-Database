21. Well indeed, those who slay the Philistines are said to have gone forth from Mizpah. For in Mizpah, which is called "watching," those dwell who persist in the contemplation of divine things. But they go out to slay the Philistines when, coming forth instructed from the secret of inner meditation, they suppress the forces of hostile domination. For inwardly they secretly arrange how outwardly, in open action, they may break through the battle formations of the enemy. Indeed they wage all the heavier battles against them when they go forth, the more quietly they have lain hidden within themselves while pondering internal things. And because evil spirits must always be suppressed by God's elect, the Philistines are recorded to have been struck down as far as the place below Beth-car. Beth-car indeed is interpreted as "house of the lamb." Isaiah, pointing out this lamb to us, says: "As a lamb he shall be led to the slaughter, and as a sheep before its shearer, without a sound" (Isaiah 53:7). What then was the house of the lamb, if not that sublime and uniquely fortified life of the Redeemer, which, since it was free from fault, stood inaccessible to all wicked spirits? No one can reach Beth-car, that is, the house of the lamb, because whoever advances greatly is still inferior to the holiness of the Redeemer. Hence also the outstanding preacher, pressing upon the praises of the same Redeemer, says: "It was fitting that we should have such a high priest: holy, innocent, undefiled, separated from sinners, and made higher than the heavens, who has no need, as priests do, first to offer sacrifices for his own sins" (Hebrews 7:26–27). What then is the place below Beth-car, to which we must slay and pursue the Philistines? But if Beth-car signifies the perfection of the Lord's life, the place below Beth-car expresses the common highest sanctity of the Saints, who both humble themselves by obeying the same Redeemer, and draw near to his glory through the pursuit of an innocent life. For the place which is shown to be situated below Beth-car is recognized as both inferior to and near the place beneath which it lies: because holy men, the nearer they are to God through the height of their life, the more they are subject to him in humbler thought. Therefore, while the triumph of new believers is shown under the deeds of the Israelites, the foreigners are said to have been slain as far as the place below the house of the lamb: because indeed through unceasing effort of struggle, we must strive toward the citadel of perfection, where we may be all the more terrible to our enemies, the nearer we are to our Redeemer. For there is already a certain security there which cannot be disturbed by fear of enemies. For the Lord, pointing out the gifts of granted power to such as these, says: "Behold, I have given you power to tread upon serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy" (Luke 10:19). Hence also he who had reached the place near to the house of the lamb says: "Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation, or distress, or hunger" (Romans 8:35), or other such things? The house of the lamb can also designate the heavenly homeland. Hence John also says: "I saw upon Mount Zion a lamb standing, and with him one hundred forty-four thousand, having his name and the name of his Father written on their foreheads" (Revelation 14:1). What then is the place that is below the house of the lamb, if not the boundary of temporal life, from which the elect are taken up to the joys of the heavenly homeland? For we who are led to the boundary appointed for us, which we cannot pass beyond by living, come as it were to a place from which we may be transferred elsewhere. But the boundary of the elect man's life is shown to be situated below the house of the lamb: because from where he is plunged down through the straits of mortality, from there he is raised up to the joys of unfailing life. For even the Lamb himself, who joyfully inhabits his own house amid harpists playing and singing, before he was led to the joy of this house, was below the house. For hence it is that at the time of his sacrifice he says: "My soul is sorrowful even unto death" (Matthew 26:38; Mark 14:34). Therefore the end of each elect person, while it is indicated by a place, is recorded as being below Beth-car, that is, the house of the lamb; because holy men, when they leave temporal things through the penalty of death, ascend from nearby to the heavenly homeland that stands above them. For Paul, asserting confidently, says: "We know that if our earthly house is dissolved, we have a dwelling from God, not made with hands, in heaven" (2 Corinthians 5:1). Therefore we slay the Philistines as far as the place that is below the house of the lamb, if as long as we are in this life, we triumph over evil spirits.
