48.  What ‘heavens,’ saving those concerning whom it is written, The heavens are telling the glory of God? [Ps. 19, 1]  Which ‘heavens His Spirit garnished’ then, when It ‘filled’ them.  Which we have learnt by Luke’s relating, who saith, Suddenly there came a sound from heaven, as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting; and there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues as the Spirit gave them utterance. [Acts 2, 2–4 ]  From Him, then, they received the adornments of prowess, whom an exceeding disfigurement of fear before had possession of.  For we know that first one of the Apostles, i.e. of the ‘heavens,’ how often, before the grace of the Holy Spirit was vouchsafed, whilst he feared to die, he denied ‘the Life;’ who not by punishments, not by inflictions, not by the dreadful power of anyone, but by the simple interrogation of a single slave, was brought to the ground.  And truly that that slave the sterner sex might not exhibit as an object to cause alarm, it was by a maidservant putting the question that he was tried.  Again, that the weakness of such a sex, by the lowness of her office as well might be made contemptible, he was questioned not by a maidservant only, but by a maidservant keeper of the door.  See how contemptible the person is that is sought out for the purpose of trying him, that it might be plainly brought to light, what excessive weakness of fear possessed him, who even before the voice of a maidservant of the door could not stand fast.
49.  But this one a little before so full of affright, what after the Coming of the Holy Spirit he became, let us now see.  Surely we have learnt by Luke’s attesting it, with what an authoritativeness he preached the word, in opposition to the priests and rulers.  For when upon a miracle being wrought inquiry had arisen, and the rulers from among the priests, the elders, and the scribes laid their hands together in the persecution of the Apostles, setting those persons in the midst, they busied themselves to ask in what power they had wrought the miracle.  Unto whom Peter being filled with the Holy Spirit spake, Ye rulers of the people and elders; if we be this day examined of the deed done to the impotent man, by what means he is made whole; be it known unto you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by the Name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, Whom ye crucified, Whom God raised from the dead, even by Him doth this man stand here before you whole. [Acts 4, 8. &c.]  And when the rage of the persecutors against this grew to a head, and the priests and rulers forbade those men to preach Jesus, with what independent power Peter rose in height against the wrath of the rulers, is made plain, when it is there added directly, But Peter and the Apostles answered and said unto them, It is right to obey God rather than man. [v. 19]  But when the commands of those withstanding did not repress the influence of the persons preaching, it comes to scourges.  For it is added, And when the chief priests had beaten them, they commanded that they should not speak in the Name of Jesus, and let them go. [Acts 5, 40]  But that the prowess of the Apostles not even scourges had power to restrain, is openly shown, when it is immediately introduced next, And they departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for the Name of Jesus.  And immediately even after the rejoicing of their scourges what they did we have pointed out; And daily in the temple, and in every house, they ceased not to teach and to preach Jesus Christ.  Mark, that man, a little while before full of fears, now speaks with tongues, flashes forth with miracles, with free voice rebukes the unbelief of the priests and rulers, gives to the rest for the preaching of Jesus an example of independence.  That he should not speak in His Name, he is restrained by scourgings, and yet is not withheld.  He sets at nought the strokes of those that scourged him, who a little while back had dreaded the words of those that questioned him.  And he that when asked a question shrunk in consternation from the powers of a maidservant, when beaten with the rod forces back the powers of the rulers.  For being henceforth established by the efficacy of the Holy Spirit, the heights of this world he trod down with the heel of liberty, that he should see that that was low down on the earth, whatever it was that swelled high against the grace of the Creator.
50.  These are the ornaments of the heavens, these are the gifts of the Spirit, that are used to be manifested by divers powers, which as divided by the bestowal of secret distribution Paul reckons up, saying, For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit; to another faith by the same Spirit; to another the gifts of healing by the same’ Spirit; to another the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to another discerning of spirits; to another divers kinds of tongues; to another the interpretation of tongues. [1 Cor. 12, 8–10]  All which directly afterwards including in one by a general statement he says, But all these worketh that one and the self-same Spirit, dividing to every man severally as He will.  Of these ‘heavens’ too it is said in the Psalm, By the word of the Lord were the heavens set fast. [Ps. 33, 6]  Of these ornaments of the Spirit also it is added, And all the power of them by the Spirit of His mouth.  Therefore it is well said, His Spirit hath garnished the heavens; because the holy Preachers, except they received the gifts of the Paraclete, that were promised to them, would not have shone with any comeliness of might.  But because when the Holy Apostles were beautified with the grace of the gifts of virtue, the preaching of life gained ground against the hearts of unbelievers, and our old enemy being expelled by the voices of the preachers, abandoned the minds of the unbelievers, which he had close beset; after the ornaments of the heavens it is fitly subjoined;
And by the midwifery of His hand the crooked serpent is brought forth.
51.  For who is described by the designation of the ‘serpent,’ but our old enemy, at once slippery and crooked, who for the deceiving of man spake with the mouth of a serpent?  Of whom it is said by the Prophet, Leviathan the bar-serpent, the crooked one [Is. 27, 1]; who was for this reason allowed to speak with the mouth of a serpent, that by that very vessel of his man might learn what he was that dwelt within.  For a serpent is not only crooked but slippery as well; and so because he stood not in the uprightness of truth, he entered into a crooked animal, and because if to his first suggestion resistance be not made, in a moment whilst it is not perceived he slips in entire into the interior of the heart, he made speech to man by a slippery animal.  Now ‘the dens’ of this serpent were the hearts of wicked men.  Which same because he drew on to his own depravity, he as it were rested in the dwelling place of them.  But ‘by the midwifery of the Lord’s hand, the crooked serpent is driven out of his own dens,’ in that whilst the Divine grace heals us, he that had held possession of us, our old enemy, is cast out of us, as Truth Incarnate says, Now shall the prince of this world be cast out. [John 12, 31]  Hence all the Saints now already he does not possess by holding, but persecutes by trying.  For because he does not reign in them within, he fights against them without, and because he has lost his dominion in the interior, he sets on foot wars in the exterior.  For him That One drove forth from the carnal hearts of men, Who for the sake of men came to the state of Incarnation; and whereas He took seisin of the hearts of unbelievers, He as it were put His hand to the dens of the serpent.  Whence it is rightly said by the Prophet; And the sucking child shall play on the hole of the asp, and the weaned child shall put his hand on the cockatrice den.  They shall not hurt nor destroy in all My Holy Mountain. [Is. 11, 8. 9.]  For whom does he call ‘the sucking child,’ or ‘the weaned child,’ saving the Lord?  And what did he denote by ‘the hole of the asp,’ and ‘the cockatrice den,’ saving the hearts of wicked men?  Because our old enemy, whereas he gat himself wholly into their consenting, as a crooked serpent in his own hole, he gathered and wound up the coils of his craftiness; whom he both designates with the title of ‘asp’ as covertly ravening, and of a ‘cockatrice’ as openly wounding.  And so the Lord ‘put His hand upon the hole of the asp and the cockatrice,’ when He took seisin of the hearts of the wicked by Divine power.  And the asp and the cockatrice, being seized, i.e. the devil, he drew away therefrom a captive, that ‘in His Holy Mountain,’ which is the Church, he might not ‘harm’ His Elect believers.
Thus it is hence said in the Song of Songs, on the coming of the Spouse; Thou shalt be crowned from the top of Amana, from the top of Shenir and Hermon, from the lions’ dens. [Cant. 4, 8]  For what else is denoted by the title of the lions but the devils, which rage against us with the fury of the deadliest cruelty?  And because the sinners are called to faith, whose hearts were once ‘the dens of lions,’ when by their confession the Lord is believed to have overcome death, it is as if He were ‘crowned from the lions’ dens.’  For a crown is the recompense of victory.  So often then do the faithful offer a crown to Him, as they confess that He has overcome death by virtue of the Resurrection.  And so ‘the lion is driven from his den,’ because ‘by the midwifery of the Lord’s hand,’ ‘the crooked serpent is hindered from dwelling in the dens,’ which he had possession of.  For he went forth defeated from the hearts of believers, who had aforetime ruled over them with the sceptre of unbelief.
53.  Observe how in a few short sentences the holy man related the order of the Lord’s Advent, set forth its weighty charges, and in admiring described what by His Incarnation was possible to be done.  But He, Who wrought marvellous things when He came in humility, cannot be viewed with all the great terribleness He shall come with, when He appeareth in the mightiness of His Majesty.  The order of His first Advent might be viewed and estimated, in so far as in coming to redeem carnal beings, He abated the greatness of His Divinity to carnal eyes.  But who might bear the terrors of His Highness, when with the power of the Second Advent in exercising judgment by fire, He shall glow in the Majesty of His power?  Whence the holy man describes His first Advent, but is exhausted for the second.
