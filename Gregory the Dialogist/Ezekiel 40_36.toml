"And its windows round about, fifty cubits in length, and twenty-five cubits in width." But because our discourse has led us to the resurrection of the flesh, it is exceedingly sad and greatly lamentable that we know some stand in the Church and yet doubt the resurrection of the flesh. The ancient fathers most certainly believed this would come, even when they held no example yet of that same resurrection. With what condemnation, therefore, are those worthy who have already received the example of the Lord's resurrection, and yet still distrust their own resurrection? They hold the pledge, and have not faith. They fill the Church, but because they doubt their own resurrection, they stand with empty minds. Concerning this resurrection it is said through blessed Job: "I know that my Redeemer lives, and on the last day I shall rise from the earth, and again I shall be clothed with my skin, and in my flesh I shall see God; whom I myself shall see, and my eyes shall behold, and not another." Hence also through the Psalmist it is said: "In his sight all who descend into the earth fall prostrate." For the dead descend into the earth not in spirit, but in body. Therefore those who descend into the earth fall prostrate in the sight of the Lord, because those who now rot in dust come to judgment by rising again.
