15.  For ‘man is born to labour,’ in that he, who is furnished with the gift of reason, bethinks himself that it is wholly impossible for him to pass through this season of his pilgrimage without sorrowing.  Hence when Paul was recounting his woes to his disciples, he justly added, For yourselves know that we are appointed thereto. [1Thess. 3, 3]  But even in that the flesh is afflicted with scourges, the mind is lifted up to seek higher things, as Paul again bears witness, saying, But though our outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by day. [2 Cor. 4, 16]  So then, ‘man is born to labour, and a bird to flying,’ for the mind flies free on high for the very same reason that the flesh toils the sorer below. 
16.  By the designation of ‘man’ too, may be represented the life of the carnal sort.  And hence Paul says, For whereas there is among you envying and strife and divisions, are ye not carnal? [1 Cor. 3, 3]  Soon after which he subjoins and says, Are ye not men? [ver. 4, Vulg.]  In this life, then, ‘man is born to labour,’ for every carnal person, in seeking to obtain transitory things, is overcharging himself with the burthen of his desires.  For it is sore labour to be seeking this same glory of the present life, at times to win it so sought, and to guard it with diligence when won.  It is sore labour, with infinite pains to lay hold of that, which he, that shall lay hold, knows can never remain for long.  But holy men, forasmuch as they have no fondness for transitory objects, are not only laid under no burthen of temporal desires, but even, if crosses on any occasion arise, in these very straits and faintings are free from trouble.  For what is there more severe than scourges?  and yet it is written concerning the Apostles when scourged, And they departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for His Name. [Acts 5, 41]  What then can be labour to the minds of those, to whom even the chastisement of stripes is not labour?  Man then is ‘born to labour,’ for he really feels the ills of the present state, who is agape after the good things thereof.  For that mind which hangs on the attraction of things above, has beneath it whatsoever is set in motion against it from without.  Therefore it is well added, and a bird to flying.  For the soul withdraws itself from the painfulness of labour, in proportion as it raises itself through hope toward things on high.  Was not Paul like a ‘bird born to flying,’ who in undergoing such countless crosses, said, Our conversation is in heaven? [Phil. 3, 20]  And again, We know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens. [2 Cor. 5, 1]  Like a bird, then, he had mounted above the scenes below, whom, while yet lingering on earth in the body, the wing of hope was already bearing up in the heights.  But forasmuch as none by his own strength can transport himself on high, so as to be raised to the invisible world, while he is borne down by visible things, it is immediately added with propriety,
