17. For the Lord closed the womb of Holy Church, because, rejected by His supreme judgment, it could not give birth to the Jewish people in the faith of our Redeemer. Her rival indeed afflicted her, because the synagogue raged against her with threats and reproaches. But she who had not been broken by either threats or insults was also subjected to punishment by torture. Rightly therefore she is said not only to afflict her but to distress her vehemently: because rejected Judea moved against the chosen Church with the terror of threats, and struck her with blows. Hence concerning Saul, who was persecuting at that time, it is said in the Acts of the Apostles: "Saul, still breathing threats and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord, went to the chief priest and asked him for letters to Damascus, so that if he found any men of this Way, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem" (Acts 9:1-2). For he who was breathing threats and slaughter was not only afflicting but also distressing the Church, which he rivaled wickedly. For he confesses that he was her rival, saying: "For you have heard of my former conduct in Judaism, how I persecuted the Church of God beyond measure and tried to destroy it, and I advanced in Judaism beyond many of my contemporaries in my nation, being more exceedingly zealous for my ancestral traditions" (Galatians 1:13-14). And because Judea fell into such a depth of damnation that she rejoices in being cast off by God's eternal judgment, it is added: "To such an extent that she reproached her because the Lord had closed her womb." For she still considered it a great thing that she could not prevail to be converted to the faith. Therefore, as if the prophet were marveling at the magnitude of her blindness, he says: She is weighed down by such darkness of error that she insults the good on account of that by which she herself can no longer become good. And because Holy Church grieved for her as she perished, it follows: (Verse 7.) Moreover, Anna wept

(Moral Exposition) Anna is afflicted by her rival, when immoderate attention to good work disturbs the quiet of inner vision. She is afflicted when she who is proved to be more noble is placed before her, and she is greatly distressed, because the contemplation of the elect mind is narrowed when he who desires to be in the contemplation of sublime things spreads himself too immoderately in the works of the active life. For to distress is to constrict. Indeed the vision of the mind is constricted when, impeded by the occupations of works, it is by no means expanded in that immensity of inner light. And because she is said to distress her greatly, it should be noted that immoderate concern for good work also harms contemplation not a little. For Peninnah greatly distresses Anna, because when the mind is immoderately devoted to the active life, it is very difficult for it, while it occupies itself with arranging earthly things, to rise powerfully in the vision of heavenly things. Peninnah also reproaches her as if barren, because while we quickly bring forth the fruit of good works from the active life, and cannot easily attain to the joys of inner contemplation, she appears barren while we, inexperienced, despair of her fruitfulness. Therefore while we love Peninnah for her fruitfulness, Anna is afflicted, distressed, and marked with the reproach of barrenness, because while we do not restrain the concern for good actions with the discretion we ought, we render the purity of contemplation so much more difficult for ourselves, inasmuch as we by no means retain the nobler life with excellent zeal. But because she has begun to ascend to higher things, if she is strong in her purpose, enduring such trials, she does not despair. For she strives toward those lofty heights of contemplation which she has begun, and scorns to be consoled by the food of action, she who has desired to delight in the sight of the Creator alone. And so it is fittingly added: (Verse 7.) Moreover Anna wept, and did not take food.
