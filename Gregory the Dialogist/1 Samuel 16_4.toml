8. As for the historical sense, the elders are amazed, because the prophet was not accustomed to come there. By this it is perhaps signified that chosen teachers should scarcely ever be seen in public, should be frequent in solitude, free from civil affairs, full of spiritual ones. Therefore it becomes a wonder to the people when the person of the pastor is seen in public. They marvel that he goes out whom they knew as a cultivator of secrecy. Because he is held in great veneration by the people, the elders of the city are reported both to have marveled and to have gone out to meet him. But because not the people but the elders marvel, the perfect virtue of teachers is shown, which is praised not by the little ones and the simple but by the great and the learned. They also inquire about the peaceful coming of the prophet. As if, then, he who said threatened a coming that was not peaceful: "What do you wish? Shall I come to you with a rod, or in the spirit of gentleness?" (1 Cor. 4:21). What then is the meaning of what is said: (Verse 4) "Is your coming peaceful?"

9. But the chosen faithful, when they rightly consider the deeds of spiritual teachers, assuredly weigh the divine will in them. For because they knew Samuel to be a prophet, it was assuredly because he had known the secrets of divine dispensation. Therefore, when they ask about his peaceful arrival, what else do they do by asking than wish to know the secret of divine counsel? Would that we also, as often as we see holy men, would be eager to inquire about the security of our peace, and to learn diligently from them how we are seen by God, we who do not have the eyes of our own knowledge. Therefore the arrival of teachers is peaceful when they come to those who are not to be struck for fault, but to be exhorted for the sake of righteousness. He therefore who had come to the righteous man who had been advanced, answered saying: (Verse 5) "Peaceful; I have come to sacrifice to the Lord. Sanctify yourselves and come with me, that we may sacrifice."

He came also to Bethlehem, because the order of preachers strove first to convert Judea, and afterward preached the faith of the Redeemer to the Gentiles. But what does it mean that the elders of the city marvel, except that those who had attained the understanding of maturity were astonished at the preaching of so great a novelty? But marveling, they come to meet him, because they gladly hear the preaching of the truth. To come to meet preachers is to hear with desire the word of faith that they preach. What do they ask about his peaceful entrance? What is a peaceful entrance, except when he has come with the presence of peace? This same peace He shows who says: "He Himself is our peace, who has made both one" (Eph. 2:14). What does it mean, then, that they ask about his peaceful entrance, except that the hearts of the elect Jews were waiting with desire for the promise of the fathers? As if wavering, those who were waiting might say: "Has the peace perhaps come, which foretold that it would come, so great a span of time running ahead?" And because the new teachers relate that what the ancient fathers had promised has been fulfilled, they say: "It is peaceful." As if to say: We do not promise future things, but we show the present gifts of peace. In our entrance it is present; in our word it is not something future. Already the righteous Simeon saw, already he held and adored Him, saying: "Now you dismiss your servant, O Lord, according to your word in peace" (Luke 2:29). Already He appeared to the shepherds; already, with the long-awaited peace sent from heaven, the multitude of angels sang: "Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace to men of good will" (Luke 2:14). And because He had come not only to preach peace but also to persuade, he adds, saying: "I have come to sacrifice."
