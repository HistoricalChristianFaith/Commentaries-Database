Some subjects, while neglecting the measure of their own order, confuse that same measure in such a way that they share in the decision-making of their superiors, yet refuse to obey their commands. They easily dare to correct the words of their superiors, but do not strive to easily fulfill what they command. What then is shown to us in the voice of this armor-bearer, except that free decision-making must be left to those in authority, and the virtue of obedience must be held by subjects without slackening? For, to assign free authority of decision-making to preachers, he says: "Do all things that please your heart." And to show the ready willingness of subjects for every service, he adds: "Go where you desire, and I will be with you wherever you wish." Nor indeed did he say there: "Do some things that are in your heart, and do not do some things, or do them differently"; nor here: "Go there, and I will be with you, but there I will not be with you." "Do all things," he says, because all things are to be arranged by the decision of superiors. "I will likewise be with you," he says, "wherever you wish"; because one who is subject to any command of obedience ought not to be absent from it.
