By these same words the time of holy church is set forth, when it is openly derided by the lost; when the wicked are gaining ground, faith becomes a reproach. Truth becomes a ground of accusation. So much the more contemptible shall each individual be in proportion to his righteousness. The worse object of abhorrence, the more worthy object of praise. Therefore the holy church of the elect in the time of calamity “becomes a proverb” to the wicked.… “They abhor me, they flee away from me; they do not hesitate to spit at my face.” All the wicked “flee away” from holy church, not by the paces of footsteps but by the characters of their practices. They fly far not in place but desert, whereas, pride gaining ground, they condemn the church with open upbraiding. For “to spit at his face” implies not only to speak evil of the good in their absence but also to openly defy the just in their presence. And these then while the wicked by openly deriding put them down, they let out insults upon them in loose words, like streams of spittle running down.…“He has opened his quiver and afflicted me.” What is denoted by the “quiver” of God but secret counsel? Now the Lord casts the arrow from the quiver, when from his secret counsel he sends forth an open sentence. Any one can suffer, but the cause of the suffering is obscure. After the scourge, amendment of life follows and the actual power of counsel is itself disclosed as well. So the quiver shut is hidden counsel. But we are chastised by an open quiver when by that which follows after the scourge, we see with what counsel we are stricken.…
“And he put a bridle into my mouth.” Therefore because holy church, who ever gives forth its words in a spirit of charity, let it say, “He has put a bridle into my mouth.” It is as though he confessed openly, saying, “Because in some I did not see any progress from preaching, I refrained assault that through the events of life they might be taught with patience. With words of preaching only they would never consent to receive counsel.” But this grieves us especially in troubles that occur with kinfolk, where we have trusted them with love.
