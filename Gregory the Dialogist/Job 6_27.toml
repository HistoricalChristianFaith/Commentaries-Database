1. For he shows what great weakness he considers himself to be of, who calls himself ‘fatherless.’  But because charity even when wounded cannot quit love, he at once complains that they would have him overthrown, and yet witnesses that he is their friend.  Whose words, as we have often said already, in such wise specially apply to himself, that yet by them, in the Spirit of Prophecy, we have at the same time set forth the sentiment [‘sententia.’ see l. xxiii. § 31] of the faithful People, in the voice of the Church Universal.  Which same People, while encountering the opposition of heretics, both regards itself as weak in humility, and yet never abandons the greatness of keeping love entire, For the People of Holy Church, as it is the child of a dead Father, is not unfitly called ‘fatherless,’ in that henceforth indeed through faith it follows His life of Resurrection, but does not as yet see Him by His appearing.  Now heretics ‘overwhelm the fatherless,’ when they bear hard upon the lowliness of the faithful People, by clamorous and false charges, and yet he is a ‘friend,’ whom they set themselves to ‘overthrow,’ in that God's faithful People never cease with loving affection to call to the Truth, the very persons whom they suffer as persecutors.  But herein it is necessary to be known, that holy men neither dread from weakness to be exposed to falsehoods, nor in being harmed ever hold their peace as to the Truth.
