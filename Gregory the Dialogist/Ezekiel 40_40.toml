And at the outer side, which goes up to the entrance of the gate that looks toward the north.

Nor does it seem foreign to reason that the prophet, when he was speaking of the outer side and naming the door of the gate, added: Which goes toward the North. For in the outer custody the law given in the letter was kept. But the door of the gate is the historical understanding itself of the law, which leads to the fear of the Lord. This gate is said to go toward the North, because the same law under the fear of death constrained the cold hearts of the Jewish people. For that people would have run as if through heat, if they had kept the Lord's commandments out of love. But because they kept the letter under the fear of proposed death, they remained as if in the torpor of cold. Hence to the new peoples loving eternal rewards, not fearing temporal torments, and already being warm, it is said: You have not received the spirit of servitude again in fear, but the spirit of adoption, in which we cry out, Abba, Father.

The gate that leads to the north.

The gate that leads to the north also has two tables on one side and two on the other—the same chief priests and elders of the people we mentioned who held greater authority in governance, as well as the scribes and Pharisees who presided over that unlearned people in a lesser position. But these tables are beside the gate that leads to the north, because when these four orders presided over the people, the Synagogue, raging in the persecution of our Redeemer, rushed headlong into the torpor of unbelief. Nevertheless, these tables had sacrifice, which they held according to the letter alone; hence they also slipped into the torpor of cold, because they were not kindled by the flame of the Spirit. But the interior tables have a holocaust, because whether in the hearts of the apostles and prophets, or in the minds of the evangelists and teachers, the fire of the Spirit both burned and burns. Because it consumes their every thought in good work, the flame of the love of God, like a holocaust, sets ablaze all at once whatever it finds. For they offer a holocaust who are kindled to the very marrow, whether in good work or in holy meditation.
