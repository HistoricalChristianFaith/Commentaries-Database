The gates of the spiritual building have seven steps because they proclaim to their hearers fear of the Lord, godliness and knowledge, fortitude and counsel, understanding and wisdom. But when they require the renunciation of all things, when they warn that nothing in this world is to be loved and nothing retained through fondness, when they advocate concentration on the contemplation of the heavenly kingdom and rejoicing in its mysteries, they add a step and pass over to inner truths.
