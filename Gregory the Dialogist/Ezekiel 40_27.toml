Now it is said: "And the gate of the inner court toward the South way, and he measured from gate to gate in the South way, one hundred cubits." Now, therefore, we must inquire what these three inner gates are. For the gate of the inner court which was mentioned above is not among these three inner gates, because that one is said to face toward the gate of the East and North, whereas these are recorded as being positioned individually within toward the South or East and North. Hence through that one the inner entrance is rightly designated, because, as was already said in the preceding discussion, it lies open either to Jews and Gentiles, or to those beginning and those persevering in good, or to those falling from good but rising after their faults through repentance. But now, after individual gates have been described in the East and North and South, why are individual gates of the inner court again described in the South and East and North? With the Lord breathing inspiration, great effort is needed to search out the depth of so great a mystery. For if by the name of gates we understand the holy preachers, we should know that the Church is one in the preachers of the Old and New Testament. The gates have seven or eight steps because they harmoniously preach the sevenfold grace of the Holy Spirit, and by the eighth step they announce the reward of eternal retribution. Whence it is written: "Give a portion to seven, and also to eight." What, therefore, can we say the outer gates were, except the ancient fathers, who through the precepts of the law knew how to guard the works of the people rather than their hearts? So that we ought to understand the inner gates as the preachers of holy Church, who by spiritual counsels guard the hearts of their disciples, lest they take delight even in thoughts in the evil things they do not do. For through those gates one is said to ascend by seven steps, but the ascent of these is declared to be of eight steps, because both in the veneration of the law the seventh day was kept, and in the New Testament the eighth day is held in sacrament, namely that which is called the Lord's Day, which is the third from the Passion but the eighth from creation, because it also follows the seventh.
