Those who are over others are to be warned that through prudence they should attain watchful eyes within and round about and strive to become living creatures of heaven. For the living creatures of heaven are described as full of eyes round about and within. So it is fitting that those who are over others should have eyes within and round about, so that in striving to please the inward judge and in serving outwardly as examples of life, they may detect the things that should be corrected in others. Subjects are to be warned not to judge rashly the lives of their superiors, if perchance they see them act blamably in anything; otherwise, when they rightly find fault with evil, they are plunged to lower depths by the impulse of elation. They are to be warned that, when they consider the faults of their superiors, they grow not too bold against them. On the contrary, even if any of their superiors’ deeds are exceedingly bad, the subjects’ private judgment, constrained by the fear of God, should still not lead them to refuse to bear the yoke of reverence under them.
