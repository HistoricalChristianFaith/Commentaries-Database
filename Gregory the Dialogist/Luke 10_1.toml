Our Lord and Savior, dearest brothers, sometimes admonishes us through words, and sometimes through deeds. For His very actions are commandments, because when He does something in silence, He makes known what we ought to do. For behold, He sends His disciples out to preach in pairs, because there are two commandments of charity, namely the love of God and of neighbor, and charity cannot exist between fewer than two persons. For no one is properly said to have charity toward himself, but love extends toward another so that it may be charity. The Lord sends His disciples to preach in pairs, so that by this He may silently indicate to us that whoever does not have charity toward another should by no means undertake the office of preaching.

It is well said that he sent them before his face into every city and place where he himself was about to come. For the Lord follows his preachers, because preaching comes first, and then the Lord comes to the dwelling place of our mind, when words of exhortation run ahead, and through these truth is received in the mind. For thus Isaiah says to these same preachers: Prepare the way of the Lord, make straight the paths of our God. Thus the Psalmist says to them: Make a way for him who ascends over the setting. For the Lord ascended over the setting because from that by which he fell in his passion, from that same thing he manifested his greater glory by rising again. He ascended over the setting, namely, because he trampled down by rising again the death which he had endured. Therefore we make a way for him who ascends over the setting when we preach his glory to your minds, so that he himself also, coming afterward, may illuminate them through the presence of his love.
