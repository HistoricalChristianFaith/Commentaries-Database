20.  God ‘numbers our steps,’ when He marks each one of our several deeds for the recompensing them.  For what is denoted by the steps, but each particular act of ours?  Thus Almighty God both ‘numbers our steps’ and ‘spares our sins,’ in that He at once surveys our actions with exactness, and yet remits them in mercy to those that repent, Who both sees obduracy in those that sin, and yet softens it into penitence by preventing grace.  Thus He ‘numbers sins,’ in that He turns us ourselves to bewail the several things which we have done.  And He remits them in mercy, in that whilst we our own selves punish them, He Himself never judges them in the last reckoning, as Paul testifies, who saith, For if we should judge ourselves, we should not be judged. [1 Cor. 11, 31]
