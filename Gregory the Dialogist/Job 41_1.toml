This the Lord openly indicates to blessed Job, saying: "Will you catch Leviathan with a hook?" By Leviathan, which means "their addition," that whale who devours the human race is designated. For while he promised to add divinity to man, he took away immortality. And the guilt of transgression, which he gave the first man to drink, he multiplies to those who follow him through the worst persuasion, heaping punishments upon them without end.

On a hook, however, the bait is shown while the barb is hidden. Therefore the almighty Father caught him with a hook, because he sent his incarnate only-begotten Son to that one's death, in whom both the passible flesh could be seen and the impassible divinity could not be seen. And when that serpent, through the hands of his persecutors, bit the bait of his body, the barb of divinity pierced him through. He had known him earlier as God through his miracles, but from his knowledge he fell into doubt when he saw him subject to suffering. The hook therefore held fast the jaws of the one swallowing, since in him the bait of flesh was visible, which the devourer might seize; and the divinity lay hidden during the time of the passion, which would slay him.

He was caught on the hook of his incarnation, because while he seized the bait of the body in him, he was pierced by the barb of divinity. For there was present the humanity which would draw the devourer to itself; there was the divinity which would pierce him through; there was the open weakness which would provoke him; there was the hidden power which would transfix the throat of the plunderer. He was caught, therefore, on the hook, because he perished from the very thing he bit. And he lost those mortals whom he rightfully held, because he presumed to attack with death the immortal one over whom he had no rightful claim.
