Indeed, before our Redeemer was born in the flesh, we were at discord with the angels, from whose brightness and purity we stood far distant through the guilt of the first sin and through our daily transgressions. For since by sinning we were estranged from God, the angels, citizens of God, regarded us as strangers from their fellowship. But because we have come to know our King, the angels have recognized us as their fellow citizens. For since the King of heaven assumed the earth of our flesh, that angelic majesty no longer despises our weakness. The angels return to peace with us, they set aside the intent of their former discord; and those whom they had previously despised as weak and cast off, they now honor as companions.
