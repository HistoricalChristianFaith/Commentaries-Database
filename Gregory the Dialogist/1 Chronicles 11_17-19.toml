I must tell you that I have been led to praise God the more for your work by what I have learned from the report of my most believed son Probinus the presbyter; namely that, your excellency, having issued a certain ordinance against the perfidy of the Jews, those to whom it related attempted to bend the rectitude of your mind by offering a sum of money, which your excellency scorned, and, seeking to satisfy the judgment of almighty God, preferred innocence to gold. With regard to this, what was done by King David recurs to my mind, who, when he longed for water from the cistern of Bethlehem, which was wedged in by the enemy, had been brought him by obedient soldiers, said, “God forbid that I should drink the blood of righteous men.” And, because he poured it out and would not drink it, it is written, “He offered it a libation to the Lord.” If, then, water was scorned by the armed king and turned into a sacrifice to God, we may estimate what manner of sacrifice to almighty God has been offered by the king who for his love has scorned to receive not water but gold.

David desired long afterwards to drink water from the cistern of Bethlehem, which, when his bravest soldiers had brought to him, he refused to drink and poured it out as a libation to the Lord. For it was lawful for him to drink it, had he been so minded; but, because he remembered having done what was unlawful, he laudably abstained even from what was lawful. And he, who to his guilt previously feared not that the blood of dying soldiers should be shed, afterwards considered that, were he to drink the water, he would have shed the blood of living soldiers, saying, “Shall I drink the blood of these men who have put their lives in jeopardy?”
