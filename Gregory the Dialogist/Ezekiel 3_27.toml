"But when I shall have spoken to you, I will open your mouth, and you shall say to them: Thus says the Lord God: He who hears, let him hear; and he who is silent, let him be silent, for it is a provoking house."

Then, as it were at the end, the mouth of the prophet is opened, when through the preaching of Enoch and Elijah, as the Jews return to the faith, the prophecy of sacred scripture is recognized to have been about Christ. But since we have spoken these things typologically, let us now discuss the same words to your charity in a moral sense.

Whence it is added here: But when I shall have spoken to you, you shall open your mouth, and you shall say to them: Thus says the Lord God.

Often some desire to hear the word of God, but when they observe others turning away their ear, they themselves also deviate from hearing salvation; and frequently many desire to rest and to be free from all the activities of this world, to succumb no longer to any earthly desires, but when they see others advancing by acting restlessly and being exalted in this world by riches and honors, because they are not yet firm in the way of righteousness, they slip into wicked works by the example of others. For hence it is that the Psalmist, speaking in the figure of the weak, said: "But my feet were almost moved, my steps were nearly poured out, because I was zealous concerning sinners, seeing the peace of sinners." Hence again he says: "While the impious man is proud, the poor man is set on fire." Hence to the prophet Jeremiah it is said by the Lord's voice concerning Judah and Israel: "Have you seen what the turning away Israel has done? She went off by herself upon every high mountain and under every leafy tree, and committed fornication there. And I said when she had done all these things: Return to me, and she did not return." Where it is immediately added how Judah, who seemed to stand, also fell through emulation of her. For he says: "And her treacherous sister Judah saw that because the turning away Israel had committed adultery, I had dismissed her and given her a bill of divorce; and her treacherous sister Judah did not fear, but went off and committed fornication herself also." Behold, the merciful God is despised and calls out, to those turning away from him he opens a sign of mercy, because he says to the one sinning: "Return to me," and yet she did not return. But because the Israelite people deserted the almighty God, not wishing to return, she received a bill of divorce. She deserted, that is, by sinning, but she received a bill of divorce by remaining in her iniquities without the scourge. For the soul that sins departs. But if prosperity follows her after sin, no discipline, no rebuke of severity recalls her to heart; in the division she made between herself and the Lord, she also received a bill of divorce, so that now, as if abandoned as a stranger, she may do the evil things she wishes, may not feel the scourges of God's zeal, in order that she may descend more deeply to eternal punishments. But her sister Judah, because she saw the Israelite people dismissed in their pleasures, herself also burned into the uncleanness of fornication. For because she observed the adulteress flourishing in her perversity, she herself also did not fear to sin more grievously and to withdraw from union with the Lord, as if from the bed of a lawful husband. Hence it is necessary that we consider all those sinning to be more wretched when we observe them abandoned in their fault without the scourge. For hence it is said through Solomon: "The turning away of the little ones will kill them, and the prosperity of fools will destroy them." For he who is turned away from God and prospers becomes so much nearer to perdition as he is found more estranged from the zeal of discipline. Let it therefore be said: "Let him who hears hear, and let him who rests rest, because it is a provoking house." As if it were openly said: You who have already begun both to hear the words of truth and to rest from wicked action, do not imitate those by whose conduct you see me provoked.

However, we can also understand this in another way. For some who hear the word do not truly hear, because they lend their ear to sacred speech but do not tear their heart away from worldly desires. And there are some who, while resting, do not rest at all, because though they are idle from wicked deeds in body, they turn over perverse works in their mind out of love for them. For this is why it is written concerning Judah coming into captivity: Her enemies saw her and mocked her Sabbaths. Indeed, enemies mock the Sabbaths when malign spirits cast wicked thoughts into an idle mind, so that even if it rests from work, it does not rest from delight in evil works. Rightly therefore it is now said: Let him who hears, hear—so that the word may sound in the ear of the body in such a way that it resounds in the ear of the heart. And let him who rests, rest—so that desires for wickedness may be driven from thought, since they are now seen to be driven from action. And lest we follow the examples of the wicked, as we have said, it is added: For it is a rebellious house. But though the wicked are tolerated for a long time, they suddenly fall, and the weak behold their punishments, lest they imitate those whose sins they think go unpunished. Hence here too the desolation of that same Judah is added, which is called a rebellious house, when the Lord immediately says to His prophet: And you, son of man, take a brick for yourself, and place it before you, and draw upon it the city of Jerusalem, and arrange a siege against it.
