The prophet learns of the calamities beforehand so that he is prepared for all of them. For evils have less power over a mind when they do not come unexpected, and yet when calamities are known beforehand how great the virtue of obedience shown in him who both realizes that he is to suffer adversity and yet is not disobedient to the voice of God.
