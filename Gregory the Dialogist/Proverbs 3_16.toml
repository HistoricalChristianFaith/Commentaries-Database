The church says by the voice of the elect, “His left hand is under my head, and his right hand shall embrace me.” The left hand of God—that is, prosperity in the present life—the church has put under her head, in that she presses it down in the intentness of her highest love. But the right hand of God embraces her, because in her entire devotion she is encompassed with his eternal happiness. Therefore, it is said again through Solomon, “Length of days is in her right hand, but in her left hand riches and glory.” In speaking, then, of riches and glory being placed in her left hand, he showed the manner in which they are to be esteemed. Thus the psalmist says, “Save me with your right hand.” He does not say, “with your hand,” but “with your right hand” to indicate that it was eternal salvation that he sought. Again it is written, “Your right hand, O Lord, has dashed in pieces the enemies.” For the enemies of God, though they prosper in his left hand, are dashed to pieces with his right; since for the most part the present life elevates the bad, but the coming of eternal bliss condemns them.
