The Church says by the voice of the elect, "His left hand is under my head, and his right hand shall embrace me." The left hand of God, to wit prosperity in the present life, she has put under her head, in that she presses it down in the intentness of her highest love. But the right hand of God embraces her, because in her entire devotion she is encompassed with His eternal blessedness. Hence again, it is said through Solomon, "Length of days is in her right hand, but in her left hand riches and glory." In speaking, then, of riches and glory being placed in her left hand, he shewed after what manner they are to be esteemed. Hence the Psalmist says, "Save me with thy right hand." For he says not, "with thy hand," but "with thy right hand;" in order, that is, to indicate, in saying "right hand," that it was eternal salvation that he sought. Hence again it is written, "Thy right hand, O Lord, hath dashed in pieces the enemies." For the enemies of God, though they prosper in His left hand, are dashed to pieces with His right; since for the most part the present life elevates the bad, but the coming of eternal blessedness condemns them.
