The church says by the voice of the elect, “His left hand is under my head, and his right hand shall embrace me.” She has put under her head, as it were, the left hand of God, that is, the prosperity of the present life, and presses it down in the rapture of supreme love; but the right hand of God embraces her, because in her complete devotion, she is enfolded with his eternal happiness. Wherefore, it is said again by Solomon, “Length of days is in her right hand, and in her left hand, riches and glory.” He showed, then, how riches and glory are to be regarded, inasmuch as he recorded them as placed in the left hand. Wherefore, the psalmist says, “Save me with your right hand.” He does not say, “with the hand” but “with the right hand,” to indicate by using the words “right hand,” he is seeking eternal salvation. For this reason it is written again, “Your right hand, O Lord, has destroyed the enemy.” For the enemies of God, though prosperous in his left hand, are destroyed by his right hand, because very often the present life raises up the wicked, but the coming of eternal bliss condemns them. .
