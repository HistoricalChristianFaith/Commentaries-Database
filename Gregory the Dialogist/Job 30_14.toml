53. What is in this place designated by the title of ‘a wall,’ but the Redeemer of the human race, concerning whom it is said by the Prophet for the edifying of Holy Church, There shall be set in her a wall and a bulwark? [Is. 26, 1] For that same Redeemer is ‘a wall’ to us, Who forbids the rushing of evil spirits to reach to our hearts. Who also set ‘a bulwark’ as well to our faith, because before that He showed Himself in flesh, He sent prophets as preachers of His mystery. Since they are rightly entitled by the name of ‘a bulwark,’ [‘antemurale’] because, whereas they preached the Lord coming after, they stood as it were ‘before the wall.’ But it is as if ‘the wall were broken,’ when by the promptings of the wicked, faith, which is in our Redeemer, is done away in the hearts of some. And when power is awarded to the perverse in this life, what else but ‘a door’ of error is opened? And so it is as if the wall being burst asunder and the door opened the wicked rush in upon the good, when power being received temporally, the corrupt set themselves to pull down the very defences of faith too in the hearts of some. Concerning whom it is fitly said; And were rolled down for my miseries; that is to say, because in the first instance to their own miseries. For except that by living corruptly they fell before to their own ‘miseries,’ they would never afterwards persuade others also to those miseries. But after their own the children of perdition are ‘rolled down to our miseries’ also, when to those evil things wherein they are themselves already involved, they draw persons as well who are linked to ourselves.
54. It is possible too that by the title of a wall may be understood the defence of discipline, as Solomon bears witness, who says, I went by the field of the slothful, and by the vineyard of the man void of understanding. And lo, it was all grown over with nettles, and thorns had covered the face thereof; and the stone wall thereof was broken down. [Prov. 24, 30. 31.] For to ‘pass by the field of the slothful, and by the vineyard of the man void of understanding,’ is to look into the life of any careless liver, and to take a view of his deeds. Which same ‘nettles or thorns fill up,’ because in the hearts of the careless, itching earthly desires and the prickles of bad habits sprout forth, since it is written, In desires is every one that is idle. ‘The stone wall was pulled down,’ i.e. the discipline of the Fathers was loosened from his heart. For because ‘the stone wall being pulled down’ he saw that discipline was loosened, he directly added in that place going on; Then I saw and laid it up in my heart; and by example I learned instruction. And therefore as it were the wall being burst the enemy enters in, when by the crafty persuading either of evil spirits, or of bad men, the defences of discipline in the heart are scattered away. But when the vigour of that same discipline is relaxed in the heart of the lost, in their eyes all the deeds of the good are had in contempt, and they account it nothing, whatever they see relating to virtues in the Elect.
