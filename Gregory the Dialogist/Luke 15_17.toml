Therefore God chose these whom the world despises, because very often that contempt itself calls a person back to himself. For he who left his father and squandered prodigally the portion of substance he had received, after he began to hunger, returned to himself and said: "How many hired servants in my father's house have bread in abundance?" Indeed he had departed far from himself when he was sinning. And if he had not hungered, he would never have returned to himself, because only after he lacked earthly things did he begin to consider what he had lost of spiritual things.
