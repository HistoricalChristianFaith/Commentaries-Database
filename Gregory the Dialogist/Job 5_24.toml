In holy Scripture complete peace is described in one way and initial peace in another. For “Truth” gave to his disciples peace from the beginning, when he said, “Peace I leave with you; my peace I give unto you.” And Simeon desired to have perfect peace. He sought it saying, “Now let your servant depart in peace, according to your word.” Our peace begins in longing for the Creator, but it is perfected by clarity of vision. Our peace will be perfect when our mind is neither blinded by ignorance nor moved by the assaults of the body. Forasmuch as we touch upon its first beginnings, when we either subject the soul to God or the flesh to the soul, the “tabernacle” of the righteous person is said to “have peace.” The body he inhabits through his mind is restrained from the evil motions of its desires under the controlling hand of righteousness. But what advantage is it to restrain the flesh by continence if the mind has not been taught to expand itself through compassion in the love of our neighbor? For the body’s chasteness is worth nothing if not recommended by sweetness of spirit. - "Morals on the Book of Job 6.53"

53.  In holy Scripture full peace is described in one way, and peace in its beginning in another.  For ‘Truth’ gave to His Disciples peace in its beginning, when He said, Peace I leave with you; My peace I give unto you. [John 14, 27]  And Simeon desired to have perfect peace, when he besought saying, Now lettest Thou Thy servant depart in peace, according to Thy word. [Luke 2, 29]  For our peace begins in longing for the Creator, but it is perfected by a clear vision.  For it will then be perfect, when our mind is neither blinded by ignorance, nor moved by the assaults of its fleshly part.  But forasmuch as we touch upon its first beginnings, when we either subject the soul to God or the flesh to the soul, the ‘tabernacle’ of the righteous man is said to ‘have peace,’ in that his body, which he inhabits by his mind, is held in from the froward motions of its desires under the controlling hand of righteousness.  But what advantage is it to restrain the flesh by continence, if the mind is uninstructed to expand itself by compassion in the love of our neighbour?  For that chasteness of the flesh is as nothing, which is not recommended by sweetness of spirit.  Whence after the ‘peace of the tabernacle’ it is fitly subjoined,
And thou shalt visit thy likeness, and shalt not sin.
54.  For the likeness of man is another man.  For a fellow-creature is rightly called our ‘likeness,’ in that in him we discern what we ourselves are.  Now in the visiting of the body we go to our neighbour by the accession of steps, but in the spiritual visiting, we are led not by the footstep but by affection.  He then ‘visits his likeness,’ whoever direct his way to one, whom he sees to be like to himself in nature, by the footsteps of love, so that by seeing his own case in another, he may collect from himself how to condescend to another's weakness.  He ‘visits his likeness,’ who, that he may remodel another in himself, takes account of himself in another.  For hence ‘Truth,’ in telling by the mouth of Moses what had been done, denoted what was to be done, saying, And the earth brought forth grass and herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, each one bearing seed after his kind. [gen. 1, 12]  For ‘the tree produces seed after its kind’ when our mind gathers from itself thought for another, and produces the fructification of well doing.  Hence the wise man saith, Do not that to any, which thou wouldest not have done to thyself. [Tob. 4, 15]  Hence the Lord saith in the Gospel, Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even to them. [Matt. 7, 12]  As if He said in plain words, ‘Visit your likeness in another man, and from your own selves learn what conduct it behoves you to exhibit to others.’  Hence Paul says, And unto the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain the Jews; to them that are under the law, as under the law, that I might gain them that are under the law; to them that are without law, as without law, (being not without law to God, but under the law to Christ.) [1 Cor. 9, 20. 21.]  And soon after, I am made all things to all men, that I might save all. [ib. 22]  Not indeed that the great Preacher, to become like a Jew, broke away into faithlessness; nor, that he might become ‘as one under the law,’ did he turn back to the fleshly sacrifice; nor, that he might become ‘all things to all men,’ did he change his singleness of mind into variety of deceit; but by lowering himself, not by falling, he drew near to the unbelievers, to this end, that by taking each one into himself and transforming himself into each one, by sympathizing with them, he might gather what it was, that, if he himself were like them, he would justly have desired should be bestowed upon him by others; and might go along with every erring person so much the more to the purpose, in proportion as he had learnt the method of his salvation by the consideration of his own case.  Well then is it said, And thou shalt visit thy likeness, and shalt not sin.  For sin is then perfectly conquered, when everyone sees from the likeness of himself, how to expand in the love of his neighbour.  But when the flesh is kept in check from evil practices, when the mind is exercised in virtuous habits, it remains that every one should by word of mouth reach the life, which in his own ways he observes.  For he gathers abundant fruits of his preaching, who sows before the seeds of welldoing.  Whence after the ‘peace of the tabernacle’ and the ‘visiting of our likeness,’
