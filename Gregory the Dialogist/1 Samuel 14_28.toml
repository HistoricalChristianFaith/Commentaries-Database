But often a lesser one, kindled with the zeal of charity, endeavors to bring back great men who are transgressing to the remembrance of the Scriptures. Whence it also follows: (Verse 28) And one of the people answered and said: "Your father bound the people with an oath, saying: Cursed is the man who eats bread today."

For he reported that the father had adjured the people and pronounced a curse, because when a lesser person wishes to correct an erring superior, he ought not to rebuke harshly, but sweetly and humbly bring him back to remembering the ordinances of his elders. Whence he says: 'Your father bound the people with an oath.' For in order to gently admonish the one who bound the people with an oath, he declared him to be his father. As if he were saying in other words: You ought to preserve the ordinances of your elders with all the more devotion, the more highly you see yourself holding their place through the dignity of succession. The people are also declared to have been bound by the oath of the father, so that attention may be given not to the lowliness of the person speaking, but to the authority of the one pointed out: so that if the rank of the one making the suggestion is despised, the loftiness of the one who is indicated may be feared. Yet he declares him a father, so that the precepts of elders ought to inspire both fear and love. Let him therefore say: 'Your father bound the people with an oath, saying: Cursed is he who eats bread today.' Which is as if he were saying: I want you to be mindful of those things which are yours, not mine, because while you hold the high position of your elders, you ought to keep their laws as if by hereditary right. Now by the name of bread, the favor of flatterers is rightly expressed, because it both satisfies and strengthens a mind intent on vanity, while it renders it more vigorous for doing things that ought to be praised. This indeed is seen to apply greatly to the arrogant, who are encouraged to speak by praises offered to them. And because the arrogant preacher has subjects like himself who are desirous of praise, there follows: (Verse 28) 'Now the people had fainted.'

What is it literally to fail, except to grow weary? For those who seek passing praises from the preaching of the word fail when they are praised, because they bring forth with no vigor the words which they see are not praised. For as though growing weary, they fail when, being despised, they fall silent. But also when they do not eat, they seem to fail, because if they had the lawful food of favor, as though refreshed and strong, they would attack vices through the preaching of the word.
