65. Every one who forsakes the way of life, and casts himself down into the darkness of sins, plunges himself, as it were, into a well or pitfall. But if, through long commission he is also so weighed down by a habit of sin, as to be unable to rise upward, he is pent in, as it were, in the narrow opening of a well. Whence David the Prophet entreats in the person of sinners, saying, Let not the tempest of water drown me, neither let the deep swallow me up, and let not the well press its mouth upon me. [Ps. 69, 15] For a tempest of water has, as it were, hurried away him, whom the iniquity of evil doing has moved from stability in goodness. But if it has not yet prevailed by long custom, it has not overwhelmed. He has already fallen into a well, who has done that, which the law of God forbids. But if long custom does not yet weigh him down, the well has not contracted its mouth. He escapes therefore with greater ease, the less closely he is pent in by habit. Whence the prophet Jeremiah, when beholding that Judaea had been overwhelmed, through long habit, by iniquities, bewails himself in his lamentations, under her person, and says, My life is fallen into a well, and they have placed a stone over me. [Lam. 3, 53] For one’s life falls into a pit, when it is denied with the pollution of iniquity. But a stone is placed over, when the mind is also consumed by sin, through long habit, so that, though willing to rise, it is quite unable to do so, because the weight of evil habit presses on it from above. But because it submits to the power of God, and is brought back to the large room of good deeds, after the confinement of evil habit, it is said, He will bring thee safely from a narrow opening into a broad place. For he is safely brought from a narrow opening into a broad place, who, after having borne the yoke of iniquity, is brought back by penitence to the liberty of good works.
66. For it is, as it were, the narrowness of a confined opening, to wish, and yet to be unable to rise from an overpowering evil habit; to tend, in desire, to things above, but yet still to remain in deed in things below, to advance in heart, but not to follow in act, and to endure one’s self as a kind of self-contradiction within one’s self. But when a soul, proceeding thus, is assisted by the hand of grace to raise it up, it arrives from a narrow opening to a broad place: because, having overcome its difficulties, it performs the good works which it desires. The prophet David had beheld the enclosure of a narrow opening, when he said, Thou hast delivered my soul from necessities, and hast not shut me up into the hands of the enemy. [Ps. 3l, 7. 8.] But he found that he had been brought safely into a broad place, when he added, Thou hast set my feet in a large room. [ibid.] For our feet are firmly placed in a large room, when we journey to those good things which are fitted for us, and are not impeded by any difficulty. For we are proceeding, as it were, through a wide place whither we please, because we are not hard pressed by any difficulties placed in our way.
67. But Eliu would say this rightly, if his opinion were but suitable to blessed Job. For he believed, that he had been scourged for his faults, and therefore decided that he had fallen into a narrow opening. For with the heavier blows he beheld him afflicted, with the more abominable iniquities he believed him to be weighed down; being surely ignorant that his scourges were an increase of his merits, not a punishment for his sin. But when he declares that he had fallen into a narrow opening, he proceeds, as it were, to speak more fully of the profound depth in which Job is plunged: and says,
And which hath no foundation beneath it.
68. Every sin has no foundation; because it has no subsistence in its own proper nature. For evil has no substance. But that which any how exists, unites with the nature of good. The narrow opening is said, then, to have no foundation beneath it, because the pollution of sin has no power of subsisting by itself. But since foundation is derived from fundum, (bottom,) we may without impropriety understand that ‘foundation’ is put for bottom, as hearing is derived from ear, and yet the ear itself is frequently designated by the word hearing. When speaking then of a narrow opening, he added, as wishing fully to describe the profound abyss, And which hath no foundation (or bottom) beneath it. For the infernal pit swallows up him, whom iniquity hurries away. But the infernal pit is rightly believed not to have a bottom; because every one who is swept away by it, is devoured by the boundless profound. For the Prophet, wishing to describe fully its boundless immensity, says, The infernal pit hath enlarged its soul, and hath opened its mouth without measure. [Is. 5, 14] As therefore that is said to be enlarged without measure which attracts very many to itself, so it is not improperly believed to be deep, and without a bottom, because it absorbs, as it were, into the boundless abyss of its immensity those, whom it receives into itself. And therefore when saying, He will bring thee safely from a narrow opening into a broad place, he fitly subjoined, And which hath no foundation beneath it. As if he were saying, He will bring thee safely from a narrow opening, which has no bottom under it. For since it is through sin that we tend to the pit, He brings safely from a narrow opening him whom He delivers from sin. But him whom He rescues from the narrow opening, He withdraws from the depths of hell.
69. Though it can also be understood in another sense. For as he who is plunged into a well, is confined in the bottom of it; so would the mind fall in, and remain, as it were, at the bottom, if, after having once fallen, it were to confine itself within any measure of sin. But when it cannot be contented with the sin into which it has fallen, while it is daily plunging into worse offences, it finds, as it were, no bottom to the well into which it has fallen, on which to rest. For there would be a bottom to the well, if there were any bounds to his sin. Whence it is well said in another place, When a sinner hath come into the lowest depth of sins, he contemneth. [Prov. 18, 3] For he puts by returning, because he has no hope that he can be forgiven. But when he sins still more through despair, he withdraws, as it were, the bottom from the well, so as to find therein no resting place. It follows,
But the rest of thy table shall be full of fatness.
70. The rest of the table, is the refreshment of inward satiety: which is said to be full of fatness, because it is set forth with the delight of eternal pleasure. The Prophet was hungering after the feasts of this table, when saying, I shall be satisfied, when Thy glory shall be manifested. [Ps. 17, 15] He was thirsting for the cups of this table, when saying, My soul thirsted for the living God; when shall I come and appear before the face of God? [Ps. 42, 2] Eliu, therefore, wishing to console the temporal sufferings of blessed Job, by an eternal compensation, promises him, as if freely, from himself, that which was justly due to him as his desert, saying, But the rest of thy table shall be full of fatness.
