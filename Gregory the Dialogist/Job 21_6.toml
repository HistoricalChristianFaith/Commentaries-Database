44.  That blessed Job was not forgetful of his deeds, the last utterance of his lips proves.  Wherefore this which he now says to his friends, Even when I remember I am afraid, and trembling taketh hold of my flesh, must clearly be said in mockery.  As if it were in plain words; ‘If I remember that I have had any thing of the hypocrite in me, directly I tremble in tears of penitence.’  And ‘if he remembered, his flesh was shaken with trembling’ he declares, i.e. that the weakness of practice was disheartened by the dread of vengeance.  But as Zophar said many things about the sudden condemnation of the wicked man, whereby he snapped at the powerful estate of blessed Job, the holy man subjoins in answer to his words.
