The servant who returned with two talents was praised by his master. He was led to his eternal reward when his master said to him, “Well done, good and faithful servant. Because you have been faithful about a few things, I shall put you in charge of many.”

All the good deeds of our present life, however many they may appear to be, are few in comparison with our eternal recompense. The faithful servant is put in charge of many things after overcoming all the troubles brought him by perishable things. He glories in the eternal joys of his heavenly dwelling. He is brought completely into the joy of his master when he is taken into his eternal home and joined to the company of angels. His inner joy at his gift is such that there is no longer any external perishable thing that can cause him sorrow.
