“Who will uncover the face of its garment?” This Leviathan tempts in one way the minds of people who are religious, and in another those who are devoted to this world. It presents openly to the wicked the evil things they desire, but it secretly lays snares for the good and deceives them under a show of sanctity. It presents itself to the one as more manifestly wicked, as though they were its friends, but to the others it covers itself, as it were, with a cloak of comeliness, as if they were strangers, in order to introduce secretly, concealed beneath the cover of a good action, the evil that it cannot actually accomplish. Hence its members, when they are unable to injure by open wickedness, often assume the guise of a good action and display themselves to be wicked in conduct, but yet they deceive by their appearance of sanctity. For if the wicked were openly evil, they would not be received at all by the good. But they assume something of the look of good, in order that while good people receive in them the appearance that they love, they may also take the poison blended with it that they avoid.…
“And who will enter into the midst of its mouth?” You only listen to me, who, by the discreet minds of the elect, examine the words of its suggestions and prove that they are not such as they sound. For they seem to promise what is good, but they lead to a fatal end. To enter, therefore, into the middle of his mouth is so to penetrate its words of cunning, as to consider not their sound but their meaning. - "Morals on the Book of Job 33.44–45"

44. This Leviathan tempts in one way the minds of men which are religious, and in another those which are devoted to this world. For he presents openly to the wicked the evil things they desire; but he secretly lays snares for the good, and deceives them under a show of sanctity: he presents himself to the one more manifestly as wicked, as though they were his friends, but to the others he covers himself, as it were, with a cloke of comeliness, as if they were strangers, in order to introduce secretly, concealed beneath the cover of a good action, the evils which he cannot publicly effect. Whence also his members, when they are unable to injure by open wickedness, often assume the guise of a good action, and display themselves to be wicked in conduct, but yet deceive by their appearance of sanctity. For if the wicked were openly evil, they would not be received at all by the good. But they assume something of the look of the good, in order that while good men receive in them the appearance which they love, they may take also the poison, which they avoid, blended with it. Whence the Apostle Paul, on beholding some men under the cloke of preaching devoting themselves to the service of the belly, says, For Satan himself transforms himself into an angel of light. What wonder then if his ministers are transformed as the ministers of righteousness? [2 Cor. 11, 14] Joshua feared this transformation when, on seeing an Angel, he asked him on which side he was, saying, Art thou ours, or our adversaries? [Josh. 5, 13] in order, namely, that if he were of the adverse force [‘virtutis’], he might, from knowing that he was suspected, shrink from practising deception. Because therefore this Leviathan, in attempting a work of iniquity, frequently clothes himself with a semblance of sanctity, and because the garb of his simulation cannot be detected except by Divine grace, it is well said, Who will uncover the face of his garment? Thou understandest, except Myself, Who inspire into the minds of My servants the grace of most subtle discernment, in order that, on the unveiling of his malice, they may see his face exposed, which he conceals closely covered under the garb of sanctity. And because he endeavours to corrupt the minds of the faithful sometimes by openly shewing himself, sometimes by suggestion, (for he acts at one time by deed, at another by persuasion,) it is rightly subjoined;
And who will enter into the midst of his mouth?
45. Thou understandest, But I, Who by the discreet minds of the Elect examine the words of his suggestions, and prove that they are not such as they sounded. For they seem to promise what is good, but they lead to a fatal end. To enter, therefore, into the middle of his mouth is so to penetrate his words of cunning, as to make, not their sound, but their meaning, to be considered. Adam would not enter into the middle of his mouth, when he neglected to consider carefully the purpose of his persuasion. For he believed in truth that he was receiving Divinity through him, and he lost his immortality. From incautiously remaining then external to the meaning of his words, he utterly exposed himself to be devoured by his mouth.
