Concerning “the exhortation of the captains and the howling of the army,” the tempting vices that fight against us in invisible contest in behalf of the pride that reigns over them, some of them go first, like captains, others follow, after the manner of an army. For all faults do not occupy the heart with equal access. But while the greater and the few surprise a neglected mind, the smaller and the numberless pour themselves upon it in a whole body. For when pride, the queen of sins, has fully possessed a conquered heart, she surrenders it immediately to the seven principal sins, as if to some of her generals, to lay it waste. And an army in truth follows these generals, because doubtless there spring up from them importunate hosts of sins.
