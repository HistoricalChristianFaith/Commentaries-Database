"And at midnight a cry was made: Behold, the bridegroom comes, go out to meet him." The cry concerning the arrival of the bridegroom happens at midnight, because the day of judgment creeps up in such a way that it cannot be foreseen when it comes. Hence it is written: "The day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night."
