To whom it is answered that in this life he received his good things, because he considered all his joy to be transitory happiness. For the just can have good things here, and yet not receive them as recompense, because while they seek better things, that is eternal things, whatever good things may have been present, in their judgment, when they burn with holy desires, they seem hardly good at all. Hence the prophet David, who was supported by the riches of his kingdom and many attendants, although he perceived that these things were good for necessity, nevertheless panted with longing for one singular good alone, saying: "But for me, to cling to God is good."

Among these things it should be noted what is said to him: "Remember, son." For behold, Abraham calls him son, whom nevertheless he does not free from torment, because the faithful forefathers of this unfaithful people, since they see that many have strayed from their faith, do not rescue from torments by any compassion those whom nevertheless they recognize as sons according to the flesh.

But this which is said to him through Abraham's response must be considered with very great fear: "Son, remember that you received good things in your life, and Lazarus likewise evil things. But now he is comforted here, and you are tormented." This sentence, my brothers, needs fear rather than exposition. For if any of you have received something of external good in this world, you ought to fear that very external gift, so to speak, lest it be given to you as recompense for certain of your deeds, lest the Judge who here restored external goods reject you from the retribution of inward good, lest honor here or riches be not an aid to virtue but a reward for labor.

For behold, when it is said, "You received good things in your life," it is indicated that this rich man also had something of good, from which he might receive good things in this life. And again, when it is said of Lazarus that he received evil things, it is clearly shown that Lazarus also had some evil that needed to be purged. But the fire of poverty purged the evils of Lazarus, and the happiness of passing life rewarded the goods of the rich man. Poverty afflicted and cleansed the one; abundance rewarded and repelled the other.

Therefore whoever among you have good things in this world, when you recall that you have done good deeds, greatly fear concerning them, lest the prosperity granted to you be the reward of those same goods. And when you see any poor people committing some blameworthy acts, do not despise them, do not despair of them, because perhaps the furnace of poverty purges what the excess of very slight depravity stains. Fear greatly concerning yourselves, because a prosperous life has even followed some evil deeds. But consider carefully concerning them, because the teacher poverty also torments their life until it leads them to righteousness.
