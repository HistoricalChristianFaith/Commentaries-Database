"And its palm trees on the front, and there were eight steps by which one ascended to it." This step, as Truth teaches, was shown to a certain man, who when the precepts of the law were spoken to him, responded: All these things have I kept from my youth. For he was standing as it were already on seven steps, when he said he had kept all things from his youth. But immediately it is said to him: Yet one thing is lacking to you: If you wish to be perfect, go, sell all that you have, and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven, and come follow me. In these words he indeed saw the eighth step, but he refused to ascend, because he went away sad. Therefore whoever, having despised temporal things, is nourished by the contemplation of eternity, searches out the joys of the heavenly kingdom, after the seven steps which he held by fearing and working and growing in the understanding of wisdom, has entered by the eighth step the entrance of the interior gate.

Through the number eight both the day of eternal judgment and the resurrection of the flesh are signified. Hence also the Psalm which is written "for the eighth" begins with fear of judgment, when it says: "Lord, rebuke me not in your anger, nor chasten me in your fury." For now is the time of mercy, but in that judgment is the day of wrath. On which day, indeed, all this time which revolves through seven days comes to an end. Because it follows after seven days, it is rightly called the eighth. On which day our flesh also will rise from the dust, so that it may receive from the Truth whether good or evil it has done. Hence also by the law circumcision is commanded to be performed on the eighth day. For through the member that is circumcised mortal propagation is generated, and the number of those dying and succeeding is increased. But because in the resurrection of the dead neither is propagation of the flesh any longer performed, and there will be no passing away and succession, because as it is written: "They will neither marry nor be given in marriage, but will be like angels in heaven," on the eighth day the foreskin is commanded to be cut off. For there the propagation of the flesh no longer has a place, where the rising flesh has the permanence of eternity. Through this member descended the virgin mother, who conceived God in her womb without union with a man, who first showed us the glory of the eternal homeland in his resurrection. Who rising from the dead, dies no more, and death will no longer have dominion over him. And he gave us an example, so that we may believe those things will happen on the last day concerning our flesh which we have recognized happened concerning his flesh on the day of resurrection.
