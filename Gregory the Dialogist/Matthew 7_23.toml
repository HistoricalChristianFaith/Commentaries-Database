Mor., xx, 7: By this sentence it is given to us to learn, that among men charity and humility, and not mighty works, are to be esteemed. Whence also now the Holy Church, if there be any miracles of heretics, despises them, because she knows that they have not the mark of holiness. And the proof of holiness isnot to work miracles, but to love our neighbour as ourselves, to think truly of God, and of our neighbour better than of ourselves.
