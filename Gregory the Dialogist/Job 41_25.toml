12. Holy Scripture often so mixes up past and future times, as sometimes to use the future for the past, sometimes the past for the future. For it uses the future for the past, when there is pointed out to John a woman, who is about to bring forth a male child, to rule the Gentiles with a rod of iron. [Rev. 12, 5] For since this had already taken place by the coming of the Lord in the flesh, an event which had occurred was being announced. Again, it was the past for the future, as the Lord speaks by the Psalmist, saying; They have dug My hands, and My feet, they have numbered all My bones. [Ps. 22, 16. 17.] For by these words in truth, the nature of the Lord’s Passion is described as already past, but yet it is announced as still far future. In this place then in which it is said; When he shall he taken away, the angels shall fear, nothing prevents its being understood, that past events are described under the form of the future tense. Nor do we give up the sense of its true meaning, if we believe that when this Leviathan was falling from the height of blessedness, the Elect Angels also were greatly terrified at his fall, in order that, as the fall of pride was casting him out from their number, their very fear might give them strength to stand more firmly. Whence it also follows;
And being affrighted shall be purified.
13. But they are purified; doubtless because, when he went forth with his reprobate hosts, they alone, who were to live in happiness for ever, remained in the abodes of heaven. His fall then alarmed and purified them; it alarmed them, in order that they might not proudly despise their Creator. But it purified them, because it was so ordered, that when the reprobate went forth, the Elect alone remained. And because God, the Maker of all things, knows how to apply even the evil doings of the reprobate to the protection of the good, He converted the lapse of those who fell to the benefit of those who remain; and the fault of the proud is punished, by the same means by which the increased merits of the humble Angels were discovered and confirmed. For on the fall of these, it was granted as a special gift to those that they should never in any wise fall. For while the holy Angels behold in them the ruin of their own nature, they stand with greater caution and firmness in their own persons. Hence it is ordered, by the Lord the Maker of all, marvellously arranging all things, that even the losses of its ruin are of service to that abode of Elect spirits, when it is more firmly built up, in consequence of its having been partially destroyed.
14. But because Holy Scripture is frequently accustomed to designate the preachers of the Church, by the name of ‘Angels,’ because they announce the glory of the heavenly country, we can in this place understand ‘Angels’ to mean holy preachers. For this cause it is that John, in the Apocalypse, writing to the seven Churches, speaks to the Angels of the Churches, that is, to the preachers of the peoples. [Rev. 2, and 3] Hence the Prophet says; And the angels of peace shall weep bitterly. [Is. 33, 7] Hence again the Prophet Malachi says; The priest’s lips keep knowledge, and they seek the law at his mouth, for he is the angel of the Lord of hosts. [Mal. 2, 7] Hence Paul says; Great is the mystery of godliness, which was manifested in the flesh, was justified in the spirit, appeared unto angels, hath been preached unto the Gentiles, is believed on in this world, is received up into glory. [1 Tim. 3, 16] He therefore, who, after he had said that the mystery of the dispensation appeared to Angels, added also that it had been preached unto the Gentiles, certainly by the name ‘Angels’ designated holy preachers, that is, the messengers of truth.
15. If therefore the expression, When he shall be taken away, the angels shall fear, and being affrighted shall be purified, is referred to future time, there is here pointed out the last damnation of this Leviathan, in this world, on the coming of the strict Judge. Because he, who is now tolerated by the wonderful longsuffering of gentleness, is taken out of this world by the wrath of judgment. But he is cast out from thence with so great a weight of terror, that even the strength of holy preachers is disturbed; For when he shall he taken away, the angels shall fear. Because when he is swept away with the whirlwind of judgment, even those messengers of the heavenly country, who shall be found in their bodies, are staggered with unbounded fear, and tremble. For though they now are strong and perfect, yet, as still living in the flesh, they cannot fail of being agitated with fear, at the whirlwind of such great terror. But when this Leviathan is swept away, and when all the elements are shaken at his destruction, the hope of the approach of the kingdom fills those holy preachers with joy, whom, as I have said, that time of judgment shall find still in their bodies, and the infirmity of their flesh alarms them at the display of wrath. There will therefore be in them, in a certain way, a joyful trembling, and a fearless fear; because they are sure of being rewarded in the heavenly kingdom, and through fear of so great a whirlwind they tremble from the infirmity of the flesh.
16. Let us consider therefore how greatly the conscience of the wicked is then agitated, when the life even of the just is disturbed. What will they do, who hate the coming of the Judge, if even they who love tremble at the terror of so great a judgment? And because, whatever rust of slight sins could possibly exist in holy preachers, is burnt out by this dread, after He had said, When he shall be taken away, the angels shall fear, He fitly subjoined immediately; And being affrighted shall be purified. But because we have learnt these things concerning the end of this Leviathan, let us hear what he does meanwhile, before he perishes.
