17.  For Holy Church being borne down with sorrows is to say many like things.  For it shall be for her to be besieged with such great tribulations, as with great sighing to long for these times, which we undergo with great sorrow.  So then let her say, let her say in the voice of blessed Job, Who would give me that I might be as in the months past?  For because an appointed number of days has the name of ‘months,’ what else does he signify by the title of months, but the gatherings of souls?  For days, while they are gathered in months, are removed away, because in this time as well Holy Church, while she gathers in souls shining bright with the light of truth, hides them in the interior depths.  Sometimes also a month is put for perfection, as when the Prophet says, It shall be a month from a month; [Is. 66, 23] i.e. perfection in rest to those, to whom there may now be perfection in practice.  So let her remember her perfection of old, let her bring back to mind with what preaching of hers, by souls gathered in, she carried off her gains, and being straitened by tribulations, let her say, Who would give me that might be as in the months of old?  In which same months, who and what he was, he subjoins in telling over.
