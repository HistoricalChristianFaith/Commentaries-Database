9.  What is a potsherd made from, excepting mud?  and what is the humour of the body, but mud?  Accordingly he is said ‘to scrape the humour with a potsherd,’ as if it were plainly said, ‘he wiped away mud with mud.’  For the holy man reflected, whence that which he carried about him had been taken, and with the broken piece of a vessel of clay he scraped his broken vessel of clay.  By which act we have it openly shown us, in what manner he subdued under him that body of his when sound, which even when stricken he tended with such slight regard; how softly he dealt with his flesh in its sound state, who applied neither clothing, nor fingers, but only a potsherd to its very wounds.  And thus he scraped the humour with a potsherd, that seeing himself in the very broken piece, he might even by the cleansing of the wound be taking a remedy for his soul.
10.  But because it often happens that the mind is swelled by the circumstances that surround the body, and by the way men behave toward us the frailty of the body is removed from before the eyes of the mind, (as there are some of those that are of the world, who while they are buoyed up with temporal honours, whilst they rule in elevated stations, whilst they see the obedience of multitudes yielded to them at will, neglect to consider their own frailty, and altogether forget, nor ever take heed, how speedily that vessel of clay which they bear, is liable to be shattered,) so blessed Job, that he might take thought of his own frailty from the things about him, and increase the intensity of his self-contempt in his own eyes, is described to have seated himself not any where on the earth, which at most in every place is found clean, but upon a dunghill.  He set his body on a dunghill, that the mind might to its great profit consider thoroughly what was that substance of the flesh, which was taken from the ground. [Gen. 3, 23]  He set his body on a dunghill, that even from the stench of the place he might apprehend how rapidly the body returneth to stench.
11.  But see, while blessed Job is undergoing such losses in his substance, and grieving over the death of so many children whereby he is smitten, while he is suffering such numberless wounds, while he scrapes the running humour with a potsherd, whilst, running down in a state of corruption, he sat himself upon a dunghill, it is good to consider how it is that Almighty God, as though in unconcern, afflicts so grievously those, whom He looks upon as so dear to Him for all eternity.  But, now, while I view the wounds and the torments of blessed Job, I suddenly call back my mind's eye to John, and I reflect not without the greatest astonishment, that he, being filled with the Spirit of prophecy within his mother's womb, and who, if I may say so, before his birth, was born again, he that was the friend of the Bridegroom, [John 3, 29] he than whom none hath arisen greater among those born of women, [Matt. 11, 11] he that was so great a Prophet, that he was even more than a Prophet, he is cast into prison by wicked men, and beheaded, for the dancing of a damsel, and a man of such severe virtue dies for the merriment of the vile!  Do we imagine there was aught in his life which that most contemptible death was to wipe off?  When, then, did he sin even in meat, whose food was but locusts and wild honey?  How did he offend even by the quality of his clothing, the covering of whose body was of camel's hair?  How could he transgress in his behaviour, who never went out from the desert?  How did the guilt of a talkative tongue defile him, who was parted far from mankind?  When did even a fault of silence attach to him, who so vehemently charged those that came to him?  O generation, of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come? [Matt. 3, 7]  How is it then, that Job is distinguished above other men by the testimony of God, and yet by his plagues is brought down even to a dunghill?  How is it that John is commended by the voice of God, and yet for the words of a drunkard suffers death as the prize of dancing?  How is it, that Almighty God so utterly disregards in this present state of being those whom He chose so exaltedly before the worlds, saving this, which is plain to the religious sense of the faithful, that it is for this reason He thus presses them below, because He sees how to recompense them on high?  And He casts them down without to the level of things contemptible, because He leads them on within to the height of things incomprehensible.  From hence then let everyone collect what those will have to suffer There, that are condemned by Him, if here He thus torments those whom He loves, or how they shall be smitten, who are destined to be convicted at the Judgment, if their life is sunk so low, who are commended by witness of the Judge Himself.

58.  For what do we understand by the ‘potsherd,’ saving forcibleness of severity, and what by the ‘humour,’ save laxity of unlawful imaginations?  And thus we are smitten, and ‘scrape off the humour with a potsherd,’ when after the defilements of unlawful thoughts, we cleanse ourselves by a sharp judgment.  By the potsherd too we may understand the frailness of mortality.  And then to ‘scrape the humour with a potsherd,’ is to ponder on the course and frailty of our mortal state, and to wipe off the rottenness of a wretched self-gratification.  For when a man bethinks himself how soon the flesh returns to dust, he readily gets the better of that which originating in the flesh foully assails him in the interior.  So, when bad thoughts arising from temptation flow into the mind, it is as if humour kept running from a wound.  But the humour is soon cleansed away, if the frailty of our nature be taken up in the thought, like a potsherd in the hand.
59.  For neither are these suggestions to be lightly esteemed, which though they may not draw us on so far as to the act, yet work in the mind in an unlawful way.  It is hence that our Redeemer was come, as it were, ‘to scrape the humour from our wounds,’ when He said, Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not commit adultery.  But I say unto you, that whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her, hath committed adultery with her already in his heart. [Matt. 5, 27. 28.]  ‘The humour,’ therefore, ‘is wiped off,’ when sin is not only severed from the deed, but also from the thought.  It is hence that Jerubbaal saw the Angel when he was winnowing corn from the chaff, at whose bidding he forthwith dressed a kid and set it upon a rock, and poured over it the broth of the flesh, which the Angel touched with a rod, and thereupon fire coming out of the rock consumed it. [Judg. 6, 11. &c.]  For what else is it to beat corn with a rod, but to separate the grains of virtues from the chaff of vices, with an upright judgment?  But to those that are thus employed the Angel presents himself, in that the Lord is more ready to communicate interior truths in proportion as men are more earnest in ridding themselves of external things.  And he orders a kid to be killed, i.e.  every appetite of the flesh to be sacrificed, and the flesh to be set upon a rock, and the broth thereof to be poured upon it.  Whom else does the ‘rock’ represent, saving Him, of Whom it is said by Paul, And that rock was Christ? [1 Cor. 10, 4] We ‘set flesh then upon the rock,’ when in imitation of Christ we crucify our body.  He too pours the juice of the flesh over it, who, in following the conversation of Christ, empties himself even of the mere thoughts of the flesh themselves.  For ‘the broth’ of the dissolved flesh is in a manner ‘poured upon the rock,’ when the mind is emptied of the flow of carnal thoughts too.  Yet the Angel directly touches it with a rod, in that the might of God's succour never leaves our striving forsaken.  And fire issues from the rock, and consumes the broth and the flesh, in that the Spirit, breathed upon us by the Redeemer, lights up the heart with so fierce a flame of compunction, that it consumes every thing in it that is unlawful either in deed or in thought.  And therefore it is the same thing here ‘to scrape the humour with a potsherd,’ that it is there to ‘pour the broth upon the rock.’  For the perfect mind is ever eagerly on the watch, not only that it may refuse to do bad acts, but that it may even wipe off all that is become foul and soft in it, in the workings of imagination.  But it often happens that war springs up from the very victory, so that when the impure thought is vanquished, the mind of the victor is struck by self-elation.  Therefore it follows that the mind must be no otherwise elevated in purity, than that it should be heedfully brought under in humility.  And hence, whereas it was said of the holy man, And he took a potsherd, and scraped the humour withal, it is forthwith fitly added,
And he sat down upon a dunghill.
60.  For ‘to sit down upon a dunghill’ is for a man to entertain mean and abject notions of himself.  For us to ‘sit upon a dunghill,’ is to carry back the eye of the mind, in a spirit of repentance, to those things which we have unlawfully committed, that when we see the dung of our sins before our eyes, we may bend low all that rises up in the mind of pride.  He sits upon a dunghill, who regards his own weakness with earnest attention, and never lifts himself up for those good qualities, which he has received through grace.  Did not Abraham sit by himself upon a dunghill, when he said, Behold, now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord, which am but dust and ashes? [Gen. 18, 27]  For it is plain to see in what place he had set himself, who, at the very moment that he was speaking with God, reckoned himself to be ‘dust and ashes.’  If he then thus despises himself who is raised to the honour of converse with the Deity even, we should consider with earnest thoughts of heart with what woes they are destined to be stricken, who, while they never advance a step towards the highest things, are yet lifted up on the score of the least and lowest attainments.  For there are some, who, when they do but little things, think great things of themselves.  They lift their minds on high, and account themselves to excel other men in the deserts of virtue.  For surely, these inwardly quit the dunghill of humility within themselves, and scale the heights of pride; herein following the steps of him, the first that elevated himself in his own eyes, and in elevating brought himself to the ground, following the steps of him, who was not content with that dignity of a created being, which he had received, saying, I will ascend into heaven; I will exalt my throne above the stars of God. [Is. 14, 13]  And it is hence that she, which is united to him by an evil alliance, even Babylon, i.e. ‘the confused multitude of sinners,’ says, I am, and none else beside me, I shall not sit as a widow. [Is. 47, 8]  Whosoever then swells within him, has set himself on high by himself.  Yet doth he sink himself so much the deeper below, in proportion as he scorns to think the lowest things of himself according to the truth.  There are some too that labour not to do aught that is virtuous, yet when they see others commit sin, they fancy themselves righteous by comparison with them.  For all hearts are not wounded by the same or a similar offence.  For this one is entrapped by pride, while that perchance is overthrown by anger, and avarice is the sting of one, while luxury fires another.  And it very often chances that he, who is brought down by pride, sees how another is inflamed with anger; and because anger does not speedily influence himself, he now reckons that he is better than his passionate neighbour, and is as it were lifted up on the score of his righteousness in his own eyes, in that he forgets to take account of the fault, by which he is more grievously enchained.  And it very often happens that he who is mangled by avarice, beholds another plunged in the whirlpool of luxury, and because he sees himself to be a stranger to carnal pollution, he never heeds by what defilements of the spiritual life he is himself inwardly polluted; and while he considers well the evil in another, which he is himself without, he forgets to take account in his own case of that which he has; and so it is brought to pass, that when the mind to be pronounced upon goes off to the cases of other men, it is deprived of the light of its own judgment, and so much the more cruelly vaunts itself against others' failings, in proportion as it is from negligence in ignorance of its own.
61.  But, on the other hand, they that really desire to rise to the heights of virtue, whenever they hear of the faults of others, immediately recall the mind to their own; and the more they really bewail these last, so much the more rightly do they pronounce judgment on those others.  Therefore, forasmuch as every elect person restrains himself in the consideration of his own frailty, it may be well said that the holy man in his sorrow sits down upon a dunghill.  For he that really humbles himself as he goes on his way, marks with the eye of continued observation all the filth of sin wherewith he is beset.  But we must know that it is in prosperity that the mind is oftenest touched with urgent temptations, yet that it sometimes happens that we at the same time undergo crosses without, and are wearied with the urgency of temptation within, so that both the scourge tortures the flesh, and yet suggestion of the flesh pours in upon the mind.  And hence it is well, that after the many wounds that blessed Job received, we have yet further the words of his illadvising wife subjoined also.

33.  For what is the potsherd in the hand of the Lord, but the flesh which He took of the clay of our nature?  For the potsherd receives firmness by fire.  And the Flesh of our Lord was rendered stronger by His Passion, in so far as dying by infirmity, He arose from death void of infirmity.  And hence too it is rightly delivered by the Prophet, My strength is dried up like a potsherd. [Ps. 22, 15]  For His ‘strength was dried up like a potsherd,’ Who strengthened the infirmity of the flesh which He took upon Him by the fire of His Passion.  But what is to be understood by humour [saniem] saving sin?  For it is the custom to denote the sins of the flesh by flesh and blood.  And hence it is said by the Psalmist, Deliver me from blood. [Ps. 51, 16]  Humour then is the corruption of the blood.  And so what do we understand by humour but the sins of the flesh, rendered worse by length of time?  Thus the wound turns to humour when sin, being neglected, is aggravated by habit.  And so the Mediator between God and man, the Man Christ Jesus, in giving up His Body into the hands of those that persecuted Him, scraped the humour with a potsherd, forasmuch as He put away sin by the flesh; for He came, as it is written, in the likeness of sinful flesh, that He might condemn sin of sin. [Rom. 8, 3. Vulg.]  And whilst He presented the purity of His own Flesh to the enemy, He cleansed away the defilements of ours.  And by means of that flesh whereby the enemy held us captive, He made atonement for us whom He set free.  For that which was made an instrument of sin by us, was by our Mediator converted for us into the instrument of righteousness.  And so ‘the humour is scraped with a potsherd,’ when sin is overcome by the flesh.  It is rightly subjoined;
And he sat down upon a dunghill.
34.  Not in the court in which the law resounds, not in the building which lifts its top on high, but on a dunghill he takes his seat, which is because the Redeemer of man on coming to take the flesh, as Paul testifies, hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the mighty. [1 Cor. 1, 27] Does not He, as it were, sit down upon a dunghill, the buildings being ruined, Who, the Jews in their pride being left desolate, rests in that Gentile world, which He had for so long time rejected?  He is found outside the dwelling all in His sores, Who herein, that He bore with Judaea, which set itself against Him, suffered the pain of His Passion amid the scorn of His own people; as John bears witness, who says, He came unto His own, but His own received Him not. [John 1, 11]  And how He rests Himself upon a dunghill, let this same Truth say for Himself; for He declared, Likewise I say unto you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner that repenteth, more than over ninety and nine just persons which need no repentance. [Luke 15, 7. and 10.]  See, He sits upon a dunghill in grief, Who, after sins have been committed, is willing to take possession of penitent hearts.  Are not the hearts of penitent sinners like a kind of dunghill, in that while they review their misdoings with bewailing, they are, as it were, heaping dung before their eyes in abusing themselves?  So when Job was smitten he did not seek a mountain, but sat down upon a dunghill, in that when our Redeemer came to His Passion, He left the high minds of the proud, and rested in the lowliness of the heavy laden.  And this, while yet before His Incarnation, He indicated, when He said by the Prophet, But to this man will I look, even to him, that is poor, and of a contrite spirit, and trembleth at My word. [Is. 66, 2]
35.  But who can think what numberless outrages He underwent at the hands of men, Who showed to men such unnumbered mercies?  Who can think how great those are which He even yet undergoes, yea now that He reigns from above over the hearts of the faithful?  For it is He that endures daily all wherein His Elect are racked and rent by the hands of the reprobate.  And though the Head of this Body, which same are we, already lifts itself free above all things, yet He still feels in His Body, which He keeps here below, the wounds dealt it by reprobate sinners.  But why do we speak thus of unbelievers, when within the very Church itself we see multitudes of carnal men, who fight against the life of our Redeemer by their wicked ways.  For there are some, who set upon Him with evil deeds, because they cannot with swords, forasmuch as when they see that what they go after is lacking to them in the Church, they become enemies to the just, and not only settle themselves into wicked practices, but are also busy to bend the uprightness of good men to a crooked course.  For they neglect to lift their eyes to the things of eternity, and in littleness of mind they yield themselves up to the lust of temporal things, and they fall the deeper from eternal blessings, in proportion as they look upon temporal blessings as the only ones.  The simplicity of the righteous is displeasing to these, and when they find opportunity for disturbing them, they press them to lay hold of their own duplicity.
