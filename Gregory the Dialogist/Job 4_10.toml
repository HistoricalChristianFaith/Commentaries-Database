41.  Forasmuch as the nature of every thing is compounded of different elements, in Holy Writ different things are allowably represented by anyone thing.  For the lion has magnanimity, it has also ferocity: by its magnanimity then it represents the Lord, by its ferocity the devil.  Hence it is declared of the Lord, Behold, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David hath prevailed. [Rev. 5, 5]  Hence it is written of the devil, Your adversary, the devil, like a roaring lion, walketh about seeking whom he may devour. [1 Pet. 5, 8]  But by the title of a ‘lioness’ sometimes Holy Church, sometimes Babylon is represented to us.  For on this account, that she is bold to encounter all that withstand, the Church is called a ‘lioness,’ as is proved by the words of blessed Job, who in pointing out Judaea forsaken by the Church, says, The sons of the traders have not trodden, nor the lioness passed by it. [Job 28, 8. Vulg.]  And sometimes under the title of a lioness is set forth the city of this world, which is Babylon, which ravins against the life of the innocent with terribleness of ferocity, which being wedded to our old enemy like the fiercest lion, conceives the seeds of his froward counsel, and produces from her own body reprobate sons, as cruel whelps, after his likeness.  But the ‘lion's whelps’ are reprobate persons, engendered to a life of sin by the misleading of evil spirits, who both all of them together constitute that great city of the world which we have declared before, even Babylon; and yet these same sons of Babylon severally are called not ‘a lioness’ but ‘a lioness's whelps.’  For as the whole Church together is denominated Sion, but the several individual Saints the sons of Sion, so both the several individuals among the reprobate are called the children of Babylon, and all the reprobate together are designated the same Babylon.
42.  But so long as good men remain in this life, they keep watch over themselves with anxious heed, lest the lion that goeth about surprise them by guile, i.e. lest our old enemy slay them under some show of virtue; lest the voice of the lioness stun their ears, i.e. lest the glory of Babylon catch away their minds from the love of the heavenly country; lest ‘the teeth of the young lions’ bite them, i.e. lest the promptings of the reprobate gain power in their heart.  But, on the other hand, heretics are already as if secured touching holiness, because they fancy that they have surmounted all obstacles by the preeminent merit of their life.  And hence it is said here, The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the lioness, and the teeth if the young lions are broken.  As though it were expressed in plain words; ‘We for this reason are never beaten and bruised with any strokes, for that we tread under at once the might of the old enemy, and the lust of earthly glory, and the promptings of all the reprobate, overcoming them by the preeminence of our life.’

38.  For what does he call the roaring of the lion but, as we have said a little above, the severe character of that man?  what the voice of the lioness, but his wife's loquacity?  what the teeth of the young lions, but the greediness of his children?  For because his sons had perished when feasting, they are denoted by the term of ‘teeth;’ and while unsparing Eliphaz rejoices that they are all ‘broken,’ he denounces them as deservedly condemned.  And he yet further doubles the cruelty of his reproaches.
