For, as I said, it is a craft peculiar to the boastful to be eager to enquire about their erring when they know that they have not erred. And again, they disdain to make this enquiry and to be convicted of error whenever they plainly foresee that they have done wrong. They do not seek to be but to appear humble. They assume an appearance of humility by making the inquiry when they are praised the more from the very inquiry itself. But because it is very difficult forpride, which reigns in the heart, not to break in the voice, if the hearers of these haughty people wait for a while and consider their sayings in silence, the words that follow too soon manifest in their hearts. They cannot continue long in that guise of humility that they assume in appearance only.… “Does God require it of you, because it has displeased you?” As though he were saying, I am about to give reasons, in the sight of God, why my iniquity is now blamed by you, though it is plain that it is not required of you in judgment. When good people are unjustly assailed by the world, they appeal to the judgment of heaven. Hence also it is said by the same blessed Job, “Behold, my witness is in heaven, and he who knows me is on high.” And because they especially desire to please him, they seek for the witness of him only. Wicked people also, who forsake the life of the just, sometimes imitate their words when reproved for their misdeeds and adopt that as a ground of defense which the righteous urge as an evidence of their purity. Hence it has become already a custom with them, when anyone blames them for their doings, to seek the judgment of God rather than of people even when they are not afraid of being judged by him and are ashamed of being judged by people.… But since those who speak first in a dispute are usually more to blame than those who reply, he subjoins, “For you did begin to speak, not I.” He believed himself to be so innocent, inasmuch as he burst forth only on being struck, being doubtless ignorant that innocence is not defended on the score of time but on that of reason. What support does it give to his defense that, though he did not revile him when silent, when he began properly, he replied to him insultingly? But after he displays himself in words of pride, behold, he again conceals himself under the pretext of a demand and proceeds to say, “But if you know anything better, say on.” Yet he does not say, “because you know better,” but “if you know anything better, say on.” It was itself too arrogant that he had doubted the knowledge of his superior. But he showed that he had exhibited his humility in having given blessed Job an opportunity for speaking. As was before stated, everything in the doings of the proud that is concealed by a covering of words is brought to light. When the boastful purpose again breaks forth, Elihu speedily made it known with what purpose he required blessed Job to speak.
