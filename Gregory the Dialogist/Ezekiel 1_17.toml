When our Savior came into the world, he made to be spiritually understood what he found to be carnally held. Thus wherever its letter is spiritually understood, all the carnal display in it comes to life. Truly the New Testament is also called the eternal Testament through the pages of the Old because the understanding of it is never changed.
