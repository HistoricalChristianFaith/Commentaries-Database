31. As we have already said far above, Ramah is interpreted as "consummated vision" and signifies that blessed and perfect society of the citizens above, to which Samuel returns lest he be weighed down by the burden of his labor. For Samuel returns to Ramah when the mind of the preacher is refreshed through love of heavenly things. For amid the immense burdens of his office he would collapse, if he did not return to love of heavenly things through the desire of his hope. For to return, for preachers, is to lead the intention of their mind back to the joys of the heavenly fatherland. And there they judge Israel, because they strive by preaching to make their faithful subjects conformable to the beauty of the heavenly fatherland which they retain in their mind. There they judge Israel, because from that already perfect city they draw the pattern they see, which they impress upon the minds of their children by speaking; and whatever they perceive to be unworthy of that beauty, they endeavor to cut away from their minds. And because they rest with complete love in the glory of that blessed fatherland, his house is said to be there. For his house is recognized to be that in which he dwells by loving. Whence also that outstanding preacher boasts, saying: "Our citizenship is in heaven." For he goes around Bethel, Gilgal, and Mizpah, and in none of these does he have a house, but in Ramah he has a house: because the holy doctors of the Church, whatever they now receive from the examples of the elect, whatever from the instruction of the sacred books, whatever from the height of heavenly revelation—they examine these things in passing, having them as an aid for the journey, not as the object of love for their reward. But what they love in the heavenly city they have not for the advancement of the journey, but for the sufficient—indeed, for the abundant—generosity of their reward. And because all good things are gathered there, it follows: "He also built an altar there to the Lord."

32. For what is the altar of the Lord, if not the heart of the just man? Moreover, by the judgment of Truth it is said: "Where your treasure is, there will your heart be also" (Matt. 6:21). But he who does good works out of love for the heavenly homeland, while he ardently desires to arrive at those things which he stores up above, assuredly builds an altar upon which he may kindle the sacrifices of daily desire. And it is well said: "He built there an altar to the Lord," because from the increase of heavenly zeal, just as the flame of good desire grows in the heart, so also, as if by the addition of stones, an altar is built upward where holocausts of love may be offered to God. This can also be fittingly applied to the gaining of souls. For the teacher builds an altar to the Lord in Ramah when he places the merits of his subjects in heaven, and while through his daily zeal chosen souls ascend to the heavenly kingdoms, they are sent, as it were, as stones for the construction of the heavenly altar. Let it therefore be said of Samuel, let it be said: "He built there an altar to the Lord," because surely the zeal of the teacher is altogether idle if through what is done by him on earth the heavenly edifice is not increased.
