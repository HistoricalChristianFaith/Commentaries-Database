“He stretches out his hand to the flint; he overturns mountains by the roots.” “He stretches out his hand to the flint” means he presented the arm of his preaching to the hardness of the Gentiles. Hence the same blessed Job, forewarned of the history of his suffering being destined to be made known to the Gentiles, says, “Let these things be engraved with an iron pen in a plate of lead or hewn in the flint.” However, whom in this place do we understand by the “mountains” except the powerful ones of this world, who because of earthly substance puff themselves up? Concerning them the psalmist says, “Touch the mountains, and they shall smoke”; but the mountains are overturned from the roots, because holy church, preaching the highest powers of this world, fell from their inmost thinking into the adoring of almighty God. For “the roots” of the mountains are the inmost thoughts of the proud. And “the mountains fall from the roots,” because for the worshiping of God, the powers of the world are laid level with the earth from the lowest thoughts. For by a root the hidden thought is rightly denoted, because by means of that which is not seen, being within, there bursts out what should be seen without. Therefore, on the side of good it is said by the prophet, “And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall again take root downward and bear fruit upward. As though it were expressed in plain speech; “Deep down below the thought springs up, that up on high the reward may be rendered back.” So then, let him say, “He stretches out his hand to the flint and overturns the mountains from the roots.” While the sacred preaching sought the hardness of the Gentiles, it entirely frustrated the loftiness of the proud, however, because those it empties of earthly thoughts, it fills with heavenly gifts. Moreover, those whom it drains of interest below, it waters with streams from above. It is directly added, “He cuts out streams in the rocks,” that is, in the hard hearts of the Gentiles he opened the rivers of preaching; as it is likewise spoken by the prophet of watering the dryness of the Gentiles, “He turns the wilderness into a standing water and dry ground into water springs.”
