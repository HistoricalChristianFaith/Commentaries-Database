It was said by Moses, “They drew honey from the rock, and oil from the hardest rock.” … But because according to Paul, “the rock was Christ,” they drew honey from the rock who saw the deeds and miracles of our Redeemer; and they drew oil from the hard rock because they were found worthy to be anointed with the outpouring of the Holy Spirit after his resurrection.… The gift of the holy anointing flowed out of him through the breathing forth of the Spirit. Of this oil the prophet said, “The yoke will be destroyed from before the oil.”

It is possible that the Holy Spirit himself was denoted by the name of oil, concerning which it is said through the prophet: “and the yoke will rot at the presence of the oil.” The yoke rotted at the presence of oil because when we are anointed with the grace of the Holy Spirit, we are liberated from the bondage of our slavery. Then, with the prideful tyranny of the evil spirit broken, the yoke with which the necks of our freedom was oppressed is destroyed. Again, it is written about the oil: “My beloved had a vineyard on a hill called the son of oil.” The son of oil represents the faithful people, whose faith in God is generated by the interior anointing of the Holy Spirit.Although it has been burdened in the past with many tribulations, therefore, let the holy church call to mind the gifts of the Spirit and the marvelous prophecies which it now possesses, and let it lament its silence, saying, “The rock poured out for me streams with oil.”
