And so we pass quickly over the allegorical meanings, that we may come more swiftly to the breadth of the moral sense. "There was a certain rich man, who was clothed in purple and fine linen, and feasted sumptuously every day." Whom, dearest brothers, does this rich man who was clothed in purple and fine linen and feasted sumptuously every day signify, if not the Jewish people, who had the cultivation of life outwardly, who used the delights of the law they received for show, not for usefulness?

Some think that the precepts of the Old Testament are stricter than those of the New; but these are certainly deceived by careless consideration. For in the Old Testament, not avarice but robbery is punished. There, property unjustly taken is punished by fourfold restitution. But here this rich man is not blamed for taking what belonged to others, but for not giving what was his own. Nor is it said that he oppressed anyone by violence, but that he exalted himself in the things he had received. From this, therefore, we must especially conclude with what punishment he should be punished who seizes what belongs to others, if he is struck with the condemnation of hell who does not share his own possessions. Therefore let no one consider himself safe, saying: "Behold, I do not seize what belongs to others, but I enjoy things lawfully granted to me," because this rich man was not punished for taking what belonged to others, but because he wrongly abandoned himself to the things he had received. This too is what delivered him to hell: that he was not fearful in his prosperity, that he turned the gifts he received to the use of arrogance, that he knew nothing of the bowels of compassion, that he refused to redeem his sins even when he had abundant means to do so.

And there are some who do not think that the wearing of fine and costly garments is a sin. But if indeed it were not a fault, the Word of God would never so carefully express that the rich man who is tormented in hell had been clothed in fine linen and purple. For no one seeks exceptional garments except for vainglory, that is, to appear more honorable than others. For the thing itself testifies that more costly clothing is sought only for empty glory, because no one wishes to be clothed in precious garments where he cannot be seen by others. We can better understand this fault also from the opposite: for if the lowliness of cheap clothing were not a virtue, the evangelist would not carefully say of John: "He was clothed with camel's hair."
