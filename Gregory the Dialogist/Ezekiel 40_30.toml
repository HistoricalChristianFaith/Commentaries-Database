"Twenty-five cubits in length, and five cubits in width, and its vestibule toward the outer court." The interior gates have vestibules that are measured as twenty-five cubits in length. For if we multiply eight by three, we arrive at twenty-four. To this one is added, so that we have twenty-five. For good hearers, who are like certain vestibules of the gates, hold the longsuffering of eternal hope; they await the eighth day in faith in the Trinity. Because this Trinity is one God, they indeed multiply eight by three, but they are made firm in the confession of one God. The vestibules are level because the hearts of good hearers are humble. They have length because they persevere in the longsuffering of hope. Their length is measured at twenty-five cubits because they believe in the resurrection of the flesh on the eighth day through the Trinity, and they confess that the same holy Trinity is one God. They also have five cubits in width because through the simple life that is led by the five senses they are enlarged in love of neighbor. And it should be noted that after the vestibules of the gates were described above as one thing, afterward the vestibule that has five cubits in width is said to look outward, because indeed there are some hearers who penetrate the understanding of the interior life more by advancing in virtues, and there are certain simple ones who live well indeed but according to the bodily senses. Hence they are also said to look outward. For they look outward, as it were, because they live according to the bodily senses. But nevertheless even those looking outward are within, because even if they do not know how to transcend the bodily senses by understanding, they still humbly hold faith and charity. And so they are within in the spiritual building through love, and they look outward, as it were, through simplicity.

The vestibule that looks outward can designate the faith of beginners, and the vestibule that is interior can designate the faith of the perfect, who already shine forth through it in signs and virtues. The higher precepts can also be represented by the interior vestibule, while the still lesser precepts can be represented by the vestibule that looks outward. For through the vestibule one goes to the steps and to the gate, because through the precepts of preaching one attains to virtues and to the entrance of heavenly grace. But when some are commanded to meditate on eternal things in their thoughts, to be wise about heavenly things, and when they are told to live in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, the interior vestibule is shown, as it were, which is measured at fifty cubits in length and twenty-five in width. But when others are commanded, "Let the husband render to his wife what is due, and likewise also the wife to her husband," the vestibule that looks outward is designated, as it were. Though it looks outward, nevertheless it is inside, because the unlearned hearer both still does what is of the flesh and yet is not excluded from the number of the good.
