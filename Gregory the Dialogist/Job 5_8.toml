17.  As though he said in plain words, ‘Him I petition, by Whom I know that these things are bestowed.’  For if he imagined that he had them by himself, he would not need to make his prayer to God.  It goes on;
Which doeth great things and unsearchable, marvellous things without number.
18.  Who may see to the bottom of the marvellous works of Almighty God, how He made all things of nothing, how the very framework of the world is arranged with a marvellous mightiness of power, and the heaven hung above the atmosphere, and the earth balanced above the abyss, how this whole universe consists of things visible and invisible, how He created man, so to say, gathering together in a small compass another world, yet a world of reason; how constituting this world of soul and flesh, He mixed the breath and the clay by an unsearchable disposal of His Might?  A part, then, of these things we know, and a part we even are. Yet we omit to admire them, because those things which are full of marvels for an investigation deeper than we can reach, have become cheap from custom in the eyes of men.  Hence it comes to pass that, if a dead man is raised to life, all men spring up in astonishment.  Yet every day one that had no being is born, and no man wonders, though it is plain to all, without doubt, that it is a greater thing for that to be created, which was without being, than for that, which had being, to be restored.  Because the dry rod of Aaron budded, all men were in astonishment; every day a tree is produced from the dry earth, and the virtue residing in dust is turned into wood, and no man wonders.  Because five thousand men were filled with five loaves, all men were in astonishment that the food should have multiplied in their teeth; every day the grains of seed that are sown are multiplied in a fulness of ears, and no man wonders.  All men wondered to see water once turned into wine.  Every day the earth's moisture being drawn into the root of the vine, is turned by the grape into wine, and no man wonders.  Full of wonder then are all the things, which men never think to wonder at, because, as we have before said, they are by habit become dull to the consideration of them; but when he said, which doeth great things, he did well in immediately adding, and unsearchable.  For it was but little to do great things, if the things that were done could have been searched to the bottom.  And it is lightly added, marvellous things without number.  As it would have been but an inferior greatness, if the things, which He created ‘unsearchable,’ He had made [a] but few in number.
19.  But herein it ought to be impressed upon us, that the Divine miracles should both ever be under our consideration in earnestness of mind, and never sifted in intellectual curiosity.  For it often happens that the thought of man, when, seeking the reason of certain things, it fails to find it out, plunges into a whirlpool of doubt.  Hence it comes to pass that some men reflect that the bodies of the dead are reduced to dust, and while they are unable to infer the power of the Resurrection from reasoning, they despair of their being able to be brought back to their former condition.  Things that are marvellous then are to be believed on a principle of faith, but not to be pried into by reason.  For, if reason set them open before our eyes, they would no longer be marvellous, But when the mind may chance to falter in these, it is needful that such things as it knows by custom, yet does not infer by reason, should be recalled to mind, that by the weight of a similar circumstance one may supply strength to the faith, which one finds to be undermined by one's own shrewdness.  For, when the dust of the human flesh is thought on, the mind of some is shaken, and despairs of the time, when dust shall return to flesh, and through the lineaments of the limbs form a body restored to life, when that dryness of earth shall flush into freshness through the living limbs, and fashion itself in distinct parts by the forms and shapes of them.  This indeed can never be comprehended by reason, yet it may be easily believed from example.  For who would imagine that from a single grain of seed a huge tree would rise up, unless he had it as a certain fact by experience?  In that extreme minuteness of a single grain, and with next to no dissimilarity within itself, where is the hardness of the wood buried, and a pith either tender or hard compared with the wood, the roughness of the bark, the greenness of the root, the savour of the fruits, the sweetness of the scents, the variety of the colours, the softness of the leaves?  Yet because we know this by experience, we do not doubt that all these spring from a single grain of seed.  Where then is the difficulty that dust shall return into limbs, when we have every day before our eyes the power of the Creator, Who in a marvellous manner, even from a grain creates wood, and in a still more marvellous manner from the wood creates fruit?  Which doeth great things and unsearchable; marvellous things without number.  For the greatness of the Divine works can neither be made out in respect of kind and quality, nor reckoned in respect of quantity.
