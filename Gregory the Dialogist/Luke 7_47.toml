Mary Magdalene, who had been a sinner in the city, by loving the truth, washed away the stains of her sin with tears: and the voice of Truth is fulfilled, by which it is said: "Many sins are forgiven her, because she loved much." For she who had previously remained cold through sinning, afterward burned ardently through loving.

After this enumeration, the judgment is added: "Therefore I say to you: Her many sins are forgiven, because she loved much." What, my brothers, do we believe love to be, if not fire? And what is sin, if not rust? Hence it is now said: "Her many sins are forgiven, because she loved much." As if it were openly said: She has fully burned away the rust of sin, because she burns intensely with the fire of love. For the rust of sin is consumed all the more, the more the sinner's heart is set ablaze with the great fire of charity.

But now our Redeemer concludes the good deeds he has enumerated, when he adds through his verdict: "Therefore I say to you: Her many sins are forgiven, because she has loved much." As if he were saying openly: Even if what is being refined is very hard, nevertheless the fire of love abounds, by which even hard things are consumed.
