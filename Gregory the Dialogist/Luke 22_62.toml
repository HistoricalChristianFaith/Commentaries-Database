For I consider Peter, I reflect upon the thief, I look at Zacchaeus, I gaze upon Mary, and I see nothing else in these except examples of hope and repentance placed before our eyes. For perhaps someone has fallen in faith; let him look to Peter, who wept bitterly because he had denied out of fear.

Did he not hold Peter in his mouth when he denied? But when he returned to life through repentance, this Leviathan in a certain way lost him as if through the hole in his jaw.
