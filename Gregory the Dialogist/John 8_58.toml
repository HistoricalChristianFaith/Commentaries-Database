(ut sup.) Our Saviour mildly draws them away from their carnal view, to the contemplation of His Divinity; Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was, I am. Before is a particle of past time, am, of present. Divinity has no past or future, but always the present; and therefore He does not say, Before Abraham was, I was: but, Before Abraham was, I am: (Exod. 3:14) as it is in Exodus, I am that I am. Before and after might be said of Abraham with reference to different periods of his life; to be, in the present, is said of the truth only.

Our gracious Redeemer draws them away from gazing at His flesh and leads them to the contemplation of His divinity, saying: "Amen, amen, I say to you, before Abraham was made, I am." For "before" belongs to past time, "I am" to present time. And because the Divinity has neither past nor future time, but always has being, He did not say "Before Abraham I was," but "Before Abraham I am." Hence also it is said to Moses: "I am who am." And: "You shall say to the children of Israel: He who is has sent me to you." Therefore Abraham had both a before and an after, because he was able both to arrive through the manifestation of his presence and to depart through the course of his life. But Truth always has being, because nothing in it either begins at an earlier time or ends at a later one. But the minds of the unbelievers, unable to endure these words of eternity, ran to stones, and sought to overwhelm Him whom they could not understand.
