And she was bowed down, nor could she look upward at all. Every sinner thinking earthly thoughts, not seeking heavenly things, is unable to look upward, because while he follows lower desires, he is bent from the uprightness of his mind, and he always sees these things which he thinks about without ceasing. Return to your hearts, dearest brothers, always examine what you turn over in your thoughts at every hour. One thinks about honors, another about money, another about the extent of estates. All these things are below, and when the mind is entangled in such things, it is bent from the uprightness of its state. And because it does not rise up to heavenly desire, like the bent woman it can in no way look upward.
