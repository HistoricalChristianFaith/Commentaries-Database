“This is the beginning of the ways of God. He who made him provided him with his sword.” The sword of this Behemoth is his own malice in inflicting harm. But he who made him good in his nature provided him with his sword, because, according to divine will, his malice is limited, so that he is not allowed to strike human beings as much as he would like to. Now, if our enemy can do much but strikes less, this is due to the fact that the mercy of our Creator sets a limit to his sword. Therefore, [the devil] hides inside his conscience, and his malice, through which he makes people die, does not exceed the proper limits set by God.
