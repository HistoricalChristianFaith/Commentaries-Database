Through the holy spirit of prophecy the winged creatures are described in detail, so that the very subtlety of the description may reveal to us that the persons of the Evangelists are signified through them, and the word of God may leave nothing doubtful to our understanding. For behold it is said: "And the likeness of their faces was the face of a man, and the face of a lion on the right side of the four of them; and the face of an ox on the left side of the four of them; and the face of an eagle above the four of them." That these four winged creatures designate the four holy Evangelists, the very beginnings of each gospel book testify. For because he began from the human generation, Matthew is rightly represented by the man; because of the cry in the wilderness, Mark is rightly designated by the lion; because he began from sacrifice, Luke is well represented by the calf; but because he began from the divinity of the Word, John is worthily signified by the eagle, who saying: "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God," while he gazed upon the very substance of Divinity, fixed his eyes upon the sun like an eagle. But because all the elect are members of our Redeemer, and our Redeemer himself is the head of all the elect, through the fact that his members are figured, nothing prevents him also from being signified in all these. For he, the only-begotten Son of God, truly became man; he deigned to die as a calf in the sacrifice of our redemption; he rose through the power of his strength as a lion. The lion is also said to sleep with open eyes, because in that very death in which our Redeemer could sleep according to his humanity, he kept watch according to his divinity by remaining immortal. He also, ascending to heaven after his resurrection, was raised up on high as an eagle. Therefore he is everything to us at once, who by being born became man, by dying a calf, by rising a lion, and by ascending to heaven was made an eagle. But because we have already said above that the four evangelists are signified by these creatures, and under their appearance all the perfect together, it remains for us to show how each of the elect is expressed by these visions of creatures.

Every elect person who is perfect in the way of God is simultaneously a man, a calf, a lion, and an eagle. For man is a rational animal. The calf, moreover, is customarily slaughtered in sacrifice. The lion is a mighty beast, as it is written: "The lion, the mightiest of beasts, will not cower before any encounter." The eagle soars to the heights and gazes upon the rays of the sun with unwavering eyes. Therefore, everyone who is perfect in reason is a man. And because he mortifies himself from the pleasures of this world, he is a calf. Because through that voluntary mortification of his own he possesses the strength of security against all adversities—whence it is written: "The righteous man, confident as a lion, shall be without fear"—he is a lion. Because he contemplates in a lofty manner those things which are heavenly and eternal, he is an eagle. Therefore, since every righteous person becomes a man through reason, a calf through the sacrifice of his mortification, a lion through the strength of security, and an eagle through contemplation, each perfect person can rightly be signified by these holy living creatures. We say this in order to demonstrate that the things which have been said about the four living creatures pertain also to each individual among the perfect.

But a great question arises for us concerning these same evangelists and holy preachers: why is man and lion said to be on the right side of the four of them, while the calf is said to be on the left side of the four? For it is not without wonder why those two are said to be on the right and this one on the left. And again we must ask why the eagle is mentioned as being not on the right or left, but above the four of them. We have thus posed two questions for ourselves, which we must resolve with the Lord's help. Therefore, man and lion are said to be on the right, while the calf is said to be on the left. For on the right we have joyful things, but on the left we have sorrowful things. Hence we also say that what we consider adverse is on our left. And, as we said before, the incarnation is signified by the man, the passion by the calf, and the resurrection of our Creator by the lion. Now concerning the incarnation of the only-begotten Son, by which we were redeemed, all the elect rejoiced; but concerning his death, those first saints among the elect, the holy apostles themselves, were saddened, who again rejoiced at his resurrection. Since, therefore, both his birth and resurrection brought joy to the disciples, whom his passion had saddened, man and lion are described as being on his right, while the calf was on his left. For those same holy evangelists rejoiced at his humanity, were strengthened by his resurrection, who had been saddened by his passion. Therefore, man and lion are on their right, because the incarnation of our Redeemer gave them life, and his resurrection strengthened them. But the calf is on the left, because his death cast them down into unbelief for a moment of time. Rightly, however, the place of the eagle is described as being not beside but above, because whether through what it signifies—his ascension—or because it proclaims that the Word of the Father is God with the Father, it surpassed the other evangelists in the power of contemplation; although he speaks of his divinity together with them, yet he contemplates this more subtly than all. But if the eagle, joined with the three others, is mentioned as the four living creatures, it is strange how it is described as being above the four of them—unless it is because John, through seeing the Word in the beginning, also passed beyond himself. For unless he had also transcended himself, he would not have seen the Word in the beginning. Since, therefore, he transcended even himself, he was no longer merely above three, but with himself added, above four.
