It is said, as Paul witnesses, “And from sin he condemned sin.” He bound his tongue with a cord, because by means of the likeness of sinful flesh he swept away all his deceitful arguments from the hearts of his elect. For behold, when the Lord appears in the flesh, the tongue of Leviathan is bound, because, when his truth had become known, those doctrines of falsehood were silenced.For where is now the error of the academicians, who endeavor to establish on sure grounds that nothing is sure, who with shameless brow demand from their hearers belief in their assertions, when they declare that nothing is true? Where is the superstition of the mathematicians, who, looking up at the courses of the constellations, make the lives of men to depend on the motions of the stars? Though the birth of twins often scatters their doctrine to the winds; for though born at one and the same moment, they do not remain in the same kind of life. Where are those many false teachings, which we abstain from enumerating, for fear of digressing far from the course of our commentary? But every false doctrine has now been silenced, because the Lord has bound the tongue of Leviathan by the cord of his incarnation. Whence it is also well said by the prophet: “And the Lord shall lay waste the tongue of the Egyptian sea.” For the “tongue of the sea” is the knowledge of secular learning. But it is well called “the Egyptian sea,” because it is darkened with the gloom of sin. The Lord, therefore, laid waste the tongue of the Egyptian sea, because by manifesting himself in the flesh, he destroyed the false wisdom of this world. The tongue of Leviathan is, therefore, bound with a cord, because the preaching of the old sinner was bound by the likeness of sinful flesh.
