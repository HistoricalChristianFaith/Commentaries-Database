If we consider, dearest brothers, what and how great are the things promised to us in heaven, everything that is possessed on earth becomes worthless to the soul. For earthly substance, compared to heavenly happiness, is a burden, not a help. Temporal life, compared to eternal life, should be called death rather than life. For what is this daily failing of corruption itself other than a kind of prolongation of death? But what tongue can tell, or what understanding can grasp how great are the joys of that heavenly city: to be present among the choirs of angels, to stand with the most blessed spirits in the glory of the Creator, to behold the face of God present before us, to see the uncircumscribed light, to be affected by no fear of death, to rejoice in the gift of perpetual incorruption? But at hearing these things the soul is set ablaze, and already desires to stand there where it hopes to rejoice without end. But one cannot arrive at great rewards except through great labors. Hence Paul, that excellent preacher, says: "No one will be crowned unless he has competed lawfully." Therefore let the greatness of the rewards delight the mind, but let not the struggle of labors deter it. Hence Truth says to those coming to him: "If anyone comes to me and does not hate his father and mother, and wife and children, and brothers and sisters, and even his own soul as well, he cannot be my disciple."

But it is fitting to inquire how we are commanded to hate our parents and blood relatives, when we are ordered to love even our enemies? And certainly the Truth says concerning a wife: "What God has joined together, let not man separate." And Paul says: "Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the Church." Behold, the disciple preaches that a wife should be loved, while the Master says: "He who does not hate his wife cannot be my disciple." Does the judge announce one thing while the herald proclaims another? Or can we both hate and love at the same time? But if we weigh the force of the precept, we are able to do both through discernment, so that those who are joined to us by kinship of the flesh, and whom we recognize as our neighbors, we may love, and those whom we suffer as adversaries in the way of God we may disregard by hating and fleeing from them. For one who thinks carnally is loved, as it were, through hatred, when he brings wicked things upon us and is not heard. Moreover, so that the Lord might demonstrate that this hatred toward our neighbors does not proceed from lack of affection but from charity, He added immediately, saying: "And his own soul as well." Therefore we are commanded to hate our neighbors, and to hate our own soul. It is clear, then, that one ought to hate his neighbor by loving him, he who hates his neighbor just as he hates himself. For we truly hate our own soul well when we do not yield to its carnal desires, when we break its appetite, when we resist its pleasures. Therefore what is led to better things by being despised is loved, as it were, through hatred. Thus, thus indeed we ought to show the discernment of hatred toward our neighbors, so that we may both love in them what they are, and hold in hatred that by which they obstruct us on our journey to God.

Certainly, when Paul was going to Jerusalem, the prophet Agabus took hold of his belt and bound his own feet, saying: "The man whose belt this is, they will bind thus in Jerusalem." But what did he who perfectly hated his own soul say? "I am prepared not only to be bound but also to die in Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, nor do I consider my soul more precious than myself." Behold how he hated his soul by loving it, or rather, by hating it he loved it, since he desired to hand it over to death for Jesus, so that he might raise it to life from the death of sin. Therefore, from this discernment of our hatred let us draw a pattern for hatred of our neighbor. Let anyone in this world be loved, even an adversary, but let not even a relative be loved who is opposed in the way of God. For whoever now desires eternal things, in the cause of God which he undertakes, must become estranged from father, from mother, from wife, from children, from relatives, from his very self, so that he may know God more truly the more he recognizes no one in God's cause. For the carnal affections greatly buffet the intention of the mind and obscure its vision; yet we do not suffer them as harmful if we hold them in check by suppressing them. Therefore, neighbors are to be loved, charity is to be extended to all, both relatives and strangers, yet for the sake of that same charity we must not be turned aside from love of God.

Now we know that when the ark of the Lord was returning from the land of the Philistines to the land of the Israelites, it was placed upon a cart, and cows were yoked to the cart, which are recorded to have been nursing mothers, whose calves they shut up at home. And it is written: "The cows went straight along the way that leads to Beth-shemesh, and they kept to one path, going and lowing, and they turned aside neither to the right nor to the left." What then do the cows signify but all the faithful in the Church, who while they consider the precepts of sacred Scripture, carry as it were the ark of the Lord placed upon them? Concerning these it should also be noted that they are recorded to have been nursing mothers, because there are many who, while inwardly set upon the way of God, are outwardly bound by carnal affections; yet they do not turn aside from the straight path, who carry the ark of God in their mind. For behold the cows proceed to Beth-shemesh. Beth-shemesh means "house of the sun"; and the Prophet says: "But unto you who fear the Lord shall the sun of righteousness arise." If therefore we are heading toward the dwelling of the eternal sun, it is surely fitting that we not turn aside from the way of God on account of carnal affections. For it must be considered with all our strength that the cows placed under God's cart proceed and groan: they give forth lowing from deep within, and yet they do not turn their steps from the path. Thus indeed ought the preachers of God, thus ought all the faithful within holy Church to be, that they may have compassion on their neighbors through charity, and yet not stray from the way of God through that compassion.
