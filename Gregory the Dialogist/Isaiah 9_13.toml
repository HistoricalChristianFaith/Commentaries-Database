Against them the prophet complains to the Lord, saying, “You have bruised them, and they have refused to receive correction.” … Hence again the Lord says, “The people are not returned to him who has struck them.” … Hence the Lord reproaches the people of Israel, captive yet not converted from their iniquity, saying, “The house of Israel is become dross to me; all these are brass, and tin, and iron and lead, in the midst of the furnace.” This is as though he said unmistakably, “I wished to purify them in the fire of tribulation, and I wanted them to become silver or gold. But they have turned from me in the furnace into brass, and tin, and iron and lead, because even in tribulation they have rushed forward not to virtue but to vices.” When brass is struck, it gives off a greater sound than do other metals. He … who when chastised breaks forth into sounds of murmuring has turned to brass in the midst of the furnace. Tin, however, when skillfully treated, presents the deceptive appearance of silver. He therefore who is not free from the vice of pretence in the midst of tribulation has become tin in the furnace. But he uses iron who plots against the life of the neighbor, and he is iron in the furnace when he does not put away in his tribulations the wickedness of doing harm to neighbors. Lead, again, is heavier than the other metals. He then is found to be lead in the furnace who is so weighed down by the burden of his sin that even in tribulation he is not raised above earthly desires.
