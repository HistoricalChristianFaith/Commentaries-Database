27. The heart of the holy Church is none other than that devout and learned blessedness of the faithful which is within her. And Anna spoke in her heart, because the preaching of the holy Church benefited only those who were to be illuminated by the true light through divine predestination. What indeed is the movement of the lips but the advancement of signs in the holy preachers? These indeed, although they seemed to speak outwardly like lips and to stand in a lowly position, while they gave sight to the blind, hearing to the deaf, and life to the dead, certainly displayed great movements of merits. Hence also that great lip of the holy Church, while speaking it seemed to stand in a lowly position, because it was not only humble in word and conduct, but also sublime in the power of signs, so that by its movement it raised itself up to heaven, saying: Our conversation is in heaven (Phil. 3:20). And so Eli only saw Anna's lips moving but did not hear her voice at all, because the Jewish priesthood marveled at the works of the apostles but was not advanced to salvation by their preaching. Therefore Anna's voice was not heard, because although the holy Church was wonderful in the display of signs, when she brought forth words of preaching, she kindled strangers to love of the Redeemer. But what does Eli think of her whom he does not understand? It follows: (Verse 13) Therefore Eli thought her to be drunk.

28. Indeed, we have recognized this also according to the history of the Acts of the Apostles, because on the days of Pentecost the holy apostles were believed to be drunk, when, having received the fullness of the Holy Spirit, they spoke the great works of Christ in every tongue (Acts 2:4). But spiritually the holy Church is believed to be drunk, which Judea does not consider to be asserting true things, but preaching heretical and false things. Yet she was drunk, not with the drinking of error, but with the filling of the Holy Spirit. For drunkenness is accustomed to change the heart, to alienate the mind. But with changed heart he was going about, who recently entering houses, terrifying all the faithful with threats, tearing them apart with slaughter, was now preaching that the Jesus whom he had persecuted was the true Son of almighty God (Acts 9:5, 20). Whence also, glorying that he had lost the madness of his former mind, he says: "Who was before a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and insolent, but I obtained mercy, because I did it ignorantly" (1 Timothy 1:13). Testifying that he had received another heart, he says: "But we have the mind of Christ" (1 Corinthians 2:16). Whence also he preached all the more attentively, inasmuch as in the mind of Christ he had received the force of greater love. But while the holy Church loved ardently, while she confidently preached those things which she loved, the priesthood of the Jews held her words as a burden of impatience, not in the sweetness of devotion. Wherefore it also follows: (Verse 14.) And he said to her: "How long will you be drunk?" And because he tried to command her to be silent, he added: (Verse 14.) "Digest a little while the wine with which you are soaked."

(Moral Exposition) Both of these—namely carnal prelates and spiritual subjects—Eli and Anna well represent; for when he sat before the doorposts of the Lord's temple and Anna prayed, Eli watched her mouth and called her drunk. But she, who patiently endured the insults, displayed humility of response with truthful reasoning. She declared herself his handmaid, speaking from much grief and sorrow, and not only calmed his angry spirit against her, but even turned him to prayer for obtaining the fruit of her desire.
