That the overthrow of Jerusalem which was accomplished by Vespasian and Titus, the Roman princes, is described while the Lord weeps, no one who has read the history of that destruction is unaware. But first we must ask what it means that is said: "Seeing the city, he wept over it, saying: If you had known, even you." For the Redeemer first wept over the ruin of the faithless city, which the city itself did not know was coming upon it.

But since we know that Jerusalem has now been destroyed and through its destruction has been changed for the better, we ought to draw some likeness inwardly from external things and fear the ruin of morals from the ruined buildings of walls. For seeing the city, he wept over it, saying: If you had known, even you. This he did once, when he announced that the city would perish. This our Redeemer never ceases to do daily through his elect, when he considers that certain people have passed from a good life to wicked ways. For he mourns those who do not know why they are mourned, because, according to the words of Solomon: "They rejoice when they have done evil and exult in the worst things." If they had recognized their damnation which hangs over them, they themselves would mourn with the tears of the elect.
