It had been said above: "Each of them went before its face," but now it is said: "It walked in the presence of its face." And so the same statement seems to have been repeated. But since we use "in the presence of" to mean "in the present" (that is, it signifies "in the present"), we can distinguish by more subtle inquiry that it is one thing to walk before the face, and another to walk in the present. For to walk before the face is to seek what lies ahead; but to walk in the present is not to be absent from oneself. For every just person who anxiously examines their life and diligently considers how much they grow daily in good things, or perhaps how much they decline from good things—this one, because they place themselves before themselves, walks in their own presence, since they vigilantly see whether they are rising or falling. But whoever neglects the guardianship of their life, and either despises or does not know how to examine what they do, what they say, what they think—this one does not walk in their own presence, because they are ignorant of what they are like in their habits or in their actions. Nor is one present to oneself who is not anxious to examine and know oneself daily. But that one truly places themselves before themselves and is present to themselves, who attends to themselves in their actions as if to another.

For there are many sins which we commit, but they do not seem serious to us because, loving ourselves with a private love and closing our eyes, we flatter ourselves in our self-deception. Hence it often happens that we judge our own serious faults lightly, while judging the light faults of our neighbors severely. For it is written: "Men shall be lovers of themselves." And we know that private love powerfully closes the eye of the heart. From this it happens that what we ourselves do, and do not consider to be serious, is often done by our neighbor, and seems to us excessively detestable. But why does what seemed trivial to us in ourselves appear serious in our neighbor, unless because we neither see ourselves as we see our neighbor, nor our neighbor as we see ourselves? For if we looked at ourselves as we do at our neighbor, we would see our own faults with strict judgment. And again, if we looked at our neighbor as we do at ourselves, his action would never appear intolerable to us, since we have often perhaps done the same things, and thought we had done nothing intolerable to our neighbor. Moses strove to correct this badly divided judgment of our mind through the precept of the law, when he said that the bushel should be just and the measure equal. Hence Solomon says: "A weight and a weight, a measure and a measure, both are abominable before God." We know that in the double weights of merchants, one is larger, the other smaller. For they have one weight by which they weigh for themselves, and another weight by which they weigh for their neighbor. They prepare lighter weights for giving, but heavier ones for receiving. Therefore every person who weighs differently the things that belong to their neighbor and differently those that are their own has "a weight and a weight." Both therefore are abominable before God, because if one loved their neighbor as themselves, they would love them in good things as they love themselves. And if one looked at themselves as they do at their neighbor, they would judge themselves in evil things as they judge their neighbor. We ought therefore to see ourselves carefully as we see others, and, as has been said, to place ourselves before our own eyes, so that constantly imitating the winged creatures, lest we be ignorant of what we do, we may always walk before our own face. But the perverse, as we said a little before, do not walk before their own face, because they never consider what they do; they tend toward destruction; they exult in wicked deeds. Of whom it is written: "Who rejoice when they have done evil, and exult in the worst things." Often indeed the just person who beholds them weeps, but they themselves, in the manner of the frenzied, are lamented over, yet they laugh.

Others give much from their own possessions to the needy, but when they find an opportune moment, they oppress the needy and devastate with whatever plunder they can those whom they are able to. They place before the eyes of their thought the good things they do, and they do not place there the worst things they commit. These clearly do not walk before their own face, because if they were present to themselves, they would see carefully all that they do, and they would recognize how they lose their good works through evil actions, as it is written: And he who gathered wages put them into a bag with holes (Haggai 1:6). For from a bag with holes there goes out elsewhere what is put in from elsewhere, because undiscerning minds do not see how the reward that is acquired from good work is lost through evil work. Another preserves bodily chastity and vigilantly watches himself, lest he outwardly admit anything blameworthy; he is content with his own things, he does not seize what belongs to others, but nevertheless perhaps he holds hatred in his heart against his neighbor. And though it is written: He who hates his brother is a murderer, he considers how pure he is outwardly in deed, and he does not weigh how cruel he is in mind. What is this man but absent from himself, who walks in the darkness of his own heart and does not know it? Another now does not seize what belongs to others, now guards his body from impurity, now loves his neighbor with a pure mind, and conscious of past evils, afflicts himself with lamentations in his prayers; but when prayer is finished, he seeks happy things to rejoice over in this world, and lets his neglectful soul sink into temporal joys, nor does he care lest immoderate joys exceed the measure of his tears; and it happens that by laughing excessively he loses the good that he gained by weeping. This one therefore does not walk before his own face, because he refuses to see the losses he suffers. For it is written: The heart of the wise is where sadness is, and the heart of fools is where gladness is. In all things therefore that we do, we ought diligently to observe ourselves inwardly and outwardly, so that following the winged creatures, we may be present to ourselves and always walk before our own face, having as our only helper Jesus Christ our Lord, the Son of the Father, who lives and reigns with him in the unity of the Holy Spirit, through all ages of ages. Amen.

Oh, how marvelous is the depth of God's utterances! It is delightful to attend to it, delightful to penetrate its inner meanings with grace as our guide. Whenever we examine it by understanding, what else do we do but enter the shade of the forests, so that we may be hidden in its coolness from the heat of this age? There we gather the greenest herbs of its teachings by reading, and we ruminate on them by reflecting. In the discourse that was delivered to you, dearest brothers, three days ago, it was explained how the living creatures that were shown signify either our Redeemer, or His four evangelists, and all the perfect. The virtue of these living creatures is still expressed more subtly, so that we too, weak and contemptible as we are, may stretch ourselves toward imitating them, insofar as we are able by the Lord's generosity. For behold, it is said: Wherever the impulse of the spirit was, there they went.

In the elect and the reprobate the impulses are different. In the elect, namely, is the impulse of the spirit; in the reprobate, the impulse of the flesh. For the impulse of the flesh drives the soul to hatred, to pride, to impurity, to plunder, to outward glory, to cruelty, to faithlessness, to despair, to anger, to quarrels, to pleasures. But the impulse of the spirit draws the mind to charity, to humility, to continence, to generous mercy, to inward advancement, to works of piety, to faith in eternal things, to hope of coming joy, to patience, to peace, to consideration of mortal life, to tears. Therefore it is necessary that we should always with great care consider in everything we do what impulse leads us; whether our thought is driven by the impulse of the flesh or by the impulse of the spirit. For to love earthly things, to prefer temporal things to eternal, to possess outward goods not for necessary use but to desire them for pleasure, to seek vengeance against an enemy, to rejoice at a rival's downfall—this is the impulse of the flesh. But on the contrary, to love heavenly things, to despise earthly things, to seek passing things not for the fruit of pleasure but for the use of necessity, to be grieved at an enemy's death—this is the impulse of the spirit. And because all who are perfect always exercise themselves in these virtues, it is rightly now said of the holy living creatures: Where the impulse of the spirit was, there they went.

But we must know that very often the impulse of the flesh cloaks itself under the guise of a spiritual impulse, and thought itself lies to itself that what it does carnally it does spiritually. For often someone, overcome by the goads of anger, is inflamed against offenders with zeal for avenging justice more than is necessary, and crossing the boundary of justice in vengeance acts cruelly, while suspecting that he acts justly. The impulse of the flesh, therefore, is veiled for this person under the appearance of spirit, when what is believed to be done justly is not held under the restraint of discretion. And often another person, devoted to excessive gentleness, observes the faults of his subjects, and refuses to correct these through the fervor of zeal, which by cruelly not correcting he multiplies in them; and so it happens that his mildness is hostile both to himself and to his subjects, since because he reckons the torpor of his mind to be patience, through the spirit of the flesh he distances himself from the impulse of the spirit. Therefore, the first consideration ought to rouse us to inquiry of our own heart, lest we be led to certain things we do through an open impulse of the flesh, lest the mind, seduced by depraved pleasures, recognize things to be evil and nevertheless do them. But the second concern ought to render us vigilant, lest the impulse of the flesh secretly insinuate itself as if under the impulse of the spirit, and pretend to us that the faults we commit are virtues.

It should be known that those faults are more serious which imitate virtues under a false appearance, because those faults which are recognized openly cast the soul into confusion and draw it to repentance; but these not only do not humble one to repentance, but even exalt the mind of the one acting, since they are considered virtues. Moreover, what had been said above about the holy living creatures is repeated again, so that it may be more firmly established: They did not turn back when they walked.

Because all the elect strive toward good things in such a way that they do not return to perpetrating evil: "For he who perseveres to the end will be saved." And as it is said through Solomon: "The path of the just, like a shining light, proceeds and grows until the perfect day." For in their souls the good desire and understanding of the inner light is already part of the day, but because they advance in virtue until the end of life, they come to the perfect day when, having been led to the heavenly kingdoms, they will no longer lack anything in that light which they desire.
