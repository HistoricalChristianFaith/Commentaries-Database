I was reduced to nought. As the wind thou didst take away my desire. And as a cloud my health hath passed away.

For in the reckoning of the wicked we are 'brought to nought,' when those temporal goods, which they themselves love as chief, we do not retain in our bands. Because the promises from Above being disregarded they desire the things of earth, and if ever aught rises up in the mind of those persons in the way of longing after the Eternal world, it is quickly done away by transitory gratification springing up. And hence it is directly subjoined; As the wind thou didst take away my desire.

Since the faithful People declares that itself suffers that, wherein those whom it loves it grieves should suffer. Thus 'the wind takes away desire,' when any transitory object does away the longing after Eternity. And hence it is yet further fitly subjoined; And as a cloud my health hath passed away. Since the cloud towers on high, but the breath of wind drives it into career. Thus, surely, then is it with the temporal good things of the wicked. They appear as it were by loftiness of honour to pass their time as on high, but they are daily driven on to the career of life as by a kind of blasts of their mortality. So 'health passes as a cloud,' because the glory of the wicked, in the degree that it is lofty, is not fixed.
