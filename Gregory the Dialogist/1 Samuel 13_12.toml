17. Behold, he who is accused of the recklessness of a great transgression is not afraid to assert great reasons of justice. "I saw," he says, "that the people were slipping away from me." Here he asserts that he was abandoned by the people. "Furthermore, you had not come within the appointed days." Here he shows himself cheated of the prophet's promise. "Furthermore, the Philistines had gathered at Michmash." Here he likewise brings up the imminent danger of battle. Therefore, drawing a conclusion from his own action, he says: "Compelled by necessity, I offered the burnt offering." As if to say: You accuse me of a great offense, when the offense is so much lighter inasmuch as it was committed not from recklessness but from necessity. But what the prophet recognizes him to be—he who was unwilling to recognize himself—he adds, saying: (Verse 13.) "You have acted foolishly, and you have not kept the commandments of the Lord your God."
