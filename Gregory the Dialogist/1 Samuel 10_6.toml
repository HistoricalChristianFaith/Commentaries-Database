18. It is well added: "And the Spirit of the Lord will leap upon you, and you will prophesy with them." The Spirit of the Lord is said to leap because the hearts of the elect are suddenly filled with His gifts. They immediately begin to prophesy, because those who are full of the divine Spirit cannot remain silent about the mighty works of God. Or he is declared about to prophesy, to whom Samuel promises the grace of the divine word. This is as if he were saying: You who now cannot speak in that abundance of the Spirit coming upon you—when that fullness has poured itself into you, you will abound with a wealth of speech. Indeed, the Lord, promising this leaping Spirit to the disciples, says: "When the Spirit of truth comes, He will teach you all truth, and will announce to you the things that are to come" (John 16:13). The Spirit indeed leaps upon those whose hearts He illuminated by coming suddenly (Acts 2:2). And once illuminated, they prophesied, because they proclaimed the Redeemer of the human race in every tongue. This we certainly see happening even now in the holy Church, because often those who desire to speak divine things are suddenly taught by that same Spirit, and they are also able to speak most excellently things they had learned by no prior meditation. For in return for keeping the commandments of God, they receive the grace of the word in the sublime revelation of the Redeemer. For what wonder is it if those who through purity of life are always the dwelling place of the Holy Spirit can suddenly receive the light of knowledge? But what kind of gift of the Holy Spirit would it be if it gave knowledge and did not give the affection of great charity? For those who are filled with that Spirit preach heavenly things, but they love what they speak. Therefore it is fittingly added: "And you will be changed into another man." What is the love of the elect mind other than a transformation of the old nature? For our nature was so condemned through the fall of the first man that it daily declines by slipping and grows old by declining. But we who fail in ourselves, when that Spirit leaps into us, are renewed, because we are immediately made what we were not. Someone was lukewarm, but suddenly visited by the Spirit, he is made fervent. He begins to burn with devotion, to exercise himself vigorously in good work. He has therefore been changed into another man, because he began to be what, before the Spirit leaped into him, he could not be. Someone is already of good conduct, loves heavenly things, despises earthly things, but he cannot manage to weep for the things he loves above or for the things he hates below. Often indeed he desires to weep and cannot, though he recalls having committed many things for which he ought to weep; but when that Spirit suddenly leaps in, he bursts forth into fountains of tears. He is therefore changed into another man, who receives the grace of compunction through the coming Spirit, which he did not have before the coming of that same Spirit. Someone desires to obtain purity of heart, to think on heavenly things, to be hindered by no encounters with worldly cares; but he cannot rise up to what he desires through devotion by means of the affection of purity. But suddenly, caught up in the power of the coming Spirit, he ceases to be carnal, powerfully casts aside the cares of the world, and rises to the contemplation of eternal things with wonderful purity. He then marvels that he is what he was not; he then marvels that he was not what he is. For when he sees himself to be such in spiritual things, he who is such marvels that he could not have been such before. He is therefore changed into another man, who sees himself to be what he was not, and not to be what he had been. Well therefore concerning Saul: "You will be changed into another man." Because when the preachers of the holy Church receive the grace of divine preaching, they do not receive only the knowledge of the word, but the power of love—so that through the word they may be able to benefit others, and through love of the word they themselves may become better. For when they speak, they are changed into another man, because when the Spirit speaks through them, they themselves are joined to that same Spirit by wondrous charity, and they no longer dissent from His will in either word or deed. For sacred Scripture, praising such a man, says: "He who clings to God is one spirit with Him" (1 Cor. 6:17). For we cling to God when we abundantly receive the grace of the Holy Spirit; and we are made one spirit with Him when we are in harmony with the divine will in mind, mouth, and deed.
