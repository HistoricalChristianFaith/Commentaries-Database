38.  It is good to run through these points in a moral sense, putting aside the signification of the Jewish people, and to trace out in what manner they are transacted by wicked men in general.  For the minds of the wicked, when they see some things done well by their neighbours, are strained upon the stretched rack of their jealousy, and they undergo the grievous chastisement of their own malice, when with a consuming heart they see good in others.  Therefore it is well said, They meet with darkness in the day time.  For when their mind is grieved for the superiority of another, there is an overshadowing from the ray of the light; for oftentimes while they view the unconcealed good qualities in their neighbours, they look closely if there be any evil points lying concealed from sight, and they busy themselves in eager scrutinies, if they may chance to find somewhat with which they may be able to charge them.  Sound limbs indeed are all they see, but, with the eyes of the heart closed, they seek by feeling to find a sore.  And hence it is rightly subjoined, And grope in the noonday as in the night.  The day of good deeds shines outwardly in a neighbour, but they ‘grope as it were in the night,’ because inwardly they are under the darkness of their jealous feeling.  They busy themselves to get to some points which they may censure, they seek out an opening for detraction, but forasmuch as they are unable to find this, they search about in blindness without.  Which is well set forth in that occasion, when from the Angels protecting Lot, the inhabitants of Sodom could not find the doorway in his house, as it is written, And they pressed sore upon the man, even Lot, and came near to break the door.  But the men put forth their hand, and pulled Lot into the house to them, and shut to the door.  And they smote the men that were at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great, so that they wearied themselves to find the door. [Gen. 19, 9-11]  What does it mean that, when the wicked are up in arms against him, Lot is brought back into the house, and defended, but that every righteous man, while he encounters the assaults of evil ones, is brought back into his interior, and abides undismayed.  But the men of Sodom cannot find the door in Lot's house, because the corrupters of souls detect no opening of accusation against the life of the righteous man.  For, stricken with blindness, they as it were go round and round the house, who, under the influence of envy scrutinize words and deeds; but because in the life of the just, strong and praiseworthy conduct fronts them every way, groping at random they feel nothing else than the wall.  Therefore it is well said, And grope in the noonday as in the night.  For while the good, which they see, it is out of their power to impeach, being blinded by wickedness, they search out for impeachment evil which they see nothing of.

34.  They ‘meet with darkness in the day-time,’ for in the very presence of Truth, they were blinded by the deceitfulness of unbelief.  For we see clearly in the day-time, but in the night the pupil of our eye is dimmed.  Therefore whilst the persecutors beheld the miracles of Divine Power, and yet doubted of His Divine Nature, they were subjected to ‘darkness in the day-time,’ for they lost their eyesight in the light.  Hence it is that ‘Light’ Itself admonishes them, saying, Walk while ye have the light, lest darkness come upon you. [John 12, 35]  It is hence that it is said of Judaea, Her sun is gone down, while it was yet day. [Jer. 15, 9]  It is hence that the Prophet again took up in himself the strain of persons in a state of penitence, in these words, We stumble at noonday as in the night, we are in dismal places as dead men. [Is. 59, 10]  Hence again He says, Watchman, what of the night [b]?  Watchman, what of the night?  The watchman said, The morning cometh, and also the night. [Is. 21, 11. 12]  For ‘the watchman came by night,’ in that the Guardian of the human race even showed Himself manifest in the flesh, and yet Judaea, being close pressed by the darkness of her faithlessness, never knew Him.  Where it is well added in the voice of the watchman, The morning cometh, and also the night.  For by His presence hath a new light shone out upon the world, and yet the former darkness remained in the hearts of unbelievers.  And it is well said, They shall grope in the noonday as in the night; for we search out by groping that which we do not see with our eyes.  Now the Jews had seen His undisguised miracles, and yet they still went on seeking Him, as it were groping for Him, when they said, How long dost Thou make us to doubt?  If Thou be the Christ, tell us plainly. [John 10, 24]  See, the light of miracles was before their eyes, yet stumbling in the darkness of their own hearts, they continued to grope in seeking for Him.  And this same blindness of theirs burst out into cruelty, and their cruelty even to the extent of overt acts of persecution.  But the Redeemer of mankind could not for long be held by the hands of His persecutors.
