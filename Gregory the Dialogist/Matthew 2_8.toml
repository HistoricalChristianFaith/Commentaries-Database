He requests that it be reported back to him where the child might be found; he pretends that he wishes to adore him, so that he might destroy him (as if he could find him). But how great is human malice against the counsel of divinity? For it is written: There is no wisdom, there is no prudence, there is no counsel against the Lord. By his character, who else is signified but hypocrites, who, while they seek falsely, never deserve to find the Lord?
