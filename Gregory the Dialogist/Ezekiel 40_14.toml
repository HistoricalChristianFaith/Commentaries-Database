And he made fronts of sixty cubits, and to the front of the gate was the court on every side round about.

We have often said that perfection of good work is signified by the number six, not following what the wise men of this age have striven to establish, saying that the number six is perfect because it is completed when counted in its own order, as when one, two, three are said, the number six is filled up; or because it is divided into three parts, that is, a sixth, a third, and a half, namely into one, two, and three; but we say that the number six is perfect because, as was said a little before, God completed all His works on the sixth day. Since indeed He gave the law to sinful man, which is written in ten precepts, and six times ten makes sixty, rightly through sixty cubits the perfection of good works is signified. This the Lord also clearly indicates in the Gospel, who, when He was explaining the parable of the sower, said: "Other seed fell on good ground, and yielded fruit that sprang up and increased, and brought forth one thirty, and one sixty, and one a hundred." For the fruit of good ground brings forth thirty when the mind has conceived the perfection of faith, which is in the Trinity. It brings forth sixty when it has produced perfect works of a good life. But it brings forth a hundred when it has advanced to the contemplation of eternal life. For our left hand is the present life, but the right hand is the life to come. And rightly through the number one hundred the contemplation of eternal life is signified, because when after thirty and sixty we arrive by counting at the number one hundred, that same hundredth number passes to the right hand. Faith and works are still on the left hand, because while we are still placed here, we both believe what we do not see, and we work so that we may see. But when the soul has already raised itself to the contemplation of eternal life, the counting, as it were, reaches the right hand. Therefore he made the fronts sixty cubits long. For since perfection is signified by the number sixty, what is signified by the fronts of the building but the very works that are seen outwardly? For to give the word of preaching, to give food to the hungry, clothing to those who are cold, and to endure adversities patiently for the sake of good work—what else are these but the fronts of the heavenly building? Because the beauty of outward works adorns the dwelling place of God, which still lies hidden within. But these fronts have a court all around on every side, because works are great in this regard, if the breadth of charity enlarges them in the mind. Concerning charity it is written: "Your commandment is exceedingly broad." Concerning this the Psalmist again says: "You have set my feet in a spacious place."

But behold, while I speak, it occurs to my mind how broad charity is. If God is reached through charity, and Truth says of itself: Enter through the narrow gate. And again I hear the Psalmist saying: Because of the words of your lips I have kept hard ways. And in the Gospel the Lord says: For my yoke is sweet, and my burden is light. How then is charity broad, if the gate is narrow? Or how is the yoke sweet and the burden light, if in God's precepts the ways that are kept are hard? But charity itself quickly resolves this question for us, because the way of God is narrow for those beginning, and broad for those already living perfectly. And the things we spiritually propose to our mind against habit are hard, and yet God's burden is light, after we have begun to bear it, so that for love of him even persecution is pleasing, and all affliction for his sake comes with sweetness of mind, just as the holy apostles also rejoiced when they endured scourges for the Lord. Therefore that narrow gate becomes broad for those who love, those hard ways become soft and level for those running spiritually; for when the mind knows it will receive eternal joys for temporal pains, it begins to love even that by which it is afflicted. Therefore the court before its front is the breadth of love in perfection of work.

And it should be noted that it says "on every side round about," so that a man through everything he does may always expand himself in the breadth of charity, lest either fear or hatred constrain him. If therefore someone speaks the word of God, and does not keep in his mind the charity which he preaches, he has the front of the building, but does not have the court before the front. If someone bestows alms upon the needy, and through this perhaps is lifted up in heart, and does not relieve the want of his neighbor out of charity, but exalts himself with silent pride, he indeed shows the front in the building, but has not made a court beside the front. If someone endures insults inflicted by a neighbor, and silently bears the evils cast at him, great is the patience which he demonstrates, but only if he does not hold pain in his heart, if he seeks to win even the one who had offended him to the tranquility of meekness. For if while outwardly showing patience he inwardly holds pain, and does not love him whom he endures, he indeed has the front in the building, but does not have the court before the front, because he who has subjected himself to the constraint of hatreds has surely lost the breadth of charity. For as we have already said in the earlier part, that patience is true which also loves the one whom it bears. For to tolerate but to hate is not the virtue of meekness, but a veil for fury. And it should be noted that this same court is called the court of the gate. For our gate is the entrance to the kingdom. And to love God and neighbor perfectly is already to stretch toward the entrance of the kingdom. For insofar as anyone loves, to that extent he draws near to the entrance. But insofar as he neglects to love, to that extent he refuses to enter, because he does not strive to see what he desires. Therefore we have the court of the gate when from the breadth of charity we already enter through desire into the heavenly life which we are not yet able to attain. And so when a good work is done toward a neighbor, it remains that the intention of that same good work be discerned: whether it does not seek the repayment of present favor, but the soul directs its hope toward the future promise, so that from temporal things it may hope for eternal, from earthly things heavenly. For the hope of heavenly things makes the mind firm, lest it be shaken by the waves of earthly tumults. Concerning which it is also said through Paul: "Which we have as an anchor of the soul, safe and firm, and entering into the interior of the veil."
