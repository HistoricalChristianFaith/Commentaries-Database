The spiritual tasks we impose on an unaccustomed spirit are hard. Yet the burden of God is light when we have begun to bear it so that even persecution pleases us through our love of him. Every affliction for his sake comes in sweetness of mind, for the holy apostles too rejoiced when they endured the whip for the Lord.
