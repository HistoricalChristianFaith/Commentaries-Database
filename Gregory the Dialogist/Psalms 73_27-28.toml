But, if there are any who say that sins are only superficially put away in baptism, what can be more against the faith than such preaching, whereby they would willingly undo the very sacrament of faith, wherein principally the soul is bound to the mystery of heavenly cleanness, that, being completely absolved from all sins, it may cleave to him alone of whom the prophet says, “But it is good for me to cling to God”? For certainly the passage of the Red Sea was a figure of holy baptism, in which the enemies behind died but others were found in front in the wilderness. And so to all who are bathed in holy baptism, all their past sins are remitted, since their sins die behind them even as did the Egyptian enemies. But in the wilderness we find other enemies, since, while we live in this life, before reaching the country of promise, many temptations harass us and hasten to bar our way as we are proceeding to the land of the living. Whosoever says, then, that sins are not entirely put away in baptism, let him say that the Egyptians did not really die in the Red Sea. But if he acknowledges that the Egyptians really died, he must acknowledge that sins die entirely in baptism, since surely the truth avails more in our absolution than the shadow of the truth. In the Gospel the Lord says, “He who is washed does not need to wash but is entirely clean.” If, therefore, sins are not entirely put away in baptism, how is he that is washed entirely clean? For he cannot be said to be entirely clean if he has any sin remaining. But no one can resist the voice of the truth, “He who is washed is entirely clean.” Nothing, then, of the contagion of sin remains to him whom he himself who redeemed him declares to be absolutely clean.
