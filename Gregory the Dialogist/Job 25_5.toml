22.  What is denoted by ‘the moon’ but the whole Church together?  what by ‘the stars’ but the souls of the several persons that live rightly?  who amidst the practices of wicked men, whilst they are conspicuous by rare virtues, as it were shine in the darkness of night.  Whence likewise it is said by Paul to the disciples; Among whom ye shine like lights in the world. [Phil. 2, 15]  For that Holy Church is represented by the designation of ‘the moon,’ the Prophet bears witness, saying, The sun was lifted up, and the moon stood in her order. [Hab. 3, 11]  For on ‘the sun being lifted up, the moon is established in her order,’ in that on our Lord ascending into the heavens, Holy Church is thereupon made strong in the authoritative function of preaching.  And that by the title of ‘stars’ the Elect are represented, Paul again informs us, by saying, For one star differeth from another star in glory. [1 Cor. 15, 41]  So ‘the moon doth not shine, and the stars are not clean in His sight,’ because neither doth Holy Church by her own power shine forth in so many miracles, except the gifts of preventing grace fall in showers upon her, nor are the minds of the several persons that live rightly clean of the stains of sinful practices, if they be judged apart from pity; because in the eyes of the strict Judge every single individual his own proneness to corruption doth pollute, unless the grace of One sparing day by day wipe this away.  For the mind of the Elect strives to go forth to the liberty of righteousness, but is still bound and tied with the fetters of frailty, and it longs indeed perfectly to get the better of offences, but so long as it is fettered by the corruption of the flesh, it is tied with the chains thereof, even when it would not be.  Hence therefore let him collect with what a load of sins they are borne down, who neglect to war against the same, if not even they entirely get the better of evil doing, who strenuously fight against it.  And hence it is said, Behold even to the moon, and it shineth not, and the stars are not pure in His sight.
