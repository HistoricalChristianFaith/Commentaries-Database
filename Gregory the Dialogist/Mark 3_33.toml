For Jesus, our Creator and Redeemer, pretends not to know His mother, and indicates who is His mother and who are His relatives not through kinship of the flesh, but through union of the spirit, saying: "Who is my mother, and who are my brethren? For whoever does the will of my Father who is in heaven, he is my brother, and sister, and mother." By these words, what else does He suggest to us, except that He gathers many who are obedient to His commands from among the Gentiles, and does not acknowledge Judea, from whose flesh He was born?
