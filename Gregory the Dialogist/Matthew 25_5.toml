"While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept," because while the Judge delays His coming to the final judgment, both the elect and the reprobate are lulled in the sleep of death. For to sleep is to die. But to slumber before sleep is to languish from health before death, because through the weight of illness one arrives at the sleep of death.
