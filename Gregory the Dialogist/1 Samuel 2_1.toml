We have already shown that the type of holy Church lies hidden in the person of Anna. She, indeed, once the child was born, declares that she exults in the Lord, because she did not swell with vain pride over having drawn the Gentile people to faith in the Redeemer, but kept the intention of her joy fixed on Him from whom she received the gifts of her fruitfulness. By these words she indicates the foundation of her joy in such a way that she also shows the cause of that same exultation. Barren indeed she wept, giving birth she exulted, to foreshadow the character of holy Church, which grieves that it has been cast down from the joys of paradise into this valley of tears, but patiently endures the hardships of its exile for the sake of winning souls. It has been accustomed to exult only in this: if in the tribulation of time by which it is pressed, through the glory of its fruitfulness, with the elect multiplied, the losses of the heavenly homeland may be repaired. Therefore she says: "My heart has exulted in the Lord," because she has obtained the fruit of her purpose. In this passage it should be noted that what she speaks in glorying she is said to have prayed. For it was stated beforehand: "And Anna prayed and said: My heart has exulted in the Lord." But why is she said to have prayed when she is known to ask nothing from God by entreaty? But because the holy woman knew through the spirit of prophecy that this would come to pass, and she vehemently desires it to happen, she speaks both exulting and praying. Indeed she exulted in the certainty of future things, vehemently desiring to happen what she knew by revelation of the mystery. Holy Church also recalls, proclaims, and prays the divine benefits from that source, loving and venerating them, because indeed it carries out outwardly by speaking what it inwardly desires to happen with wondrous longing, and venerates what has happened with great devotion. Therefore she says: "My heart has exulted in the Lord," because the gifts she receives for the fruit of eternal joy she does not convert to temporal gladness.

What is the horn of Anna, except the power of the holy Church? This horn indeed was wonderfully lifted up when the Son of God, through His assumed humanity, made Himself a participant in our nature. Therefore in this the horn of the holy Church was exalted, in which human nature now shines, elevated above the angels. But in that the holy Church singularly declares Him her God and Savior, she covertly shows the rejection of the Synagogue. Therefore in God our Savior our horn has been exalted, because the sublimity of Ecclesiastical power has been raised up for us in the humanity of the Redeemer. Hence also concerning the same Redeemer it is said through Zechariah: He has raised up a horn of salvation for us, in the house of David His servant, as He spoke through the mouth of His holy prophets (Luke 1:69-70), because when she reports that her horn has been exalted, she covertly indicates that before she had a horn that was not exalted. For the holy Church before the coming of the Redeemer had a horn, because in the patriarchs and prophets she received from God both the order of right living and the power of correcting those who transgressed. But nevertheless she did not have an exalted horn, because even if she could live justly, still she could not return to the joys of Paradise without the presence of the Redeemer. But now the horn of the holy Church has been exalted, because we have already received the Redeemer of the world coming, through whose grace we are able not only to live rightly, but also to pass over to the joys of paradise, because He who died for us has already risen, in whose death death died, and paradise opened itself to His faithful ones. Therefore our horn has been exalted in our God, because, with the grace of the Holy Spirit now poured out, we see the image of the Redeemer impressed upon the multitude of the elect, while those who despise all earthly things, flee the pleasures of the flesh, and abandon their own possessions, shine with such higher power as the holy Church did not have these great marks of virtue in the multitude of the ancients. Our horn has been exalted in God our Savior, because to as many as received Him, He gave power to become children of God (John 1:12). Our Savior wished to exalt this horn when He said: Behold, I have given you power to tread upon serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy (Luke 10:19). Hence again asserting He says: Whatever you bind on earth shall be bound also in heaven (Matthew 16:19). Hence again He promises, saying: You shall sit upon thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel (Matthew 19:28). Therefore let Anna say: My horn has been exalted in my God, so that evidently the glory of the holy Church may be designated, which obtains the singular summit of power from the presence of the Redeemer. And because she is now extended throughout the whole world, who once was afflicted by persecutions within Judea.

For who else are to be understood as enemies of the Church than the Jews? Over whom indeed she has an enlarged mouth, because against their faithlessness she now moves the tongues of all faithful nations. Therefore the mouth of holy Church has been enlarged, because it is spread throughout the whole world, and while she instructs all nations by the preaching of truth, she reproves the foolishness of the Jews, as it were with enlarged mouth. And because she was able to do this for the reason that she joyfully received the Redeemer of the world coming in the flesh, she sets forth the cause of her enlarged mouth.

Now we have learned who the Salvation of God is. Concerning whom Isaiah also prophesying says: All flesh shall see the Salvation of God; all the ends of the earth shall see the Salvation of God (Isa. 52:10; Ps. 97:3). But Jesus in our language is called Savior. Concerning whom Habakkuk also promises himself joy, saying: I will rejoice in God my Jesus (Hab. 3:18). Behold, by the voices of the ancient Jews the Lord Jesus is declared to be God. But now the Jews await a Savior whom they in no way believe to be God. But perhaps the Jews strive to reject this in their own mouth, and while they interpret Jesus as Savior, they understand God the Savior not as the person of the Only-begotten, but of the Father; nevertheless in the same place it is added, whereby the person of the Only-begotten is more openly demonstrated: O Lord God, he says, my strength, set my feet in completion, and place me upon the heights, that I may conquer in his glory (Ibid. 19). Behold, he speaks to God saying: Place me upon the heights. But because he says: I shall conquer in his glory, there is certainly another of whom he speaks. Who therefore is he of whom he speaks except the only-begotten Son of God, whom he believes to be not only true man, but also God? Therefore when he speaks to God, saying: I will rejoice in God my Jesus, and I shall conquer in his glory, he demonstrates not another God, but another person of God. These are the reasonings of holy Church, these are the invincible assertions spread throughout the whole world against the faithlessness of the Jews. Therefore holy Church has her mouth opened wide against her enemies, because now, with God as author, it is known everywhere, whereby the faithlessness of the Jews is also refuted. Therefore let those who deny the Salvation of God hear the reason for the opened mouth, and let them be struck by the argument of our Savior's joy for their own confusion. But they can be struck, yet they refuse to cease from their blasphemies. Already the world has received the Salvation of God, all flesh has seen, the Jew does not believe, because, as I said, he awaits a Savior who is not God. Therefore let them hear the curse of the prophet saying: Cursed is the man who trusts in man, and whose heart departs from the Lord (Jer. 17:5). The Jews trust in a man, who refuse to believe in the Redeemer, while they await the Antichrist at the end of the world. For their confusion the Psalmist proclaims, saying: All the ends of the earth have seen the Salvation of God (Ps. 97:3). As if he confounds the faithlessness of the Jews saying: Why do you defer visions to the future? He whom you await has already come, he whom you held as promised has already appeared to all the ends of the earth; when you closed your eyes, he passed by; indeed you have become so blind that such great light stood before you, and you did not see. Therefore, shout joyfully to the Lord all the earth, sing, and exult, and make melody; make melody to our God on the harp, and with the voice of psalm, with trumpets of beaten metal, and with the sound of the horn trumpet. Shout joyfully in the presence of the Lord the King; let the sea be moved and its fullness, the world, and all who dwell in it. The rivers shall clap their hands together, the mountains shall exult before the face of the Lord, because he comes, because he comes to judge the earth (Ibid. 4, seq.). As if to say: Because they are pressed by such immense blindness that they did not deserve to see, you who have seen, rejoice more abundantly. But how wonderfully and ineffably one ought to rejoice, heaping up signs of joy, he says: Shout joyfully, sing, and make melody. Also desiring to convey the celebration of gladness, enumerating its instruments, he says: Make melody to the Lord on the harp, and harp, and with the voice of psalm, with trumpets of beaten metal and with the sound of the horn trumpet, shout joyfully in the presence of the Lord the King. What does "in the presence of the King" mean, except in the knowledge of the Redeemer? But he explains by how many this solemnity of joys is to be performed, saying: Let the sea be moved, and its fullness, the world, and all who dwell in it. O unhappy Judea, the ends of the earth have seen the Salvation of God, all the earth moved shouts joyfully, the whole world rejoices, the rivers clap with their hands, the mountains exult; but the impious hearts of the Jews do not believe, and in the darkness of their blindness they are struck with the punishment of envy. But him whom they do not fear to blaspheme, holy Church more attentively commends.

1. In the previous book, while we were discussing the text of sacred history in a moral sense, we placed Anna's fruitfulness in the perfection of the highest contemplation, because for the mind to conceive is to rejoice ineffably in the contemplation of the supreme omnipotence of God, while to give birth is to be unable to conceal the marks of the charity conceived in the mind. Now, what does it mean for her who gives birth to sing a canticle, if not to proclaim with true praises the Creator whom she loves ineffably? She says therefore: My heart has exulted in the Lord.

2. But she who ate and drank, who had a bitter spirit, who wept abundantly, who made a vow—because that mind can worthily praise almighty God which has arrived at the heights of His love through worthy struggles—she indeed learned through long practice to despise all things; and while she casts aside all created things from her attention, she rejoices all the more in the vision of eternal majesty, inasmuch as no appearance of any creature prevails to hold her back in love of itself. She therefore says: "My heart has exulted in the Lord," she who, despising all things, loves Him alone. He had indeed come to this same affection who said: "What remains for me in heaven, and what have I desired from you upon the earth?" (Ps. 72:25). Hence, exulting in God, she says: "Your face, your face, O Lord, I will seek" (Ps. 26:3). Hence the bride in the Canticles asks, saying: "Let him kiss me with the kiss of his mouth" (Cant. 1:1). Therefore when she says, "My heart has exulted in the Lord," what else does she glory in than that she has clung to the kisses of Him whom she ardently loves? And for this reason she alone says these things, who knows from experience what the power of love is in the bridegroom's chamber. For illuminated by victories over all passions and raised to the summit of virtues, she arrived at that height from which, through the joy of wondrous devotion and exultation, she placed her heart in God. And because she says "my heart," what else has she declared than the freedom of her mind? The reprobate indeed do not have their own hearts, because the devil possesses them. Whence it is also said of the traitor: "When the devil had already put it into the heart of Judas, son of Simon Iscariot, to betray him" (John 13:2). For if Judas, and not the devil, possessed his heart, he himself would rather have placed good in it than the devil evil. On the contrary, the chosen man speaks, saying: "I carry my soul in my hands" (Job 13:14). For what else is the hand of the elect but the power of inner freedom? What then is it for him to carry his soul in his hands, but to retain the glory of inner freedom in his power? Therefore, as often as we gravely sin, we do not have our own heart. Wherefore Jeremiah also, reproaching the Jewish people for sinning gravely, says: "Hear, O foolish people, you who have no heart" (Jer. 5:21). Hence likewise another prophet, turning back, confesses to God, saying: "Your servant has found his heart" (2 Kings 7:27). She therefore says: "My heart has exulted in the Lord," to declare the freedom of mind without which she could not worthily praise God.

3. By the horn, the intention of the elect mind is designated, which is wonderfully exalted when it arrives rejoicing at him who stands above all things. Hence she declares that her horn is exalted not in anything else, but in God. For whoever loves passing goods, his intention is assuredly lowered, not exalted, because it is fixed in the depths where it is placed by desire. Hence it is that the Lord says in the Gospel: Where your treasure is, there is your heart also (Matt. 6:21; Luke 12:34). Therefore the Lord wished to exalt our horn when he said: Lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven (Matt. 6:20, 33). Those to whom Paul conformed himself had an exalted horn, when he said: Our conversation is in heaven (Phil. 3:20). But whoever loves only heavenly things, if he has not known how to taste that sweetness of intimate delight, although he may be greatly exalted, he has not yet reached the height of this exaltation. He, therefore, is sublime with this exaltation who, advancing through the increase of virtues, has attained the height of supreme contemplation—not only so as to love heavenly things perfectly, but also so as to rest, in the perfection of love, in the contemplation of almighty God alone. He has his horn exalted in God who enjoys the lofty vision of the interior light, in which he glories with a certain familiar singularity. Wherefore she does not say, "In our God," but "in my God." For she says "my" of him whom she loves familiarly and singularly. To which dignity of divine familiarity he had certainly arrived who said: You are my God, and I will give thanks to you; you are my God, and I will exalt you (Ps. 117:28). Hence Isaiah says, rebuking the unbelieving: Is it a small thing for you to be troublesome to men, that you are troublesome also to my God (Isa. 7:13)? She, therefore, who is raised up by the exaltation of her horn in God, singularly proclaims him her God, because that supreme infusion of divine sweetness makes the exalted mind both receptive of itself and deeply familiar.

4. Who are the enemies of the elect mind, if not evil spirits? What then is it to have a widened mouth over one's enemies, if not to reject all the persuasions of evil spirits by the most ample bounty of grace poured into oneself? For he has a narrow mouth who cannot prevail against all the deceits of evil spirits through the consideration of reason. For the mouth of the mind is reason, and to speak is to deliberate. For the mouth is filled when the reason of the mind is raised up through grace poured into it to the contemplation of the highest truth. Indeed, for it to be filled is to be imbued with the illumination of the highest truth. There it learns both what to desire eternally and what to despise temporally. And because the highest truth is love, the elect soul is raised up by the subtlety of truth and is inflamed with love for that thing which it has learned, and it keeps the teaching all the more strictly, the more fervently the force of love embeds it within itself. To this soul, even if evil spirits suggest evil things, they are confounded by the opening of its widened mouth, because, instructed by the truth of the highest wisdom and kindled by the torches of the highest love, it now possesses against the suggestion of error the immense light of wisdom, and possesses against the offered pomp of this world an ineffable love. In the immensity of light it sees what to reject, and through the force of the highest love it delights in rejecting the unworthy things which it knows. Through wisdom it rebukes the evil things suggested, and in the power of love it refutes the things it has detected. Therefore it widens its mouth over its enemies, because from the abundance of reason it deliberates many things against the demons, and it destroys their objections all the more keenly because it recognizes in lofty things that by which it may reject evil suggestions. Whence, immediately intimating the cause, she says: "Because I have rejoiced in your salvation."

5. Which is indeed as if she were saying: Because my horn is exalted in my God. This certainly is to rejoice in the salvation of God, namely to have one's horn exalted in one's God. This is not understood of just any joy of salvation, but of that most perfect joy by which the chosen and perfected soul, in the manner of a bride, rejoices in the bridegroom. Concerning which joy David entreats, saying: Restore to me the joy of your salvation, and strengthen me with a princely spirit (Psalm 50:14). She, therefore, who glories in having her mouth opened wide over her enemies, is described as having first rejoiced in the salvation of God, because that blessed mind will be able to powerfully reject the persuasions of malignant spirits, which, having been sublimely raised up through contemplation into the divinity of the Redeemer, receives from Him both the greatness of wisdom and the fullness of charity.
