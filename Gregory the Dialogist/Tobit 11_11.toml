Michael indeed means "Who is like God"; Gabriel, "the strength of God"; and Raphael is called "the medicine of God." Raphael also, as we said, is interpreted as the medicine of God, because when he touched the eyes of Tobias as if through the office of healing, he wiped away the darkness of his blindness. He therefore who is sent to heal was fittingly called the medicine of God.
