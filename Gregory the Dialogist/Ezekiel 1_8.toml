"And the hand of a man under their wings on four sides." The four parts can be understood in this place as the four regions of the world, namely East, West, South, and North, because the preaching of the saints has gone forth by God's authority into all parts of the world.

We can also understand by the four principal parts the four virtues from which the remaining virtues arise, namely prudence, fortitude, justice, and temperance. We truly receive these virtues when we maintain their order. For prudence is first, fortitude second, justice third, and temperance fourth. For what good can prudence do if fortitude is lacking? For to know what one cannot do is more a torment than a virtue. But he who prudently understands what he should do, and bravely does what he has understood, is without doubt already just; yet temperance ought to follow his justice, because justice very often falls into cruelty if it lacks moderation. Therefore that justice is truly justice which governs itself with the restraint of temperance, so that in the zeal with which one burns, he may also be temperate; lest if he burns too intensely, he lose the justice whose limits he does not know how to maintain.

There are two lives of holy preachers, namely active and contemplative; but the active is prior in time to the contemplative, because through good work one strives toward contemplation. The contemplative, however, is greater in merit than the active, because the latter labors in the practice of present work, while the former already tastes the coming rest with an inner savor. What therefore is signified by hands if not the active life, and what by wings if not the contemplative life? The hand of a man is therefore under their wings, that is, the power of work is under the flight of contemplation. This is well represented in the Gospel by those two women, namely Martha and Mary. For Martha was busy about frequent service; but Mary sat at the Lord's feet and listened to his words. Therefore one was intent on work, the other on contemplation. One served the active life through external ministry, the other the contemplative through the suspension of her heart upon the word. And although the active life is good, the contemplative is nevertheless better, because the former fails with mortal life, while the latter grows more fully in immortal life. Hence it is said: Mary has chosen the best part, which shall not be taken from her. Since therefore the active is lesser in merit than the contemplative, it is rightly now said: The hand of a man under their wings. For even if through the active life we do something good, yet through the contemplative we fly toward heavenly desire. Hence also in Moses the active is called servitude, but the contemplative freedom.

And since both lives are from the gift of grace, nevertheless as long as we live among our neighbors, one is for us a matter of necessity, the other of will. For who, knowing God, enters into His kingdom unless he first does good works? Therefore, without the contemplative life those can enter the heavenly homeland who do not neglect the good works they are able to perform; but without the active life they cannot enter if they neglect to do the good works they can. The former, therefore, is a matter of necessity, the latter of will. The former is in servitude, the latter in freedom. Hence it is said to Moses: If you buy a Hebrew servant, he shall serve you for six years, and in the seventh he shall go out free without payment. With whatever garment he entered, with such let him go out. If he has a wife, let his wife also go out with him. But if his master has given him a wife, and she has borne sons and daughters, the woman and her children shall belong to his master, but he himself shall go out with his clothing. But if the servant says, I love my master and my wife and children, I will not go out free, his master shall bring him to the gods, and he shall be brought to the door and the posts, and his master shall pierce his ear with an awl, and he shall be his servant forever. We have given this testimony at somewhat greater length in order to show the distinction between servitude and freedom in both lives. But it should not be burdensome if we pursue this in exposition, so that we may confirm those very things which we have said.

For "Hebrew" is interpreted as "one who crosses over." And a Hebrew servant is purchased when anyone who now crosses over from this world in mind is subjected to the service of the Almighty Lord. For he desires to serve the true God who has learned to cross over from this world in mind. Thus Moses crossed over, that he might see the vision. Thus David, when he saw the wicked exalted and lifted up above the cedars of Lebanon, crossed over, and behold, he was not. Because we perhaps believe the powers of the wicked to be something great, unless we cross over in mind to the enduring age. But the Hebrew servant who has been purchased is commanded to serve for six years, so that in the seventh he may go out free without payment. For what is designated by the number six except the perfection of the active life? What is expressed by the number seven except the contemplative life? Therefore he serves for six years, and in the seventh goes out free, because he who through the active life which he has perfectly fulfilled passes over to the freedom of the contemplative life. And it should be noted that he goes out free without payment, because those who after they have done everything say they are unprofitable servants, for them without doubt, just as the active life itself was from a gift, so also the contemplative will be from grace. With whatever garment he entered, with such let him go out, because it is altogether necessary that each one of us persevere in that which he begins, and continue until the end of the work in the intention with which he began. For he crosses over well to the contemplative life who in the active life has not changed the garment of his intention for the worse. And there are some who before they are joined to the service of Almighty God in holy conduct already love to do good works. But there are others who learn good works after they have come to the service of Almighty God. Therefore he who strove to have good works even before he came to God's service, is a Hebrew servant purchased with a wife.

And generally he who is such can pass over to the contemplative life, and yet not abandon the active life. Hence it is also added there: "If he has a wife, and the wife goes out together with him." For the wife goes out with him to freedom when he who has attained contemplation does not abandon outwardly the action of good work by which he can benefit others. But if the Lord has given him a wife, and she has borne sons and daughters, the woman and her children shall belong to his master, but he himself shall go out with his clothing. The master gives a wife to the purchased servant when any preacher joins to good action him whom he has bound to the authority of almighty God. For preachers are also called masters, as it is said to Elisha the prophet concerning his preacher: "Do you know that your master will be taken from you?" And the wife of the purchased servant bears sons and daughters when good action produces strong or tender fruits. But the woman who was given by the master remains with the same master along with her children, while the servant himself goes out with his clothing, because good action, or the fruits of that same good action, are reckoned to the reward of the preacher. But he himself, persevering in the intention of his desire, goes out free to contemplation through heavenly grace. "But if the servant says, 'I love my master, and my wife and children; I will not go out free.'" The servant loves his master when he guards the words of the preacher with a careful mind. Also loving his wife and children, he refuses to go out free when, loving the active life and its fruits, he does not wish to pass over to the contemplative life, because considering that he has good works in the service of his ministry, he refuses to withdraw to the quiet of freedom. But let his master offer him to the gods, and let him be brought to the door and the posts, and let him pierce his ear with an awl, that he may be his servant forever. For he who has resolved to remain in the active life is offered by his master to the gods when he is instructed by his preacher in the sayings of the ancient fathers, who were priests for us in the way of the almighty Lord. And he is led to the door and posts of the tabernacle so that he may hear something more profound about the entrance to the heavenly dwelling, and may subtly recognize the day of the fearful judgment, lest through the good works which he does he seek to please men. And so his ear is pierced with an awl when his mind is struck by the subtlety of the fear of God, so that, transfixed by the sharpness of the word, through everything he does he may know to always attend to the entrance of the kingdom, and as it were to carry an ear pierced from the door and post of the tabernacle.

He will be a servant in this age, so that he may be able to be free after this age. For he is a servant in this age who has resolved through the active life to serve men, so that after the present age he may be able to attain true freedom. Concerning this it is said through Paul: "Because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God." For then there will be true freedom in us, when our adoption shall have attained to the glory of the children of God. But now not only is the active life in servitude, but even contemplation itself, by which we are caught up above ourselves, does not yet perfectly obtain freedom of mind, but imitates it, because that inward rest is seen in a mirror dimly. Yet however great may be the limitation of contemplation, it is already far broader and more sublime than the active life, since it passes over to a certain freedom of mind, thinking not on temporal things but on eternal. Since therefore the contemplative life flies up to higher things and far surpasses the active life by a certain, so to speak, dignity of its security, it is fittingly said now: "And the hand of a man was under their wings."

But if in this place our Redeemer is understood as the man, the hand of the man is under their wings, because unless God had become man, who raised the minds of the preachers to heavenly things, those living creatures that appear would not fly. Nor is it unfittingly said that the hand of the man is under the wings, because of this same Redeemer of ours it is written: "Who being the brightness of glory and the figure of His substance, and upholding all things." His hand therefore carries our hearts, His hand raises us up in contemplation. For unless, as has been said, the almighty Word had become man for the sake of men, human hearts would not fly to contemplate the excellence of the Word. Therefore the minds of men have been made lofty from the same source whence the humble God appeared among men. Let it therefore be said of the holy living creatures, let it be said: "And the hand of a man under their wings."
