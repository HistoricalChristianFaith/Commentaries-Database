There is a story well regarded and handed down to us by the account of our elders. A certain father of a household served with great zeal for hospitality along with his whole house; and while he received strangers at his table daily, one day a certain stranger came among others and was led to the table. And while the father of the household, from his custom of humility, wished to pour water on his hands, he turned and took the pitcher, but suddenly did not find the one on whose hands he had wished to pour water. And while he marveled at this occurrence to himself, that same night the Lord said to him through a vision: "On other days you received me in my members, but yesterday you received me in myself." Behold, coming to judgment, He will say: "What you did for one of my least ones, you did for me." Behold, before the judgment, when He is received through His members, He also visits His hosts through Himself; and yet we are sluggish toward the grace of hospitality. Consider, brothers, how great is the virtue of hospitality. Receive Christ at your tables, that you may be worthy to be received by Him at the eternal banquet. Offer now hospitality to Christ the stranger, that He may not disregard you as strangers at the judgment, but may receive you as His own into the kingdom.

But because examples rather than words more often stir the hearts of listeners to the love of God and neighbor, I am eager to relate to your charity what my son Epiphanius the deacon, who is present here, born in the province of Isauria, is accustomed to tell as a miracle that occurred in the neighboring land of Lycaonia. For he says that there was a certain monk named Martyrius, a man of very venerable life, who was traveling from his own monastery to visit another monastery over which a spiritual father presided. And so as he went on his way, he found a leper whom the elephantine disease had disfigured throughout his limbs with dense wounds, wanting to return to his lodging but unable to do so because of weariness. And this man said that he had his lodging on that very road where the same monk Martyrius was hastening to go. But the man of God, having pity on the weariness of this leper, immediately threw down and spread out on the ground the cloak with which he was clothed, and placed the leper upon it, and lifting him up wrapped all around in his cloak upon his shoulder, he carried him back with him. And when he was now approaching the doors of the monastery, the spiritual father of that monastery began to cry out with a loud voice: "Run, open the doors of the monastery quickly, because brother Martyrius is coming carrying the Lord." But immediately when Martyrius reached the entrance of the monastery, he who was thought to be a leper leaped from his neck, and appearing in that form in which the Redeemer of the human race is accustomed to be recognized by men, God and man Christ Jesus, he returned to heaven while Martyrius watched, and ascending he said to him: "Martyrius, you were not ashamed of me on earth; I will not be ashamed of you in heaven." And when this holy man had just entered the monastery, the father of the monastery said to him: "Brother Martyrius, where is he whom you were carrying?" To which he replied, saying: "If I had known who he was, I would have held his feet." Then the same Martyrius related that when he had carried him, he had not felt his weight at all. Nor is this surprising; for how could he feel weight, when he who was being carried was himself carrying the one who bore him?

In this matter we must consider how much fraternal compassion avails, how much the bowels of mercy join us to almighty God. For we draw near to him who is above all things precisely when we lower ourselves even beneath ourselves through compassion for our neighbor. In bodily matters, no one touches high things unless he stretches upward; but in spiritual matters it is certain that the more we are drawn down through compassion, the more truly we approach the heights. But behold, for our edification it is not enough for the Redeemer of the human race that he declared he would say at the last judgment: "Inasmuch as you did it to one of the least of these my brethren, you did it to me," unless he also showed in himself before the judgment what he had said; so that he might demonstrate that whoever now renders good works to the needy renders them especially to him for whose love he renders them. And the more anyone receives a greater reward, the more he does not despise even him who seems most deserving of contempt. For what in human flesh is more sublime than the flesh of Christ, which is exalted above the angels? And what in human flesh is more abject than the flesh of a leper, which is torn apart by swelling wounds and filled with exhaling stenches? But behold, he appeared in the form of a leper; and he who is to be revered above all things did not disdain to be seen as despised below all things. Why this, except to admonish us who are slower of understanding, that whoever hastens to stand before him who is in heaven should not refuse to be humbled on earth and to suffer with even the abject and despicable brethren?

But you, brothers, knowing both the rest of Lazarus and the punishment of the rich man, act diligently, seek intercessors for your sins, and secure the poor as advocates for yourselves on the day of judgment. For you now have many Lazaruses; they lie before your doors, and they need what falls daily from your table while you are already satisfied. The words of sacred scripture ought to instruct us to fulfill the commands of piety. Every day, if we seek Lazarus, we find him; every day, even if we do not seek him, we see Lazarus. Behold, the poor present themselves persistently, they ask of us, who will then come as intercessors for us. Certainly we ought to have asked them entirely, yet we are the ones being asked. Consider whether we ought to refuse what is requested of us, when those who ask are our patrons.

Therefore do not waste the times for mercy, do not neglect the remedies you have received. Before punishment, think about punishment. When you look upon any who are lowly in this world, even if some things of theirs seem reprehensible, do not despise them, because perhaps those whom weakness of character wounds, the medicine of poverty heals. If there are any such things of theirs that ought rightly to be reproved, turn these, if you wish, to the use of your own reward, so that from their very faults the increase of your piety may be accumulated, inasmuch as you give both bread and word equally, the bread of refreshment with the word of correction; and let those who sought one thing receive two forms of nourishment from you, while they are satisfied both outwardly with food and inwardly with discourse.

Therefore when a poor person is seen to be blameworthy, he ought to be admonished, not despised. But if he has nothing deserving of reproof, he ought to be greatly venerated as an intercessor. But behold, we see many people, and we do not know what merit each one has. Therefore all are to be venerated, and it is necessary that you humble yourself before all, the more so because you do not know which of them is Christ.

Learn therefore, brothers, to despise all temporal things; learn to scorn passing honor, to love eternal glory. Honor those whom you see as poor, and those whom you observe outwardly as despised by the world, consider them inwardly as friends of God. Share with them what you have, so that one day they may deign to share with you what they have. Consider what is said by the mouth of the teacher of the nations: "In this time let your abundance supply their want, that their abundance also may be a supplement to your want." Consider what Truth itself says in person: "As long as you did it to one of these my least brethren, you did it to me." Why are you slow to give, when what you extend to one lying on earth you give to him who sits in heaven?
