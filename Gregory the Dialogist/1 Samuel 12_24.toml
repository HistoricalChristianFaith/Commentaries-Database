Whence Samuel also well explains this same way, saying: "Therefore fear the Lord, and serve Him in truth, and with your whole heart."

17. This way is indeed good and right: because it leads to eternal life and arrives there swiftly. Through the fear of the Lord, evils are avoided; by serving him, his commandments are fulfilled. We truly serve him in truth when we carry out his precepts for the sake of heavenly reward alone. For whoever seeks a temporal reward for a good work does not truly serve God, whom he does not love in his work because of a false intention. But those who desire to serve God in truth are commanded to place their whole heart in divine service, so that they may carry out the things of God in such a way that they retain nothing in their mind that is contrary to God. This way is assuredly not only good but right: because it leads to salvation and swiftly brings its follower to perfection. For it is shown as another way to the promised land — good, because it leads there; right, because it avoids detours. Through this way, each person arrives at the summit of virtues all the better, the less he turns aside through circuits of negligence. This right way is expressed in that way by which the Lord is said to have wished to lead the children of Israel to the promised land. He wished to entrust the labors of the desert to them, so that for us who walk in the footsteps of his Only-Begotten, he might smooth the course of so great a journey. For they could not yet hear: "If you wish to be perfect, sell what you have and give to the poor, and follow me; and you will have treasure in heaven" (Matt. 19:21). For while the ancient people ran about through various things with license over temporal possessions, they could not, as it were, be led quickly to the promised land through the circuit of toil. Therefore, so that the prophet might introduce to us the way of the new life, he says that the way is good and right: to fear God and to serve him in truth and with the whole heart — because those who do not cease to seek the almighty God both through good works and through fervent desires quickly arrive at the height of divine grace. And because he had made that same people attentive to hearing the words of his preaching through a miracle, he adds: "For you have seen the magnificent things that the Lord has done among you."

18. As if he were saying: From those things which you have seen, gather how terribly you ought to fear almighty God, and how devoutly you ought always to serve Him. Which words indeed, if we wish to apply them to ourselves, we must fear God all the more reverently and serve Him all the more devoutly, the more wonderful things we have perceived in our Redeemer.
