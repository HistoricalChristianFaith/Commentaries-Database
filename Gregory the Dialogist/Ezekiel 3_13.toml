"And the sound of the wings of the living creatures striking one against another."

The prophet hears behind him the sound of a great commotion, because, as has been said, the word of those preaching is followed by the lamentation of the penitent. He hears behind him the sound of the wings of the living creatures, because from that very lamentation of the penitent arise the virtues of the saints, so that they advance all the more in holy action, the more they remember having acted wickedly before their knowledge of life. But there is great uncertainty in these words, because it is not clearly stated by the prophet whether each living creature strikes its wings against itself, or whether these same holy living creatures beat one another in turn with their wings, so that the wing of one touches another, and the wing of another touches this living creature.

But because often in sacred Scripture something is said obscurely so that, by God's wonderful dispensation, it may be explained in many ways, we ought by the Lord's gift to explain both meanings to your charity. We have already often said that the wings of the living creatures are the virtues of the saints. How then does each living creature, spreading its wings, strike one wing against another, unless it is openly given to understand that, if we become holy living creatures, virtue in us stirs up virtue, while one strikes against another toward perfection? For behold, someone already has knowledge of the word of God; he learns to have also bowels of mercy. For through knowledge of the word of God he learns: "Give alms, and behold, all things are clean to you." And when he has begun to be merciful in almsgiving, he reads the words of holy authority; and whatever is said in them about mercy, he understands more deeply through experience. For there it is written: "I was a father to the poor." Perhaps before he read this and passed it by. But when mercy has begun in his heart to imitate nature, he reads and recognizes what it means to be a father to the poor, because returning inward, he understands in himself what he hears outwardly. For it is one thing to give alms from precept, and another from charity. To do good from precept belongs to beginners; but to do good from charity belongs to the perfect, who not only act because it is commanded, but also love what they do in fulfilling the command. Hence it is that it is said with great virtue through the Psalmist: "See that I have loved your commandments, O Lord; in your mercy give me life." For to fulfill God's commandments for the sake of the command belongs to one who serves and obeys, but to fulfill them lovingly belongs to one who obeys and loves. Therefore, because mercy is learned through knowledge of charity, and knowledge is multiplied through the charity of mercy in a contrite heart, wing strikes wing in us, because virtue stirs up virtue. So one who guards the good of chastity in his body is kindled with zeal against the lustful, that they may be cleansed from the stains of impurity. And often when he finds some in their falls, he subdues, afflicts, and restrains them to the purity of chastity. If perhaps his mind has been tempted by the impurity of lust, from that very zeal by which he corrected others he convicts himself, and is ashamed to think impure things which he recalls having corrected in others. In this, therefore, wing strikes wing, while virtue strikes virtue and guards against impurity.

But if, as we have said, the living creatures in turn strike one another with their wings, and the wing of each strikes against the wing of another, the meaning of this description also lies open, with the Lord's help. What does it mean, then, that these winged creatures in turn strike their wings one against another, except that all the saints mutually touch one another with their virtues, and rouse each other to advancement through the consideration of another's virtue? For all things are not given to one person, lest being lifted up in pride he should fall, but to this one is given what is not given to you, and to you is given what is denied to him, so that while the former considers the good that you have and he does not have, he may set you before himself in his thought; and again, while you observe that he possesses what you yourself do not have, you may place yourself after him in your thought, and so it comes about as it is written: "Considering one another as superiors." For to speak briefly of a few things out of many: to this one is granted the virtue of marvelous abstinence, and yet he does not have the word of knowledge. To that one, however, is given the word of knowledge; and yet he strives to attain the virtue of perfect abstinence, and cannot. To this one is granted freedom of speech, so that, providing the consolation of protection to all who are oppressed, he may speak freely in defense of justice; but yet, still possessing many things in this world, he wishes to leave all, and cannot. To that one, indeed, it has already been given to leave all earthly things, so that he desires to have nothing in this world; but yet he does not presume to exercise authority of speech against any who are sinning. And he who therefore ought to speak more freely, because he no longer has anything by which he might be held to the world, refuses to speak freely against others, lest he lose that very tranquility of his life. To this one the virtue of prophecy has been given; he already foresees many things that are to come; but yet, seeing and compassionating the sickness of his neighbor in the present, he is unable to cure it. To that one the grace of healing has been given, and by his prayers he drives away from a neighbor's body the affliction that is present; but yet he does not know what will follow him a little later. By a wondrous dispensation, therefore, almighty God so distributes His gifts among His elect that He gives to one what He denies to another, and grants more to one what He grants less to another, so that while either this one observes that the other has what he himself does not have, or that one considers that this one has received more what he thinks is less present to himself, all may admire the gifts of God in one another, that is, in turn; and from this very admiration one may be humbled before another, and may think that he whom he sees to have what he does not have has been placed before him by divine judgment. Therefore, the living creatures in turn strike one another with their wings when holy minds touch each other with alternating virtues, and by touching rouse one another, and once roused, fly toward advancement.

Let us see how Paul was touched by the wings of the apostles and stirred to repentance. Considering the evils of his past persecution and the innocent life of the apostles, he said: "For I am the least of the apostles, who am not worthy to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the Church of God." He considered indeed the innocence of the apostles, and because of his preceding wickedness, all the care he showed in the Church became worthless in his eyes; and he did not consider how many he surpassed by the understanding he had received, because, weighing their innocence, he grieved that he had once been a persecutor. But let us see if any of the apostles marvels at the understanding given to Paul. We must first consult the chief of the apostles himself, who, admonishing his disciples, says: "As also our most beloved brother Paul, according to the wisdom given to him, has written to you; as in all his epistles, speaking in them of these things, in which there are certain things hard to understand, which the unlearned and unstable distort." Therefore Paul marvels at the innocence in all the apostles, and the chief of the apostles marvels at the wisdom in Paul. They therefore touch each other with their wings, mutually stirring one another to progress by that whereby they fly.

Therefore, Almighty God works in the hearts of men what He does in the regions of the earth. For He could have bestowed all fruits upon any single region; but if any one region did not need the fruits of another region, it would have had no communion with the other. Hence it happens that He grants to one an abundance of wine, to another an abundance of oil; He makes one abound in a multitude of flocks, another in a richness of crops, so that when one brings what the other does not have, and the other returns what the first did not bring, through the communion of grace the divided lands may be joined together as one. Therefore, just as the regions of the earth, so are the minds of the saints, who, while they mutually share with one another what they have received, as it were bestow their fruits as regions upon regions, so that all may be joined together in one charity.

But amid these things it must be known that just as all the elect always observe in others what they have received better from God than themselves, so that they may prefer them to themselves in thought and lay themselves beneath them in humility, so the mind of the reprobate never considers what good another has more than itself, but what good itself has more than another. For they do not weigh what good things of the spirit another has received that they themselves lack, but what good things they have and what evils are present in another. And while almighty God distributes virtues to individuals for this purpose, that He may humble one to another in thought, the reprobate drag down the good they have received to this end, that they may be destroyed by it through pride, since they always consider the good things that they have and others do not have, and never take care to weigh how many good things others have that they themselves do not have. Therefore what divine mercy arranges for the increase of humility, reprobate minds turn to the increase of pride; and from the diversity of gifts they fall away from good, whence they ought to have grown in the good of humility.

Therefore, for this reason, dearest brothers, it is necessary that you should always look upon what you have less of in yourselves, but in your neighbors look upon what they have received more than you, so that while you look upon them as above yourselves because of the good which they have and you do not have, you too may grow through humility to obtain this as well. For if you weigh the good things received in them, and they consider in you the gifts which you have, you touch one another with wings in turn, so that being stirred up you may always fly toward heavenly things.

"And the sound of the wheels following the living creatures, and the sound of a great commotion."

We said above that the Testaments are signified by the wheels of sacred Scripture. The voice of the wheels, therefore, is the word of the Testaments. Thus after the voice of the wings of the living creatures, the voice of the wheels is also heard, because when the preaching of the preachers is received, while the virtues of the saints fly upward to accomplish higher things and mutually urge one another toward advancement, the state of the holy Church is raised up, so that throughout the whole world the pages of the sacred Testaments may be read. For everywhere now the holy Gospel resounds, everywhere the words of the apostles, everywhere the law and the prophets. Therefore the voice of the wheels follows after the voice of the wings, because after the miracles of the saints, the words of sacred Scripture are freely and openly heard within the holy Church. The wheels follow the living creatures, because, as was said above, after the life of the saints came into honor, the words of the Testaments also appeared venerable to men.

Or certainly the living creatures follow, because in the life of the holy Fathers we recognize what we ought to understand in the volume of sacred Scripture. For their action opens to us what the page of the Testaments says in its proclamations. But we must ask why, after it was said above, "I heard behind me the voice of a great commotion," after the voice of the wings and wheels there is added: "And the voice of a great commotion." If this is carefully examined, it can be found that it is not repeated idly.

For indeed there are two great commotions by which our hearts are stirred. One commotion is from fear, the other from love; one arises from the grief of the penitent, the other from the fervor of those who love. After the word of preaching, therefore, the first commotion occurs when we bewail the evils we have done; but after the sound of the wings and wheels, there is a second commotion, when with great weeping we seek the heavenly goods that we hear about. For behold, because within holy Church we learn examples of virtues from many Fathers, we hear as it were the sound of wings daily; because sacred utterances resound everywhere, we are aroused as if by the voices of wheels. And because through these same sacred utterances we are kindled to love of our Creator, burning with the fires of great fervor, we lament that we are still far from the face of almighty God. After the first sound of great commotion, therefore, at the end there also comes a sound of great commotion, because we who by knowing God began to bewail our sins, now loving him whom we have known, do not cease to desire him with weeping. After the sound of the wheels, therefore, follows the sound of great commotion, because when the Testaments of God have begun to sound in the ear of the heart, the spirit of those who hear, pierced with compunction from love, is moved to lamentation. For this is why the words of sacred Scripture become savory in the heart of readers; this is why they are often read by those who love them in silence, as it were secretly and quietly. Whence it is also said through another prophet: "You have cut off in alienation the heads of the mighty; nations shall be moved in it; they shall open their mouths like a poor man eating in secret." For almighty God has cut off the heads of the mighty in alienation, because he repelled the pride of the Jews by alienating them from himself. In which alienation the nations were moved, because while the Jews fell from the faith, the hearts of the Gentiles ran to the knowledge of faith. These nations indeed open the mouth of the heart in the nourishment of sacred reading, and eat in secret like a poor man, because with haste and silence they take in the words of life as they read.
