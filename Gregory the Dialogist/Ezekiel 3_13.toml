Why is it that these winged creatures beat their wings in turn one to another? It is because all the saints by turns touch themselves with their virtues and rouse themselves to make progress through considering one another’s virtue. For all things are not given to one person lest he fall through being puffed up with pride. But to this individual is given what is not given to you, and to you is given what is denied to that person, so that while that one considers the good that you have and he has not, he sets you before himself in his thoughts; and again, whereas you see that that one has what you have not, you set yourself behind him in your thoughts, and what is written is come to pass: “In humility count others better than yourselves.”

The noise of the wheels is the speech of the Testaments. Then the noise of the wheels is heard after the noise of the sacred creatures’ wings because, after the speech of the preachers has been received, when the virtues of the saints fly up to pursue higher things and encourage each other on to progress, the posture of holy church is raised up, and the pages of the sacred Testaments are read throughout the world.

There are two movements through which our hearts are moved. One movement is from fear, the other from charity; the one results from the lamentations of the penitent, the other from the fervor of those who love. Therefore the first movement happens after the word of preaching, when we bewail the sins that we have committed; after the noise of the wings and the wheels, there is the second movement, when with much weeping we seek the heavenly blessings of which we hear.
