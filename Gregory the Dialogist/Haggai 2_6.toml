In truth he comes, who shakes the elements by his coming, in whose sight heaven and earth tremble. Hence the prophet says, “There is still a little while, and I will move not only the earth but also the sky.” He will bring the whole human race to his examination; angels, archangels, thrones, principalities and dominations will obey him, for the punishment of evil and the recompense of the good. Consider, dearly beloved, what terror there will be on that day at the sight of so great a judge. There will be no relief from punishment then. What a shame we will feel in the sight of all human beings and angels because of our own guilt! How we will fear when we see him angry, whom the human mind cannot comprehend even when he is peaceful!
