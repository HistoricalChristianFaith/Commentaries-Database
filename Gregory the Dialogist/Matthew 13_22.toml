It should be noted that the Lord, in His explanation, says that cares, pleasures, and riches choke the word. For they choke it because by their importunate thoughts they strangle the throat of the mind; and since they do not allow good desire to enter the heart, they kill, as it were, the passage of the breath of life. It should also be noted that He joins two things with riches, namely cares and pleasures, because indeed they both oppress the mind through anxiety and dissolve it through abundance. For by their contrary nature they make their possessors both afflicted and unstable. But since pleasure cannot coexist with affliction, at one time they afflict through the anxiety of guarding them, and at another time they soften toward pleasures through abundance.
