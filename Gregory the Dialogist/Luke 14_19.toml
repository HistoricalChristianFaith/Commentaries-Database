Another said: I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I go to test them; I pray you, have me excused. What do we understand by the five yoke of oxen except the five senses of the body? These are also rightly called yokes, because they are doubled in each sex. These bodily senses, indeed, because they do not know how to comprehend internal things, but know only external ones, and, abandoning what is innermost, touch those things which are outside, rightly through them curiosity is designated. For while it seeks to examine the life of another, always ignorant of its own inner depths, it strives to think about external things. For the vice of curiosity is grievous, which while it leads anyone's mind outwardly to investigate the life of a neighbor, always hides from him his own inner depths, so that knowing the affairs of others, he does not know himself, and the mind of the curious person, the more skilled it becomes in another's merit, the more ignorant it becomes of its own. For this reason also it is said concerning these same five yoke of oxen: I go to test them; I pray you, have me excused. For the very words of the one making excuse do not differ from the signification of his vice when he says: I go to test them, because indeed testing sometimes tends to pertain to curiosity.

But it should be noted that both he who makes excuse from his inviter's supper on account of the farm and he who does so on account of testing the yoke of oxen mixes in words of humility, saying: I pray you, have me excused. For when he says I pray you, and yet disdains to come, humility sounds in the voice, pride in the action. And behold, every wicked person judges these things when he hears them, yet does not cease to do the things he judges. For when we say to anyone acting perversely: Be converted, follow God, abandon the world, where do we call him except to the Lord's supper? But when he responds: Pray for me, because I am a sinner, I cannot do this, what else does he do except both ask and make excuse? For saying: I am a sinner, he insinuates humility; but adding: I cannot be converted, he demonstrates pride. Therefore he makes excuse by asking, who both puts on humility in his voice and exercises pride in his action.
