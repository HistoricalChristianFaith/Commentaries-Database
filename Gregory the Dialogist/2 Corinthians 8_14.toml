Learn therefore, brothers, to despise all temporal things; learn to scorn passing honor, to love eternal glory. Honor those whom you see as poor, and those whom you observe outwardly as despised by the world, consider them inwardly as friends of God. Share with them what you have, so that one day they may deign to share with you what they have. Consider what is said by the mouth of the teacher of the nations: "In this time let your abundance supply their want, that their abundance also may be a supplement to your want." Consider what Truth itself says in person: "As long as you did it to one of these my least brethren, you did it to me." Why are you slow to give, when what you extend to one lying on earth you give to him who sits in heaven?
