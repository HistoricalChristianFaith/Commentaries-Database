But what they are in themselves and what they are to others, he sets forth, saying: 'And when they have greeted you, they will give you two loaves, and you shall receive them from their hand.' Holy men greet us when they announce to us the eternal goods of salvation. Those who greet us in the body incline their head to show reverence to the one greeted. But for spiritual men to incline the head is to bring down their mind from the highest contemplation. For if they do not incline the head, they cannot greet; because they do not instruct us with salutary teaching if they do not bring down their mind from the highest contemplation of heavenly things. For then they show us great reverence: because they do not consider those to be small for whose sake they deign to descend from their lofty summit.

10. But while the future king is greeted, two loaves of bread are given to him. For two loaves are given to the preacher being ordained, when he is taught to weep for sins not only his own, but those of others. He has, therefore, one twisted loaf when he is afflicted for his own sins; he has the other when he strives to lament the sins of his subjects. But the Psalmist, more clearly suggesting this bread, says: "Rise up after you have sat down, you who eat the bread of sorrow" (Psalm 126:2). Hence he confesses to the Lord, saying: "You will feed us with the bread of tears, and you will give us drink in tears with measure" (Psalm 79:9). The twisted loaf, therefore, is the bread of sorrow and the bread of tears. And perhaps for this reason that one man carried three twisted loaves: because there were three who were going together, so that when they divided them among themselves, each would have one loaf apiece. This can also fittingly be understood of the goats. In this matter, what is to be noted except that men of a more secluded life, while they maintain a solitary way of living, do not have care for others? They therefore have one goat and one loaf, who are pricked with compunction only for their own sins and are not burdened by those of others through pastoral office. And because those who are of the same perfect way of life emulate in themselves the affliction of the flesh, fittingly one carries three loaves, another three goats, and a third a flask of wine. For it is as though one carries what all are about to offer or eat; and all eat or offer what one carries, when each one, kindled by pious emulation of them, has in himself good examples for others and does not neglect to imitate the good things that others have. And because the twisted loaves of bread are spoken of in the feminine gender, this surely suggests that for him who is pricked with compunction by habit, from some tears still more tears arise. For the affliction of the penitent is, as it were, fruitful as in the feminine sex; because the more often one is pricked with compunction, the more abundant streams of tears are supplied to him. To Saul, therefore, not one loaf but two are given, because it is not enough for the preacher to weep for himself alone. Let him therefore receive two loaves from the hands of the men, so that he may learn to weep by the example of the perfect, but may recognize that weeping is necessary both for himself and for his subjects. And because by the hand power is sometimes understood, the men have three loaves in hand; because those who have advanced to the heights of contemplation possess weeping in the strength of their power. For because they do not wish to be dissolved in vain joy when they could be, they are rightly able to weep when they wish. We indeed, being weak and negligent of the guard of our mind, even when we wish to be moved to compunction and to weep for our sins, are unable to do so. For since spiritual tears are produced from a great fervor of the spirit, we who are bound by the cold of our negligence are prevented from quickly growing warm unto tears. Rightly, therefore, those who are said to appear to the future king at the oak of Tabor are said to have loaves in their hands; because those who are perfect in the contemplation of the secluded life possess what is profitable for their subjects through the observance of virtues.

11. And it should be noted that Samuel commands the anointed king, saying: "And you shall receive from their hand." What better meaning can be gathered from this phrase than what is plainly seen: namely, that we do not willingly imitate the affliction found in holy men? For those who seek the honor of prelacy and its dignity are innumerable, but those who desire the labor of ministry and the affliction of the flesh that comes with that same prelacy are few. We gladly wish to be exalted above others, but we avoid mourning their sins. For we see the loaves offered to us, but we refuse to receive them from the hands of those offering, because we observe the affliction in chosen men that we do not imitate. Therefore let the prophet command, saying: "You shall receive from their hand." So that whoever desires to be a fit ruler of the Church should by no means refuse to take up what has been spoken. It is also fitting that Saul is first led to men leaping over great ditches, and then to those who carry loaves, young goats, and wine: so that the untrained preacher may learn from some to despise the heights of the world, and from others to offer the affliction of the flesh and the sacrifices of tears to almighty God on behalf of himself and those under his care.
