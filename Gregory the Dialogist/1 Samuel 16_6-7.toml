11. And because we have taught through the sacred scriptures that the Lord shows who should be chosen as bishops, let us now see, as the mysteries of this sacred history speak, what kind of men He shows to be worthy and what kind He rejects. There follows: (Verses 6, 7.) "And when they had come in, he saw Eliab and said: Is this the Lord's anointed before Him? And the Lord said to Samuel: Do not look upon his countenance, nor upon the height of his stature, because I have rejected him, nor do I judge according to the sight of men. For man sees those things which appear, but the Lord beholds the heart." For what does it mean for the wise to enter in, except to pass into the subtle sanctuary of discernment? But he saw Eliab when he entered, because the pastor recognizes that man as worthy of leadership in the holy Church who possesses both the strength of good works and the knowledge of truth. But what does it mean that the Lord commands him not to look upon his stature or his countenance, except that in the holy Church neither works nor knowledge are commended without humility? For what is a person's countenance but the outward manner of life by which he is known? And what is his stature but the height of knowledge by which he is raised to higher things? Whom then does Eliab more fittingly signify than those who do good and are learned, yet are arrogant? Hence Eliab is interpreted as "my God is father." This indeed is the name they dare to presume for themselves. For what does it mean that "my God is father" is said, except that while they vigorously do good works and wisely understand spiritual things, they boast that by singular merit they have passed into the number of the sons of God? For they would say "father" not "mine" but "ours" to the almighty Lord, if through humility they saw themselves in common with the other elect in the order of heavenly birth. Rightly therefore he is rejected, because in the spiritual heights none but the humble are preferred. Thus the prophet subtly inquires about the person to be anointed, saying: "Is this the Lord's anointed before Him?" This happens now when the chief teacher recognizes both the life and the understanding of the one to be chosen, but still inquires about the virtue of humility. But he sees his countenance and stature rejected, when he recognizes that whatever beauty he has in works, whatever loftiness exists in his learning, is without the virtue of humility. Rightly therefore the Lord says: "I have cast him aside, nor do I judge according to the sight of man, because man sees the face, but God beholds the heart." As if He were saying: Men are accustomed to praise great works and words of knowledge, but I praise neither words nor works that I do not see founded in true humility. Those who are of this sort would tremble at the repulse of their unworthiness if they were willing to hear attentively what the Lord says to the prophet: "Do not look upon his countenance, nor upon the height of his stature, because I have cast him aside." For they consider what the arrogant do to be of great importance; but behold, the Lord declares it so worthless that it is judged not even worth looking upon. But with this one set aside, what follows is shown: (Verse 8.) "And Jesse called Aminadab and brought him before Samuel. And he said: Neither has the Lord chosen this one."
