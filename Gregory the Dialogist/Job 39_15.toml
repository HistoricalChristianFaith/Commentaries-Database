38. The foot crushes, and the beast of the field breaks, the eggs at the time, when they are forsaken on the earth; because, namely, while the hearts of men seek to be ever thinking on earthly things, ever to be employed on things below, they throw themselves down for the beast of the field, that is, the devil, to trample on: so that, after they have been long degraded by the basest thoughts, they are at length crushed by the perpetration of even greater crimes. The synagogue, therefore, neglected to raise up from the earth by good living the eggs which it laid. But, though Almighty God found many of its children dead and chilled by earthly desires, yet he animated them with the warmth of His love. But that life, which the synagogue gave not its children, it grudged them afterwards, when it was striving to extinguish by persecution, those whom it remembered not to have by cherishing brought forth to good works.

16. What is understood by ‘foot,’ but the passing over of active work? What is signified by the ‘field,’ but this world? Of which the Lord says in the Gospel, But the field is the world. [Matt. 13, 38] What is expressed by the ‘beast,’ but the ancient enemy, who, lying in wait for the spoils of this world, is daily satiated with the death of men? Of which it is said by the Prophet, the Lord promising; No evil beast shall pass through it. [Is. 35, 9] The ostrich, therefore, deserting her eggs, forgets that the foot may crush them; because, namely, hypocrites abandon those whom they beget as their children in conversation [al. ‘in conversion.’], and care not at all, lest the examples of evil in doings should lead them astray, when deprived of either the earnestness of exhortation, or of the care of discipline. For see next did they love the eggs, which they produce, they would doubtless be afraid, lest any one should crush them by pointing out evil doings. This foot Paul was fearing for his weak disciples, as for eggs which he had laid, when he said, Many walk, of whom I told you often, but now I tell you even weeping, that they are enemies of the cross of Christ. [Phil. 3, 18] And again, Beware of dogs; beware of evil workers. [ib. 2] And again, We command you, brethren, in the name of our ‘Lord Jesus Christ, that ye withdraw yourselves from every brother that walketh disorderly, and not after the tradition which they received of us. [2 Thess. 3, 6] This foot John was dreading for Caius; for when he had mentioned before many wickednesses of Diotrephes, he added, Dearly beloved, imitate not that which is evil, but that which is good. [3 John 11] This the leader of the Synagogue himself was fearing for his feeble flock, saying, When thou hast entered the land, which the Lord thy God shall give thee, take heed that thou wish not to imitate the abominations of those nations. [Deut. 18, 9] She forgets also, that the beast of the field may break them, because the hypocrite doubtless cares not at all, if the devil raging in this world carries off his children who are brought forth in good conversation. But this beast of the field Paul was fearing for the eggs, which he had laid, saying, I fear, lest, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty, so your senses should be corrupted from the love that is in Christ Jesus. [2 Cor. 11, 3] This beast of the field Peter was fearing for his disciples, saying, Your adversary, the devil, as a roaring lion goeth about, seeking whom he may devour; whom resist, stedfast in the faith. [l Pet. 5, 8. 9.] Faithful teachers therefore have over their disciples the bowels of fear, from the virtue of charity. But hypocrites fear the less for those committed to them, the more they discover not what they ought to fear for themselves. And because they live with hardened hearts, they acknowledge not even the sons whom they beget, with any affection of the love which is due to them.
