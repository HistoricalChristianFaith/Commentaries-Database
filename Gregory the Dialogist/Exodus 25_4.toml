[[commentary]]

Scarlet cloth, twice dyed, was to be offered to adorn the tabernacle so that our love of God and neighbor might have the color of love in God’s sight. That person truly loves himself who loves his Creator completely. Scarlet cloth is twice dyed when a soul is set on fire toward itself and its neighbor as a result of its love of truth.
