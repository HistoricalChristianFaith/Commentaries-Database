Scarlet cloth, twice dyed, was to be offered to adorn the tabernacle so that our love of God and neighbor might have the color of love in Godâ€™s sight. That person truly loves himself who loves his Creator completely. Scarlet cloth is twice dyed when a soul is set on fire toward itself and its neighbor as a result of its love of truth.
