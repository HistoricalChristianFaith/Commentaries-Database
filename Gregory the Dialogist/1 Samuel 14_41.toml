But what does it mean that Saul commands the people to separate themselves to one side, and the people ask the king to do what he commands, except that simple people do not know how to examine themselves, even when they are commanded to? Therefore he says: "Do what is good in your eyes." As if to say: You will be able to manage our affairs better, you who have received the light of the heart not only for yourself, but also for foreseeing our paths. But the ruler is praised for the interior illumination which he has through grace, yet does not possess through his own estimation. He is praised, indeed, because he is able to know the secrets of others, but he himself lacks confidence that he can know himself. Because, therefore, he does not ascribe to himself the light of so great a grace, he does not neglect to seek it from God through prayers. Whence it also follows: And he said to the Lord God of Israel: "Give a sign. Why have you not answered your servant today? If this iniquity is in me or in my son Jonathan, give a revelation; or if this iniquity is in your people, give holiness."

We therefore ask that a sign be given when we demand that hidden things be revealed to us. But we must ask what such great diversity of words means. For regarding himself and his son he asks that a manifestation be given, but if the iniquity is in the people, holiness. This however can be stated briefly: because chosen teachers know their own strength and know the weakness of the subject people. For themselves, therefore, they ask only the manifestation of the fault, because they know they are accustomed to pursue it with the severity of penance. But for the people they seek holiness, because they do not desire merely to know the faults of their subjects; but those whom they find doing evil, they urge to arrive at pardon through lamentation. For what does it mean to say, "Give holiness," except, "Sanctify those whom you reveal"? You uncover their hidden things to me, but nothing is accomplished by the uncovering if you do not work upon those whom you reveal by pouring back grace. But because often subjects stand firm while prelates fall, there follows: And Jonathan and Saul were taken. And because it is not easily recognized by whom the fault itself was committed, there follows: And Saul said: Cast the lot between me and my son. And Jonathan was taken.
