What is crawling on the hands, if not to curve the whole body, to leave nothing lofty in oneself, to bend the upper limbs to perform the duties of the lower? And what is suggested to us by this action, if not that the conversion of sinners requires great compassion from preachers? For what else did our Redeemer appear to do but crawl on his hands, when he became a friend of tax collectors, and received sinners, and ate with them? Indeed, he was crawling on his hands when he said: "The healthy have no need of a physician, but those who are sick" (Matt. 9:12). Hence he says again: "I came not to call the righteous, but sinners." This bending down of crawling is also designated in sacred Scripture by the term "camel." For the Savior willed to humble himself down to our lowest condition, so that he might raise us up to the heights of his divinity. Paul, indicating that he followed this one who crawled on his hands, says: "I became all things to all people, that I might save all" (1 Cor. 9:22). But also, because hands usually signify works, the pastor crawls on his hands when he sets forth to sinners the way that the converted ought to follow, not by the wisdom of speech, but by the example of his manner of life. Indeed, the Lord was teaching his preachers to crawl on their hands when he said: "So let your light shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father who is in heaven" (Matt. 5:16). And fittingly, the one crawling is said to climb up to the outpost of the Philistines, because that teacher can arrive at the destruction of the vices of sinners who soothes the sinners themselves by a great display of humility and a great affection of charity. For while he extends the agreeableness of grace outwardly, he inwardly sends in the hand to cut away the sickness of the mind.

The face of Jonathan is seen when those who hear the word of the preacher recognize also the charity of his mind; when, namely, they hear him both preaching heavenly things and loving with wonderful charity those to whom he opens those heavenly things. And they are rightly said to fall before his face, because while they recognize the good things that are in the mind of the preacher, they abandon the state of wickedness. But also, while many come to the remedy of penance, some take refuge in the examples of the great, others in those of the lesser. Fittingly therefore it was said: "His armor-bearer was killing others." To be deprived of a reprobate life is indeed to be slain; and whoever abandons evil by someone's example or admonitions falls before his feet as if slain. For James, setting forth the victories of individuals in a general statement, says: "He who causes a sinner to be converted from the error of his way shall save his soul from death, and shall cover a multitude of sins" (James 5:20).
