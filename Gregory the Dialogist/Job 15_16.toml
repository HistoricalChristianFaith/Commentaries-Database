39.  He who first said it was impossible that man should of himself be clean from sin, and righteous, calls him ‘abominable’ and ‘useless;’ ‘abominable’ on account of the uncleanness of his stain, but ‘useless’ on account of the unrighteousness of an imperfect life; who however may be understood as ‘abominable and useless’ in another sense.  For often a bad man seems to do some things rightly, but by those things which are wrong, even those which are right belonging to him are brought to nought; and because the evil ones are very displeasing to God, neither are those pleasing which seem to be good.  And so he, that is ‘abominable’ before God in his evil things, is ‘useless’ in the good; in that whilst he shows himself an object of execration to God by wicked deeds, neither is that which seems right proceeding from him well-pleasing.  And it is well said, Which drinketh iniquity like water.  For what is eaten is swallowed not without delay, seeing that it is chewed in order to be swallowed; but what is drunk has no hindrance to be swallowed, in proportion as it hath again no need to be chewed.  And so because sin is committed by the foolish man without any drawing back, iniquity is drunk like water.  For because he does unlawful things without fear, he swallows the draught of iniquity without let or hindrance.
