Hence they also immediately add by way of rebuke: "Go rather to those who sell, and buy for yourselves." For the sellers of oil are flatterers. For those who, when any grace has been received, offer the brightness of glory through their vain praises, as it were sell oil. Concerning this oil indeed the Psalmist says: "But let not the oil of the sinner anoint my head." For our principal part is the head. And by the term "head" is meant the mind which rules the body. Therefore the oil of the sinner fattens the head when the favor of the flatterer soothes the mind.
