It is said in the psalm regarding just individuals: “The saints will rejoice exceedingly in glory; they will rejoice in their beds”; because when they flee evils from the outside, they glory secure within the secret recesses of their minds. Then the joys of their hearts will have been fulfilled when there will have been no external struggles with the flesh. For until the flesh is subdued, one’s bed is disturbed just as the wall of our house shakes.
