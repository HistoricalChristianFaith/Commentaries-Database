Hence it is said by the Psalmist of the just, "The Saints shall be joyful in glory, they shall rejoice upon their beds"; in that when they flee the mischiefs from things without, they exult in safety within the recesses of their hearts. But the joy of the heart will then be complete, when the fight of the flesh shall have ceased without. For so long as the flesh allures, because as it were the wall of our house is shaken, even the very bed is disturbed.
