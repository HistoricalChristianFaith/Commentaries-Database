Who are the Hebrews who had been with the Philistines, if not sinners who have fallen from a religious way of life? Of whom it was said not far above: "The Hebrews crossed the Jordan." They are Hebrews indeed by the order of religion, but they are with the Philistines, and they go up with them, as long as they are deceived by harmful suggestions and advance in wicked conduct. They are with the evil spirits by the intention and will of sin, but they go up with them, because, driven by those spirits, they raise themselves to the boldness of iniquitous action. Or they are with them when they carry out their sins to completion by their deeds; but they go up with them when they do not fear to set forth the examples of their wickedness for others to imitate. What does it mean, then, that they are said to return and be with Israel, except that such people also very often come to their senses? For to return is to take up again the love of the religious life. And to be with Israel is to persist within the holy Church in the unity of charity. One must return to this end: that being with Israel may be proposed as the goal, because there is no conversion of a sinner if, once converted, he lacks perseverance in good works and unity of charity.
