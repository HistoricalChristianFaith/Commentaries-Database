He hath compassed the waters with bounds, until the light and darkness come to an end.

Because very often in Holy Writ, as we said above, by the name of 'waters' peoples are denoted; the Lord compasseth the waters with bounds; because He so tempers the knowledge of mankind: that until the successions of the changing seasons pass away, it cannot perfectly attain to the knowledge of the Interior Brightness. But if by the name of 'light' we understand the righteous, and by the designation of 'darkness' sinners; (and hence Paul saith, For ye were sometimes darkness, but now are ye light,) there is nothing to hinder this same thing that we said being understood, 'that the perfect knowledge of eternity is vouchsafed to no one, until the course of the righteous and of the unrighteous is brought to an end.'
