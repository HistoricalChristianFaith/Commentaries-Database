As if it were openly said, wilt thou restrain him with thine own strength? Whence it is also fitly subjoined;
Remember the battle, and speak no more.
35. The deep dispensation of God’s judgment for this reason often either assails His well-deserving servants with threats, or presses on them with scourges, or weighs them down by some superimposed burdens, or entangles them in laborious employments, because it foresees with wonderful power, that if they were to remain quiet, and in freedom under tranquillity, they would sink beneath the wounds of the mind from being unable to endure the temptations of the adversary. Whilst then it engages them in scourges or burdens to be endured without, it protects them from receiving the darts of temptations within. For it is frequently a practice for a physician to draw out the inflammation of the bowels into an itching on the skin; and he often effects a cure within, by causing an outward wound. In like manner the medicine of the Divine dispensation frequently causes the removal of an inward wound by outward pains, and the throwing out of that inward corruption of sins, which would otherwise occupy the mind, by the deep wounds of scourges. And yet frequently, when men are not conscious to themselves of an open sin, and are either tortured by pain, or weighed down by labours, they break out into complaints against the Just and Almighty Judge; from not observing against how mighty an adversary they are waging war. But did they but observe anxiously his irresistible strength, they would not murmur at the outward sufferings they endure.
36. But these seem to us grievous, for the very reason that we do not like to consider our still more grievous contests with our secret adversary. From which assaults, as we said, we are frequently defended, when scourged, and concealed when afflicted. For if our flesh is afflicted with no pain, before it is strengthened with the incorruption of the resurrection, it is unchecked in temptations. But who can be ignorant that it is much better to burn with the heat of fevers, than with the fire of sins? And yet when we are seized with a fever, because we neglect attending to the heat of sins, which might possess us, we murmur at the blow. Who can be ignorant, that it is much better to be held in bondage by cruel men, than to be under the power of the flattering spirits of devils? And yet when we are galled by the yoke of our human condition [perhaps ‘of subjection to man’], in the deep judgment of God, we break out into complaint, doubtless because we do not consider that if no condition of bondage oppressed us, our mind, more fatally free, would perchance be in bondage to many iniquities. We believe then the sufferings we endure to be weighty, because we see not how severe and irresistible are the assaults of the crafty enemy against us. For every weight would be as nothing to our mind; if it considered the assaults of the secret adversary which might oppress it. But what if Almighty God were to lighten the burdens we suffer, and yet withdraw from us His assistance, and leave us amid the temptations of this Leviathan? Where shall we betake ourselves, when so mighty an enemy is raging against us, if we are not defended by any protection of our Creator? Because, therefore, blessed Job was not conscious to himself of a fault, and yet was enduring severe scourges, lest he should haply exceed in the sin of murmuring, let him be reminded what to fear, and let it be said to him, Remember the battle, and speak no more. As if it were plainly said to him, If thou considerest the contest of the secret enemy against thee, thou dost not blame whatever thou sufferest from Me. If thou beholdest the sword of the adversary assailing thee, thou dost not at all dread the scourge of a Father. For thou seest with what scourge I smite thee, but thou omittest to look from how great an enemy I keep thee free by My scourging. Remember therefore the battle, and speak no more: that is, keep thyself the more silent under the discipline of a Father, the more thou seest that thou art weak for the assaults of the enemy. Whilst then thou art smitten by My correction, in order that thou mayest bear it with patience, recal thine enemy to mind, and consider not that every thing thou sufferest is hard, when by outward tortures thou art freed from inward suffering. But because this Leviathan flatters himself with a false promise of the Divine compassion, after He had spoken of the terror of his strength, and had roused the mind of blessed Job with circumspection towards Him, (saying, Remember the battle, and say no more;) in order to shew his unpardonable guilt.
