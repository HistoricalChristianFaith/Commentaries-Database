In these words, what should we note, what should we carefully consider, except that the subject does not die because of the fault of the superior, nor is the superior without fault when, not hearing the words of life, the subject dies by his own fault? For death is owed to the impious, but the way of life must be announced to him by the watchman, and his impiety must be rebuked. But if the watchman is silent, the impious man himself will die in his iniquity, because it was the merit of his impiety that he was not worthy for the watchman's word to reach him. But the Lord requires his blood from the hand of the watchman, because he himself killed him, because by remaining silent he betrayed him to death. In both of these cases, we must weigh how closely connected are the sins of subjects and superiors, because where the subject dies by his own fault, there the one who is in charge, because he was silent, is held guilty of death. Consider therefore, dearest brothers, consider, because the fact that we are not worthy pastors is also due to your fault, over whom we have been placed as prelates. And if at times you slide into iniquity, this is also due to our guilt, since you do not have us resisting and crying out against your wicked desires. Therefore you spare both yourselves and us if you cease from wicked work. We spare both you and ourselves when we do not keep silent about what displeases. Oh how free from the blood of those committed to him was that excellent preacher who said: I am clean from the blood of all; for I did not shrink from announcing to you the whole counsel of God. For if he had not announced it, he would not be clean from blood. But because he strove to announce the whole counsel of God to them, he was clean from their blood. By this voice we are summoned, we are bound, we are shown to be guilty, we who are called priests, who on top of the evils that are our own also add the deaths of others, because we kill as many as we see going to death daily while we remain lukewarm and silent.

But when it is said: "His blood I will require at your hand," if by the name of blood in this passage the death of the body is designated, our fear regarding our silence is greatly increased, because if he who is set over others as a watchman is held so gravely guilty even for the bodily death of those who will someday die anyway, by what guilt is he bound for the death of the soul of his subjects, which could have lived forever if it had heard words of correction? But sins can better be signified by the name of blood. Whence a certain one, when he was lamenting the sins of the flesh, said: "Deliver me from bloodguilt, O God, God of my salvation." Therefore the blood of the dying is required at the hand of the watchman, because the sin of the subject is imputed to the fault of the superior if he has remained silent. There is therefore something he can do, so that even when his subject dies he may render himself free. Let him rise up, keep watch, oppose evil deeds, as it is written: "Run about, make haste, rouse your friend; give no sleep to your eyes, nor let your eyelids slumber."
