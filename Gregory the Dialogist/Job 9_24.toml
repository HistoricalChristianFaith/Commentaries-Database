44.  For what is denoted by the designation of ‘the earth,’ saving the flesh?  who by the title of ‘the wicked,’ save the devil?  The ‘hands’ of this wicked one were they, who were the aggressors in the death of our Redeemer.  Thus ‘the earth is given into the hands of the wicked,’ in that our Redeemer's Soul our old enemy could never corrupt, by himself tempting Him.  But His Flesh he being permitted did by means of his ministers deprive of life for three days; and unknown to himself, by that very permission, he ministered to the dispensation of God's pitifulness.  For assailing our Redeemer with three temptations, he had no power to defile the heart of God.  But when he set on the mind of Judas to bring about the death of His fleshly part, and when he gave him a band of soldiers and officers from the Chief Priests and Pharisees, then that wicked one stretched forth his hands upon ‘the earth.’  The judges of this earth were the Priests and Rulers, Pilate and the scoffing soldiers; and so this wicked one ‘covered the faces of the judges thereof,’ in that he veiled the mind of the persecutors, that they should not know their Maker, with a cloud of wickedness.  Whence it is said by Paul, But even unto this day, when Moses is read, the vail is upon their heart [2 Cor. 3, 15]; and he says again, For had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory. [1 Cor. 2, 8]  And so the face of the judges proved to be covered, in that the mind of the persecutors not even by His miracles ever knew Him to be God, Whom it had power to hold fast in the flesh.  But forasmuch as our old enemy is one person with all the wicked, Holy Scripture very often so speaks of the head of the wicked, i.e. the devil, that it suddenly goes off to his body, i.e. to his followers.  Therefore it may be that by the name of ‘the wicked one,’ the faithless and persecuting People is denoted, with which this also which is added accords;
If it is not he, who then is it?
45.  Who then shall any where be accounted wicked, if that People, which persecuted Pity Itself, be not wicked?  But the holy man, after regarding the faithlessness of the Jewish People, calls back the eye of his mind to himself, grieves that he cannot behold Him Whom he loves, is sad and sorrowful that he is withdrawn from the present world, before the Saving Health of the world is manifested.
