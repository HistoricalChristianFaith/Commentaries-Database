Indeed He exchanged words with them, He rebuked the hardness of their understanding; He opened up the mysteries of Sacred Scripture that pertained to Himself, and yet because He was still a stranger to faith in their hearts, He pretended to go farther. For we say "fingere" means to fashion; hence we also call shapers of clay "figuli" [potters]. Therefore the simple Truth did nothing through duplicity, but showed Himself to them in body such as He was with them in mind. Moreover they were to be tested, whether those who did not yet love Him as God could at least love Him as a stranger.
