For knowledge is a virtue, but humility is the guardian of virtue. It remains therefore that in all that it knows the mind should humble itself, lest the wind of pride carry away what the virtue of knowledge has gathered. When you do good things, brothers, always recall to memory the evil things you have done, so that while fault is carefully observed, the mind may never carelessly rejoice in good work. Consider as your superiors one another, especially those who are not committed to your charge, your neighbors, because even those whom you see doing certain wicked things—you do not know what good things may lie hidden in them. Therefore let each one strive to be great, but yet in some way not know that he is, lest while he arrogantly attributes greatness to himself, he lose it. For hence it is said through the prophet: "Woe to you who are wise in your own eyes, and prudent before yourselves." Hence Paul says: "Be not wise in your own eyes."
