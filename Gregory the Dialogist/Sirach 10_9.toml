Differently to be admonished are the humble and the haughty. To the former it is to be insinuated how true is that excellence which they hold in hoping for it; to the latter it is to be intimated how that temporal glory is as nothing which even when embracing it they hold not. Let the humble hear how eternal are the things that they long for, how transitory the things which they despise; let the haughty hear how transitory are the things they court, how eternal the things they lose. Let the humble hear from the authoritative voice of the Truth, "Every one that humbleth himself shall be exalted." Let the haughty hear, "Every one that exalteth himself shall be humbled." Let the humble hear, "Humility goeth before glory;" let the haughty hear, "The spirit is exalted before a fall." Let the humble hear, "Unto whom shall I have respect, but to him that is humble and quiet, and that trembleth at my words?" Let the haughty hear, "Why is earth and ashes proud?" Let the humble hear, "God hath respect unto the things that are humble." Let the haughty hear, "And lofty things He knoweth afar off." Let the humble hear, "That the Son of Man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister;" let the haughty hear, that "The beginning of all sin is pride." Let the humble hear, that "Our Redeemer humbled himself, being made obedient even unto death;" let the haughty hear what is written concerning their head, "He is king over all the sons of pride." The pride, therefore, of the devil became the occasion of our perdition, and the humility of God has been found the argument for our redemption. For our enemy, having been created among all things, desired to appear exalted above all things; but our Redeemer, remaining great above all things, deigned to become little among all things.

Let the humble, then, be told that, when they abase themselves, they ascend to the likeness of God; let the haughty be told that, when they exalt themselves, they fall into imitation of the apostate angel.
