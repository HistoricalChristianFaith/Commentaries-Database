The humble and the proud are admonished differently. For the humble, it is to be insinuated how true that excellence is that they hold in hoping for it. For the proud, it is to be intimated how that temporal glory is as nothing, that even when they embrace it they are not holding it. Let the humble hear how eternal the things are that they long for, how transitory the things are that they despise. Let the proud hear how transitory the things are that they court and how eternal the things are that they lose. Let the humble hear from the authoritative voice of the Truth, “Everyone who humbles himself shall be exalted.” Let the proud hear, “Everyone who exalts himself shall be humbled.” Let the humble hear, “Humility goes before glory”; let the proud hear, “The spirit is exalted before a fall.” Let the humble hear, “To whom shall I have respect, but to one who is humble and quiet and trembles at my words?” Let the proud hear, “Why are earth and ashes proud?” Let the humble hear, “God respects the humble.” Let the proud hear, “And the proud he knows from afar.” Let the humble hear, “That the Son of man came not to be ministered to but to minister.” Let the proud hear that “the beginning of all sin is pride.” Let the humble hear that “our Redeemer humbled himself, being made obedient even to death.” Let the proud hear what is written concerning their head: “He is king over all the children of pride.” The pride, therefore, of the devil became the occasion of our perdition, and the humility of God has been found as the argument for our redemption. For our enemy, who is among the created beings, desired to appear exalted above all things. But our Redeemer, remaining great above all things, decided instead to become little among all things. Let the humble, then, be told that when they abase themselves, they ascend to the likeness of God. Let the proud be told that when they exalt themselves, they fall into imitation of the apostate angel.
