And it is well added subsequently: "Samuel cried out to the Lord, and the Lord sent thunder and rain on that day; and all the people greatly feared the Lord and Samuel. And all the people said to Samuel: Pray for your servants to the Lord your God, that we may not die. For we have added to all our sins this evil, that we should ask for ourselves a king."

10. If we bring this down to our own times, in order that the people may come to the knowledge of their sins, preachers cry out to God on their behalf, because they seek the salvation of the faithful with great desires. For preachers to cry out is to petition for the salvation of the elect with great devotion. At their cry the Lord gives His voice, because He stirs the hearts of sinners so that they may recognize the wickedness of their depravity. He gives rains, because He aids their stirred hearts through the infusion of heavenly grace, so that each one may not only abandon the evil deeds he has committed, but also courageously perform the good works he desires. But this is said to happen on the day of the wheat harvest, so that the power of the miracle may be indicated. The transformation of the heart is indeed no less a miracle than the disturbance of the air. It is no less a miracle for parched hearts to come back to life than for rains to flood down in an unusual manner during the heat of summer. It is surely a greater miracle to shake an insensible mind with an inward thunder than for thunder to resound when clouds collide in the wind. But the right order of conversion is shown in the ordered arrangement of the words. For he says: "The Lord gave thunder and rain, and all the people feared the Lord and Samuel exceedingly." In the most orderly conversion, when evil is abandoned, good is propagated in the mind; when the converted mind nourishes good seed as if through rain, it submits itself to God and to men through the virtue of obedience. Rightly, therefore, it is said: "All the people feared the Lord and Samuel," because whoever receives the coming of the Supreme Spirit both abandons evil and lays hold of good, and is so subjected to God that for God's sake he also submits himself to men. And because they have no presumption in this very virtue of obedience, they say: "Pray for your servants to the Lord, that we may not die." When the spirit of life pours itself into the mind, it immediately raises it to the dread of death, because the teaching of that same spirit is that the mind should act in fear so as not to encounter what it fears. But holy men praying for them can be heard, who also reveal the hidden sins of the heart through the humility of confession. Hence it is also added: "For we have added to all our sins this evil, that we should ask for ourselves a king." But since these matters have already been sufficiently discussed in our exposition, let us look at what follows.
