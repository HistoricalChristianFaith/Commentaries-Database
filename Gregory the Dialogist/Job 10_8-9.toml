For he, who declares himself both “made and fashioned altogether round about” by God, leaves to the people of darkness no part either in his spirit or in his flesh. For he described himself as “molded” in virtue of the interior image, but he spoke of being “fashioned altogether round about” insofar as he consists of a covering of flesh. Yet, it is to be observed that he declares himself made by the hands of God. He is setting before the divine mercy the dignity of his creation. For though all things were created by the Word which is coeternal with the Father, yet in the very account of the creation it is shown how greatly humankind is preferred above all animals; how much greater than celestial things that are without sense.
