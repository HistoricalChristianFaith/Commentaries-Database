50.  The Churches of the nations are like separate countries in the world, which, while they be planted in one faith, are separated by a diversity of customs and of tongues.  What then do we take the stones of the countries to mean but the Elect ones of the Church, to whom it is declared by the voice of him who was the first among the teachers, Ye also as lively stones are built up a spiritual house? [1 Pet. 2, 5]  Concerning whom the Lord by His Prophet promises Holy Church, saying, Behold, I will lay thy stones in order. [Is. 54, 11]  Whoso then lives aright, joins himself in covenant ‘with the stones of the countries.’  For herein, that he conquers the desires of the world, without doubt he ties his life to an imitation of the Saints that have gone before.  But when he is departing from the practice of the world, the assaults of malicious spirits increase, which nevertheless, the more they afflict a man in sorrow of heart, bow him the more humbly to his Creator.  And hence it is added,
And the beasts of the earth shall be peacemakers to thee.
51.  First it is to be observed, that he does not say, ‘made peaceful,’ but, ‘peacemakers,’ that is to say, not that they are at peace, but that they make peace; for the crafty foes in making plots distress, but the distressed soul delights the more in her return to the heavenly home, the more she lives  toiling in this woful place of exile, and most truly abases herself to the gracious regard of her Helper, when she considers the most violent plots of the enemy against her.  The beasts of the earth then are rendered ‘peacemakers’ to the Elect, in that the malignant spirits, when they bear down the hearts of the good by their hostility, drive them to the love of God against their will.  Thus there arises a firmer peace with God, from the same source, whence a tougher fight is occasioned us by our adversaries.
52.  By the ‘beasts of the earth’ too may be understood the motions of the flesh, which, while they gall the mind by prompting conduct which is contrary to reason, rise up against us like beasts.  But when the heart is bowed down under the Divine Law, even the incitements of the flesh are reduced, so that, though in tempting us they give a low muttering, yet they never mount so high as to the execution of the deeds, as to the madness of open biting.  For who that still subsists in this corruptible flesh, completely tames these beasts of the earth, when that preeminent Preacher that was caught up to the third heaven, says, But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin, which is my members. [Rom. 7, 21]  But it is one thing to see these beasts raging in the field of practice, and another to hold them ravening within the door of the heart.  For when they be forced back within the bars of continence, though they still roar by tempting, yet, as we have said, they go not such lengths as the bite of unlawful practice.  The beasts of the field then are peacemakers, in that though the motions of the flesh beat high in the desire, yet they never assail us with the open resistance of deeds, (though by this same circumstance, that they are called ‘peacemakers,’ even this same that we have said of malicious spirits is not unsuitably understood.)  For the motions of the flesh ‘make peace’ for us with God, when they offer opposition by tempting us.  For the mind of the righteous man, in that his way is directed to the realms above, is sore bestead by a grievous war arising from the corruptible body.  And if at any time it be hindered in heavenly aspirations by any enjoyment of this world however slight, by that very war of temptation, which it undergoes, it is urged on to set all its affections in that, which is disturbed by no opposition.  Whence it comes to pass that it recalls to mind the interior repose, and fleeing from the enticements of the flesh, sighs after it with a full affection.  For temptation constrains every man to mark from whence and whereunto he is fallen, who after he has forsaken the peace of God, feels a strife rise up against him from out of himself, and then he more truly sees what he has lost of the assured love of God, who having fallen down to himself, finds his own self insulted within himself.  The beasts of the earth then make peace for us, in that the motions of the flesh, whilst by offering temptation they irritate us, urge us forwards to the love of the interior repose.
