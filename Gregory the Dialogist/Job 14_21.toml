26.  For as they, who are still living, know nothing of the souls of the dead, in what place they are held; so the dead, concerning the life of those living after them in the flesh, know not at all how it is ordered; in that both the life of the spirit is far from the life of the flesh, and as the corporeal and incorporeal are things different in kind, so are they parted in knowledge.  Which however is not to be imagined concerning holy souls, in that they which behold the brightness of Almighty God within, we cannot for a moment suppose that there is any thing without that they know not [b].  But because carnal persons bestow their chief affection on their children, blessed Job declares that they are hereafter ignorant of that, which they loved here with all their heart, so that ‘whether their sons be in honour or dishonour they know not,’ whereas their care for these was always preying upon their minds.
Which however if it is to be understood in a spiritual sense, with no unfitness by the title of sons we have works denoted, as Paul saith of woman, Notwithstanding, she shall be saved in childbearing. [1 Tim. 2, 15]  Not that a woman, who being devoted to continency never bears children, shall not be saved, but she is said to be ‘saved by childbearing,’ because by the operation of good works she is united to everlasting salvation.  Thus the children in honour are good deeds, and the children in dishonour are bad deeds.  And often man strives to do things with a good intention, yet by reason of the many occasions that creep upon him, how his actions are accounted of in the sight of Almighty God is a thing uncertain.  And so ‘whether his sons be in honour or dishonour he perceiveth not,’ in that his works being sifted with a searching scrutiny, whether they be approved or condemned he cannot tell.  Thus here man is placed in the painfulness of labour, and thither he is brought in the fearfulness of misgiving.  Hence it is yet further subjoined concerning the labour of the present life itself.
