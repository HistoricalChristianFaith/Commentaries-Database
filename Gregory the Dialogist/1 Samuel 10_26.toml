39. If a plain historical narrative is sought, what could ever have been stated more clearly? But if we attend to the force of each individual word, great things are enclosed within this simplicity of words. For the people are said to have been dismissed to their home, but the king is reported not to have been dismissed to his home, but to have gone away. Separately also it speaks of the homes of the people and of the home of the king: because the people are reported as dismissed to their home, and the king as having gone away to his own. Yet the people were dismissed before the king went away. Concerning the departing people it is also carefully indicated that they did not go all at once, but each one is reported to have gone away to his own home. But concerning those who followed the king it does not say: "A part of the army went away, each one after the king," but: "A part of the army went with him." Finally, those who follow the king are reported to have had their hearts touched by God; those who despise the king are called sons of Belial. This manner of speaking is certainly not simple, but is very subtle for one who knows how to consider not what merely sounds on the surface, but what is wisely intimated within. What does it mean, then, that the king is said to go away to his home, but the people to be dismissed? We have shown that the king designates the pastor of the Church, and the people designate his subjects. Now to go is the act of one who is free; to be dismissed belongs to one who can be held back. The king is therefore said to go away so that in the person of the preacher, freedom of spirit may be proclaimed. Teachers can indeed go when they wish and return, because they are strong in good work and wise in their inner disposition. They come, indeed, when they go out to their subjects either by the example of good work or by the word of preaching. They go away when they return to the secret place of the mind and inwardly arrange what they are about to do outwardly. Inasmuch as they remain daily in this contemplation, they are, as it were, hidden within their home. The king is therefore said to go away to his home because the preacher, proven by the work of eternal life and secure in the teaching of wisdom, is free to go out to his labors and to enter into the counsels of the mind.

40. But the people is sent to its own house, because faithful subjects are not free to arrange what they wish, but only what is commanded. They are sent away as if held under constraint, while they are directed to do what is ordered and to avoid presuming what is not ordered. And because they are sent to diverse works, each one of them is sent to his own house. For in order that we may well accomplish those things which they command us, before we appear in the work, we are hidden within in internal consideration. Therefore our kings send each of us to our own house, because they command us to go to those things which they enjoin upon us through the secret disposition of the mind. They indeed command well, but if we neglect to foresee the manner of our action, we scatter with an inconsiderate mind what has been well commanded. Therefore each one returns to his own house, when every faithful subject anticipates by arranging through the counsel of the mind the work of obedience that he sets before himself. But because after the king was chosen the people was sent to its own house before the king is said to have departed, something else can be signified in this. For those who receive the king go to their own house when each subject prepares himself by considering, so that he may render faithful obedience to him whom he has asked to be set over him. In this place, therefore, the point is not to consider things already commanded, but to subject oneself with the lowest disposition to things about to be commanded. And for the king to go to his own house is to consider how he may command with discretion those who are prepared. Therefore the house of the king is one thing, and that of the subject people another; because the former consider with a lofty mind the journeys of subjects that must be arranged, while the latter prepare to carry out the commands of their superiors through the strength of their inmost purpose. Whence also the house of the king is reported to be situated in Gibeah. For Gibeah means "lofty." Therefore the house of the king is shown to be in Gibeah, because the chosen teacher strives not to dwell by thinking on low and earthly things, but to meditate on high and heavenly things. Whence also it is well said that a part of the army goes with him to Gibeah, because those who are strong against the devil follow their chosen pastor to the heights of virtues. Therefore a part of the army is said to go with the king, because in the holy Church very many are faithful who know how to humbly obey their superiors but do not know how to think lofty thoughts. They know indeed how to carry out what is commanded, but they do not know how to foresee what should be commanded to others. For Paul was, as it were, commemorating the soldiers of this part when he wrote to the Colossians, saying: "Aristarchus my fellow prisoner greets you, and Mark the cousin of Barnabas, and John who is called Justus, who are of the circumcision: these alone are my helpers in the kingdom of God" (Col. 4:10). Likewise, addressing the Romans, he says: "Greet Prisca and Aquila, my helpers" (Rom. 16:5). And a little later: "Timothy my helper greets you, and Lucas, and Jason" (ibid. 21). He called his disciples helpers, because they were lesser in rank but sharers of the labor; they were subject to the Apostle by the humility of obedience, but while they preached with him the glory of the eternal kingdom, equally defended the truth with him, resisted the unbelievers, and bravely endured the persecutions inflicted upon them, they were, as it were, soldiers of the king in the war of God. A part of the army is said to go with the king to Gibeah, because perfect disciples are co-helpers of their teachers in the lofty governance of the holy Church; they bring what aid they can through the height of virtue, but they serve through humility those whom they help.

41. And because only those can do this who have been prevented by the grace of the Holy Spirit, when part of the army is said to go with the king, it is added: 'Whose hearts God had touched.' For since we are accustomed to touch with a finger, God touches the hearts of the Saints when He bestows upon them the grace of the Holy Spirit. And they feel His touch: because, having received the gift of inward virtue, they are stirred from the weakness of their carnality. They immediately become soldiers of the heavenly army, because through the power of the Holy Spirit they abandon what is weak and are prepared for undertaking mighty deeds in the warfare of Christ.
