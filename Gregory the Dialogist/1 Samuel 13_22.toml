33. What is understood by the lance, if not the keen foresight of the holy preachers? And what is shown by the sword, if not the subtlety of their understanding? For by the lance we pierce through things set before us at a distance. But by the sword, enemies near and almost joined to us are slain. Rightly therefore in the lance the foresight of the elect is shown, by which they strike hidden enemies before they suffer their nearby assault. For while they anticipate by guarding against the future ambushes of demons, they strike as if with a lance from afar those whose nearby blows they are unwilling to receive. Whence also the blessed apostle Paul, when he discerned the armed spirits of fornication from afar, held conjugal chastity as a lance and did not permit them to approach nearer, saying: 'Because of fornication, let each man have his own wife, and each woman her own husband. Let the husband render to the wife her due, and likewise the wife to the husband' (1 Cor. 7:2). And again: 'Come together again, lest Satan tempt you because of your incontinence' (ibid. 5). Hence also concerning himself he says: 'I chastise my body and bring it into subjection, lest preaching to others, I myself should become a castaway' (1 Cor. 9:27). For he who had chastised his body lest he become a castaway was surely piercing with a lance his enemies positioned at some distance before him. The foresight of abstinence for taming the lust of the flesh is therefore taken as a lance, by which approaching enemies are struck. Rightly also understanding is expressed by the sword, because whoever recognizes and rejects the wicked suggestions of the evil spirit in the present time strikes, as it were, an enemy nearby and placed right next to him. He also cuts as if with a sword sharpened on both edges, because he condemns both false goods and true evils. But what does it mean that the sword is said to be in the hand of Saul and Jonathan? They are not in the hand of those who keenly understand things near and present and foresee future things, yet do not exercise their strength to destroy them. They openly know that the ancient enemy casts down the greatest part of the human race through the power of the flesh into fornication, yet they do not take care to chastise the flesh through abstinence. So also some clearly see present evils but make no effort whatsoever to avoid them. These indeed have sword and lance, but do not have them in hand. Rightly therefore on the day of battle the sword and lance are found in the hand of Saul and Jonathan, because only the elect are those who both understand present and future evils and more ardently desire to overcome them with the intention of the heart. Yet this is said in this place so that the people may be shown to have held nothing in hand, who are shown to hold plowshares, hoes, axes, and weeding hooks. For by these words the elect are not distinguished from the reprobate, but the dull from the skilled. But since we have now shown the armed men, let us explain the manner of the contest.
