The reading of the holy Gospel which you have just heard, dearest brothers, does not need exposition, but exhortation. For human frailty does not presume to examine what Truth itself has expounded. But there is something you ought carefully to consider in this very exposition of the Lord: that if we were to tell you that the seed signifies the word, the field the world, the birds demons, the thorns riches, your mind would perhaps hesitate to believe us. Hence the same Lord deigned to expound through himself what he was saying, so that you might learn to seek the meanings of things even in those matters which he did not wish to explain through himself. Therefore by expounding what he said, he made it known that he was speaking figuratively, so that he might make you certain when our frailty opened up to you the figures of his words.

The words of the Lord which you perceive with your ears, retain in your mind. For the word of God is food for the mind. And just as food taken in is rejected when the stomach is weak, so a word that is heard is not retained in the belly of memory. But whoever does not retain nourishment, his life is surely despaired of. Therefore fear the danger of eternal death, if you receive the food of holy exhortation but do not keep in memory the words of life, that is, the nourishment of righteousness. Behold, everything you do passes away, and to the final judgment, without any intervening moment, you hasten daily, whether willing or unwilling. Why then is what must be left behind loved? Why is that to which we are heading neglected?
