And there were certain ones who said that the second Epistle of Peter, in which the Epistles of Paul are praised, was not his. But if they had been willing to weigh the words of that Epistle, they could have thought far otherwise. For in it is written: "A voice came down to him of this kind from the magnificent glory: This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased." And it is added: "And we heard this voice when we were with him on the holy mountain." Let them therefore read the Gospel, and they will immediately recognize that when that voice came from heaven, the Apostle Peter stood on the mountain with the Lord. Therefore he himself wrote this Epistle who heard this voice concerning the Lord on the mountain.
