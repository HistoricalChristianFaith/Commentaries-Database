27. It has been sufficiently repeated that Gibeah is interpreted as "hill." A hill, however, is not the summit itself, but an elevation of the mountains near to the summit. What is understood by this hill, if not the high and perfect life of faithful subjects? This life, although it may not be equal to the loftiness of preachers, is nevertheless clearly seen to be sublime far above the merits of others. Hence also concerning certain chief elect ones it is read in the Apocalypse: "No one could sing the canticle except those one hundred forty-four thousand" (Rev. 14:3). And demonstrating more clearly who they are, he says: "These are they who were not defiled with women, for they are virgins, and they follow the Lamb wherever he goes." Therefore, when spiritual battles are described, the people found in Gibeah of Benjamin are specifically recounted, because the choir of virgins is all the more violent against the ferocity of unclean spirits, the more they are wounded by none of their blows and polluted by no filth of their suggestion. Free indeed and whole, they are ready for the encounter, strong for the strike. Are not those on the hill the sons of the right hand, whom the beloved of Jesus regards for the merit of their integrity, saying: "I saw upon Mount Zion the Lamb standing, and with him one hundred forty-four thousand"? (Rev. 14:1.) But unless they were exceedingly strong, they could by no means ascend, wearied, to such a height. Likewise, unless they were free from all thoughts, they would be unable to run everywhere after the Lamb. Therefore, because every virgin is admirable in the triumph of hidden combat, when the order of battle is described, under the type of the people of Gibeah, the special dignity of virginity is commemorated. There follows: (Verses 16–18.) Now the Philistines had gone up to Michmash. And three companies went out from the camp of the Philistines to plunder: one company was heading toward the road of Ephraim, to the land of Shual; another was entering by the road of Beth-horon; and the third turned toward the road of the border in the land of Sheba, overlooking the valley of Zeboim, toward the desert.
