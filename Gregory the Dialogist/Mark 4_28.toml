The Lord describes these steps under the name of harvest, saying: "So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed into the ground, and should sleep, and rise night and day, and the seed should spring and grow up, while he knows not how. For the earth brings forth fruit of itself: first the blade, then the ear, then the full grain in the ear. And when the fruit has come forth, immediately he puts in the sickle, because the harvest time has come." A man casts seed into the ground when he plants a good intention in his heart. And after he has cast the seed, he sleeps, because he rests in the hope of good work. But he rises night and day, because he advances through adversity and prosperity. And the seed sprouts and grows while he knows not, because even when he is not yet able to measure his growth, the virtue once conceived is led toward advancement. And the earth brings forth fruit of itself, because, with grace going before it, the mind of man rises spontaneously to the fruit of good work. But this same earth first produces the blade, then the ear, then the full grain in the ear. For to produce the blade is to still have the tenderness of a good beginning. But the blade reaches the ear when the virtue conceived in the soul draws itself forward to the advancement of good work. And it bears full grain in the ear when virtue now advances so greatly that it can become robust and perfect work. But when the fruit has come forth, immediately he puts in the sickle, because the harvest time has come. For Almighty God, when the fruit has been produced, puts in the sickle and cuts down his harvest, because when he has led each one to perfect works, he cuts short his temporal life by the sentence sent forth, so that he may bring his grain to the heavenly barns. Therefore, when we conceive good desires, we cast seed into the ground. When we begin to do right things, we are the blade. When we grow toward the advancement of good work, we reach the ear. And when we are made firm in the perfection of this same good work, we now bring forth full grain in the ear.
