17.  A little above it had been said, With Him is wisdom and strength; but now it is said, With Him is strength and wisdom.  For because Almighty God, when in the mystery of pitifulness He was made Man, first gave the lesson of mildness, and afterwards at the Judgment He shows what strength He is of; it is rightly done that in the place above Wisdom is mentioned before Strength, when the thing is spoken of the Only Begotten Son of the Father, With Him is Wisdom and Strength.  But forasmuch as when He cometh to judge, He will appear in the terribleness of His power, and the damned being cast off, will manifest to His Elect in His everlasting kingdom, how He is ‘the Wisdom’ of the Father, it is lightly said in the subsequent sentence, that with Him is first ‘strength’ and then ‘wisdom.’  Thus in the first words wherein he saith, With Him is wisdom and strength; he plainly shows, that what He taught in mildness how to believe, in the power of the Judgment He will exhibit in terribleness.  But in the subsequent words, wherein He saith, With Him is strength and wisdom; He makes it clearer than the day, that He first destroys reprobate men in the Judgment by dint of power, and afterwards shines into the souls of the Elect with the perfect light of the eternal kingdom.  But because before the day of final Judgment, He never ceases daily to judge the deeds of mortal men by His secret awards, He comes back to that which is done in this present time.
