8.  What is the ‘place’ of the hypocrite, saving the heart of his flatterers?  For there he rests, where he finds partialities towards him.  Therefore ‘the eye that saw him shall see him no more,’ because being removed by death, he is hidden from his foolish lovers, who were wont to behold him, admiring him.  ‘Neither shall his place any more behold him,’ because the tongues of his flatterers do not follow him with their partialities to the Judgment.  Yet so long as he lives he does not cease to teach his followers likewise the things that he practises himself; and through the frowardness of his erring way he begets others also in a likeness to that false pretension which he shows forth.
