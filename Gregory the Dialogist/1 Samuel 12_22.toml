But the fruit by which vain things are despised is suggested when it is added: "And the Lord will not forsake his people for the sake of his great name, because the Lord has sworn to make them a people for himself."

14. These vain things inflict a great evil upon those who turn aside after them: because while they pursue earthly things in a disordered way, they are abandoned by the supreme and omnipotent God to endure future torments. Therefore, to those who are forbidden to turn aside after vain things, the prophet rightly makes a promise, saying: "The Lord will not forsake His people for the sake of His great name." Because those who despise vain things for the love of Him are rescued from true evils, and by faith in the promise they receive the reward of an eternal inheritance. Indeed, the Lord makes them His people whom He raises up to the joys of eternal blessedness. For there, with the glory of His majesty revealed, He presides over those whom in the world He holds, taken up from the love of vanity by His hidden grace. To swear to the Lord is to make a promise and to make Him one's people; the Lord swears to the one who does not turn aside after vain things: because earthly things must be despised so that we may deserve to obtain the goods of an eternal inheritance. Yet let no one believe that he can be brought to those things by his own merits; because here it is strictly expressed: "For the sake of His great name." For it is not by our goodness, but by God's, that an earthly man enjoys heavenly goods. For it is the gift of God, not from ourselves.
