In every step of the fall, the beginning is represented by the lighter faults that later, with the increase of guilt, become more and more serious. Here the evilness of this hypocrite is analyzed through his progressive iniquities. First, he presents himself as a righteous person, which he is not at all. Then, he scorns the righteous. Finally, he even insults the Creator. Indeed, the soul never stays in the place where it fell, because, after falling voluntarily, the weight of its evilness leads it to worse and worse actions. And so, by precipitating [the fall], it is submerged more and more deeply. Let the hypocrite then go now and seek for his own praises. Later he will oppress the life of his neighbor, and one day he will even scorn his own Creator. The more he devises arrogant attitudes, the more he sinks into atrocious punishments as a result. - "Morals on the Book of Job 31.28"

For he whom the grace of charity does not fall upon looks upon his neighbor as a stranger, even though he has himself begotten him to God. Doubtless all are hypocrites whose minds in truth, while ever aiming at outward objects, become insensible within. While they are ever seeking their own, in everything they do they are not softened by any compassion of charity for the feelings of the neighbor.… But hypocrites do not know these gut level feelings of charity. Because the more their mind is let loose on outward subjects by worldly concupiscence, the more it is hardened inside by its lack of affection. And it is frozen by a benumbing torpor within, because it is softened by fatal love outside. It is unable to reflect upon itself, because it does not strive to think of itself. A mind cannot think on itself which is not entirely at home in itself. It is unable to be entirely at home in itself, because by as many lusts as it is hurried away, by as many objects as it is distracted from itself and scattered, it lies below, though with collected strength it may rise, if it willed, to the greatest heights.…
“God has deprived it of its wisdom, nor has he given it understanding.” Although to deprive is one thing and “not to give” is another, yet his first expression, “deprived,” he repeated by subjoining “has not given.” As if he were saying, My expression “deprived” means not that he has unjustly taken away wisdom but that he has justly not given it. Hence the Lord is described as having hardened the heart of Pharaoh, not because he himself inflicted hardness or, in accord with the demands of his deserts, because he softened it by a sensibility of heavenly infused fear. But now, because the hypocrite pretends that he is holy and conceals himself under the semblance of good works, he keeps down peace of the holy church and is therefore, before our eyes, arrayed with the appearance of religion. But if any temptation of his faith springs up, the rabid mind of the wolf strips itself of its garb of sheep’s skin and shows by persecution how greatly it rages against the holy. - "Morals on the Book of Job 31.17–26"

42. The ostrich raiseth her wings on high, when the synagogue opposes its Creator, not as before by dreading, but by now openly withstanding, Him. For being changed into the limbs of the devil, and believing the man of lies to be God, it exalts itself the higher against the faithful, the more it boasts also, that it is itself the body of God. And because it despises, not only the Manhood of the Lord, but also His very Godhead, it scorns, not merely the horseman, but the rider of the horseman also. For, without violating the unity of the Person, it can be understood that the Word of God then mounted the rider, when he created for Himself a living Body within the womb of the Virgin. He then mounted the horseman, when, by creating Himself, He brought under the yoke of Divine worship a human soul, possessing power over its own flesh. For the Godhead assumed the flesh, by the intervention of the soul, and by this means He held together the whole horseman; [S. Aug. de Fid. et Symb. §. 10.] because He joined together in Himself, not that only which was ruled, but that also which ruled. Judaea therefore, because, having been caught in the snare of seduction, by the coming of haughty Antichrist, it scoffs at our Redeemer, for having been lowly among men, scorns the horseman. But because it, in every thing, denies His Godhead, it scorns equally his rider also. But our Redeemer is, in one and the same person, both the horseman and the rider of the horseman; and, when He came into the world, He set forth mighty preachers against the world; and when, in the end of the world, He endures the craft of Antichrist, He supplies strength to those, who contend in His behalf: that so, when our ancient enemy is set free in that liberty of his which is speedily to be terminated, our faithful ones may receive so much greater strength, the more they have to fight against an adversary who has been let loose. Whence in this place, when the ostrich is described as raising her wings, and scorning the horseman and his rider, the mention of mighty preachers is immediately subjoined.

27. For what do we understand by the wings of this ostrich, except the thoughts of the hypocrite, kept close at this time as if folded together? But when the time shall come, he raises them on high; because when an opportunity is found, he makes them manifest by his pride. To raise the wings on high, is to disclose his thoughts with unbridled haughtiness. But now, because he pretends that he is holy, because he confines what he thinks to himself, he folds, as it were, his wings on his body, by humility. But it must be observed, that He says not, The horse and his rider, but, The horseman and his rider. For the horse is the body which belongs to each holy soul, which it knows in truth both how to restrain from unlawful pursuits by the bit of continence, and again to let loose by the impulse of charity, in the exercise of good works. By the name, therefore, of ‘horseman’ is expressed the soul of a holy man, which keeps the body, its beast of burden [‘jumentum corporis.’], under good control. Whence also the Apostle John, in the Apocalypse, having beheld the Lord, says; And the armies which are in heaven, were following Him on white horses. [Rev. 19, 14] For he rightly calls an army, the multitude of the Saints, which had toiled in this war of martyrdom. And they are said, for this reason, to sit on white horses, because their bodies doubtless were brilliant with both the light of righteousness, and the whiteness of chastity. The hypocrite therefore scorns the horseman, because, when he has burst forth in open iniquity, he despises the sanctity of the Elect; and in his pride calls those fools, whom he used to imitate with cunning art, when kept down by the peace of the faith. But who else is the rider of this horseman, but Almighty God, Who both, foreseeing, created those things which were not, and possessing, rules over those which are? For he surely mounts the horseman, because He possesses the soul of every holy man, who possesses his own members aright. For this hypocrite then to scorn the horseman, is for him to despise the saints: but to scorn the rider of the horseman, is for him to leap forward even to do wrong to the Creator.
28. For since in every lapse, men always begin with the smallest faults, and as defects secretly grow up, attain to more grievous sins, the iniquity of this hypocrite is rightly distinguished by a statement of his losses, so that he is said first, to set himself forth as the good thing, which he is not; that he afterwards openly scorns the good; and lastly, that he leaps forth even to do wrong to his Creator. For a soul never lies in the spot where it has fallen; because having once fallen of its own accord, it is carried on to greater sins by the weight of its own iniquity, so that, as it sinks into the deep, it is ever overwhelmed still deeper. Let the hypocrite then go, and seek for his own praises, let him afterwards oppress the life of his neighbours, and exercise himself at last in deriding his Creator: in order that, as he ever cherishes prouder thoughts, he may overwhelm himself thereby in more awful punishments. O how many such does Holy Church now tolerate, whom open temptation makes manifest, when the time has suddenly arrived. But because they do not now put forth their wills against her, they meanwhile press close, as it were, the folded wings of their thoughts. For since this life is passed in common by the good and the evil, the Church is now visibly made up of a number of each of these. But it is distinguished in God’s invisible judgment, and, at its end, is separated from the society of the wicked. But at present the good cannot exist therein without the wicked, nor the wicked without the good. For at this time the two parts are necessarily united and fitted to each other, in order that both the wicked may be changed by the examples of the good, and the good be purified by the temptations of the wicked. And therefore, the Lord, after having introduced under the image of the ostrich many remarks on the rejection of the hypocrites, immediately turns to speak of the lot of the Elect, in order that they who had heard in those what to fly from and endure, might hear in these what to imitate and love.
