Again, the kingdom of heaven is said to be like a net cast into the sea, gathering fish of every kind. The Holy Church is compared to a net, because it has been entrusted to fishermen, and through it each person is drawn from the waves of the present age to the eternal kingdom, lest they be plunged into the depths of eternal death. It gathers fish of every kind, because it calls to the forgiveness of sins the wise and the foolish, the free and the enslaved, the rich and the poor, the strong and the weak. Hence it is said to God through the Psalmist: To you all flesh shall come. This net, namely, is universally filled when at its end the sum total of the human race is enclosed.
