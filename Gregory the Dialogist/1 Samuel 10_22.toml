35. For they hide themselves so as not to be found, because they flee from undertaking a dignity whose burden they judge themselves unequal to bear. For spiritual leadership has the outward glory of dignity, and it also has the greatness of its inward labor. For a ruler is both honored by his subjects and bears those by whom he is honored. When therefore from the beginning of honor a cause of burden arises, because from the very source whence honor is received by the ruler, he takes on that by which he is weighed down. Although honor of dignity is in itself a great burden upon the mind, because it ought to be despised, and yet it pleases. It ought indeed to be despised lest it lift up the mind through pride; and it ought to be accepted, so that subjects may reverence the heavenly things which the teacher speaks. A heavier burden therefore arises from honor, because the chosen pastor can bear it only by great strength of soul—namely, to despise in himself what he receives in himself for God's sake, so that he may be such a one for God yet not be such for himself, and may deny himself yet not deny himself; so that what he is, he may be for God, and what he is for himself, he may not be. And so the honor offered by a subject is accepted, so that preaching may be commended. The preacher also despises the honor offered, because he is not puffed up by being honored, but rejoices that the ministry of the word of God is commended. But how difficult this is to accomplish is better grasped by thinking than by speaking. For it is impossible for weak minds to bear bravely the burden of others and to manage by strength of mind the reverence of honor offered to them—so that amid the attentions of that same honor, one may know how to rejoice in the progress of subjects and not know how to swell with pride on account of the reverence shown to oneself. Because therefore chosen men do not wish to displease God, when called they flee from undertaking the office of leadership. But they hold that very flight from ministry as a virtue of humility, not as a boast of dignity. For they flee as much as they can; but if they have been appointed by the Lord, they can by no means remain hidden. For the same reason Saul is hidden at home, but at the Lord's revealing he is shown forth, because chosen men withdraw themselves from the outward ministries of holy Church, yet by the Lord's dispensation they are brought forward to administer outward ministries. But because now in holy Church those who withdraw themselves from such great honors are few, while those who thrust themselves forward are many, those who thrust themselves forward ought to note this: that he who is said by the prophet to have been hidden at home was being sought not for the spiritual dignity of the Church, but for the secular glory of a kingdom. For they were not seeking to make him a pontiff, but they wanted to make him king. Let the priest therefore see with what disposition the summit of holy Church ought to be fled from, if kings so cautiously flee from ascending the summit of the world. But because holy men, the more earnestly they refuse to accept the rank of leadership, are the more devoutly sought after by devoted peoples, there follows: 'They ran and brought him from there.'
