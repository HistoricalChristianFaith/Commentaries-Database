74. Upon every soul, over which the Lord mercifully rules, He confers, above all things, the strength of faith: of which Peter says, Your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, goeth about, seeking whom he may devour, whom resist, strong in the faith. [l Pet. 5, 8. 9.] But neighing is joined to this strength, when that takes place which is written, With the heart man believeth unto righteousness, but with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. [Rom. 10, 10]

43. In Holy Scripture there is sometimes expressed under the term ‘horse,’ the slippery life of the wicked, sometimes temporal dignity, sometimes this present world itself, sometimes the preparation of right intention, sometimes a holy preacher.
For under the term ‘horse’ is signified the slippery life of the wicked, as it is written; Be ye not as the horse and mule. [Ps. 32, 9] And as is said by another Prophet, They were made wanton horses, and stallions, every one was neighing after his neighbour’s wife. [Jer. 5, 8]
By the name ‘horse’ is understood temporal dignity, as Solomon witnesses, who says, I have seen servants upon horses, and princes walking as servants upon the earth. [Eccles. 10, 7] For every one who sins is the servant of sin, and servants are upon horses, when sinners are elated with the dignities of the present life. But princes walk as servants, when no honour exalts many who are full of the dignity of virtues, but when the greatest misfortune here presses them down, as though unworthy. Hence it is said again; They have slumbered who mounted horses. [Ps. 76, 6] That is, in the death of the soul, they, who trusted in the honour of the present life, have closed the eyes of their mind to the light of truth.
Under the name of ‘horse’ is designated this present world, as is said by the voice of Jacob; Let Dan be a serpent by the way, a horned snake in the path, that biteth the horses’ hoofs, that his rider falleth backward. [Gen. 49, 17] In which testimony we set forth more plainly what ‘horse’ signifies, if we consider the circumstances somewhat more minutely. For some say, that Antichrist is coming out of the tribe of Dan, because in this place Dan is asserted to be a serpent, and a biting one. Whence also, when the people of Israel were choosing their position, in the partition of the camp, Dan most rightly first pitched his camp to the north; signifying him in truth, who had said in his heart; I will sit upon the mount of the testament, in the sides of the north; I will ascend above the height of the clouds. I will be like the Most High. [Is. 14, 13. 14.] Of whom also it is said by the Prophet; The snorting of his horses was heard from Dan. [Jer. 8, 16] But he is called not only a serpent, but a horned serpent, (cerastes.) For keVata in Greek are called ‘cornua’ in Latin. And this serpent, by whom the coming of Antichrist is fitly set forth, is said to be horned: because, together with the bite of pestilent preaching, he is armed also against the life of the faithful with the horns of power. But who can be ignorant that a path is narrower than a way? Dan therefore becomes a serpent in the way, because he compels those, whom he flatters by seeming to spare them, to walk in the broad way of the present life: but he bites them in the way, because he destroys with the poison of his error those on whom he confers liberty. He becomes a horned serpent in the path, because those whom he finds to be faithful, and to be confining themselves to the narrow paths of the heavenly precept, he not only assails with the wickedness of crafty persuasion, but also oppresses with the terror of his power. And, after the kindness of pretended sweetness, he employs the horns of his power in the torture of persecution. In which passage, the ‘horse’ signifies this world, which foams through its pride in the lapse of passing times. And, because Antichrist strives to seize the latter end of the world, this horned serpent is said to bite the horses’ hoofs. For, to bite the horses’ hoofs, is to reach the ends of the world by striking them; That its rider falleth backward. The rider of the horse, is every one who is exalted in worldly dignities; who is said to fall backwards, and not on his face; as Saul is said to have fallen. For, to fall on his face, is for each one to confess his own faults, in this life, and to bewail them with penitence. But to fall backward, where one cannot see, is to depart suddenly out of this life, and to know not to what punishments he is being led. And because Judaea, entangled with the snares of its own error, is looking for Antichrist, instead of Christ, Jacob, in the same passage, rightly turned round suddenly in the language of the Elect, saying; I will wait for Thy salvation, O Lord; [Gen.49, 18] that is, I do not, as the infidels, believe in Antichrist, but I faithfully believe Him, Who is about to come for our redemption, even the true Christ.
By the name ‘horse’ is understood the preparation of right intention, as it is written, The horse is prepared against the day of battle, but the Lord giveth safety; [Prov.21, 31] because the mind prepares itself indeed against temptation, but contends not healthfully, unless it he assisted from above.
By the name ‘horse’ is understood each holy preacher, as the Prophet witnesses, who says; Thou sentest Thine horses into the sea, disturbing many waters. [Hab. 3, 15] For the waters, in truth, lay quiet, because the minds of men were lulled to rest a long while, beneath the torpor of their sins. But the sea was disturbed by the horses of God; because, when holy preachers had been sent, every heart which was benumbed with fatal security, was alarmed by the shock of wholesome fear. In this place, therefore, a holy preacher is understood by the name ‘horse,’ when it is said to blessed Job; Wilt thou give the horse strength, or with thou surround his neck with neighing?
44. But what is meant by the Lord’s saying, that He first gives strength to this horse, and afterwards surrounds his neck with neighing? For by neighing is set forth the voice of preaching. But every true preacher receives, first, strength, and afterwards neighing, because, when he has first extinguished sin in himself, he then attains to the voice of preaching, for the instruction of others. This horse hath strength, because he firmly endures adversity. He hath neighing, because by blandishment he invites to heavenly things. The Lord declares, that He gives both strength and neighing to this horse, because unless both life and teaching meet together in His preacher, the virtue of perfection will never appear. For it avails not much, though he is supported by the doings of an exalted life, if he is yet unable to rouse others by his words to his own sentiments. Or, what avails it to kindle others by his speaking well, if he makes it plain that he has himself become slothful by living ill. Because therefore it is necessary for both these to meet together in a preacher, for his perfection, the Lord confers on His horse both the neighing of voice, with boldness of action, and boldness of action, with neighing of voice. And we must observe, why neighing, which is doubtless uttered inwardly through the throat, is said to be placed round the neck of the horse, that is, to be drawn in a circle outwardly. Because, namely, the voice of preaching emanates from within, but encircles from without. For as it rouses others to good living, it binds also the conduct of the preacher to good deeds, in order that his conduct may go not beyond his words, nor his life contradict his speech. The neighing then is placed round the neck of the horse, because the life of a preacher is restrained, even by his own words, from breaking forth into deeds of wickedness. Hence is it, that a collar is given as a reward to men who fight with all their power; in order that they may ever perform greater deeds, because they bear the tokens of valour; and may fear to incur the charge of weakness, while that, which they display on themselves, is already the reward of their bravery. Whence it is rightly said by Solomon to every hearer, in praise of wisdom; Thou shall receive a crown of grace for thy head, and a collar of gold for thy neck. [Prov. 1, 9]

29. But perhaps before we discuss this strength and neighing of the horse, some persons are desirous of having both the strength of the rhinoceros, and the folly of this ostrich explained in another way, putting aside their moral meaning. For the word of God is manna, and gives, in truth, that taste in the mouth of the eater, which the wish of him who partakes it rightly desires. The word of God is the earth, which produces fruit more abundantly, the more the labour of the enquirer demands. The meaning, therefore, of Holy Scripture should be sifted with manifold enquiry, for even the earth, which is often turned by the plough, is fitted to produce a more abundant crop. We therefore briefly touch upon our other view of the rhinoceros and ostrich, because we are hastening onward to unravel those questions which are more complicated. This rhinoceros, which is called also the ‘monoceros’ in Greek copies, is said to be of such great strength, as not to be taken by any skill of hunters. But, as those persons assert, who have striven with laborious investigation in describing the natures of animals, a virgin is placed before it, who opens to it her bosom as it approaches, in which, having put aside all its ferocity, it lays down its head, and is thus suddenly found as it were unarmed, by those by whom it is sought to be taken. It is also described as being of box colour, and whenever it engages with elephants, it is said to strike with that single horn, which it bears on its nostrils, the belly of its opponents, in order to easily overthrow its assailants, when it wounds their softer parts. By this rhinoceros, or certainly monoceros, that is, the unicorn, can therefore be understood that people, who when it adopted, not good works, but merely pride among all men, at its reception of the Law, carried, as it were, a singular horn among other beasts. Whence the Lord, foretelling His Passion by the voice of the Prophet, says; Save Me from the lion’s mouth, and My humility from the horns of the unicorns. [Ps. 22, 21] For as many unicorns, or certainly rhinoceroses, existed in that nation, as many as were those who with singular and foolish pride confided in the works of the Law, in opposition to the preaching of the truth. It is said therefore to blessed Job, as a type of the Church.
