What does it mean that the world is enrolled when the Lord is about to be born, except that this is openly shown: that he was coming in the flesh who would enroll his elect in eternity? Concerning the reprobate, by contrast, it is said through the Prophet: Let them be blotted out of the book of the living, and let them not be written with the just.
