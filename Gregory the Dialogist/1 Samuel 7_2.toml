3. Those who had not removed the foreign gods from their midst, except by good will, how were they resting after the Lord? All of which things, if they are investigated spiritually, the days of the ark's sojourn are multiplied. But when it remains in Gibeah; when it remains in the custody of Eleazar; because when the care of faithful souls is entrusted to devout preachers, the perfection of religion, which is bestowed through lofty doctrine, is fulfilled by the pursuit of good works. Whence also the twentieth year was then reported to be at hand. For if the number ten designates the perfection of the old Law, what does twenty signify, if not the more splendid religion of the new life? For the number twenty is ten doubled. Which number is certainly perfected in the conduct of the elect, when through love they avoid what the Law forbids and fulfill the lofty commandments of the Gospel.

4. But because we have referred the journey of the ark to the perfection of the contemplative life, the ark of God remains in Kiriath-jearim when the learned minds of contemplatives perfect the gift of that same learning of theirs in the delight of the heavenly brightness revealed to them. For the ark of God remains there now for twenty years, because chosen souls, raised to the summit of intimate exaltation, have the number ten in the perfection of knowledge, and the number twenty in heavenly delight. The multiplication of days can also be referred to the increases of spiritual virtues. Therefore, when the reason why the days are multiplied is stated more expressly, it is said to be the twentieth year: because, namely, the chosen minds of contemplatives, the more abundantly they are nourished by heavenly contemplation, the more fully they are illuminated by the splendors of spiritual virtues.

5. But what does it mean that in the twentieth year all Israel is said to rest after the Lord, except that the sublimity of the perfection of the elect does not consist in the strength of good works, but in the power of contemplation? For to rest after the Lord is to hold fast to the imitation of our Redeemer with invincible love. And whoever has not learned to love strongly by contemplating those ineffable joys of the heavenly city, because he can more frequently be cast down to love of the world, by no means rests after the Lord. When therefore the ark remains in Kiriath-jearim and the days are multiplied, all Israel rests after the Lord: because indeed, while the knowledge of the elect mind is raised to the experience of heavenly delight, while by the light of the glory poured forth the splendors of spiritual virtues are gathered together within it, it can hold fast to the imitation of the Lord all the more perseveringly because, illuminated by immense splendors, it cannot perceive those darknesses by which it might be separated from the true light. Whence also it is well that he who is said to rest after the Lord is declared to be Israel, that is, "seeing God": because the higher the contemplator is caught up into divine things, the less he is overcome by the human things which he powerfully restrains.
