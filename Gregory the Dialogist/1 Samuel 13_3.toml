5. Just as the battle line of the bridegroom excels in rank, so also it was the first to receive the titles of victory. For Jonathan struck the garrison of the Philistines: because chosen virginity, exalted by the citadel of continence over the flesh, extinguishes shameful impulses. And rightly it is called the garrison of the Philistines: because in the virginal body, carnal impulses do not have the rest of delight, but the standing of battle. They stand indeed: because they attack, but they cannot rest: because they do not in the least delight the holy mind. The garrison of the Philistines in Gibeah is therefore struck, when the desires of the flesh are thoroughly weakened by chosen virgins, and they obtain the peace of triumph, while they no longer have the accustomed wars. Toward which victory indeed, because they often advance by the exhortation of their elders, a thousand men are in Gibeah with Jonathan: but Jonathan is reported to have struck the camp of the Philistines. And because by the example of others, others are often stirred to the emulation of virtue, there follows: (Verses 3, 4.) And Jonathan struck the garrison of the Philistines, which was in Gibeah. When the Philistines had heard this, Saul sounded the trumpet throughout all the land, saying: Let the Hebrews hear. And all Israel heard this report: Saul has struck the garrison of the Philistines, and Israel rose up against the Philistines. Therefore the people cried out after Saul in Gilgal.
