30. The word of the kingdom is the honorable dignity of the pastor. For by its very display it speaks: because he is no mere uncle who is elevated by so great an order. Therefore the king does not reveal the word of the kingdom: because the pastor of the Church speaks with the great splendor of divinity, but does not speak with pride. He who indeed does not reveal the word conceals what he speaks. For the word always speaks to him for whom it is a word; otherwise it is not a word. Therefore he possesses the word of the kingdom who shines with that manner of life which, as if by speaking, provides to others examples of the heavenly journey. Therefore he does not reveal the word who does not disclose the greatness of his holiness through vainglory. He indeed has what he might reveal, but what is shown through itself he does not wish to proclaim. For he who shines with great dignity and great holiness shows many things by living which he does not say by speaking. The Lord surely wished the preacher to have this word of the kingdom when He commanded that bells be placed on the garment of the high priest (Exod. 28:34). The garment of the high priest is the display of a good manner of life. It is furnished, as it were, with many bells when it multiplies the good works that cry out as an example to the lesser ones. But the king does not dare to reveal the word of the kingdom: because it is commanded of priests that they bear the beauty of their garment before the Lord. He bears the beauty of his garment before the Lord who both shows forth good things and, from the display of good works, seeks to please not men outwardly through vanity, but God inwardly through love. Then certainly the priest is silent, but as he walks, what he wears cries out; because the chosen preacher does not proclaim himself by boasting, but never ceases to speak by living well. Let it therefore be said of Saul that he did not reveal to his uncle the word of the kingdom: because chosen men, when they receive the splendor of dignity or the growth of a good life, put themselves forward by examples, but conceal themselves in silence. And because they believe themselves to be lesser in merits than other chosen ones, he to whom he does not reveal the word is called his uncle. For an uncle is called the brother of the father. Moreover, the Redeemer of the human race makes as many sons unto the unfading glory of the eternal inheritance as He instructs in the sacraments of His faith and doctrine. For those who are instructed in the Church are, as it were, still little children. But he who now meets Him as a perfect man through great merits is a brother of the Redeemer. The blessed Apostle Paul, praising such men indeed, says: Heirs of God, co-heirs with Christ (Rom. 8:17). Because therefore perfect preachers regard other chosen and perfect ones as such and themselves as imperfect, the one who is reported to have questioned him about the word of the kingdom is called the uncle of Saul. Moreover, Samuel had spoken to Saul this same word of the kingdom: because chosen men have learned the spiritual manner of life which they possess from the speech of their elders. But the king who had been initiated through anointing had not yet been chosen by the people.
