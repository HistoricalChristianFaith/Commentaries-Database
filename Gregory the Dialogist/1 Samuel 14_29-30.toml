For what does it mean that he rebukes the father for having troubled the land, except that he reproves the leaders for having confused their own decrees through ignorance? By the name "land," the humility of subjects is designated, which is indeed seen to be troubled when, through the erring judgment of pastors, it seems to abandon the order of tranquil truth. And because while they eagerly seek the favors of arrogant men and try to assert that this is lawful, they bring forward their own accomplishments as testimony. "For you have seen," he says, "that my eyes were enlightened because I tasted a little of this honey." As if to say: I grew from the praise of my subjects while I strove not to be less than praises. For it is also the custom of chosen preachers that when they observe themselves being praised, they strive with all their strength to be what they hear about themselves from without. And therefore Jonathan reported that he had eaten a little honey: because the arrogant person thinks he freely receives the favors of the tongue for the advancement of life, not for the pursuit of vanity. But it is one thing entirely to strive to match the proclamations of praise with one's conduct, and another to seek praises in order to find advancement of life in those same praises. Indeed, those who strive to equal praises with their conduct are those who despise those very praises, who never wish to be praised by men. Certainly, as far as it lies in them, they vehemently flee from being praised, but because they cannot entirely escape being praised, they strive to be what they hear. But some, having displayed good works, wish to be praised for this reason: that once praised, they may ascend to a greater work of virtue. In this estimation of their presumption they are surely deceived, because whoever seeks praises in small matters, when he has done greater works, seeks praises more ardently and far more eagerly. And perhaps for this reason Jonathan was not able to reign after his father, because he signified those who, while they vainly exalt themselves, truly fail. He also added by way of reasoning, and says: "How much more if the people had eaten of the spoil of their enemies, would not the slaughter among the Philistines have been greater?" To taste a little honey on the tip of the rod is to glory in some way in the eloquence of doctrine. But to eat the spoil of enemies is to recall the works of virtue through memory and to rejoice in recollecting them. For one makes, as it were, the spoil of enemies when one brings to memory those things in which one prevailed against hidden foes. And one eats these to satiety who, as if he had done these things by his own virtue, vainly and vehemently exalts himself. Therefore he says: "How much more if the people had eaten of the spoil of their enemies, would not the slaughter among the Philistines have been greater?" As if to say: Since from a brief taste of favor there has been so great an advancement, what would chosen warriors do if they had full and lawful and just praises for their works? There follows: (Verse 31.) "Therefore they struck the Philistines on that day from Michmash to Aijalon."
