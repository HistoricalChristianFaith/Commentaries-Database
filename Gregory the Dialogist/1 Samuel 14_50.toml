For what is the wife of the preacher, if not good will? For he who is joined through love to good will, from her as from a noble spouse children are born to him. For when we wish to bring forth the fruit of good works, it is necessary that we first sow them in good will. Hence Ahinoam is fittingly interpreted as "brother's rest." For that brother of ours is He who, rising from the dead, spoke to Mary Magdalene saying: "Go, and tell my brothers: I ascend to my Father and your Father" (John 20:17). Hence Paul, asserting the nobility of the elect, says: "Heirs of God, co-heirs with Christ" (Rom. 8:17). What is meant by "brother's rest," except that the Redeemer of the human race rests in the good will of His co-heirs? And because good will is bestowed upon us by Him by whom it is inhabited, she is said to be the daughter of Ahimaaz. For Ahimaaz is interpreted as "brother's beauty," or "brother who is beauty." For our Redeemer is called both brother and beauty, because human nature lost the vigor of its dignity through the sin of the first man, but in the person of the Redeemer it shone forth with increased splendor. He is indeed our beauty, because all who shine with the brightness of virtues in the holy Church receive from the fullness of His light. Hence Paul says: "In Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily" (Col. 2:9). Therefore, when the prophet Samuel regards the good will of our preachers, he expresses what he has seen through types, saying: "Ahinoam the daughter of Ahimaaz," because indeed the beauty of good will is great, but it is born from the infusion of the Redeemer. For she ought to be loved as a wife, but if one looks to the father, she is loved all the more on account of her nobility.

Abner is said to mean "my father is a lamp," and Ner is also said to mean "lamp." What then is Ner understood to be, except the word of the Scriptures? Indeed, the letter of holy Scripture is like the clay vessel of this lamp, while the spiritual understanding is the brightness of its light, and its oil is the devotion of love. Therefore, he is a son of the lamp who willingly hears the words of the Scriptures, and wisely understands them, and what he gathers through understanding, he grasps through the affection of charity. Why then is he called a son of the lamp, unless because what is born from light is light? For what is sin, if not darkness? And likewise, what is a good work, if not light? For when holy men direct the steps of their works according to the guidance of the Scriptures, they receive, as it were, light from light through spiritual instruction. Indeed, John, expressing this light from light, says: 'Everyone who is born of God does not sin, because the heavenly birth preserves him' (1 John 5:18). What is it to be born of God, except to love His will as it is known in the holy Scriptures? And what is it not to sin, except to stand always in the light of justice? For the blessed apostle Peter wished, as it were, to make us light from light, when he said: 'You have the prophetic word, to which you do well to attend, as to a lamp shining in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts' (2 Peter 1:19). Rightly therefore Abner is called "my father is a lamp," and his own father is also named "lamp," because those in the holy Church can shine for others by their examples who have received both the brightness of light and the oil of perfect charity from the instruction of the Scriptures. But through John it is said "does not sin," so as to suggest the strength of preachers, who extend their hand to sinners in such a way that they themselves are not stained by the darkness of sins.
