26.  If blessed Job bears the likeness of our Redeemer in His Passion, how is it that the Lord says to Satan, Thou moved at Me against him?  Truly the Mediator between God and man, the Man Christ Jesus, came to bear the scourges of our mortal nature, that He might put away the sins of our disobedience; but forasmuch as He is of one and the self-same nature with the Father, how does the Father declare that He was moved by Satan against Him, when it is acknowledged that no inequality of power, no diversity of will, interrupts the harmony between the Father and the Son?  Yet He, that is equal to the Father by the Divine Nature, came for our sakes to be under stripes in a fleshly nature.  Which stripes He would never have undergone, if he had not taken the form of accursed man in the work of their redemption.  And unless the first man had transgressed, the second would never have come to the ignominies of the Passion.  When then the first man was moved by Satan from the Lord, then the Lord was moved against the second Man.  And so Satan then moved the Lord to the affliction of this latter, when the sin of disobedience brought down the first man from the height of uprightness.  For if he had not drawn the first Adam by wilful sin into the death of the soul, the second Adam, being without sin, would never have come into the voluntary death of the flesh, and therefore it is with justice said to him of our Redeemer too, Thou movedst Me against him to afflict [E.V. destroy] him without cause.  As though it were said in plainer words; ‘Whereas this Man dies not on His own account, but on account of that other, thou didst then move Me to the afflicting of This one, when thou didst withdraw that other from Me by thy cunning persuasions.’  And of Him it is rightly added, without cause.  For ‘he was destroyed without cause,’ who was at once weighed to the earth by the avenging of sin, and not defiled by the pollution of sin.  He ‘was destroyed without cause,’ Who, being made incarnate, had no sins of His own, and yet being without offence took upon Himself the punishment of the carnal.  For it is hence that speaking by the Prophet He says, Then I restored that which I took not away.  For that other that was created for Paradise would in his pride have usurped the semblance of the Divine power, yet the Mediator, Who was without guilt, discharged the guilt of that pride.  It is hence that a Wise Man saith to the Father; Forasmuch then as Thou art righteous Thyself, Thou orderest all things righteously; Thou condemnest Him too that deserveth not to be punished. [Wisd. 12, 15. Vulg.]
27.  But we must consider how He is righteous and ordereth all things righteously, if He condemns Him that deserveth not to be punished.  For our Mediator deserved not to be punished for Himself, because He never was guilty of any defilement of sin.  But if He had not Himself undertaken a death not due to Him, He would never have freed us from one that was justly due to us.  And so whereas ‘The Father is righteous,’ in punishing a righteous man, ‘He ordereth all things righteously,’ in that by these means He justifies all things, viz. that for the sake of sinners He condemns Him Who is without sin; that all the Elect [electa omnia] might rise up to the height of righteousness, in proportion as He Who is above all underwent the penalties of our unrighteousness.  What then is in that place called ‘being condemned without deserving,’ is here spoken of as being ‘afflicted without cause.’  Yet though in respect of Himself He was ‘afflicted without cause,’ in respect of our deeds it was not ‘without cause.’  For the rust of sin could not be cleared away, but by the fire of torment, He then came without sin, Who should submit Himself voluntarily to torment, that the chastisements due to our wickedness might justly loose the parties thereto obnoxious, in that they had unjustly kept Him, Who was free of them.  Thus it was both without cause, and not without cause, that He was afflicted, Who had indeed no crimes in Himself, but Who cleansed with His blood the stain of our guilt.

How could it be that the Lord says to Satan, “You incited me against him?” especially if we assume that blessed Job is an anticipation of the Redeemer in his passion? Truly the Mediator between God and man, the man Christ Jesus, came to bear the scourges of our mortal nature that he might put away the sins of our disobedience. But, seeing that he is of one and the self-same nature with the Father, how does the Father declare that he was moved by Satan against him, when it is acknowledged that no inequality of power, no diversity of will, interrupts the harmony between the Father and the Son? Yet he who is equal to the Father by the divine nature came for our sakes to be flogged in his human nature. He would have never endured these stripes if he had not taken the form of accursed human beings in the work of their redemption. And unless the first man had transgressed, the second would never have come to the humiliation and disgrace of the passion. When Satan moved the first man from the Lord, then the Lord was moved against the second Man. And so, Satan then moved the Lord to the affliction of this second Man, when the sin of disobedience brought down the first man from the height of uprightness. For if the devil had not drawn the first Adam by willful sin into the death of the soul, the second Adam, being without sin, would have never come to the voluntary death of the flesh.
