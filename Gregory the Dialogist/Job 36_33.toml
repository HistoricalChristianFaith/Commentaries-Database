28. The friend of truth is a lover of upright conduct. Whence the Truth Itself says to Its disciples, Ye are My friends, if ye have done what I command you. [John 15, 14] For a friend is named as ‘the keeper of the soul;’ [‘amicus, quasi animi custos.’ Isid. Etym. x. 14] and hence he who endeavours to guard the will of God in His precepts is, not undeservedly, called His friend. Hence is it that the Truth again says to the same disciples, But I have called you friends, for all things that I have heard of My Father I have made known unto you. [John 15, 15] Of this light then of the eternal country, God announces to His friend, that it is his possession, that he should not despair of himself from the frailness of his own infirmity; that he should not think what he was made, but what he was new made; but should know more certainly that he possesses this light, the more truly he is now trampling down the gloom of assailing sins. But it is well subjoined in promise, And that he may come up to it. For what is more difficult than for a man born on the earth, and bearing about earthly and fragile members, to ascend the heights of heaven, and to penetrate the secrets of the spirits above?
29. But the Maker of these very spirits has come to us, and exhibited Himself as a man, even beneath them, as is said of Him to the Father by the Prophet, Thou hast made Him a little lower than the angels. [Ps. 8, 5] And because He found between these selfsame spirits and ourselves the stumbling-block of a discordant life, with wonderful power, and with still more wonderful kindness, creating the higher, and taking on Him the lower nature, He united the highest and lowest together. Hence is it that, on the birth of this selfsame King, the bands of Angels come forth to announce Him, sing a hymn, and, the discordance of their evil conduct being overcome, acknowledge those, as citizens, of whom they before despaired: proclaiming with harmonious voice, Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace to men of good will. [Luke 2, 14] As if they said plainly; Those whom wickedness had separated, let the Goodness now born on earth unite to us. Hence is it, that before His Incarnation we read in the Old Testament, that a man adored an Angel,
[Hom. 8. in Evang. he names Lot and Joshua. The former, perhaps, only bowed as to guests. In judging of the latter instance Deut. 34, 10. must not be forgotten. See also Dan. 12, 1]
and was not forbidden to adore him. [Gen.19, 13-16] But when after the coming of the Redeemer, John had prostrated himself to adore the Angel, he heard, See thou do it not, I am thy fellow-servant, and of thy brethren. [Rev. 19, 10] For what is meant by the Angels first patiently allowing themselves to be adored by man, and afterwards refusing it; except, that at first the more abject they knew man to be, who had been given up to carnal corruptions, and was not yet delivered from this condition, the more justly did they despise Him, but that afterwards they could not keep human nature in subjection under them, inasmuch as they beheld it, in their Maker, exalted even above themselves? For that nature ought no longer to be despised, and degraded in the members, which, exalted in the head of the members, deserved to be venerated. He then, Who became lower than the Angels for our sake, made us equal to the Angels by the virtue of His humiliation. [Heb. 2, 7] Whence He also taught us by dying, that death is not to be dreaded, by His rising again, to be confident of life, by His ascension, to exult in our inheritance of the heavenly country. That so the members also may rejoice, that they are following to the same place, where they see that their Head has gone before. Whence it is well said by this our Head Himself, Wheresoever the carcase is, there will also the eagles be gathered together. [Matt. 24, 28] Whence Peter says, To an inheritance incorruptible, undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reserved in the heavens. [1 Pet. 1, 4] Whence Paul says, We know that if our earthly house this habitation be dissolved, we have a building of God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens. [2 Cor. 5, 1]
30. But if we also, who are born on the earth, ascend into heaven, where is that which the Truth again says, No man hath ascended into heaven, but He that came down from heaven, the Son of Man Which is in heaven? [John 3, 13] For to this sentence, that which the same Truth says is directly opposed, Father, I will that where I am, they may be with Me also. [John 17, 24] But yet It is not at variance with Itself in Its words, but It inflames the zeal of our mind to enquire into these things, which seem at variance. For all we, who are born in His faith, are doubtless His body. Because then the Lord has, by a marvellous dispensation of condescension, been made the Head of His own members, He is alone, even when with us, the multitude of the reprobate having been cast off. No man, therefore, ascends into heaven, but He that came down from heaven, the Son of Man Who is in heaven. For, since we have been already made one with Him, He returns alone, even in us, to that place, from whence He came alone in Himself; and He Who ever is in heaven, ascends daily to heaven; because He Who remains in His Godhead above all things, draws Himself up daily to heaven, in the body of His Manhood. Let not then human weakness despair of itself; let it consider the Blood of the Only-begotten, and in its own price behold how great that is, which costs so much. Let it consider anxiously, whither its Head has gone before; and let that which is bound by His precept to good living, be strengthened to hope by His example. Let it feel sure of heaven; let it hope for the heavenly country; let it know that it is the companion of Angels, and rejoice that in its Head it has been preferred even to Angels. Let it be rightly said then of this light of the eternal country, He declares of it to His friend that it is his possession, and that He may come up to it. But these things are very marvellous, and very awful, that a man, born on the earth, and condemned, as his deserts demand, to separation from his heavenly country, is not only brought back to the state of his creation, but is even exalted to a more glorious condition; that he who has lost paradise obtains heaven, and that so far from the guilt of his debt being binding on him, gifts are heaped upon him more abundantly even after his sin; and that that despiser of God, and imitator of the devil, if he returns to fruitful penitence, ascends even to the loftiness of contemplating the inward light. Whose heart then would not leap in admiration of such graciousness? Whose sloth would not be startled at the elevation of so high a thought?
