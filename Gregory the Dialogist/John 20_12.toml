An angel sits at the head, so to speak, when the apostles preach, “In the beginning was the Word.” And an angel sits at his feet when he says that “the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us.” We can also recognize the two testaments in the two angels, one earlier and the other later. These angels are brought together at the place of the Lord’s body because, while both testaments proclaim equally the message that the Lord became a man and died and rose, the Old Testament sits at his head, so to speak, and the New Testament at his feet.
