"And he brought me into the inner court by the South gate, and he measured the gate according to the former measures." But if by the name of gates we understand only the holy apostles to be designated, who are indeed the first preachers of holy Church to us, and who taught us to hold most firmly to faith, hope, and charity, they therefore are gates for us in these virtues, who lead us through the same virtues to the interior understanding of eternal wisdom. But if they are the outer gates, whom do we accept as the inner ones? And if they are the inner ones, whom do we understand as the outer ones? In this matter it can be usefully understood that they are simultaneously both outer and inner gates for us. For when they preach to those who are still beginners not lofty and mystical things, but certain things that can be grasped, they are outer gates; but when they speak profound and mystical things to the perfect, they are inner gates. Let us see how the outer gate opens: "I could not speak to you as to spiritual persons, but as to carnal ones, as to little ones in Christ I gave you milk to drink, not solid food." Let us see how the inner gate opens: "We speak wisdom among the perfect." Let us see whether the same gate is both inner and outer: "I am a debtor to the wise and to the unwise." He who again says: "Whether we are beside ourselves, it is for God; whether we are sober, it is for you." For in this, that by contemplating and speaking to the wise he is beside himself, he is an inner gate; but in this, that he tempers himself soberly in preaching to little ones, and does not show how much intoxication of the Spirit is poured into his mind when he preaches, he manifests himself to be an outer gate. Therefore they are both outer and inner gates for us, who both establish us in the first entrance of faith, hope, and charity, and when they preach the mysteries of the heavenly kingdom to those already progressing, they lead us to interior things through a more subtle sense.
