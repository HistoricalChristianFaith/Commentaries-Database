There follows: (Verses 25, 26) "And all the common people of the land came into a forest, in which there was honey upon the surface of the field. And so the people entered the forest, and flowing honey appeared, and no one put his hand to his mouth."

A forest is a wooded and hilly place. By this name, indeed, the hearts of worldly people are fittingly designated, because while they serve external cares with all their attention, like wooded places, they are not cultivated for the fruit of good work by the plowshare of preaching. And who are signified by the name of the common people in this passage, if not religious and simple men? Indeed, they are called the common people of the earth: because they are great in good work, yet they are not great in the loftiest contemplation. Noble indeed in action, but common people in comparison with the highest men. What then does it mean that the common people of the earth came into the forest, except that religious and simple men, through the examples of their good works, are often brought to the notice of worldly people? There honey appears in the field, because from the example of good work among worldly people they find both the breadth of devotion and the fruit of reverence. For what is a field in a forest, if not devotion in the uncultivated and unpurged heart of worldly people? And what is honey upon the surface of the field, if not the sweetness of favor? This is rightly said to appear after the entrance of the common people, because indeed the rough hearts of worldly people, if they do not first see the examples of religious men, are unable either to stretch themselves out in the breadth of devotion or to proclaim the glory of another's holiness. Before the entrance, there is only a forest, having neither a field nor flowing honey. But after the entrance, it has both the breadth of a field and the sweetness of honey, because often those who love the world receive the examples of the saints with fervent love, so that the good they see not only pleases them, but they also ardently desire to proclaim it. Yet the life of the saints is to be praised, and that praise must in no way be seized by them to whom it belongs through vainglory. It ought only to be seen, not received, so that one may rejoice that God is glorified in his work, but may scorn to be exalted on account of God's grace. Hence it is carefully expressed that flowing honey appeared upon the surface of the field, and yet no one brought his hand with the honey to his mouth. The honey flows, because the sweet fame of the saints runs sweetly and swiftly. But no one brings his hand to his mouth, because he does not receive the sweetness of praise for his good work. To bring one's hand with honey to the mouth is to receive with pleasure the praise of one's own work. Let the honey therefore flow, and let no one bring his hand to his mouth, so that the fame of the saints may flow sweetly, and may not exalt those from whom it flows. Let it flow so that it may satisfy others, but let it not be consumed, lest it serve up death. Hence it is added: (Verse 26.) For the people feared the oath. The oath of the King is: Everyone who exalts himself will be humbled (Luke 18:14). Likewise the oath of the King is what he pronounces against hypocrites, saying: Amen I say to you, they have received their reward (Matthew 6:16). Therefore the people fear the oath, because lest they lose eternal rewards, they take care not to receive temporal praises.
