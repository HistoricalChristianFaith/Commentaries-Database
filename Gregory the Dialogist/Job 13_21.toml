55.  By which same two what else does he ask in a voice of prophecy, but the season of grace and redemption?  For the Law held the people obnoxious to the stroke of vengeance, that whoso committed sin under its yoke, should be forthwith punished with death.  Nor did the Israelitish people serve God from a principle of love, but of fear.  But righteousness can never be perfected [impleri] by fear, seeing that according to the voice of John, perfect love casteth out fear. [1 John 4, 18]  And Paul comforts the children of adoption, by saying, For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear, but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father. [Rom 8, 15]  Therefore in the voice of mankind, longing for the hardness of the stroke of the Law to pass away, and eagerly desiring to advance from fear to love, he names in prayer what ‘two things God should put far from him,’ saying, Withdraw Thine hand far from me, and let not Thy dread make me afraid; i.e. remove from me the hardness of the stroke, take away the weight of dread, and while the grace of love illumines me, pour upon me the spirit of assurance, in that if I be not removed far from the rod and from dread, I know that I shall not be withdrawn from the strictness of Thy searching.  Since he cannot be justified before Thee, who serves Thee not on a principle of love, but of fear.  Hence he seeks the very presence of his Creator itself, as it were familiarly, and in a bodily sort, that he may thereby both hear what he is ignorant of, and be heard in the things that he knows.
