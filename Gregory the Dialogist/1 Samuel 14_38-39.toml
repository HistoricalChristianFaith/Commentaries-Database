By these words he clearly demonstrated the well-ordered procedure of judgment, because the fault must first be discovered, and then the punishment imposed. For the order of judgment is thrown into confusion if punishment is pronounced before the examination of the discovered fault. For lest he strike before the examination, he says: "Bring here all the corners of the people, and see, and know through whom this sin has occurred today." And because once the fault is known it must be struck more severely, he swears, saying: "As the Lord lives, even if it was done through Jonathan my son, he shall die without reconsideration." The matter must indeed be deliberated upon at length so that the fault may be found, but after it has been found, no one should be left alive in it. He is destroyed without reconsideration who, as soon as his sin becomes known, is forbidden to live in it. But this "without reconsideration"—that is, to destroy—is itself not without reconsideration, because the pastor exercises much deliberation so that the fault, which he discovers through careful examination, may be struck without reconsideration and extinguished swiftly.

But if according to the historical sense we consider the weight of this paternal oath, and equally observe the fervor of that time and the lukewarmness of this one. For the ancient fathers, in order to please God, did not spare even their sons from death. But we do not dare to pursue even with a mild harshness of words those whom we love according to the flesh. Behold, he who was raising his son for the kingdom says: "Because if the sin was committed through him, he shall die without reconsideration." We see sinners, and we either refuse or fear to rebuke the sinning. Why then do we do this, unless because we by no means love God as they did? For Moses, in order to properly punish the sin of idolatry, ordered the Levites to kill twenty-three thousand men. In carrying out which slaughter he indeed said: "If anyone is the Lord's, let him join me. Let every man put his sword upon his thigh. Go and return from gate to gate, and let each one kill his brother, and his friend, and his neighbor" (Exod. 32:26–27). As if to say: In this each one will show that he is the Lord's, if for love of Him he does not spare brother, neighbor, or friend. Saul therefore says of his son: "He shall die without resistance," because for us who now live under the grace of the Redeemer, even if bodily death is not decreed, the life of sin ought not to be prolonged. Indeed, a ruler slays without reconsideration when he does not regard the affection of the flesh, but when he finds a crime, strikes swiftly. He reconsiders, however, who, lest he sharply sting the wicked one, thinks of the services rendered to him by that person, or of the affection of kinship. In this matter it should be noted that not all faults are to be struck sharply. For light stains of dust are better removed by shaking off than by washing or applying fire. Even serious faults are not to be pursued with equal severity in all cases, because wounds of bodies require the strength of medicine in proportion to the nature and strength of the bodies themselves. Most often, however, prelates of the Church, when they hear of faults, grow more heated than is just; and while they measure out punishment, they regard neither the nature of the wounds nor the strength of the offending persons. They indeed are to be tolerated when they threaten, but are to be calmed from vengeance by the counsel of good men. Whence it is also added here: "To which no one contradicted him from all the people." For because the threats of superiors are to be humbly endured, it says: "No one contradicted him." And because their excess is to be restrained by the wholesome counsel of the devout, not much further on, when the king attempts to inflict the same death on his son, all the people cry out: "Shall Jonathan then die, who accomplished this salvation in Israel?" Therefore the people delivered Jonathan so that he would not die.
