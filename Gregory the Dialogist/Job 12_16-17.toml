When almighty God in the mystery of his mercy was made man, he first gave the lesson of mildness, and afterwards at the judgment he will show his strength. It is correct to say that in the place above, wisdom is mentioned before strength, as the thing is spoken of the only begotten Son of the Father, “With him is wisdom and strength.” In view of the fact that as he comes to judge, he will appear in the terribleness of his power, and the damned being cast off, he will manifest to his elect in his everlasting kingdom. How he is “the wisdom of the Father” is rightly said in the subsequent sentence, that with him is first “strength” and then “wisdom.” … Whereas everyone who strives to deceive his neighbor is wicked, “Truth” says to the wicked, “I never knew you; depart from me, you evildoers.” In what sense is it said here that “the Lord knows the deceiver”? But God’s “knowing” sometimes means his taking notice or acknowledging, sometimes his approving; God at once knows a wicked person, in that in taking notice of him he judges him (for he would never judge any wicked person, if he did not take notice of him), and yet he does not know a wicked person in that he does not approve of his actions. So, God both knows him, in that he finds him out, and doesn’t know him, in that he does not acknowledge him in a likeness of his own wisdom.… The only begotten Son of the most high Father, because he was made man and preached eternal truths, is therefore called the “Angel of great counsel.” We rightly interpret “the counselors” as those preachers who furnish the counsel of life to their hearers. However, when any preacher preaches the truths of eternity that he may acquire temporal gains, he is assuredly brought to a foolish end; he is aiming to reach that point by laborious effort. Hence, he ought to have fled in uprightness of mind. And it is rightly added, “And the judges to dullness.” For all that are set over the examination of other people’s conduct are rightly called “judges.” But when he who has this oversight does not diligently examine the lives of those under his authority or acquaint himself with whom he should correct, “the judge is brought to dullness,” in that he, who should have judged things that were ill, never finds out those things that are to be judged.
