20.  As if he were subjoining in explaining the things premised, saying, ‘Because He sees that by suffering them evil habits gain growth, by judging He brings to nought His gifts.’  Now the right order is observed in the account, in that vanity is first described to be known, and afterwards iniquity to be considered.  For all iniquity is vanity, but not all vanity, iniquity.  For we do vain things as often as we give heed to what is transitory.  Whence too that is said to vanish, which is suddenly withdrawn from the eyes of the beholder.  Hence the Psalmist saith, Every man living is altogether vanity. [Ps. 39, 5]  For herein, that by living he is only tending to destruction, he is rightly called ‘vanity’ indeed; but by no means lightly called ‘iniquity’ too.  For though it is in punishment of sin that he comes to nought, yet this particular circumstance is not itself sin, that he passes swiftly from life.  Thus all things are vain that pass by.  Whence too the words are spoken by Solomon, All is vanity. [Eccles. 1, 2]
21.  But ‘iniquity’ is fitly brought in immediately after ‘vanity.’  For whilst we are led onwards through some things transitory, we are to our hurt tied fast to some of them, and when the soul does not hold its seat of unchangeableness, running out from itself it goes headlong into evil ways.  From vanity then that mind sinks into iniquity, which from being familiar with things mutable, whilst it is ever being hurried from one sort to another, is defiled by sins springing up.  It is possible too that ‘vanity’ may be taken for sin, and that by the title of ‘iniquity’ weightier guilt may be designated; for if vanity were not sometimes sin, the Psalmist would not have said, Though man walketh in the image of God, surely he is disquieted in vain: he heapeth up riches, and knoweth not who shall gather them. [Ps. 29, 6. Vulg.]  For though we preserve the image of the Trinity in our natural constitution, yet being disturbed by the vain motions of self-indulgence, we go wrong in our practice; so that in ever-alternating forms lust agitates, fear breaks down, joy beguiles, grief oppresses.  Therefore from vanity, as we have also said above, we are led to iniquity, when first we let ourselves out in light misdemeanors, so that habit making all things light, we are not at all afraid to commit even heavier ones too afterwards.  For while the tongue neglects to regulate idle words, being caught by the custom of engrained carelessness, it fearlessly gives a loose to mischievous ones.  Whilst we give ourselves to gluttony we are straightway betrayed into the madness of an unsteady mind, and when the mind shrinks from overcoming the gratification of the flesh, it very often plunges even into the whirlpool of unbelief.  Hence Paul, looking at the mischiefs that befel the Israelitish people, in order to keep off from his hearers threatened ills, was justly mindful to relate in order what took place, saying, Neither be ye idolaters, as were some of them; as it is written, The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play. [1 Cor. 10, 7. Ex. 32, 6]  For eating and drink set them on to play, and play drew them into idolatry; for if the offence of vanity is not restrained with care, the unheeding mind is swiftly swallowed up by iniquity, as Solomon testifies, who says, He that despiseth small things falleth little by little.  For if we neglect to take heed to little things, being insensibly led away, we perpetrate even greater things with a bold face; and it is to be observed, that it is not said that iniquity is ‘seen,’ but that it is ‘considered.’  For we look more earnestly at those things which we consider.  Thus God ‘knoweth the vanity of men, and considereth their iniquity,’ in that He leaves not even their minor offences unpunished, and prepares Himself with greater earnestness to smite their worse ones.  Therefore whereas men set out with lighter misdeeds, and go on to those of a graver order, vanity overcasts while iniquity blinds the mind, which same mind, so soon as it has parted with the light, presently lifts itself so much the higher in swoln pride, in proportion as being taken in the snares of iniquity, it withdraws further from the truth.  Hence also he fitly sets forth whereunto vanity forces men joined with iniquity.
