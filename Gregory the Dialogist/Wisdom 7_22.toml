Because the Holy Spirit is God and coeternal with the Father and the Son from before all time, we must ask ourselves why it is said that he moves. In fact, one who moves goes to a place were he was not and leaves a place where he was. Now, why do we say that the Holy Spirit moves, given that he contains everything and there is no place where he is not? As it is written, “The Spirit of the Lord fills the universe.” And yet, when Wisdom’s praises are sung, it is added, “In her there is a spirit intelligent, holy, unique, manifold, subtle, mobile.” And a little later, “friend of human beings, stable.” These words raise a big problem for us. Why is it said that this Spirit who fills everything is simultaneously mobile and stable? If we recall, however, the usual way in which human beings express themselves, it will not be difficult for us to discover the writer’s meaning. A person moves about freely in the area in which he lives—he might be found anywhere, and often he is in places we would hardly believe. Now, it says that the all-powerful Spirit is both mobile and stable, to indicate his universal presence. It says that he is stable, because by his essence he encompasses everything; that he is mobile, because he reaches even those who do not know it. He is called stable, because he holds all things together, mobile because he makes himself present to all. Thus the brightness of the fire moves in the midst of the living winged creatures, with its glow, because the Holy Spirit makes himself present simultaneously to each and to all. He enkindles those he reaches and enlightens those he enkindles, so that, after their former coldness, ablaze, they would burn, and with the fire of the love they have received, they would emit the flames of a good example.
