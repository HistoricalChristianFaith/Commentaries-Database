Spirit indeed is God eternal before all ages, coeternal with the Father and the Son, we must ask why He is said to run about. For everyone who runs about approaches a place where he was not, and leaves the place where he was. By what reasoning, then, shall we say that the Spirit runs about, since all things are within Him, and there is nowhere a place where He is not? As it is written: "The Spirit of the Lord has filled the whole world." And yet, when the praise of wisdom was being described, it was added: "For in her there is a spirit of understanding, a spirit unique, manifold, subtle, mobile." And shortly after: "Steadfast yet humane." In these words again a great question arises for us: why is this spirit who fills all things said to be both mobile and stable at the same time? But if we return to the custom of human usage, we more quickly find the meaning of the speaker. For a man who runs about everywhere in the region where he is, without doubt comes upon everyone everywhere, and is suddenly found where he was not expected. Therefore the Almighty Spirit, to signify his presence everywhere, is said to be both mobile and stable at the same time. Stable, because by nature he contains all things; but he is called mobile because he meets even those who are unaware of him everywhere. Therefore holding all things he is called stable; showing himself present to all he is called mobile. Therefore the brightness of fire, and the lightning going forth from the fire, runs among the winged creatures, because the Holy Spirit is present to individuals and to all at the same time, and sets on fire those whom he touches, and illuminates those whom he sets on fire, so that after their former coldness those who have been kindled may burn, and through the fire of love which they have received may give back flames of examples.
