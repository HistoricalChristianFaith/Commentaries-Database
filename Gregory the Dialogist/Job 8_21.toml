88.  For the ‘mouth’ of the righteous will then be ‘filled with laughing’ when the tears of their pilgrimage being done, their hearts shall be filled to the full with exulting in eternal joy.  Concerning this laughing ‘Truth’ saith to His disciples, Verily, verily, I say unto you, that ye shall weep and lament, but the world shall rejoice; and ye shall be sorrowful, but your sorrow shall be turned into joy. [John 16, 20]  And again, But I will see you again, and your heart shall rejoice, and your joy no man taketh from you. [ver. 23]  Concerning this laughing of Holy Church, Solomon saith, And she shall laugh in the last day. [Prov. 31, 25]  Of this it is said again, Whoso feareth the Lord, it shall go well with him at the last. [Ecclus. 1, 3]  Not that there shall be laughter of the body, but laughter of the heart.  For now from rioting in dissipation there springs a laughter of the body, but then from joy in security there will arise a laughter of the heart.  Therefore when all the Elect are replenished with the delight of open vision, they spring forth into the joyousness of laughter in the mouth of the interior.  But we call it shouting [jubilum], when we conceive such joy in the heart, as we cannot give vent to by the force of words, and yet the triumph of the heart vents with the voice what it cannot give forth by speech.  Now the mouth is rightly said to be filled with laughter, the lips with shouting, since in that eternal land, when the mind of the righteous is borne away in transport, the tongue is lifted up in the song of praise.  And they, because they see so much as they are unable to express, shout in laughter, because without compassing it they resound all the love that they feel.
89.  Now it is said ‘till,’ not that Almighty God so long forbears to raise up the evil until he take to Him His Elect to the joys of their jubilee, as if afterwards He saved from the punishment those whom first leaving in sin He sentences to damnation, but that He never does it even before the Judgment, when it may seem doubtful to men, whether it is to be done.  For that after the jubilee of His Eject people He does not stretch out His hand to the evil-minded, is already plain from the mere severity of the final reckoning by itself.  As the Psalmist also spake in this manner, The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit Thou on My right hand, until I make Thine enemies Thy footstool. [Ps. 110, 1]  Not that the Lord never sat on the Lord's right hand, after that by smiting His enemies He made them subject to His power, but that He is set over all things in eternal blessedness, even before He treads under His feet the hearts of those that rebel against Him.  Wherein it is made plain that His enemies being brought under, He still rules without end even afterwards.  Thus it is said in the Gospel of the espoused of Mary, And knew her not, till she had brought forth her first-born Son. [Matt. 1, 25]  Not that he did know her after the birth of the Lord, but that he never touched her even when he did not know her to be the Mother of his Creator.  For because it was impossible that he could have touched her after he knew that the Mystery of our Redemption was transacted from her womb, plainly it was necessary that the Evangelist should bear witness of that time, of which there might be misgivings entertained by reason of Joseph's ignorance.  And so it is expressed here in like manner, Behold, God will not cast away a perfect man, neither will He stretch out His hand to the evil-minded; till He fill thy mouth with laughter, and thy lips with shouting.  As if it were expressed in plain speech; ‘Not even before the Judgment does He abandon the life of the faithful, nor even before He appears does He forbear from smiting the minds of the evil-disposed by abandoning them.’  For that the sons of perdition He torments without end, and that after that He shall have appeared His Elect reign for evermore, assuredly there is no doubt.
