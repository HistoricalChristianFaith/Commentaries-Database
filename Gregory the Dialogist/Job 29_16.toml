41.  For very often men give much to the poor, not because they love those poor, but because if they do not give, they dread the indignation of the Judge Above; which persons, if they were not afraid of God, would have had no mind to give the things they possess.  And indeed in good deeds it is the first step of beginners, that he who does not yet know how to love his neighbour as himself, nevertheless should yet henceforth begin to dread the judgments from Above. Thus because it is one thing to do a good deed by command and another to do it from affection as well, that the holy man may teach us the inward spirit of his practice, let him say, I was a father to the poor.  For not a patron, or a neighbour, or an helper to the poor, but ‘a father’ he testifies that he had been; in this way, because by the great attentiveness of his charity he converted the purpose of mercy into the affection of nature, that he should look on those as children by love, whom he was the head of as a father by protecting.  Therefore because the force of his mercy had copied nature, he records himself to have been a father to the poor.  Where he likewise adds;
And the cause that I knew not, I most carefully searched out.
42.  In which words we have to consider all the particulars how distinctly they are related, and that no profit is passed over by him.  Since he is just in his actions, pitiful in his neighbours’ infirmities, active in the concerns of the poor.  For he that takes thought of the blessings of the eternal recompensing, must needs extend himself to every occasion of the repayment to follow after.  For hence it is said by Solomon; He that feareth God, neglecteth nothing. [Eccl. 7, 18]  Hence also Paul saith; prepared unto every good work. [2 Tim. 2, 21]  But herein we ought to bear in mind that occasionally in our actions lesser good things are to be let pass for the usefulness of greater ones.  Thus who could be ignorant that it has the merit of a good work to bury the dead: and yet Lo one, who had prayed to be let go in order to the burying of his father, it was said; Let the dead bury their dead; but go thou and preach the kingdom of God. [Luke 9, 60]  Thus the dutifulness of this service was to be made to give place to the office of preaching, because by the first he would be burying persons dead in the flesh in the earth, by the other he would be raising up persons dead in the soul to life.  By the Prophet likewise it is said to the chiefs of the Synagogue; Seek judgment, relieve the oppressed. [Is. 1, 17]  And yet Paul the Apostle says; Set them to judge, who are least esteemed in the Church. [1 Cor. 6, 4]  For he was kindling his hearers’ hearts to the excellency of wisdom, to different kinds of tongues, to the investigating the mysteries of prophecy also, saying, Desire spiritual gifts, but rather that ye may prophesy.  But because they would not be capable of ‘spiritual gifts,’ if earthly matters had weighed them to the ground, he premised long before, saying, Set them to judge who are least esteemed in the Church.  As though he said in plain words; ‘they that are of least worth in the Church, and not enriched with any power of extraordinary gifts, let these only judge concerning earthly matters, that by whom extraordinary good cannot be supplied, the lesser good may be.’  Whom he at once styles ‘contemptible,’ and yet calls ‘wise,’ when he says; Is it so that there is not a wise man among you?  no one that shall be able to judge between his brethren? [1 Cor. 6, 5]  From which point what else is concluded but that they are to try earthly causes, who have received wisdom in things external? But they that have been enriched with spiritual gifts surely ought never to be entangled with earthly concerns, that while they are not compelled to manage the good things beneath, they may by being exercised be enabled to serve the interests of the good things Above.
43.  But above every thing it needs to be looked to, that they who shine forth with spiritual gifts should never entirely abandon the affairs of their neighbours of weak condition, but that they should entrust the same to be managed by others, whom it is meet for.  Whence also Moses appointed to the people seventy persons in the stead of himself, that in proportion as he buried himself out of the way of external causes he might with the greater fervour go into the things of the interior.  And so it comes to pass, that those that are the highest advance more to Spiritual gifts, when things that are lowest do not trample on their minds, and again the persons that are the last in the Church do not live without good practice, while in matters external they find right things which they may do.  For Holy Church is so compacted by a unity of the faithful, as our body is made one by the jointing of the limbs.  Thus there are some members in the body which are subservient to beholding the light, others which are never parted from the contact of earth.  Since the eye is set intent on the light, and that it may not be made blind, it is kept safe from the dust.  But the foot then rightly discharges its office, when it does not shrink from taking on it the dust of the earth.  Which same members of the body, however, are, by imparting their functions to one another, reciprocally united in one, so that the foot should run for the eyes, and the eye look out for the feet.
44.  Thus, then, thus ought the members of Holy Church to be at once distinct in office and united in charity, that the highest persons may look out the way of those, who go at liberty in the concerns of earth, so that the foot may as it were walk by the light of the eyes, and again that whatever they execute, being busied with the affairs of earth, this they may apply to the use of the greater sort, so that the foot, whose way is looked out, may step not for itself only but for the eyes as well.  And so whilst they suit one another by turns, by reciprocal ministering, in a wonderful way it is brought about, that whereas all the Elect, by bestowing labour on one another, do what they are able, those works too become their own, which they cannot do themselves.
45.  But herein we ought to bear in mind, that when those are wanting, who might fitly minister to the exterior occasions of their neighbours, those too who are full of spiritual gifts ought to lower themselves to their inferiority, and, as far as they may with propriety be able, lend themselves with the condescension of charity to the earthly necessities of those persons.  Nor should it weary the mind, if its perception, being ever intent on the contemplation of the spiritual, is sometimes as it were bent down, diminished in managing the least concerns, when that Word, by Which all things created are held together, in order that He might benefit mankind, having taken to Him the nature of man, was willing to be ‘made a little less than the Angels.’  What wonder, then, if man for man’s sake draws himself in, when the Creator of men and Angels for man’s sake took upon Him the form of man?  Not however that the perception is diminished when it is thus drawn in; because it penetrates the things above with more exact penetration, in proportion as with more abundant humility for the love of the Creator it does not even despise the things beneath.  What is there that is unworthy of us or difficult, if we carry the mind above and below, when of the body we wash the face with the same hand, with which we shoe the foot?  Therefore let blessed Job, because when he was doing great things he did not think the least things beneath him, let him say, And the cause that I knew not I very carefully searched out.
46.  Wherein I see it is to be noted, that for delivering sentence we should not ever be precipitate, that things not examined into we should not rashly judge, that any thing heard of a bad nature should not affect us, that what is reported every where about we should not credit without proving.  Which same, without doubt, we shall be afraid of committing, if we consider the doings of our Creator with some degree of minuteness.  For that very Creator, that He might withhold us from a precipitate delivery of sentence, whereas ‘all things are naked and open to His eyes,’ [Hev. 4, 13] yet refused to judge the evil deeds of Sodom when heard, in that He saith; Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is very great, and because their cry is very grievous; I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come unto Me; and if not, I will know. [Gen. 18, 20. 21.]  Thus God, Who is Almighty and knowing all things, wherefore does He before the proving seem to doubt, but in order to set forth to us an example of gravity, that the evil of our fellow-creatures we should never venture to believe before we prove it?  Observe how by His Angels He comes down for the ascertaining of the evil, and immediately smites the culprits; and He That is patient, He Who is gentle, He, of Whom it is written; But Thou, Lord, judgest with tranquillity. [Wisd. 12, 18]  He, of Whom it is written again; The Lord is a patient Rewarder, [Ecclus. 5, 4] finding them involved in such enormous guilt, as it were overlooked patience, and would not await the day of Final Judgment for vengeance, but with the fire of judgment prevented them before the Day of Judgment.  See, the evil He in seeming believed with difficulty when He heard it, but visited without backwardness when acquainting Himself He found it true; surely that He might give us an example that worse climes are both to be believed with difficulty, when they are heard, and to be punished more quickly when they are truly ascertained.  For this heedfulness accordingly blessed Job entertaining anxious interest, saith, The cause that I knew not, I very carefully searched out.  Which same words we may likewise apply not inappropriately in the voice of the Church to a typical way of interpretation.  For that same Church by her elect members does when she judges the evil deeds of carnal men ‘search out that, which she knows not,’ in that the evil things which she knows not in doing them, she searches out in correcting them in judgment.  And so Holy Church, when she shall be cramped for a time by the villainy of the unjust, remembers, saying, The cause that I knew not, I very carefully searched out.  As though she said in plain speech; ‘The evil that in mine Elect I knew not in doing, in wicked Men I did, by judging, chasten with severity.’  And because She now bruises the devil by the power of her preaching, and carries off out of his mouth the soul of every one that she receives.

39.  Which same words if we refer to the utterance of Holy Church by a typical mode of interpretation, the same is ‘eyes to the blind,’ because she gives light by the Word, and the same ‘feet to the lame,’ because she stays them up by support. For by preaching she enlightens the blind, while the lame by helping she supports.  For ‘the blind’ is he that as yet seeth not whither he is going, but ‘the lame’ is he who has not the power to go there where he sees.  For frequently sin is committed either by ignorance or weakness, so that either the man knows not what he ought to desire, or cannot do every thing that he has the desire to do.  Contrarily it is rightly said by the Psalmist, The Lord is my light and my salvation. [Ps. 27, 1]  For because the Lord bestows both knowledge and force, at once in opposition to ignorance He is called ‘Light,’ and in opposition to weakness ‘Saving Health.’  It is hence that it is said of the wicked, Let their way he dark and slippery [Ps. 35, 6]; that is to say, that through the darkness they may not see where they should go, who even if they did see what was right, yet by reason of the slippery quality they should not be able to stand fast therein.  And so the one sort through the slipperiness halt in the midst of good things, and the other sort through the darkness, are ignorant what good things to follow.  Thus then Holy Church, being seized by tribulations at the end, calls to mind the old times when she was accustomed both to enlighten by teaching and to stablish by helping, and speak with the lips of her foregoing member, saying,
I was an eye to the blind, and a foot was I to the lame.
40.  And whereas she has gathered together two Peoples in herself, viz. the Jewish and the Gentile, by the ‘blind,’ the Gentile People may also be rightly denoted, and by ‘the lame’ the Jewish.  Since the Gentile People had as it were no eyes, because the Law not being received it saw not where it ought to have gone.  But on the other hand the Jewish People having eyes was lame, because the Law indeed in knowing it held, but did not stretch forth the step of right practice therein.  For if the Gentile People had not been blind, the Prophet would not say, The people that walked in darkness have seen a great light. [Is. 9, 2]  Again, if the Israelitish People had not gone lame to good practice, the Psalmist would never have said in the voice of the Lord, The strange children have lied to me: the strange children have waxed old, they have gone lame out of their paths. [Ps. 18, 44. 45.]  Which doubtless is for this reason termed a lame People, in that it had not a sound step in practice, since it would not use both feet, while it admitted one Testament, and spurned the other.  Which People when Holy Church receives coming to her, because to the same, already holding the Old Testament, she introduces the New Testament as well, for the directing the steps thereof, she as it were joins on another foot.  Which faithful People of Holy Church still further adds aright, I was a father to the poor, because surely the humble, who are called ‘poor in spirit,’ are begotten by her preaching.  But it is necessary for us in all these particulars to weigh with exactness the actual words of the history.
