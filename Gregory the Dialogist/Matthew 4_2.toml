But since the reading is fitting for these days—for we have heard of the forty days' abstinence of our Redeemer as we begin the season of Lent—we must discuss why this very abstinence is observed for the number of forty days. For Moses fasted twice for forty days in order to receive the law. Elijah abstained for forty days in the desert. The very Author of humanity, coming to humanity, took no food at all for forty days. Let us also, as much as we can, strive to afflict our flesh through abstinence during the annual season of Lent.

Why then is the number forty observed in abstinence, unless because the power of the Decalogue is fulfilled through the four books of the holy Gospel? For ten multiplied by four produces forty, because we fulfill the commandments of the Decalogue when we indeed keep the four books of the holy Gospel. From this another meaning can also be perceived. For in this mortal body we subsist from four elements, and through the pleasures of this same body we act contrary to the Lord's commandments. But the Lord's commandments were received through the Decalogue. Since therefore through the desires of the flesh we have despised the commandments of the Decalogue, it is fitting that we afflict that same flesh four times ten.

Although concerning this season of Lent there is still another thing that can be understood. For from the present day until the joys of the Paschal solemnity, six weeks come, whose days indeed amount to forty-two. When the six Sundays are subtracted from the abstinence, no more than thirty-six days remain in abstinence. But while the year is reckoned through three hundred and sixty-five days, and we afflict ourselves through thirty-six days, we give as it were the tithes of our year to God, so that we who have lived for ourselves through the year we received, may mortify ourselves to our Author in his tithes through abstinence.

Therefore, dearest brothers, just as you are commanded in the law to offer tithes of your possessions, so strive to offer him also tithes of your days. Let each one, as much as strength allows, mortify the flesh and afflict its desires, and slay shameful lusts, so that according to Paul's words, one may become a living sacrifice. For a sacrifice is both offered and is living when a person both does not depart from this life, and yet slays himself from carnal desires. Let the flesh that drew us joyfully to sin, bring us back afflicted to pardon. For the author of our death transgressed the precepts of life through the fruit of the forbidden tree. Let us therefore who fell from the joys of paradise through food, rise again to them as much as we can through abstinence.
