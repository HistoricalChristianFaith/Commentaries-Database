What does it mean that by the king's command the people are separated from the king and his son, except that when a hidden and suspected fault is sought, both the higher and lower persons must be examined? Indeed, often the people sin, and often their ruler sins; and sometimes the very fault of the subjects is ascribed to the prelate, by whose negligence it is said to be brought about. Therefore, when, after the signs shown above, it is recognized that a fault lies hidden among the people, and it is not known in whom it is concealed, let the king join himself in, so that the pastor may know whether the fault is his own or the people's. Indeed, King Saul was not conscious of the fault, which he had committed neither by consent nor by deed, and yet he is mixed in to be examined, so that if the fault also lies hidden in him, it may be found. For he was, as it were, searching himself as one unaware of sin, who said: "For I am not conscious of anything against myself, but I am not justified by this; the one who judges me is the Lord" (1 Cor. 4:4). As if to say: I do not cease to search myself and to find myself, because if I am hidden from myself, I will not be hidden from him to whom all things are naked. Therefore let the king, not conscious of that sin which was being investigated, say: "I with my son Jonathan will be on one side"; because chosen teachers, when they rage against others through zeal for righteousness, by no means spare themselves and their own close associates. For they, as it were, separate the people on one side and do not separate themselves, who examine the faults of their subjects but do not care to investigate so as to find themselves. Great indeed is the ocean of human ignorance. For if we can scarcely or never search ourselves and find what we are, when can we search others? For what is it that the Prophet laments, saying: "My heart has forsaken me" (Ps. 39:13)? What is it that Sacred Scripture declares: "Man does not know whether he is worthy of love or hatred" (Eccl. 9:2)? Likewise, the Prophet declares the fruit of his searching, saying: "Your servant has found his heart" (2 Kings 7:27). If the saints can scarcely find their heart, with what recklessness do we cease from searching ourselves? But perhaps not even the Prophet could, because he added: "That he may fear you." He would surely have found his heart if he had fully known whether he was worthy of hatred or love. He who therefore did not find it so as to be secure before God, surely found it so as to fear. But we cannot easily do even this, because while we neglect to find our sins and to weigh them once found, we are, as it were, secure with a lost heart. Therefore these are placed on one side, those on the other, so that the hidden things of each may be considered, and once the fault is found, it may be struck with a fitting punishment. Because this is greatly to be praised and not to be discouraged, there follows: "The people answered Saul: Do what is good in your eyes."
