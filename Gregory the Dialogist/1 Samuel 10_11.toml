26. What is it that they say, "What is this thing that has happened," except to marvel greatly at what could not be comprehended by them? They had known the man, a son of man; they saw him joined to the prophets. They had known him as carnal; they saw him as spiritual. They had known him as simple; they saw him as a prophet. They say therefore: "What has happened to the son of Kish?" They were able to know what he had been; what he now was, and how he could be so, they did not know. This indeed is the spiritual progress of the preacher: that he who was once known in ordinary life should possess something in a higher order that is beyond understanding. Three degrees of perfection are shown, because he says: "Yesterday and the day before." In two days indeed the preacher is recognized; on the third he possesses something that even those who knew him cannot comprehend. For the first day belongs to hearers, the second to companions, the third is that of preaching. For the pastor had his first day when as a disciple he obeyed his superiors. For he who is devoted in the virtue of obedience is seen as if in a great light. He had his second day when he began to be an assistant to his betters. For this brightness of a great way of life, in the example of the elect, makes the greatest day. The Lord, indicating this day, said: "So let your light shine before men, that they may see your good works and glorify your Father who is in heaven" (Matt. 5:16). But the third day is that of the rushing Spirit and of prophecy. For on the third day the pastor is beheld, when he matches the sublimity of his dignity with the splendor of his conduct, when, clothed with heavenly power, he shines upon his subjects with such life and such teaching that he can be seen by them but cannot be examined and judged. Such indeed was Moses when he descended from the mountain with a most radiant face, whose subjects saw the brightness but could not fix their gaze upon the shining splendor (Exod. 34:35; 2 Cor. 3:7). Such was he who gloried, saying: "But we, beholding the glory of God with unveiled face, are transformed into the same image, as by the Spirit of the Lord" (2 Cor. 3:18). Such indeed were those whom the Holy Spirit had filled. Whence also those who had gathered in Jerusalem say in amazement: "Are not all these who speak Galileans?" (Acts 2:7). For they were asking in order to understand what they were hearing, and they could not understand it. But those who had known Saul ask in wonder about the thing that happened to him; because we sometimes see those who are humble and despised in a lower order of holy Church, whom, when the Holy Spirit takes them up to the order of preaching, He clothes with the splendors of His graces and shows them to be wondrous in those same splendors. But we rightly admire the virtues of the saints when we ascribe them to the goodness of the Creator. Wherefore Moses also, praising the Lord, said: "Who is like You among the gods, O Lord? Who is like You, glorious among the saints, wonderful in majesty, working wonders?" (Exod. 15:11). Hence the Psalmist says: "God is wonderful in His saints; He Himself will give power and strength to His people" (Ps. 67:36).
