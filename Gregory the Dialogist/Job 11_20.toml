41.  That by the designation of ‘eyes’ the energy of the intention is set forth to us, ‘Truth’ testifies in the Gospel, saying, If thine eye shall be single, thy whole body shall be full of light. [Matt. 6, 22]  Forasmuch as if a pure intention have preceded our action, howsoever it may seem otherwise to men, yet to the eyes of our interior Judge, the body of the deed that follows after is presented pure.  Therefore the ‘eyes’ of the wicked are the intentions of carnal desires in them, and these fail for this reason, that they are careless of their eternal interests, and are ever looking for transitory advantages alone.  For they aim to get themselves an earthly name, they wish above all things to grow and increase in temporal goods, they are daily advancing with the tide of transient things to the goal of death; but they think not to take account of the things of mortality upon the principles of their mortal nature.  The life of the flesh is failing minute by minute, and yet the desire of the flesh is growing; property gotten is snatched off by an instant end, yet the eagerness in getting is not ended the more; but when death withdraws the wicked, then indeed their desires are ended with their life.  And the eyes of these fail them through the Avenging of the Most High, for that they would not fail here by their own determination to earthly gratification.  These same eyes of such persons the Psalmist had seen closed to their former enjoyment, when he said, In that day all their thoughts perish. [Ps. 146, 4]  For they meet at once with eternal woes they had never thought on, and on a sudden lose the temporal goods, they had long while held and dealt with.  And for these ‘all refuge shall perish,’ in that their iniquity finds not where to hide itself from the visitation of the searching Judge.  For now, when the wicked undergo some slight mishaps or evil chances, they find a hiding-place for refuge, in that they forthwith have recourse to the enjoyment of earthly objects of desire.  For that poverty torment them not, they beguile the spirit with riches.  Or lest the contempt of their neighbours sink them, they exalt themselves with titles.  If the body is cloyed with satiety, it is pampered with the variety of viands set before it.  If the mind is weighed down by any impulse to sadness, it is immediately relieved by the beguilements of sportiveness being introduced.  Here therefore they have as many places of refuge as they make for themselves entertainments of delight; but one time ‘refuge shall perish from them,’ in that their soul, when all these are gone, sees only itself and the Judge.  Then the pleasure is withdrawn, but the guilt of pleasure is preserved; and ere long the miserable wretches learn by their perishing that they were perishable things they had possession of.  Yet these as long as they live in the body never cease to seek after things of a nature to do them harm.  Whence it is still further added,
And their hope shall be the abomination of the soul.
42.  What does the sinner hope for here in all his thoughts saving to surpass others in power, to go beyond all men in the abundance of his stores, to bow down his rivals in lording it over them, to display himself as an object of admiration to his followers, to gratify anger at will, to make himself known as kind and gracious when he is commended, whatever the appetite longs for to offer to it, to acquiesce in all that pleasure dictates by the fulfilling of the thing?  Well then is their hope said to be ‘the abomination of the soul,’ for the very same objects which carnal men go after, all spiritual persons abominate, according to the sentence of righteousness.  For that which sinners account pleasure, the righteous, surely, hold for pain.  Therefore the hope of the wicked is the abomination of the soul, for the spirit is wasted while the body is at ease.  For as the flesh is sustained by soft treatment, so is the soul by hard dealing; soothing appliances cherish the first, harsh methods exercise the last.  The one is fed with enjoyment, the last thrives on bitterness.  And as hardships wound the flesh, so softness kills the spirit, as things laborious kill the one, so things delightful destroy the other.  Therefore the hope of carnal men is said to be the abomination of the soul; in that the spirit perishes for ever by the same means whereby the flesh lives pleasantly for a while.
43.  Now Zophar would have said this aright, if blessed Job had not proclaimed it all more fully even by living accordingly.  But whereas he sets himself to give an holier man admonition concerning the way of living, and to instruct one more skilled than himself with the tutorage of wisdom, he by his own act makes the weight of his words light, in that by letting in indiscreetness he undoes all that he says; in that he is pouring on the liquid element of knowledge into a full vessel.  For the treasures of knowledge are possessed by the indiscreet just as treasures of corporal substance are often in the possession of fools.  For some that are sustained by a full measure of earthly goods at times give largely even to those that have, that they may themselves seem to have them in fuller measure than all men.  So the wicked, since they are imbued with truth, speak in some respects right even to those that are more light than they are, not that they may instruct others that hear them, but that they may make it appear with what a fund of instruction they are furnished.  For they hold that they excel all men in wisdom, therefore they imagine that there is nothing that they can say to any man beyond the measure of their greatness.  Thus all the wicked, thus all heretics are not afraid to instruct their betters with a high tone, in that they look upon all as inferior to themselves.  But Holy Church recalls everyone that is high minded from the height of his self esteem, and fashions him anew by the hand of discretion in the jointing of equality.
