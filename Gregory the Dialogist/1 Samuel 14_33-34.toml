It is proper to the preachers of the holy Church both to rebuke committed faults and to show how those rebuked faults ought to be avoided. Once rebuked, they become known, but if people do not know how to avoid them, once exposed they are repeated. What is shown in this eating of blood, if not the hidden poison of pride? But hidden vices are not cured unless they are exposed. Therefore, to suggest the manner of preachers, Saul first declares that the people have transgressed, then commands that the animals they are to eat be slain upon a stone. But we know who the rock or stone is, because Paul showed this, saying: "And the Rock was Christ" (1 Cor. 10:4). The stone is rolled before the preacher when the examples of the Redeemer are recalled in his presence. It is also said to be rolled over, so that it may be seen from every side. It is called great because through Daniel it is reported to grow and fill the whole face of the earth (Dan. 2). Therefore it is not viewed carelessly, but turned from both sides, so that God may be beheld by the arrogant, and their arrogance may be crushed. Let the arrogant one see, then, how powerful in might, how sublime in majesty, how humble in power our Redeemer appeared. For while giving sight to the blind and healing the sick (Matt. 9), he commanded that what he had done powerfully should be told to no one. On the mountain he shone in splendor, the Father brought forth testimony of his divinity, and yet he said to his disciples: "Tell no one of this vision, until the Son of Man has risen from the dead" (Matt. 17:9). And perhaps for this reason, when the Lord was now rising, an angel appeared at the tomb who rolled the stone away from its entrance. For then the stone had to be rolled away, because Christ, true man and mighty God, was to be recognized after the glory of the resurrection. If therefore the proud man has looked at one side of the stone, let him roll the stone and see the other side. Let him not view the stone in just any way, for Christ is not dead, but let him see it rolled away by an angel, because he rose from the dead. Let him behold from one side the eloquence of preaching, and turn it, and marvel from the other side at the splendor of humility. Let him see from this side the power of signs, and from that side let him see that he who shone with the power of might concealed that same might by a command of silence. But while he sees the humble side, let him see the sublime side as well. Behold, the humble side of the stone is perceived, for it says: "He humbled himself, becoming obedient unto death" (Phil. 2:8). But if that side is turned, the other is revealed, for it continues: "Therefore God exalted him, and gave him a name that is above every name." We roll the stone before the preacher, therefore, when in his presence we recall both the power and the humility of our Redeemer; when we observe him humble in his works, and from his humility exalted in heaven. Upon this stone let the ox and the ram be slain, so that in every class of men the vice of pride may be slaughtered through contemplation of Christ. There indeed all blood is poured out, because whoever is instructed by the example of Christ does great things, but does not exalt himself on account of those great works. He is indeed nourished by the joy of good work, but his food is not stained with the blood of vain praise. For if that stone is turned in words, it says: "If I had not done among them the works that no one else did, they would not have sin" (John 15:24). But because he did not swell with pride at his words, turning himself, he says: "I do not seek my own glory" (John 8:50). The ox and the ram are therefore slain upon the stone when by the example of the Redeemer all horned pride is condemned; when any chosen one both acts well and teaches excellently, but neither does his own life lift him up nor his instruction of others. For in the ram the strength of one's own innocence is expressed, but in the ox the labor and strength of preaching. These are slain upon the rock, so that they may refresh the chosen mind with joy in such a way that they do not impart to it blood mixed with their flesh. This indeed the chosen preacher not only speaks but also persuades. Whence it is also added: (Verse 34) "And all the people brought each one his ox in his hand until night, and they slew them there."
