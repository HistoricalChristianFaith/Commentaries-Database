By holding this last feast with seven disciples … he declares that only those who are full of the sevenfold grace of the Holy Spirit shall be with him at his eternal feast. All time here on this earth unrolls in seven days, and the number seven indicates those who now rise above earthly things in their pursuit of perfection. It signifies those who are not bound by love of this world, who when tempted by anything at all do not suppress the [positive] desires that have arisen in them. These are the ones who feast at this final banquet in the presence of Truth.… Desire then to be filled with the presence of this Spirit. Weigh carefully what you do now for its impact on your future at that banquet.
