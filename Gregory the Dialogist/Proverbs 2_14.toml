“Seeing the city, [Jesus] wept over it, saying, ‘If only at least you had known.’ ” He did this once when he proclaimed that [Jerusalem] would perish. Our Redeemer has not stopped doing this daily through his elect when he observes that certain persons have adopted corrupt habits after having lived good lives. He mourns for those who do not know why they are mourned for, who, in Solomon’s words, “rejoice in doing evil, and delight in what is worse.” If they recognized their impending condemnation, they would mourn for themselves!
