74.  As the house of our exterior life is the building which the body lives in, so the house of our thought is any thing whatever that the mind is centered in by affection.  For every thing that we love, we as it were make our dwelling-place by reposing in it.  Whence Paul, because he had fixed his heart in things above, being still upon earth indeed, yet a stranger to earth, said, Our conversation is in heaven. [Phil. 3, 20]  So the mind of the hypocrite in whatever it does minds nothing else but the fame of its own reputation, nor cares where it is carried [‘ducitur’] after by its deserts, but what it is called [‘dicatur’] in the mean season.  Therefore his house is delight of popularity, which he as it were dwells in at rest, in that in all his works he throws himself back thereupon within his mind.  But this house can never stand, because praise fleeth away with life, and the applause of man does not hold in the Judgment.  Hence the foolish virgins too, who took no oil in their vessels, because their glory was in the voices of others and not in their own consciences, confounded by the presence of the Bridegroom, say, Give us of your oil, for our lamps are going out. [Matt. 25, 8]  For to seek oil from our neighbours is to beseech the fame of good works from the testimony of another man's mouth.  For the empty soul, when it finds that it has retained nothing within by all its labours, looks about for testimony from without.  As if the foolish Virgins said plainly, ‘When ye behold us cast away without reward, say ye what ye have seen in our practice.’
75.  But the hypocrite leans in vain then upon this house of applause, since no human testimony stands him in stead in the Judgment; for the same praise, which he afterwards claims in testimony, he before received in reward.  Or surely the hypocrite leans upon his house, when beguiled by vain caresses, he is as it were lifted up in assurance of his holiness; for hypocrites do many things evil in secret, but a few things good in public.  And when they receive praises from the good that appears, they turn away the eyes of observation from the concealed ill, and they esteem themselves such as they hear without, not such as they know themselves within.  Whence it very often happens that they also come to the Judgment of the Most High with confidence, because they imagine themselves such in the sight of the Interior Judge, as they were held to be by men without.  Yet ‘the house of the hypocrite cannot stand,’ for in the terror of a sifting search, all the foregoing assurance of holiness falls to the ground.  And when he knows that the testimony of another man's lips is wanting to him, he betakes himself to reckoning up his own works.  Hence it is still further added, He shall prop it, but it shall not rise up.  For that which cannot stand by itself, is propped to make it stand; for when the hypocrite sees his life tottering in the Judgment, he sets himself to make it stand in propping it, by the enumeration of his deeds.  Do not they prop the dwelling-place of their own praise on every hand, who in reckoning up their own deeds in the Judgment, as we said before, say, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in Thy Name?  and in Thy Name have cast out devils?  and in Thy Name done many marvellous works? [Matt. 7, 22. 23.]  But the house of praise, stayed up by all these statements, cannot rise, because the Judge saith directly, I never knew you; depart from Me, ye that work iniquity.  And it is to be had in mind that any thing, that rises, lifts itself from below to a higher elevation, and so ‘the house of the hypocrite cannot rise,’ in that in all that he may have done after the heavenly precepts, he never lifted his soul from off the earth, so that with justice he is not then lifted up to the meed of recompense, who in that which he sets forth now, lies prostrate in the desire of temporal glory.  But whereas we have heard how the life of the hypocrite, represented by the name of ‘a rush,’ is rejected in the Judgment, let us hear what sort of person he is held by men before the strict Judge appeareth.
