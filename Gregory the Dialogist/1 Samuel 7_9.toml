17. But good pastors also confer upon their afflicted subjects not only the aids of prayers, but also of sacrifices. Whence it is added: 'And Samuel took a suckling lamb, and offered it as a whole burnt offering to the Lord, and Samuel cried out.' What is the cry of Samuel, if not the great power of desire in the supplication of the priest? Whence to Moses, silent on his lips, yet desiring the salvation of his subject people with fervent devotion, it is said by the Lord: 'Why do you cry out to me' (Exod. XIV, 15)? But who is the suckling lamb, if not the one whom his forerunner pointed out, saying: 'Behold the Lamb of God, behold him who takes away the sins of the world' (John I, 29)? And he is called suckling, because in his innocence true humanity is proclaimed. But one lamb is offered, because apart from him, no one is found who might take away the sins of the world. And indeed he offered the lamb whole. For the wholeness of the lamb pertains to the soundness of the catholic profession. For it is as though one divides the lamb, who is separated from the rule of faith by the sword of error. The lamb, therefore, is so called on account of innocence; suckling, on account of the assumption of our nature; one, on account of the singularity of his power; whole, on account of the most firm soundness of our faith.

18. But if anyone wishes to refer these things not to him, but to his imitator, he may do so. For we offer a lamb when, through the good of chastity and innocence, we are conformed to our Redeemer; and when we are fed by the teaching of our innocent Fathers, we suck as it were at the breasts by which we are nourished unto eternal life. We also offer one lamb if, after the beginnings of religious conversion, we are polluted by no stain of wickedness. For he offers one lamb who does not flow away from the purpose of innocence to the stains of a polluted life, from which he would have to return through the repetition of good works. To offer a whole lamb is also to prepare for eternal life not only continence of the flesh but integrity of the mind. He by no means offers a whole lamb to the Lord who consecrates his flesh to God through continence but does not restrain the secrets of his mind from the wantonness of impure thoughts. For he steals away, as it were, a part of the lamb from the sacrifice, who does not join purity of heart to continence of body. Whence the Lamb himself, teaching his disciples to offer a whole one, says: "You have heard that it was said to the ancients: You shall not commit adultery; but I say to you that whoever looks at a woman to lust after her has already committed adultery in his heart" (Matt. 5:27–28). Hence also the foolish virgins are noted in the Gospel, who prepared their lamps but did not prepare oil (Matt. 25:3). For they have lamps prepared who preserve the good of modesty in the body; and they also have oil who maintain the brightness of purity in the watchfulness of their mind. Let it therefore be said of Samuel: "He offered a whole lamb to the Lord," because for the good of modesty to suffice for divine appeasement, it must be preserved not only in the brightness of the body but in the splendor of interior purity.

19. For he who prays for others can be heard by the Lord, who is not in any respect hateful to the Lord to whom he makes supplication. For if he is still weighed down by his own weakness, he is by no means heard for obtaining the strength of his neighbors; and he does not raise his desire to the heights of divine majesty, because he himself does not at all strive to ascend from the depths where he lies through his fall by the effort of more fervent zeal.
