But the sentence that is immediately added is greatly to be feared. Receive this with attentive ear of heart, my brothers and lords: insofar as you are sinners, my brothers; insofar as you are righteous, my lords. Receive this with attentive ear, so that you may feel it less at the judgment, the more fearfully you now hear it in preaching. For he says: "But I say to you that none of those men who were invited shall taste my supper." Behold, he calls through himself, he calls through angels, he calls through the fathers, he calls through the prophets, he calls through the apostles, he calls through pastors, he calls also through us, he often calls through miracles, he often calls through scourges, he sometimes calls through the prosperity of this world, he sometimes calls through adversity. Let no one despise, lest while the one called makes excuses, when he wishes to enter he may not be able. Hear what Wisdom says through Solomon: "Then they shall call upon me, and I will not hear; they shall rise early, and shall not find me." Hence it is that the foolish virgins coming late cry out, saying: "Lord, Lord, open to us." But to those seeking entrance it is then said: "Amen, amen, I say to you, I know you not." What amid these things, dearest brothers, except that we ought to abandon all things, postpone the cares of the world, and yearn for eternal desires alone? But these things have been given to few.

I want to admonish you to leave all things behind, but I do not presume to do so. If therefore you cannot abandon all things of the world, hold onto the things of this world in such a way that you are not held by them in the world; so that earthly things may be possessed and not possess you; so that what you have may be under the dominion of your mind, lest if your mind is conquered by love of earthly things, it itself be rather possessed by its own possessions. Therefore let temporal things be for use, eternal things for desire; let temporal things be for the journey, let eternal things be longed for at the arrival. Let whatever is done in this world be regarded as if from the side. But let the eyes of the mind reach forward before us, while with complete attention they gaze upon those things to which we are coming. Let vices be thoroughly uprooted, torn out not only from the act of deeds, but also from the thought of the heart. Let not the pleasure of the flesh, nor the anxiety of curiosity, nor the fever of ambition hinder us from the Lord's supper, but even those things which we do honorably in the world, let us touch them as if from a certain side of the mind, so that earthly things which please us may serve our body in such a way that they by no means obstruct our heart. Therefore, brothers, we do not dare to tell you to leave all things behind; but nevertheless, if you wish, you leave all things behind even while retaining them, if you so manage temporal things that you still strive with your whole mind toward eternal things.
