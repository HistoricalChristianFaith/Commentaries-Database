For behold it is added: "Who lifting up his eyes, when he was in torments, saw Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom." O how great is the subtlety of God's judgments! O how strictly is the recompense of good and evil deeds carried out! Certainly it was said above that in this life Lazarus sought the crumbs falling from the rich man's table, and no one gave to him; now concerning the torment of the rich man it is said that he desires water to be dropped from the tip of Lazarus's finger into his mouth. From this therefore, from this, brethren, gather how great is the strictness of God's severity. For this rich man who was unwilling to give even the least things from his table to the wounded poor man, placed in hell, came to seeking even the least things. For he who denied crumbs of bread asked for a drop of water.
