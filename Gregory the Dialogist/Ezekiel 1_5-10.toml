The preface of each Gospel avers that these four winged creatures denote the four holy Evangelists. Because he began from the generations of humankind, Matthew is justly represented by a man; because of the crying in the wilderness, Mark is rightly indicated by a lion; because he started from a sacrifice, Luke is well described as an ox; and because he begins with the divinity of the Word, John is worthily signified by an eagle, he who says, “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God”; while he stretched towards the very substance of divinity, he fixed his eye on the sun as if in the fashion of an eagle. But because all the elect are members of our Savior, for our Savior is indeed the head of all the elect, in that his members are thereby depicted, there is no obstacle to even him being signified in all these. For the only-begotten Son of God truly became man; he deigned to die like an ox at sacrifice for our salvation; he, through the virtue of his fortitude, rose as a lion. Moreover, the lion is said to sleep with open eyes because, in the very death in which our Savior could sleep through his humanity, by remaining immortal in his divinity, he kept vigil. Furthermore, ascending to heaven after his resurrection, he was carried aloft to the heights like an eagle. He is therefore wholly the same within us at the same time, who became a man by being born, an ox in dying, a lion in rising again and an eagle in ascending to the heavens.

The sole of the foot in the holy preachers is like that of a calf, namely, advancing in due season, brave and cloven, because each possesses reverence in maturity, fortitude in action and division on the hoof in discernment.

There are two lives of holy preachers, the active, of course, and the contemplative, but the active precedes the contemplative in time, since contemplation ensues from a good work. For the contemplative confers greater merit than the active because the latter strives in the practice of instant labor, while the former tastes future rest with secret savor.

Why are the four said to have a man and a lion on the right side and an ox on the left? Nor is it without wondrous reason that those two are said to be on the right and that one on the left. And, again, we must ask why the eagle is said to be not on the right or the left but above these four. Thus we present two questions that we must answer with the Lord’s revelation. Indeed, a man and a lion are said to be on the right and an ox on the left. So, we have joys on the right and sorrows on the left. Hence we describe as our left that which we consider to be adverse. And, as we said before, the incarnation is represented by the man, the passion by the ox and truly the resurrection of our Creator by the lion. For all the elect were gladdened by the incarnation of the only-begotten Son, through whom we are saved; truly the holy apostles, the first of the elect, were saddened by his death and rejoiced anew at his resurrection. Because, therefore, his nativity and his resurrection offer joy to his disciples, who were saddened by his passion, the man and the lion are described as being on the right and truly the ox on the left. For, indeed, these same holy Evangelists rejoiced in his humanity and were encouraged by his resurrection, they who had been saddened by his passion. Therefore, the man and the lion are on the right because the incarnation of our Savior gave them life, the resurrection established them. But the ox is to the left, because his death laid them low for a moment in faithlessness. But the place of the eagle is rightly defined not beside but above them, since, whether because it denotes his ascension or because it declares the Word of the Father to be with the Father, in the virtue of contemplation he surpasses the Evangelists; for, although speaking with them about Christ’s divinity, he contemplates this more subtly than all of them. But if, when the eagle is joined with the other three, they are said to be four living creatures, is it any wonder that he is described as above these, because having seen the Word in the beginning, John even transcended himself?
