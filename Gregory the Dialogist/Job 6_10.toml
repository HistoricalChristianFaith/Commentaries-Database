22.  The Elect, when they know that they have done unlawful things, but find upon careful examination that they have met with no afflictions in return for those unlawful deeds, with the immense force of their fear, are in a ferment with alarm, and labour and travail with dark misgivings, lest grace should have forsaken them for ever, seeing that no recompensing of their ill-doing keeps them safe in the present life; they fear lest the vengeance which is suspended be stored to be dealt in heavier measure at the end; they are eager to be stricken with the correction of a Father's hand, and they reckon the pain of the wound to be the medicine of saving health.  Therefore it is rightly said in this place, Let this be my consolation, that afflicting me with grief He spare not.  As if it were in plain words, ‘May He, Who spares people here for this cause, that He may strike them for ever and ever, therefore strike me here, that, by not sparing me, He may spare me for ever.  For I console myself in being afflicted, in that conscious of the rottenness of human corruption, by being wounded I gain assurance for the hope of saving health.’  And that he uttered it not with a swoln but with a humble mind, he makes plain, as we have before said, by the addition, in the words,
Neither will I gainsay the words of the Holy One.
23.  Most often the words of God to us are not the sounds of speech, but the enforcement of deed.  For He speaks to us in that which He works upon us in silence.  Blessed Job then would be gainsaying the words of God, if he murmured at His blows; but what feelings he entertains for his smiter is shown by him, who, as we have already said, calls Him ‘Holy One’ from whom he is submitting to blows.
