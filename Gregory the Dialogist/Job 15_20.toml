42.  The Elect also are apt to feel pride in some of their thoughts and actions.  But because they are Elect persons, they cannot feel pride all their days, because before they end their lives, they turn their hearts from self-exaltation to the fearing of humility.  But ‘the wicked man feels pride all his days,’ in that he so brings his life to an end, that he never departs from self-exalting.  He looks round him on all that is flourishing in time, and he neglects to consider whither he is being carried for ever.  He puts his trust in the life of the flesh, and thinks that those things continue for long, which he holds at the moment.  His mind is set firm in self-exaltation, every one of his kin is brought into contempt, how suddenly death creeps upon him he never takes thought, how certain his happiness he never reflects; whereas if he did but turn his eyes to the uncertainty of fleeting life, he would never keep for a certainty things uncertain.  And hence it is well added;
And the number of the years of his tyranny is uncertain.
43.  For he ought not to have felt pride at all, even if he might have had the number of his years assured, so that knowing how long he should live, he might know beforehand when to withdraw himself from self-exaltation.  But since the present life is always uncertain, death’s creeping upon him ought always to be apprehended the more, insomuch as it can never be foreseen.  And he rightly calls the pride of the wicked, ‘tyranny.’  For he is justly styled a tyrant, who in the commonwealth takes the lead without right.  And be it known that every proud man, according to his several measure, exercises tyranny.  For what sometimes one person practises in the commonwealth, in this case, by power of high office accorded to him, another in a province, another in a city, another in his own family, this same another by concealed wickedness practises to himself in the thought of his own heart.  Nor does the Lord regard what amount of evil each person may be able to do, but what amount he may have the mind to do.  And when the power is wanting without, he is, a tyrant within himself, whom iniquity lords it over within; for though he does not oppress his neighbours outwardly, yet inwardly he seeks to possess power, in order to oppress them; and because Almighty God considers the hearts of men, the wicked man has already done in his eyes the thing that he conceived.  Now our Creator willed that our end should be hidden from us with this view, that whereas we are uncertain when we may die, we may always be found ready for death.  Hence after it has been said, All his days the wicked man feels proud, he rightly adds, and the number of the years of his tyranny is uncertain.  As if it were said in plain words, ‘Wherefore is he lifted up as if on the grounds of a certainty, the tenure of whose life is held under the penalty of uncertainty?’  But Almighty God not only reserves future punishments for those that live wickedly, but even here, where they go wrong, he besets their hearts with punishments, that by this alone, viz. that they sin, they should be smiting themselves, and that always trembling, always full of suspicion, they should be afraid of meeting with those mischiefs from others, which they remember themselves to have done to others.
