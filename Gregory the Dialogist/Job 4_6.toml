33.  All which same he makes to succeed that sentence which he set before, saying, But now a stroke is come upon thee, and thou faintest; it toucheth thee, and thou art troubled.  Thus he declares that they were brought to nought all of them together, in this, that he blames blessed Job's being troubled by the scourge.  Yet it is to be well taken notice of, that though he chides unbefittingly, yet the ranks of virtues he fitly describes; for in enumerating the virtues of blessed Job, he marked out his life in four stages, in that he both added strength to fear, and patience to strength, and to patience, perfection.  Since one sets out in the way of the Lord with fear, that he may go on to strength; for as in the world boldness begets strength, so in the way of God boldness engenders weakness; and as in the way of the world fear gives rise to weakness, so in the way of God fear produces strength; as Solomon witnesses, who says, In the fear of the Lord is strong confidence. [Prov. 14, 26]  For ‘strong confidence’ is said ‘to be in the fear of the Lord,’ in that, in truth, our mind so much the more valorously sets at nought all the tenors of temporal vicissitudes, the more thoroughly that it submits itself in fear to the Author of those same temporal things.  And being stablished in the fear of the Lord, it encounters nothing without to fill it with alarm, in that whereas it is united to the Creator of all things by a righteous fear, it is by a certain powerful influence raised high above them all.  For strength is never shewn saving in adversity, and hence patience is immediately made to succeed to strength.  For every man proves himself in a much truer sense to have advanced in ‘strength,’ in proportion as he bears with the bolder heart the wrongs of other men.  For he was little strong in himself, who is brought to the ground by the wickedness of another.  He, in that he cannot bear to face opposition, lies pierced with the sword of his cowardice.  But forasmuch as perfection springs out of patience, immediately after patience we have the perfectness of his ways introduced.  For he is really perfect, who feels no impatience towards the imperfection of his neighbour; since he that goes off, not being able to bear the imperfection of another, is his own witness against himself, that he is not yet perfectly advanced.  Hence Truth says in the Gospel, In your patience possess ye your souls. [Luke 21, 19]  For what is it to possess our souls, but to live by the rule of perfection in all things, to command all the motions of the mind from the citadel of virtue?  He then that maintains patience possesses his soul, in that from hence he is endued with strength to encounter all adversities, whence even by overcoming himself he is made master of himself; and as he quells himself in a manner worthy of all praise, he comes forth unquelled with dauntless front, because by conquering himself in his pleasures, he makes himself invincible to reverses.  But as Eliphaz rebuked him with reviling, so now he adds a few words, as if in exhortation.
