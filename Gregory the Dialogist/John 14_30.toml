For we must consider deeply how terrible for us will be the hour of our death, what fear of mind, how great then the memory of all our evils, what forgetfulness of past happiness, what dread and consideration of the Judge. Then malign spirits seek their own works in the departing soul; then they recount the evils they persuaded, that they may drag the soul as their companion to torments. But why do we say this only of the perverse soul, when they come also to the elect as they depart, and seek something of their own in them, if they might prevail? Yet One among men existed, who before His passion says with free voice: "I will no longer speak much with you; for the prince of this world comes, and in me he has nothing." For since he saw Him as a mortal man, the prince of the world believed he could find something of his own in Him. But He departed from the corruption of the world without any sin, who came into the world without sin.

This Peter did not presume to say of himself against the prince of the world, Peter who deserved to hear: "Whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven." This Paul did not presume to say, who before he paid the debt of death reached the secrets of the third heaven. This John did not dare to say, who for his special love reclined on the breast of his Redeemer at supper. For since the Prophet says: "Behold, I was conceived in iniquities, and in sins did my mother bear me," he could not be without fault in the world who came into the world with fault. Hence the same Prophet says: "No living person shall be justified in your sight." Hence Solomon says: "There is no just man on earth who does good and does not sin." Hence John says: "If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us." Hence James says: "For in many things we all offend."

For it is established that all who were conceived from the pleasure of the flesh—without doubt in their action, or speech, or thought—the prince of this world had something of his own in them. But therefore he could not seize them afterward or hold them before, because He snatched them from their debts who paid the debt of death for us without being in debt, so that our debts do not hold us under the right of our enemy, because the mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus, freely rendered for us what He did not owe. For He who rendered for us the unowed death of the flesh freed us from the owed death of the soul. He says therefore: "For the prince of this world comes, and in me he has nothing."

Hence we must take care, and consider daily with great weeping, how ravenous, how terrible the prince of this world may come seeking his own works in us on the day of our departure, if he came even to God dying in the flesh, and sought something in Him in whom he could find nothing.

What then shall we wretches say, what shall we do, we who have committed innumerable evils? What shall we say to the adversary who searches us and finds much of his own in us, except only this which is our certain refuge and solid hope: that we have been made one with him in whom the prince of this world sought something of his own and could find nothing at all? For he alone is free among the dead. And we are now released from the bondage of sin with true liberty, because we are united to him who is truly free. For it is established, and we cannot deny it, but we truthfully confess that the prince of this world has much in us; yet at the time of our death he cannot seize us, because we have become members of him in whom he has nothing. But what does it profit that we are joined to our Redeemer through faith, if we are separated from him by our conduct? For he himself says: "Not everyone who says to me, Lord, Lord, will enter the kingdom of heaven." Therefore right works must be joined to right faith. Let us wash away the evils we have done through daily laments; let right works arising from love of God and neighbor overcome our past wickedness; let us refuse no good that we can bestow upon our brothers. For we do not otherwise become members of our Redeemer unless by clinging to God and showing compassion to our neighbor.
