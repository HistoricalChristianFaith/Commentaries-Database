62.  Whereas all that blessed Job underwent, that heavy Jewish people, being instructed by the strong declaration of the Fathers, was brought to know, they were written with ‘an iron pen’ and ‘a plate of lead;’ but whereas the hard hearts of the Gentiles also were made acquainted with them, what is this but that we see them ‘hewn in the flint?’  And observe, that what is written on lead, by the mere softness of the metal, is quickly obliterated; but upon the flint letters may be more slowly stamped indeed, but more hardly obliterated.  Therefore it is not unsuitably that by ‘the plate of lead’ Judaea is represented, which at once received the precepts of God without labour, and lost them with speed; and rightly by ‘the flint’ the Gentile world is represented, which could with difficulty receive the words of sacred revelation to keep, but kept them when received fixedly.  Now by the ‘iron pen’ what else is denoted save the strong sentence of God?  Whence too it is said by the Prophet, The sin of Judah is written with a pen of iron on a diamond nail [ungue]. [Jer. 17, 1]  The end of the body is in the nail, and a diamond is so hard a stone, that it cannot be cut with iron.  Now by ‘an iron pen’ there is denoted a strong sentence, but by a ‘diamond nail’ the eternal end; so the sin of Judah is said to be written with a ‘pen of iron upon a diamond nail,’ in that the guilt of the Jews is reserved by the strong sentence of God for an end that is endless.
63.  Rightly too by ‘a plate of lead’ we understand those, whom the load of avarice weighs down, to whom it is said by the Prophet with upbraiding, O ye sons of men, how long heavy in heart!  For by lead, the nature whereof is of a heavy weight, the sin of avarice is in a special manner denoted, which renders the mind it has infected so heavy, that it call never be raised to aim at things on high.  Hence it is written in Zechariah, Lift up now thine eyes, and see what is this that goeth forth.  And I said, What is it? And he said, This is an ephah [Lat.  amphora] that goeth forth.  He said moreover, This is their eye throughout all the earth.  And behold there was lifted up a talent of lead, and, lo, one woman sitting in the midst of the ephah.  And he said, This is wickedness; and he cast her into the midst of the ephah, and he cast the weight of lead on her face [or into the mouth thereof]. [Zech. 5, 5-8]  And with reference to this vision of ‘the ephah,’ and ‘the woman,’ and ‘the lead,’ that he might shew more fully what he had been made to know, he yet further added going on, Then lifted I up mine eyes, and looked, and behold there came out two women, and a spirit was in their wings, for they had wings like the wings of a kite, and they lifted up the ephah between the earth and the heaven.  Then said I to the angel that talked with me, Whither do these bear the ephah?  And he said, To build it an house in the land of Shinar. [v. 9-11]  Which testimony of the Prophet we have brought forward as a proof of the lead to no purpose, if we do not also explain it going over it again.  Thus he says, Lift up now thine eyes, and see what is this that goeth forth; and I said, What is this?  And he said, It is an ephah that goeth forth.  God desiring to shew to the Prophet, by what sin above all others the human race fell away from Him, by the figure of an ephah as it were denoted the wide-opened mouth of avarice.  For avarice is like an ephah, in that it keeps the mouth of the heart open and agape on the stretch [in ambitu].  And he said, This is their eye through all the world.  We see many men of dull sense, and yet we see them sharp in bad practices, as the Prophet too testifies, who saith, They are wise to do evil; but to do good they have no knowledge. [Jer. 4, 22]  And so these are dull in sense, but in those things which they desire, they are urged on by the goads of avarice; and they that are blind to see good, under the incitements of rewards are quick-eyed to the doing evil things.  Hence it is rightly said of this same avarice, This is their eye in all the world.  And behold there was lifted up a talent of lead.  What is ‘a talent of lead’ but the weight of sin from that very avarice.  And, lo, one woman sitting in the midst of the ephah.  Which same woman, lest perchance we should doubt who she was, the Angel thereupon made known; for it follows there immediately, And he said, This is impiety; and he cast her into the midst of the ephah.  Impiety is ‘cast into the midst of the ephah,’ in that in avarice there is always impiety taken in.  And he cast the weight of lead on her face.  The mass of lead is cast on the woman’s face, in that the impiety of avarice is borne down by the very weight of its own sin; for if it did not reach after things that are below, it would never prove impious towards God and our neighbour.
64.  Then, lifted I up mine eyes, and looked, and behold there came out two women and a spirit was in their wings.  What do we understand by these ‘two women’ but the two principal vices, i.e. pride and vain glory, which are without any doubt united to impiety?  Which two are described as having ‘a spirit in their wings;’ in that they are subservient to the will of Satan in their actions; for the Prophet calls that one ‘a spirit,’ concerning whom Solomon saith, If the spirit if him that hath power rise above thee, leave not thy place; [Eccles. 10, 4] and of whom the Lord saith in the Gospel; When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through dry places. [Mat. 12, 43]  ‘A spirit is in their wings,’ in that in whatsoever they do, pride and vain glory render obedience to the will of Satan.  And they had wings like the wings of a kite.  Now the kite is always busied in plotting against the chicken kind.  So these women have ‘wings like the wings of a kite,’ in that surely their doings are like the devil, who is always plotting against the life of the little ones.  And they lifted up the ephah between the earth and the heaven.  Pride and vain glory have this peculiar to them, that whosoever is infected by them, they lift up in his own conceit above the rest of his fellow creatures: at one time by pursuit of the gifts of fortune, at another time by the desire of dignities, the man whom they have once gotten captive, they, as it were, lift up into the height of honour.  And he that is between the earth and the heaven, at once leaves things below, and fails altogether to attain the things on high.
65.  These women, then, ‘lift up the ephah between the earth and the heaven,’ in that pride and vain glory so exalt the mind taken captive through greediness of honour, that looking down upon all their neighbours, men do, as it were, leave things below, and in proud boasting seek high things.  But all such persons, while they give themselves up to pride, at once in imagination mount above those, with whom they are placed, and are far from ever being united to the citizens above.  Thus the ephah is said to be ‘lifted up between earth and heaven,’ in that all covetous persons through pride and vain glory at once despise their neighbours at their side, and never lay hold of the things above, which are beyond them; and so they are carried ‘between the earth and the heaven,’ in that they neither keep equality of brotherhood in this lower world by charity, nor yet are able to attain the world above by setting themselves up.  And I said to the Angel that talked with me, Whither do these bear the ephah?  and he said, To build it an house in the land of Shinar.  That same ephah has a ‘house built it in the land of Shinar,’ for ‘Shinar’ is rendered ‘their ill savour;’ and as there is a sweet savour from virtue, as Paul bears witness, who saith; and maketh manifest the savour of His knowledge by us in every place; For we are unto God a sweet savour of Christ; [2 Cor. 2, 14] so reversely there is an ill savour from vice.  For covetousness is the root of all evil. [1 Tim. 6, 10]  And whereas every thing evil is engendered by avarice, it is meet that the house of avarice should be erected in ‘ill savour.’  Moreover it is necessary to be known that ‘Shinar’ is a very wide valley, wherein the tower was begun to be built by men giving themselves to pride, which, when the diversity of tongues was brought to pass, came to destruction; which same tower was called Babylon, forsooth on account of that very confusion of minds and tongues: nor is it inappropriately that the ‘ephah’ of avarice is placed there, where ‘Babylon,’ i.e. ‘confusion,’ is building, in that whereas it is certain that from avarice and impiety all things bad have their origin, this same avarice and impiety are rightly described as dwelling in confusion.
66.  We have said these things in few words out of course, that we might shew that the weight of sin is set forth by the ‘plate of lead.’  Yet these very words of blessed Job are also applicable to Holy Church, who while keeping the two testaments of sacred revelation, as it were begs a second time that her words should be written, saying, Oh! that my words were now written!  Oh! that they were printed in a book!  Which same, in that she speaks with a strong sentence at one time to hearts heavy from the weight of avarice, at another time to hardened hearts, ‘writes with a pen of iron upon a plate of lead,’ or, surely, ‘upon the flint.’  Now we say with justice that blessed Job uses the accents of our Redeemer and His Church, if we find any thing that he says explicitly of that same Redeemer of us men; for how is it to be believed that he teaches us any thing connected with Him in a figure, if he does not point Him out to us in express words?  But now let him disclose to us what he is sensible of concerning Him, and let him take away from us all misgivings in our thoughts.
