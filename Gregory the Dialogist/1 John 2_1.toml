There is a problem here. A righteous advocate never takes unrighteous cases, which ours of course are. What can we do, dear brothers? The only way to get around this is to follow what Scripture says: “The righteous man accuses himself first of all.” Therefore a sinner who weeps over his sins and accuses himself is set on the path of righteousness, and Jesus can take up his case.
