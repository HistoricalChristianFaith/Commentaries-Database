For in constant weeping, in our daily repentance, we have a priest in heaven who intercedes for us. Of whom it is also said through John: If anyone sins, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous, and he himself is the propitiation for our sins. We hear of his power. But fear again gnaws at our exultation, because he who is our advocate is called righteous. For we have unjust cases, but a righteous advocate in no way takes up unjust cases, nor consents to speak words on behalf of injustice. What then shall we do, my dearest brothers? But behold, it occurs to my mind what we should do. Let us both abandon and accuse the evils we have done. It is written: The righteous man is his own accuser at the beginning. For any sinner converted in weeping already begins to be righteous when he starts to accuse what he has done. For why should he not be righteous who now rages through tears against his own injustice? Therefore our righteous advocate will defend us as righteous in the judgment, because we both recognize and accuse ourselves as unjust.
