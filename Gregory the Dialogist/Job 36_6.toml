49. Holy Scripture is frequently wont to call the humble, ‘poor.’ Whence they are mentioned in the Gospel, with the addition, ‘spirit,’ when it is said, Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. [Matt. 5, 3] For, because riches visibly manifest the powerful, those are poor in their own sight, who are not puffed up in their own minds. But he calls those ‘wicked,’ who are either cut off from the piety of the faith, or who else contradict themselves, by their wicked habits, in that which they faithfully believe. Because then Almighty God condemns pride of wickedness, not loftiness of power; after it was said, God rejecteth not the mighty, though He is Himself mighty; it is rightly subjoined, But He saveth not the wicked, and giveth judgment to the poor. That is, He destroys the proud, but sets free the humble, by His judgment. Or certainly He gives judgment to the poor, because those who are now wickedly oppressed, then come themselves as judges over their oppressors.
50. There are in truth two classes, namely, of the Elect and the reprobate. But two ranks are comprised in each of these classes. For some are judged and perish; others are not judged and perish. Some are judged and reign; others are not judged and reign. They are judged and perish, to whom it is said in our Lord’s declaration, I hungered, and ye gave Me not to eat; I thirsted, and ye gave Me not drink; I was a stranger, and ye took Me not in; naked, and ye covered Me not; sick and in prison, and ye visited Me not. [Matt. 25, 42. 43.] To whom it is before said, Depart from Me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels. [ib. v. 41] But others are not judged in the last judgment, and yet perish. Of whom the Prophet says, The ungodly do not rise again in the judgment. [Ps. 1, 5] And of whom the Lord declares, But he that believeth not is judged already. [John 3, 18] And of whom Paul says, They who have sinned without the Law, shall perish without the Law. [Rom. 2, 12] Therefore even all unbelievers rise again, but to torment and not to judgment. For their case is not then examined; because they come into the presence of their strict Judge, with the condemnation already of their own unbelief. But those, who retain their profession of faith, but have not works in accordance with it, are convicted of sin, in order to their perishing. But they, who have not enjoyed even the sacraments of the faith, do not hear the reproof of the Judge at the last ordeal; for, condemned already by the darkness of their own unbelief, they do not deserve to be condemned by the open reproof of Him, Whom they had despised. Those hear at least the words of the Judge, because they have retained at least the words of His faith. These hear not in their condemnation the sentence of the eternal Judge: because they would not retain their reverence for Him even in words. Those perish by the Law, because they have sinned under the Law; whilst no mention of the Law is made to these, in their condemnation; because they made no effort to have any thing of the Law. For a prince, who administers an earthly commonwealth, punishes in different ways a citizen, who offends at home, and an enemy who makes war abroad. In the first case, he considers his rights, and condemns him in language of just reproof. But against an enemy he wages war: he wields instruments of destruction, and inflicts the tortures his wickedness deserves. But he does not enquire what the law provides for his offence. For it is not necessary for him to be destroyed by Law, who could never be held by the Law. Thus, therefore, in the last judgment, both a lawful reproof smites him down, who has departed in his conduct from that which he held in profession; and he is destroyed without a judicial sentence, who is not held by the law of faith.
51. But of the class of the Elect, some are judged and reign. As those, who wipe away with their tears the stains of their life, who, atoning their former misdeeds by their subsequent conduct, conceal from the eyes of their Judge, with the cloak of alms deeds, whatever unlawfulness they may have ever committed. To whom, when placed at His right hand, the Judge says at His coming, I hungered, and ye gave Me to eat. I thirsted, and ye gave Me to drink. I was a stranger, and ye took Me in, naked, and ye covered Me; sick, and ye visited Me; I was in prison, and ye came to Me. [Matt. 25, 35. 36.] To whom he speaks before, saying, Come, ye blessed of My Father, possess the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world. [ib. v. 34] But others are not judged, and yet reign; as those, who surpass even the precepts of the Law in the perfection of their virtues; because they are by no means satisfied with fulfilling that which the Divine Law enjoins on all, but with surpassing eagerness desire to perform more, than they would learn from general precepts. To whom it is said by the voice of the Lord; Ye which have left all and have followed Me, when the Son of Man shall sit on the throne of His Majesty, ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel. [Matt. 19, 28] And of whom the Prophet says, The Lord will come to judgment with the. elders of His people. [Is. 3, 14] And of whom Solomon, when speaking of the Bridegroom of holy Church, observed, saying, Her husband is noble in the gates, when he sitteth with the elders of the land. [Prov. 31, 23] These, therefore, are not judged in the last judgment, and yet reign, because they come as judges together with their Creator. For, leaving all things, they performed, from ready devotion, more than they heard ordered in general terms. For that, which the rich young man heard, was said by a special command to the more perfect, and not generally to all, Go and sell all that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven, and come and follow Me. [Matt. 19, 21] For if a general command bound all persons under this precept, it would be at once a fault for us to possess any thing of this world. But a general direction to all persons in Holy Scripture is one thing, a command specially to the more perfect is another. These then are rightly not bound by the general judgment, who in their conduct have far surpassed even general precepts. For as they are not judged, and yet perish, who, from the persuasion of unbelief, scorn to be bound by the Law; so, they are judged not, and yet reign, who, from the persuasion of godliness, advance even beyond the general precepts of the Divine Law. Hence is it, that Paul, far surpassing even special precepts given him, performed more in deed, than he received by the appointment of permission. For when he had received, that preaching the Gospel he should live of the Gospel, he both communicated the Gospel to his hearers, and yet refused to be maintained at the expense of the Gospel. [l Cor. 9, 14. 15.] Why then should he be judged in order to reign, who received a less obligation, but found out a higher mode of life? Let it be said then rightly, He giveth judgment to the poor: because, the more they are despised, by this world, for their great humility, the more do they then rise up, with greater height of power, to the seats which have been assigned them.
