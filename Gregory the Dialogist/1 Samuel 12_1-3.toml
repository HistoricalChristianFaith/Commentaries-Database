1. When wicked pastors are in charge, their principal aim is the plundering of their subjects. For because they know not how to look upon the abundance of eternal goods, the more ardently they desire present things, the more greedily they receive what is offered, and what is not offered they seize by violence. They lay snares for the innocent, oppress the weak, accept bribes, and pervert justice. Concerning these pastors, the Lord reproaches Judea through the prophet, saying: "Your pastors are evening wolves, leaving nothing for the morning" (Zeph. 3:3). He likewise strikes the slanderers of the innocent and the oppressors of the weak, saying: "If anyone does not put something into their mouths, they declare holy war against him. Therefore night shall be to them instead of vision, and darkness instead of divination" (Mic. 3:5–6). For while they recognize the iniquity they commit, through the audacity of their most wicked work they fall into blindness of heart, so that through love of present things they no longer see the light of truth, by which they might recover from their wickedness. Likewise Isaiah rebukes the acceptance of bribes, saying: "They all love bribes, they pursue rewards" (Isa. 1:23). The holy man therefore, while he shows the simplicity of his innocence, appeared exalted by the height of his merits. This commendation of virtue is indeed shown in him alone, so that the same conformity of goodness may be shown to all chosen teachers.

2. We have innocence of life for ourselves, but we ascend the height of prelacy for others, not for ourselves. Through the good of innocence we press toward the eternal homeland; through the height of prelacy we keep watch in the guardianship of others. In that virtue we are secure, but this eminence we hold with great fear: because we who greatly tremble to render an account of our own works must render an account to God for that over which we preside over others. If therefore chosen men, by God's will, ascend even the height of prelacy unwillingly, by God's will they also leave that same height with devotion. The holy man therefore says: 'Behold, I have heard your voice, and I have set a king over you; and now the king walks before you. But I have grown old and gray-haired. Moreover, my sons are with you.' As if he were saying in other words: Because I presided not for myself but for you, the dignity which I held I gladly gave to another. I have already grown old in that same dignity, and yet the long habit of preeminence which I held did not keep me bound in ambition for it. What then does it mean that he says: 'My sons are with you', except that in holy men there is a great power of spiritual love, by which, when sons are born to the height of office, they take away from them the right of succession? But he who so peacefully leaves the summit of office shows what kind of man he was while he remained at that same height. For because he did not practice the violence of plunder, he says: 'Speak concerning me before the Lord and before His Christ, whether I have taken anyone's ox or donkey.' Likewise, because he sought no occasion of harming anyone, he added, saying: 'If I have falsely accused anyone.' Likewise, because he was not burdensome to the weak, he says: 'If I have oppressed anyone.' Likewise, because from his prelacy he sought not earthly things but heavenly, he says: 'If I have received a gift from anyone's hand, I will despise it today and restore it to you.'
