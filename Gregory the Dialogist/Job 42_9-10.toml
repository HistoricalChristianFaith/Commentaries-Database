But when the text immediately adds, “And the Lord turned to the penitence of Job, when he had prayed for his friends,” it clearly shows that through penitence he deserved to have his prayers fulfilled promptly, because he had interceded for others. He held that his prayers were effective for him, as he had offered them for others. The merciful Judge more favorably receives the sacrifice of prayer when it is accompanied by the love of neighbor, and one enriches it even more truthfully when he offers it for his enemies as well.
