18.  We are said to answer anyone, when we do works in turn answerable to his deeds.  Thus in that change the Lord ‘calls,’ and man ‘answers,’ in that, before the brightness of The Incorrupt, man is shown forth incorrupt after corruption.  For now so long as we are subject to corruption, we do not in any wise ‘answer’ our Creator, seeing that whereas corruption is far from incorruption, there is no similarity suitable to our answering.  But of that change it is written, When He shall appear, we shall be like Him: for we shall see Him as He is. [1 John 3, 2]  Then therefore we shall truly ‘answer God,’ Who ‘calleth,’ when at the bidding of the Supreme Incorruption we shall arise incorruptible; and because the creature is not able to earn this by itself, but it is brought to pass by the gift of Almighty God alone, that it should be changed to that exceeding glory of incorruption, it is rightly subjoined;
Thou wilt stretch forth Thy right hand to the work of Thine hands.
19.  As if he said in plain words; ‘For this reason Thy corruptible creature is able to hold fast unto incorruption, because he is lifted up by the hands of Thy power, and is kept by the grace of Thy regard, that he should hold fast.’  For the human creature by this alone, that it is a creature, has it inherent in itself to sink down below itself, but man has obtained it from his Creator, that he should both be caught above himself by contemplation, and held fast in himself by incorruption.  And so that the creature may not fall away beneath himself, but hold on in incorruption, he is lifted to the stedfastness of immutability by the right hand of His Maker.  Moreover it may be that by the title of ‘the Right Hand’ the Son may be designated; in that, All things were made by Him. [John 1, 3]  Thus Almighty God ‘stretched out His Right Hand to the work of His hands,’ because, that He might lift on high the human race, become refuse and grovelling in the lowest things, He sent the Only-Begotten One, made Incarnate for this end.  By Whose Incarnation it has been vouchsafed to us that we, who fall into incorruption of our own will, should one time be enabled to answer God when He calls us in the glory of incorruption.  Wherein who can estimate the bountifulness of Divine Mercy, that He should bring man after sin to such a height of glory?  God takes account of the bad things we do, yet by the grace of His lovingkindness He remits them to us in mercy.
