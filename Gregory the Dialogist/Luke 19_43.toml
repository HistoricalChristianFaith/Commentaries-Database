"Because the days will come upon you, and your enemies will surround you with a rampart; and they will encircle you, and hem you in on every side." For the Roman princes are indicated when it is said: "Because the days will come upon you, and your enemies will surround you with a rampart."

Who are ever greater enemies of the human soul than the malignant spirits, who besiege it as it departs from the body, whom they nourished with deceitful pleasures while it was placed in love of the flesh? They surround it with a rampart, because by bringing back before the eyes of its mind the iniquities which it perpetrated, they constrict it, dragging it to the fellowship of their damnation, so that caught now in the very extremity of life, it may see both by what enemies it is surrounded, and yet be unable to find a way of escape, because it is no longer permitted to perform the good works which, when it was permitted to do them, it despised.
