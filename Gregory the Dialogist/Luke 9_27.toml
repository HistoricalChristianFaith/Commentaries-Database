He continues: "But I say to you truly, there are some standing here who will not taste death until they see the kingdom of God." The kingdom of God, dearest brothers, is not always called the coming kingdom in sacred Scripture, but sometimes the present Church is so called. Hence it is written: "The Son of man will send his angels, and they will gather out of his kingdom all causes of scandal." In that kingdom, indeed, there will be no scandals, where certainly the reprobate are not admitted. By this example it is understood that in this passage the kingdom of God refers to the present Church. And because some of the disciples were going to live in the body long enough to see the Church of God built and raised up against the glory of this world, it is now said as a consoling promise: "There are some of those standing here who will not taste death until they see the kingdom of God." But when the Lord was giving such great precepts about the death that must be undergone, what need was there to come suddenly to this promise? If we consider carefully, we recognize with what great dispensation of love this is done. For to the inexperienced disciples something had to be promised even about the present life, so that they could be strengthened more firmly for the future. Thus to the Israelite people, about to be freed from the land of Egypt, the promised land was promised, and when they were to be called to heavenly gifts, they were persuaded by earthly promises. Why was this? So that while there was something they could receive nearby, they might then more faithfully believe what they could hear about from afar. For a carnal people, if they did not receive small things, would not believe in great things. Therefore Almighty God, by granting earthly things, persuades toward heavenly things, so that by receiving what they could see, they might learn to hope for what they could not see at all; and they would become all the more firm regarding invisible things, inasmuch as visible promises supported them toward certainty of hope. Hence rightly also it is said through the Psalmist: "He gave them the lands of the nations, and they took possession of the labors of the peoples, that they might keep his statutes and observe his law." So therefore in this passage, Truth speaking to the inexperienced disciples promises that the kingdom of God will be seen on earth, so that it might be more faithfully hoped for by them in heaven. From that very kingdom which we now see exalted in the world, let us hope for the kingdom which we believe is to be received in heaven. For there are some who are counted by the name of Christianity, but do not have the faith of Christianity. They judge that only visible things exist, they do not desire invisible things, because they do not even suspect that they exist. We stand at the bodies of the holy martyrs, my brothers. Would they have given their flesh over to death unless they were most certainly convinced that there was a life for which they ought to die? And behold, those who so believed shine forth with miracles. For to their dead bodies the living sick come and are healed, perjurers come and are tormented by a demon, the demon-possessed come and are set free. How then do they live there where they live, if in so many miracles they live here where they are dead?

I will tell you, brothers, a story brief in words but not small in merit, which I learned from certain devout elders who narrated it. In the time of the Goths there was a certain very religious matron who frequently came to the church of these martyrs. One day when she had come to pray as was her custom, upon leaving she found two monks standing there in pilgrim's garb. She believed them to be pilgrims and ordered that something be given to them as alms. But before her almoner could approach them to distribute the alms, they came closer to her and said: "You visit us now; we will seek you out on the day of judgment, and whatever we can, we will provide for you." Having said this, they vanished from her sight. Terrified, she returned to pray and poured herself out at great length in tears. And after this she became all the more persistent in prayer, the more certain she was of the promise. But if, according to the words of Paul, faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen, we can no longer tell you to believe in the life to come, because behold, those who live in that life are visibly presented to human eyes. For what can be seen is better said to be known than believed. Therefore the Lord wished us to know the life to come rather than merely believe in it, since he visibly shows us that those whom he invisibly receives live with him.
