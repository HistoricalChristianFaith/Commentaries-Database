15. For the Lord had said above to Samuel: They have not rejected you, but me, that I should not reign over them (1 Kings VIII, 7). But of Saul it was said a little before: Because they despised him, and did not bring him gifts (Ibid., X, 27). But he who was rejected, and he who was despised, after the enemies had been slain and victory obtained, heard the people crying out: Give us the men, and we will kill them. Indeed, each of them could have taken vengeance on their enemies, not by killing, but by consenting; but even because the prophet had been rejected, he speaks, and the king who had been despised supports the one who says: No one shall be killed on this day, because our holy preachers are crowned with a greater victory when they endure the adversities of their neighbors than when they overcome enemies abroad. Whence also true wisdom speaks in Solomon, saying: The patient man is better than the mighty (Prov. XVI, 32). But it should be noted what is said: On this day. On the day of his victory, he seeks to kill who inflames those whom he draws to the love of God by the brightness of his virtues to harm others. Or he kills on the day of victory, because by that light of glory by which one is brought to veneration of the preacher, one is stirred up to hatred against those who detract from that same teacher. For whoever hates his brother is a murderer (1 John III, 15). For since through the teaching of a good pastor the good are to be helped in such a way that the wicked are tolerated, the reason why no one should be killed is well added: Because, he says, today the Lord has wrought salvation in Israel. There follows: And Samuel said to the people: Come, let us go to Gilgal, and let us renew the kingdom there. And all the people went to Gilgal, and there they made Saul king before the Lord.
