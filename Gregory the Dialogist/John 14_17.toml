But if the Holy Spirit abides in the disciples, how is it a special mark of the Mediator that [the Spirit] abides in him.… We shall better understand if we distinguish between the different gifts of the Spirit.… In respect of those gifts without which we cannot attain to salvation, the Holy Spirit ever abides in all the elect. But in respect of those that do not relate to our own salvation but to procuring that of others, [the Spirit] does not always abide in them.… For he sometimes withdraws his miraculous gifts so that his grace may be possessed with humility.… Christ … has him without measure and always.
