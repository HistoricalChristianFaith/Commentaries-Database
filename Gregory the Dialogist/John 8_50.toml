He provides us with an example of what we should do in such a situation when he adds, "I do not seek my own glory; there is one who seeks and judges." We know that it is written that "the Father has given all judgment to the Son," and yet we see that when the Son receives insulting words he does not seek his own glory. He leaves the offenses offered him for the Father's judgment. And so he suggests to us how patient we should be when even he, the Judge, does not wish to avenge himself.

(ut sup.) How we are to take injuries, He shows us by His own example, when He adds, I seek not Mine own glory, there is one that seeketh and judgeth.
