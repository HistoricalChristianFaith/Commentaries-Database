In these words of the prophet we must first inquire who are the priests of the greater order, whether those who keep watch in the guardianships of the temple, or those who serve at the ministry of the altar. But because shortly afterward it is added: "The altar was before the face of the temple," it is clearly shown that those are priests of the greater order who keep watch in the guardianships of the temple, because indeed they minister at the altar which is within. But those who keep watch at the altar which is before the face of the temple are inferior by as much as they minister in the outer areas. Therefore we must inquire who the priests are who guard the temple, and who are said to keep watch for the ministry of the altar. The teacher of the Gentiles, writing to the faithful, says: "The temple of God is holy, which you are." Who then are the priests who guard the temple of God, if not those who by praying, by preaching, by keeping watch in spiritual activities, defend the holy Church from the assaults of malignant spirits, from the persuasions of the wicked, from the errors of heretics? Was he not a guardian of the temple who, enumerating the labors of his suffering, says: "In labor and hardship, in many watchings, in hunger and thirst, in many fastings, in cold and nakedness"? And immediately he adds: "Besides those things which are from without, my daily urgency, the care of all the churches." Consider, I ask, with how great solicitude the guardian of the temple keeps watch. For behold, he suffers inestimable things in himself, and he shares the solicitude of his heart with others. Of what virtue, I ask, is it to think more about the welfare of one's neighbors than about one's own affliction? Who can worthily estimate this? Who can worthily weigh it? He labors, he grieves, he hungers, he thirsts, he is cold, he fasts, he keeps watch, and yet while keeping watch he thinks about the care of all the churches. Behold, a most diligent guardian of the temple is set forth as an example. Let whoever is able imitate him. For to suffer adversities for the truth, to bestow good things upon neighbors, to keep watch concerning the care of souls, to seek out and restrain anyone from falling into faithlessness, into pride, into plundering, or into impurity—this is to guard the temple of God, that is, the holy Church.
