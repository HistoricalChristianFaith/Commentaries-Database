Holy church has two lives, the one that it leads temporally, the other that it receives for eternity, the one in which it labors on earth, the other in which it is rewarded in heaven, the one in which it earns rewards, the other truly in which it rejoices in the receipt thereof, and in each life it offers sacrifices.
