When any one who has fallen into sin is recalled to a state of righteousness by the vigor of pastoral care, one who had been cast away is brought back. As a ligature binds a fracture, so discipline subdues a sin, in order that the woundâ€™s bleeding should not lead to death for lack of sufficient compression. But often a fracture is made worse, when it is bound together without sufficient care such that the cut is more severely felt from being bound too tightly.
