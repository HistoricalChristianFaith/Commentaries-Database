That lust resides in the loins in men and in the navel in women, the Lord testifies when speaking of the devil to blessed Job, saying: "His strength is in his loins, and his power is in the navel of his belly." Therefore, by the principal sex, lust is designated by the name of loins, when the Lord says: "Let your loins be girded." For we gird our loins when we restrain the lust of the flesh through continence. But because it is not enough to refrain from evil unless one also strives to labor in good works, it is immediately added: "And have burning lamps in your hands." For we hold burning lamps in our hands when through good works we show examples of light to our neighbors. Concerning these works the Lord indeed says: "Let your light shine before men, that they may see your good works and glorify your Father who is in heaven." Now two things are commanded: both to restrain the loins and to hold lamps, so that there may be both the purity of chastity in the body and the light of truth in action. For one without the other can in no way please our Redeemer, whether he who does good has not yet abandoned the defilements of lust, or he who excels in chastity does not yet exercise himself in good works. Neither is chastity great without good work, nor is any work good without chastity.
