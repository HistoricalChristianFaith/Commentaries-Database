At the right hand of the East my calamities on the spot arose. They overturned my feet, and oppressed with their footpaths as with waves.

For 'calamities' would 'rise to the left,' if at the hand of any persons set without the pale of Religion, and openly denying Christ, she met with the adverse dealings of persecution. But when she undergoes from persons seemingly believers the trial of tormentings, it is as if calamities arose to her at the right hand, because they who are enlisted under Christ's name, assail Christ's name in her. For by the very usage of speech we speak of having as 'on the right' what we account as great, and as on the left that which we look down upon. So then as there for 'the right hand' the Jewish people is denoted, so in this place by the term of 'the right hand,' the faithful people of Holy Church is denoted. And hence the Judge that is to come 'shall set the goats on His left Hand, and the sheep on His right Hand.' But when these very persons too fret Holy Church in the time of adversity, who seemed to be of the faithful, surely 'calamities arise to her on the right hand.' Now rightly is this same called 'the right hand of the East'; since it is written of the Head itself of the same, The East is His Name. For seeing that the light springs from the East, He is rightly called 'the East,' by the light of whose righteousness the night of our unrighteousness is enlightened. So 'calamities arise to the right hand of the East'; because these likewise leap forth to persecution, who were supposed to be Elect Members of our Redeemer. Which same calamities he rightly declares 'arise on the spot,' because whereas they who persecute were not persons without her pale, evils are brought about by them suddenly and on the spot. But if 'the right hand' is a designation of those who are truly believers, 'calamities arise to the right of the East,' because on the crisis of persecution breaking forth, the righteous undergo the cruel assaults of the wicked.

What are denoted by the Church's 'feet,' but her outermost members? which while they lend themselves to earthly deeds, are able to be the sooner deceived by adversaries in proportion as they do not understand things on high. Therefore these 'feet adversaries overturn,' that is to say, when they draw her outermost members to the error of their doctrine. The 'feet overturned' cannot keep the way, in that all the weak being either persuaded by the promises of their persecutors, or affrighted by their threats, or broken by their tortures, swerve from the right path. Now 'the paths' of adversaries are rightly likened to waves, when it is said, and they oppressed with their footpaths as with waves; in this way, because the life of the evil-minded, mischievous with wayward restlessness, comes down as a tempest for the overwhelming the ship of the heart, so to say. Concerning which same tempest it is said by Solomon, As a tempest passing, the wicked shall not be. And when the weak man sees the froward flourishing, that man the wave of wretched imitation plunges into the sea of frowardness.
