Our gate has four tables in the inner porch because holy church [was instructed by the preaching of four Evangelists through whose teaching the heart learned to ascend to love of almighty God and to offer its thoughts to him in sacrifice. Two of them are said to be on this side and two on that, because two Evangelists bore witness to what they saw concerning the Lord, and two reported what they learned by listening to their seniors. Surely there are four tables in the inner porch, this which we plainly see, because holy church] received for the instruction of the faithful peoples four orders of rulers whom Paul enumerates by the gift of the almighty Lord, saying, “He gave some, apostles; some, prophets; some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers.”

The tables have a width of one and a half cubits, because the hearts of the saints are spread in breadth of charity for the neighbor whom they love and see, and they measure one cubit.

What are the souls of the faithful if not holy vessels that catch the words of piety, so that the whole burnt offering of life and prayer may be sacrificed from their minds.

The borders of the tables are bent inward when the teachers are silent in thought and recall what they say and closely examine themselves as to whether they practice what they preach.

Apparent harshness but charity in mind is to be shown to the wicked, for a vigorous appearance can coerce the wrongdoer, and the preservation of charity does not lose the reward of meekness.
