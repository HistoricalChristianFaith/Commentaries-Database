But four tables for the holocaust were built from squared stones.

For whom do we understand by squared stones in this place, if not any holy ones whose life has known how to stand firmly in prosperity and adversity? For a squared stone stands equally on whichever side it has been turned. Therefore whoever is not lifted up in prosperity, is not broken in adversity, is not drawn by persuasions to evil, is not called back from good work by reproaches, is a squared stone. And he has stability as if from every side, because he does not have a fall in any change. Certainly when the prophet recognized that the Jewish people were perishing from the faith, and foresaw holy apostles rising in the Church, through whom many from the gentiles were strengthened in the fortitude of faith and life, he spoke in great consolation, saying: "The stones have fallen, but we shall build with squared stones." For seeing apostles, martyrs, and teachers rising in the holy Church, he grieved less at the fall of stones, that is, at the perdition of the Jews, because he beheld the building of almighty God, that is, the holy Church being built from squared stones. Therefore four tables are constructed from squared stones, because faith and life, patience and kindness have been given from the life of the saints as an example to following peoples, so that now the vestibule may have tables, that is, the people may hold the virtues of life, in which they may kindle the sacrifice of prayer to almighty God on the altar of their heart. For whatever good the faithful peoples of the holy Church have done or do, they have received this as an example from the life of their preachers. For whence would this vestibule have tables, unless it had found squared stones? So that we may briefly bring forward one example from the squared stones, do you wish, dearest brothers, to see faith? "For me to live is Christ, and to die is gain." Do you wish to know life? "The world is crucified to me, and I to the world." Do you wish to hear patience? "Even unto this hour we both hunger and are struck with fists, and are without stable dwelling, and we labor working with our own hands; we are cursed and we bless, we suffer persecution and we endure; we are blasphemed and we entreat." Do you wish to know kindness? "But I most gladly will spend and be spent myself for your souls." And lest perhaps we believe that he was a debtor to the love of those for whom he desired to be spent, he soon adds to those same disciples, saying: "Though loving you more, I am loved less." When therefore the life of holy preachers is known by the faithful people for imitating their virtues, assuredly tables are constructed from squared stones in the vestibule. Indeed the Synagogue also had spiritual fathers in teaching and prophecy, from whom it might draw an example of life in virtues. But its unlearned people, serving more through fear than following through love, refused to imitate the life of the fathers which it saw, and therefore the outer gate which proceeds toward the north does not have tables for the holocaust.

These tables were made from squared stones, in length one and a half cubits, and in width one and a half cubits, and in height one cubit.

These tables were made from squared stones, because while they meditate daily on the words of sacred eloquence in their hearts, they are constructed as if from squared stones for offering the holocaust of prayer to the Lord. For the words of Sacred Scripture are squared stones, because they stand everywhere, because they are found reprehensible from no side. For in everything they narrate about the past, in everything they announce about the future, in everything they preach morally, in everything they sound forth spiritually, they have stability as if on different sides, because they have no fault. Therefore the hearts of the saints are tables of God constructed from squared stones for the holocaust, because those who always meditate on the words of God sacrifice themselves to the Lord from carnal life in their thought. Hence it is written: The law of his God is in his heart, and his steps shall not be supplanted. And hence it is said again: In my heart I have hidden your words, that I may not sin against you. But since we have learned from what these tables are constructed, let us also hear what their measurements are. It follows: In length one and a half cubits, and in width one and a half cubits, and in height one cubit.

A certain person explained this passage, saying: The tables have in length and width one and a half cubits, that is, as a square, which joined together make three cubits. These three cubits have in height one cubit, so that the mysteries of the Trinity may preserve the measure of one cubit, that is, of the divine majesty. This interpretation cannot stand, because in that supreme Trinity which created all things and contains all things, there is no half, nor is anything one made from two halves. For that substance has nothing of diminution or division, which always remaining unchangeable, receives neither decrease nor increase. But we have often said that length pertains to the longsuffering of hope, while width pertains to the amplitude of charity. Therefore the tables which were constructed for the holocaust are measured with a length of one and a half cubits, because the holy fathers and teachers, who extend themselves with longsuffering toward the secrets of inner hope, through the fact that they live in virtues, are indeed very perfect as far as human measure is concerned, but as far as those divine mysteries which cannot be fully grasped by man, as long as they remain in this mortal flesh, they are not perfect. Therefore in themselves they already have a cubit, but in God they do not yet have a cubit, because indeed they already advance fully in virtues, but nevertheless they still know something about God only in part. Behold, again Paul comes to mind as testimony regarding the measure of the table. Let us see whether his life is measured by a complete cubit. For he says: Let us, as many as are perfect, think this. Let us see if in those things which he perceives about God he has already perfectly extended himself to perceive the mysteries: I do not consider myself to have comprehended. Who again says: We know in part, and we prophesy in part; but when that which is perfect has come, that which is in part will be done away. Who again says: Now I know in part, but then I shall know just as I also am known. If therefore he is perfect, and knows in part, he has a cubit, as far as concerns himself, but nevertheless a half above himself. Let the hearts of the saints therefore be extended in the longsuffering of hope, let them be extended in the perfection which they have, by one cubit. But because they cannot yet see fully, where they direct the eye of hope, that which they have above one cubit is cut back to a half cubit, so that in this life they may always see themselves as imperfect, and run more ardently toward perfection.

In width one and a half cubits.

The tables also have a width of one and a half cubits, because the hearts of the saints, expanded in the breadth of charity, have a cubit according to the neighbor whom they love and see. For they can perfectly love those whom they are able to know perfectly in some measure. But Almighty God they love from the depths of their being, they follow from the depths of their being, yet they cannot love Him as much as they ought, because they are not yet able to see Him whom they love; and the measure of love is less where the measure of knowledge is still less. Therefore they have one cubit and a half, because what is much less is already complete in their soul, that is, charity toward their neighbor; but what is much greater in them, that is, the love of God whom they do not see, is not yet complete. Concerning this love, which begins here so that it may be perfected by the vision of the Lord in the eternal homeland, Isaiah rightly speaks, saying: "The Lord lives, whose fire is in Zion, and His furnace in Jerusalem." Now it is more to be a furnace than a fire, because a fire can also be small, but in a furnace a vaster flame is kindled. Zion indeed means contemplation, while Jerusalem is called the vision of peace. We contemplate our peace here in the meantime, so that we may fully see it there afterward. From the love of the Lord, therefore, there is a fire in Zion, a furnace in Jerusalem, because here we burn to some degree with the flames of His love, where we contemplate something of Him; but there we shall fully burn, where we shall fully see Him whom we love.

And in height one cubit.

The height of the tables is one cubit. For what is the height of the saints, if not faith in invisible things? For through faith what is not seen is believed, and therefore through this the mind of the righteous is led to height, so that it may despise all visible things on earth and follow in heaven those invisible things which it hears. But the height of the tables has one cubit, because there is unity of faith in the heart of all the saints. That God is one Trinity both the fathers of the Old Testament and the preachers of the New Testament have professed. Therefore the height of the tables has nothing more than one cubit, nothing less, because the faith of all the fathers agrees with itself in great unity. But those who, already advancing to the patience of hope through the highest virtues, have one and a half cubits, and are measured by one and a half cubits in the breadth of charity, but grow to one cubit in the height of faith—these are great and worthy of being venerated with the highest admiration. Therefore they ought to receive the souls of the little ones in the bosom of their way of life, and offer them in the sight of the Lord as a kind of holocaust and sacrifice.
