"And rising I went out into the plain, and behold, there the glory of the Lord stood, like the glory which I saw beside the river Chebar."

The prophet saw in the plain the glory of the Lord, which he had seen beside the river Chebar in the midst of the Israelites, because that same majesty appeared to the Gentiles which had first revealed itself to the elect among the Jewish people through the revealing Spirit.

"And I fell upon my face."

Having seen the glory of the Lord, the prophet falls on his face, because although a man may be elevated to understand sublime things, nevertheless from the contemplation of God's majesty he understands the weakness of his own condition; and he who sees himself to be ashes and dust before God's eyes has, as it were, no standing.
