Forasmuch as the nature of every thing is compounded of different elements, in Holy Writ different things are allowably represented by any one thing. For the lion has magnanimity, it has also ferocity: by its magnanimity then it represents the Lord, by its ferocity the devil. Hence it is declared of the Lord, Behold, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David hath prevailed. Hence it is written of the devil, Your adversary, the devil, like a roaring lion, walketh about seeking whom he may devour.
