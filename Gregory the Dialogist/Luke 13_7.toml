The lord of the vineyard came to the fig tree a third time, because he sought out the nature of the human race before the law, under the law, and under grace, by waiting, admonishing, and visiting.

And he said to the keeper of the vineyard: Behold, these three years I come seeking fruit on this fig tree, and I find none. He came before the law, because through natural understanding he made known what each person should do toward his neighbor by his own example. He came in the law, because he taught by commanding. He came after the law through grace, because he showed the presence of his mercy by displaying it. But nevertheless he complains that in three years he found no fruit, because the minds of certain wicked people are neither corrected by the inspired natural law, nor instructed by precepts, nor converted by the miracles of his incarnation. What indeed is expressed by the keeper of the vineyard, except the order of those placed in authority? Who, while they preside over the Church, certainly bear the care of the Lord's vineyard. For Peter the apostle was the first keeper of this vineyard. We unworthy ones follow him, inasmuch as we labor for your instruction by teaching, entreating, and rebuking.

But now we must hear with great fear what is said to the cultivator of the vineyard concerning the unfruitful tree: Cut it down; why does it even occupy the ground? Each person according to his own measure, insofar as he holds a place in this present life, if he does not produce the fruit of good works, like an unfruitful tree occupies the ground, because in that place where he himself is, he also denies others the opportunity to work. But in this world any powerful person, if he does not have the fruit of good works, also presents an obstacle to others, because whoever is under him is oppressed by the example of his wickedness, as if by the shadow of his perversity. The unfruitful tree stands above, and below the barren ground lies. The shadow of the unfruitful tree thickens above, and the ray of the sun is by no means permitted to descend to the earth, because when any subjects observe the perverse examples of a perverse patron, they themselves also, remaining unfruitful, are deprived of the light of truth. And, pressed down by the shadow, they do not receive the warmth of the sun, because they remain cold toward God on account of that by which they are badly protected in this world. But concerning any such perverse and powerful person, God scarcely makes any further inquiry. For after he has lost himself, the only question to be asked is why he also oppresses others. Hence the lord of that same vineyard rightly says: Why does it even occupy the ground? For he occupies the ground who burdens the minds of others; he occupies the ground who does not employ in good works the place that he holds.
