For in the Law God held the rod, in that He said, 'If any man do this or that, let him die the death.' But in His Incarnation He removed the rod, in that He shewed the paths of life by mild means. Whence it is said to Him by the Psalmist, "Set forward, go forth prosperously and rejoice, because of truth, and meekness, and righteousness." For He had no mind to be feared as God, but put it into our hearts that as a Father He should be loved; as Paul clearly delivers; "For ye have not received the Spirit of bondage again to fear, but ye have received the Spirit of adoption of sons, whereby we cry, Abba, Father." Hence too it is fitly added here, "Then would I speak, and not fear Him." For the holy man, because he beholds the Redeemer of the world coming in meekness, does not assume fear towards a Master, but affection towards a Father. And he looks down on fear, in that through the grace of adoption he rises up to love. Hence John says; "There is no fear in love, but perfect love casteth out fear."
