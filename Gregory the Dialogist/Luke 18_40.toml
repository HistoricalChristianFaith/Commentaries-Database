But when we persist intensely in our prayer, we fix Jesus as He passes by in our mind. Hence it is added there: And Jesus, standing still, commanded him to be brought to Him. Behold, He who was passing by before now stands still, because while we still suffer the crowds of phantasms in prayer, we perceive Jesus as somewhat passing by. But when we persist intensely in prayer, Jesus stands still to restore our sight, because God is fixed in the heart, and the lost light is restored.

Yet in this matter the Lord suggests something else to us, which can be usefully understood concerning His humanity and divinity. For Jesus passing by heard the blind man crying out, but standing still He performed the miracle of illumination. For to pass by belongs to humanity, to stand still belongs to divinity. Through His humanity indeed He experienced being born, growing, dying, rising again, coming from place to place. Therefore, since in divinity there is no changeableness, and this very thing—to be changed—is to pass by, certainly that passing by is from the flesh, not from the divinity. But through His divinity it belongs to Him always to stand still, because He is present everywhere, neither coming through movement nor departing through movement. Therefore the Lord passing by hears the blind man crying out, but standing still illuminates him, because through His humanity He had compassion on the cries of our blindness and showed mercy, but He poured into us the light of grace through the power of His divinity.
