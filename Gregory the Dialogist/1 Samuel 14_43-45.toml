It should also be known that the vice of gluttony tempts us in five ways. For it sometimes anticipates the seasons of want, but sometimes [it] does not anticipate them but seeks for daintier food. Sometimes it looks for those things, which must be taken, to be prepared more carefully; but sometimes it agrees with both the quality of, and the season for, its food, but exceeds, in the quantity of what is to be taken, the measure of moderate refreshment. But sometimes that which it longs for is even of a baser kind, and yet it sins more fatally through the heat of unbounded desire. For Jonathan deserved in truth the sentence of death from the mouth of his father, because in taking honey he anticipated the time which had been fixed for eating.

What then is the meaning of what is said, "Shall Jonathan then die," unless that another would have died for the same fault? By these words of the people there is surely shown to us the power of great discernment, because in the judgment of the elect, not only must the causes of faults be weighed, but also the merits of persons. This is openly shown by these words, because Jonathan is declared not to die not because he was the son of the king, but because he had wrought great salvation in Israel. When therefore great men fall, they are not to be handed over to the common judgment, because their prior works deserve that the gravity of their later faults be lightened. But this lightening of fault itself is not to be determined by respect of persons, but by regard for their prior life, because for his absolution the gains of Holy Church must be weighed, not carnal affection admitted. But what wonder if one's own merits avail for the absolution of a sinner, when from the authority of sacred Scripture we learn that some have been delivered for the sake of others? Indeed, by the good work of some, others are helped, as is said by the Lord to the sinning King Solomon: "Because you have not kept my commandments, I will surely tear your kingdom apart and give it to your servant. Nevertheless, in your days I will not do it, for the sake of David your father; but from the hand of your son I will tear it away" (1 Kings 11:11). Hence it is that not only do the works of fathers benefit their children, but we have also recognized that citizens are to be delivered for the sake of fellow citizens. Indeed the Lord promised to spare Sodom, which was to be overthrown, if He found in it only ten righteous persons (Gen. 18). Jerusalem also is said to be looked upon mercifully, because some good works were found in it. Hence it is that Eli, righteous in his own life but negligent in pastoral authority, heard from the man of God: "A great part of your house shall die when they reach manhood; nevertheless I will not utterly take away from you a man from my altar" (1 Sam. 2:33), so that sacred Scripture might here openly show that he was both struck for his laxity and regarded for his past manner of life. But he could perhaps be struck in part, because he had some impurity of life. Of Jonathan therefore it is well said: "Shall Jonathan then die, who has wrought this great salvation in Israel? Far be it! As the Lord lives, not a hair of his head shall fall to the ground, for he has worked with God this day." As if to say: He who has done great works has worthily deserved to be absolved entirely. Because therefore in ecclesiastical judgment, even if there is no respect of persons, there is nevertheless a discernment of merits, he fittingly concluded the sentence, saying: "So the people delivered Jonathan, that he should not die."

In this passage it should be noted that the king twice uttered an oath above concerning the killing of Jonathan, whom nevertheless, overcome by the insistence of the people, he did not kill. What does it mean that he swore, and by no means kept the assertion of his oath? But from this matter two lessons come to us, namely that we ought to be both cautious and discerning. Cautious indeed, lest we swear; discerning, if we swear to do perverse things. For he who takes care not to swear cannot possibly commit perjury. But when one swears wrongly, it is more just that the oath be abandoned than that the crimes which are sworn be carried out. Therefore let everyone be cautious before he swears, so that either he does not swear at all, or does not swear that he will do evil things. That we should indeed be cautious, the Lord teaches, saying: "Let your speech be: Yes, yes; no, no. Do not swear by heaven, nor by the earth" (Matt. 5:37). On the other hand, the reprobate are both incautious and lacking in discernment. For they often promise that they will do evil things, and do not trouble themselves to revoke their promises, as though they would incur perjury. Hence it is that Herod swore incautiously, and fulfilled the wicked oath he had uttered in the death of the Lord's forerunner (Mark 6). We ought therefore to be cautious in our decisions, but if we neglect to be cautious, our resolutions must be abandoned, not fulfilled. For to desist from a resolution in this way is not the vice of fickleness, but the virtue of discernment. Nevertheless, swearing things that must be revoked and detested is absolutely to be avoided and greatly dreaded, because when such an oath is not fulfilled, guilt is not entirely avoided, but the lesser evil is chosen.
