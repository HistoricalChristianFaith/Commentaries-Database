30.  For ‘the eye of Man’ is the pity of the Redeemer, which softens the hardness of our insensibility, when it looks upon us.  Hence, as the Gospel witnesses, it is said, And the Lord turned, and looked upon Peter.  And Peter remembered the word of the Lord.  And he went out, and wept bitterly. [Luke 22, 61. 62.]  But the soul when divested of the flesh ‘the eye of Man’ doth not henceforth at all regard, in that it never delivers him after death, whom grace doth not restore to pardon before death.  For hence Paul saith, Behold, now is the accepted time, behold, now is the day of salvation. [2 Cor. 6, 2]  Hence the Psalmist saith, For His mercy is for the present state of being [d]; [Ps. 118, 1] for this reason, that the man whom mercy doth not rescue now, after the present state of being, justice alone consigns to punishment.  Hence Solomon saith, And if the tree fall toward the south or toward the north, in the place where the tree falleth there it shall be. [Eccles. 11, 3]  For when, at the moment of the falling of the human being, either the Holy Spirit or the Evil Spirit receives the soul departed from the chambers of the flesh, he will keep it with him for ever without change, so that neither once exalted, shall it be precipitated into woe, nor once plunged into eternal woes, any further arise to take the means of escape.  Therefore let the holy man, contemplating the ills of mankind, viz. how he is removed from the present world without the knowledge of his Redeemer, and buried in everlasting flames without remedy, and taking up their voice in his own person, give utterance to the words, And the eye of man shall not see me.  Forasmuch as the man whom the grace of the Redeemer doth not now look upon to correct, it doth not then visit to keep from destruction.  For the Lord, when He cometh to judgment, looketh on the sinner to smite, but He doth not look on him to acknowledge him in bestowing the grace of salvation.  He taketh account of sins, and knoweth not the life of those that perish.  Hence after that the holy man had averred that he could no more be ‘seen by the eye of Man’ after the present life, he rightly added at once;
Thine eyes are upon me, and I shall not stand.
31.  As though he said in plain words; ‘Thou, when thou comest in severity to Judgment, both seest not, to save, and yet seest, to smite, in that him, whom Thou lookest not on in the present life with the pitifulness of Thy saving care, hereafter looking on Thou dost extinguish by Thy law of justice.  For now the sinner casts away the fear of God, and yet lives, blasphemes and yet prospers, because the pitiful Creator would not in seeing punish him, whom He would rather by waiting for bring to amendment; as it is written, And winkest at the sins of men for their repentance. [Wisd. 11, 23]  But when the sinner is then looked upon, he ‘does not stand,’ in that when the strict Judge minutely examines his deserts, the convicted sinner cannot bear up against his torments. 
32.  Not but that this likewise accords with the voice of the righteous, whose mind is ever anxiously fixed on the coming Judgment.  For they have fears for every thing that they do, whilst they heedfully consider who are the persons, and before what a Judge they will have to stand.  They behold the power of His Mightiness, and they consider what an amount of guilt they are tied and bound with from their own imperfection.  They reckon up the evil deeds of their own doing, and multiply over against them the benefits of their Creator.  They reflect how rigidly He judges wicked deeds, how minutely He examines good ones; and they foresee without a shadow of doubt that they will be lost, if they be judged apart from pity: for even this very life that we seem to live righteously is sin, if, when He takes account of our lives, the mercy of God does not make allowance for it in His own eyes.  For it is hence written in this very book, Yea, the stars are not pure in His sight. [Job 25, 5]  For strictly judged in His sight those very persons do also bear spots of defilement, that shine bright in the purity of holiness.  Therefore it is well said, Thine eyes are upon me, and I shall not stand.  As if it were said in plain terms by the voice of the righteous man, ‘If I be sifted with an exact scrutiny, I cannot stand up in undergoing judgment, for life cannot bear up against punishment, if the mercilessness of just retribution bears hard upon it.’  Now both the sin and the punishment of that same human race is well added in few words.

For “the human eye” is the pity of the Redeemer that softens the hardness of our insensibility when it looks upon us. Hence, as the Gospel witnesses, it is said, “And the Lord turned, looked upon Peter, and Peter remembered the word of the Lord. And he went out, and wept bitterly.” However, when the soul is divested of the flesh, “the human eye” does not henceforth see anything. The Redeemer’s pity never delivers anyone after death that it has not gracefully restored to pardon before death.
