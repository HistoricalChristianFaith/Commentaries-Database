For “the human eye” is the pity of the Redeemer that softens the hardness of our insensibility when it looks upon us. Hence, as the Gospel witnesses, it is said, “And the Lord turned, looked upon Peter, and Peter remembered the word of the Lord. And he went out, and wept bitterly.” However, when the soul is divested of the flesh, “the human eye” does not henceforth see anything. The Redeemer’s pity never delivers anyone after death that it has not gracefully restored to pardon before death.
