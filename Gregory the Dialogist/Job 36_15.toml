64. The poor is delivered from his straitness, when any humble person is set free from this affliction of his pilgrimage. For he is here oppressed with even continual tribulations, in order that he may be excited to seek for the joy of real consolation. Whence it follows also,
And will open his ear in tribulation.
To open the ear in tribulation, is to open the hearing of the heart, by the affliction of blows. For when we despise commands, we are treated with a merciful severity, in order that we may fear the rod. Tribulation then opens the ear of the heart, which this worldâ€™s prosperity often closes. For it is said by Solomon, The turning away of the little ones shall slay them, and the prosperity of fools shall destroy them. [Prov. 1, 32]
