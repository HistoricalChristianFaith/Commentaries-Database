72.  Whereas the ‘skin’ is expressly named, all doubt of a true resurrection is removed; in that our body will not, as Eutychius the Bishop of Constantinople wrote, in that gloriousness of the resurrection be impalpable, and more subtle than the wind and air: for in that gloriousness of the resurrection our body will be subtle indeed by the efficacy of a spiritual power, but palpable by the reality of its nature; whence also our Redeemer, when the disciples doubted of His resurrection, showed them His hands and feet, and offered His bones and flesh to be touched, saying, Handle Me and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones as ye see Me have. [Luke 24, 39]  And when, being placed in the city of Constantinople, I brought before Eutychius this testimony of truth from the Gospel, he said, ‘For this reason the Lord did this, that He might take away all doubt of the resurrection from the hearts of the disciples.’  To whom I said; ‘This is a very extraordinary thing that you assert, that doubting should arise to ourselves from the same quarter, whence the hearts of the disciples were cured of doubting.’  For what can be said worse than that that is made doubtful to us relating to His true flesh, whereby His disciples were restored anew to faith from all doubting?  For if He is declared not to have had that, which He manifested; from the same source, from whence the faith of His disciples is confirmed, ours is destroyed.  And he further added, saying, ‘He had that body which He showed a palpable body; but after the hearts of those that handled it were confirmed, all that in the Lord which was capable of being handled, was reduced into a certain subtle quality.’  To which same I answered, saying; ‘It is written, Knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more, death hath no more dominion over Him. [Rom. 6, 9]  If then there was aught in the Body which was capable of being altered after His resurrection, contrary to the truly spoken declaration of Paul, the Lord after His resurrection returned into death; and what fool even would venture to say this, save he that denies the true resurrection of His flesh?’  Then he objected to me, saying, ‘Whereas it is written; Flesh and blood cannot inherit the Kingdom of God, [1 Cor. 15, 50] by what means is it to be supposed that the flesh truly rises again?’  To whom I say; ‘In Holy Writ flesh is named in one way according to nature, and in another way according to sin or corruption.’  For there is flesh according to nature, as where it is written, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh. [Gen. 2, 23]  And, The Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us. [John 1, 14]  But there is flesh according to sin, as where it is written, My Spirit shall not always abide in those men, for that they are flesh. [Gen. 6, 3] And as the Psalmist saith; For He remembered that they were but flesh, a wind that passeth away, and cometh not again. [Ps. 78, 39]  Whence too Paul said to the disciples; But ye are not in the flesh, but in the spirit. [Rom. 8, 9]  For it was not that these persons were not in the flesh, to whom he was sending letters, but for that they had subdued the motions of carnal passions, henceforth, free through the efficacy of the Spirit, they ‘were not in the flesh.’  Therefore in respect to what Paul says, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God, he would have flesh to be understood as applied to sin, not flesh as applied to nature.  Hence directly afterwards that he was speaking of flesh after sin he makes plain, by adding; Neither doth corruption inherit incorruption.  Therefore in that glory of the heavenly kingdom there will be flesh according to nature, but not flesh according to the desire of the passions; in that the sting of death being overcome, it will reign in eternal incorruptibility.’
73.  To which words the same Eutychius directly answered that he assented, yet still he denied that the body could rise again a palpable body.  Who in the treatise too which he had written concerning the resurrection, had put in the testimony of the Apostle Paul, when he says; That which thou sowest is not quickened except it die.  And that which thou sowest, thou sowest not that body that shall be, but bare grain. [1 Cor. 15, 36. 37.]  Being eager to show this, that the flesh will either be impalpable [Nearly all MSS.  read, ‘palpabilis,’ which, if right, must come under the following negative], or will not be itself identically, seeing that the holy Apostle, when treating of the glory of the resurrection, says that ‘it was not sown the body that it shall be.’  But the answer to this is soon made.  For the Apostle Paul, when he says, Thou sowest not that body that shall be, but bare grain, is telling us of what we see; viz. that the grain, which is sown without a stalk or leaves, springs up with a stalk and leaves; so that he, in heightening the glory of the resurrection, did not say that what it was is wanting to it, but that what it was not is present: but this man, whereas he denies the real body to rise again, does not say that what was wanting is there, but that what it was is wanting.
74.  Upon this, then, we being led on in long disputing on this point, we began to recoil from one another with the greatest animosity, when the Emperor Tiberius Constantine, of religious memory, bringing myself and him to a private audience, learnt what dispute was being carried on between us, and weighing the statement of both sides, and by his own allegations as well disproving that same book which he had written concerning the resurrection, determined that it ought to be consumed in the flames.  Upon our leaving whom, I was seized with a grievous sickness, while to that same Eutychius sickness and death shortly followed.  And when he was dead, because there was well nigh no one who followed his statements, I held back from prosecuting what I had commenced, lest I should seem to be darting words at his ashes, but while he was still alive, and I sick of violent fever, I if any of my acquaintance went to him for the sake of greeting him, as I learnt from their relation, he used to take hold on the skin of his hand before their eyes, saying, ‘I confess that we shall all rise again in this flesh;’ which as they themselves avowed he was before wont altogether to deny.
75.  But let us, laying aside these considerations, minutely search out in the words of blessed Job, if there will be a true resurrection, and the true body in that resurrection; for, lo, we are no longer able to doubt of the hope of the resurrection, in that he says, And that I shall rise at the last day from the earth.  Moreover he has removed all doubting of the true renewal of the body, in that he says, And I shall be again encompassed with my skin.  And he still further adds, with the view of removing the misgivings of our thought;
And in my flesh shall I see God.
76.  Mark, he owns the resurrection, ‘the skin,’ ‘the flesh,’ in explicit words.  What is there left then, by which our mind should have occasion to doubt?  If this holy man then before the fact of the Lord’s resurrection, believed in the flesh being destined to be brought back to its entire state, what will be the guilt of our doubting, if the true resurrection of the flesh not even after the proof of our Redeemer obtains credit? For if after the resurrection there will not be a palpable body, surely another person rises again than dies: which is profane to say; viz. to believe that it is I who die, and another that doth rise again [ABCD, ‘another shall rise.’].  Wherefore I entreat thee, blessed Job, add how thou art minded, and remove from us all ground of scruple on this point.  It follows;
Ver. 27.  Whom I shall see for myself, and mine eyes shall behold, and not another.
77.  For if, as certain votaries of false opinions believe, after the resurrection there shall be no palpable body, but the subtle quality of an invisible body shall be called the flesh, though there be no substance of flesh, then surely he that dies is one person, and he that rises again is another.  But blessed Job destroys this assertion for them by a truthtelling voice, in that he says, Whom I shall see for myself; and mine eyes shall behold, and not another.  But we, following the faith that blessed Job held, and truly believing the palpable Body of our Redeemer after His resurrection, confess that our flesh after the resurrection will be at once both the same and different, the same in respect of nature, different in respect of glory, the same in its reality, different in its power.  Thus it will be subtle, in that it will be incorruptible; it will be palpable, in that it will not lose the essence of its very and true nature.  But that same assurance of the resurrection the holy man subjoins with what sure hope he holds it, with what certainty he awaits it.  It goes on;
This my hope is laid up in my bosom.
78.  We suppose that we hold nothing more surely than what we have in our bosom; and so he kept ‘hope laid up in his bosom,’ in that he laid hold beforehand on true certainty concerning the hope of the resurrection.  But whereas he made known that the day of the resurrection would come, he now, whether in his own voice, or in a figure of the holy and universal Church, reproves the deeds of the wicked, and foretells the Judgment which ensues on the day of the resurrection.
