For then your subject dies without you, when in the cause of death he has endured you as one who does not speak against it. For you are joined to the death which you do not oppose. And it should be noted what things ought to be preached by the watchman, namely faith and works. For he says: "But if you have announced to the wicked man, and he has not been converted from his wickedness and from his wicked way." For wickedness pertains to unbelief, but the wicked way pertains to depraved action. And every watchman ought to have this zeal: that he first draw people to the piety of faith, and afterward to the pious way, that is, to good action.

But since the discussion has turned to exhortation, we ought briefly to make known how great should be the order and consideration of speech in the mouth of a pastor. For a teacher ought to weigh what he speaks, to whom he speaks, when he speaks, how he speaks, and how much he speaks. For if one of these is lacking, the speech will not be fitting. Indeed it is written: "If you offer rightly, but do not divide rightly, you have sinned." We offer rightly when we do a good work with good zeal; but we do not divide rightly if we neglect to have discretion in the good work. For we ought to consider what we speak, so that according to Paul's words, "Let our speech always be seasoned with grace as with salt."

We must consider to whom we are speaking, because often a word of rebuke that one person accepts, another does not accept. And often the same person becomes different according to their deed. Hence Nathan the prophet struck David after his adultery with a strong sentence of rebuke. When he spoke about the one who seized the sheep, saying "The man who did this is a son of death," he immediately responded to him, saying: "You are that man." Yet when he spoke to him about Solomon's kingdom, because there was no fault, he humbly prostrated himself before him in adoration. Therefore in one and the same person, because the circumstances were different, the prophetic discourse was also different.

When we ought to speak must also be considered, because often even if reproof is delayed, it is afterwards kindly received. And sometimes it grows weak, if it has lost the time when it ought to have been brought forth earlier. For the wise woman also, seeing Nabal drunk, did not wish to reprove him for the fault of his avarice, but when the wine was digested she profitably struck him with the words of her reproof. And the Prophet announces that the tongues of flatterers are not to be deferred to a subsequent time, who says: "Let them immediately be confounded with shame who say to me, Well done, well done." For flattery, if it is patiently endured even for a time, increases, and little by little soothes the mind, so that it grows soft from the rigor of its rectitude in the delight of speech. But lest it should increase, it must be struck immediately and without delay.

We must also consider how we speak. For often the words that call one person back to salvation wound another. Hence the apostle Paul, who admonishes Titus, saying: "Rebuke with all authority," exhorts Timothy, saying: "Reprove, entreat, rebuke with all patience and teaching." Why does he prescribe authority to one and patience to the other, unless because he perceived that the one was of a gentler spirit, while the other was of a more fervent spirit? Upon the gentle one, severity of speech had to be enjoined through the authority of command, but he who burned with fervor of spirit needed to be tempered through patience, lest if he grew more heated than was right, he would not lead the wounded back to salvation, but would wound the healthy.

We must also be careful how much we speak, lest if we draw out a word of exhortation or reproof too long for one who cannot bear much, we lead our hearer to weariness. Hence the same excellent preacher speaks to the Hebrews, saying: "I beseech you, brethren, that you bear with the word of consolation, for I have written to you in very few words." This is especially fitting for the weak, that they hear few things indeed, and things they are able to grasp, but things that pierce their mind with the sorrow of repentance. For if a lengthy discourse of exhortation is spoken to them all at once, because they cannot retain many things, they lose everything together. Hence physicians of bodies also apply cloths to ailing stomachs with suitable medicine, but they apply it thinly, lest if they are filled with much medicine, they not help the weakness of the stomach by strengthening it, but burden it by oppressing it.

It should be known, however, that even if at times a rather lengthy discourse exceeds its proper measure, this is not dangerous for the hearers. But if how something is said, and to whom it is said, is not carefully considered, it is very dangerous. For modest minds, if they have perhaps committed some faults, should be reproved gently, because if they are rebuked too harshly, they are broken rather than instructed. On the other hand, harsh and shameless minds, if they are reproved gently, are provoked by that very gentleness to greater faults.

We learn this well in the same distinguished preacher, who when he knew that the Corinthians were divided into schism out of love for personalities, being considerate of their modesty, began his speech to them with thanksgiving and praises, saying: "I give thanks to my God always for you in the grace of God, which was given to you in Christ Jesus, because in all things you have been made rich in him, in all speech and in all knowledge, just as the testimony of Christ has been confirmed in you." He adds further and says: "So that you lack nothing in any grace, as you await the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ." I ask you, Paul, if they already lack nothing, why do you weary yourself writing to them? Why do you speak while positioned at a distance? Let us consider then, dearest brothers, how much he praises them. Behold, he asserts that the grace of God was given to them, he says they were made rich in all things in all speech and in all knowledge; he declares that the testimony of Christ, that is, what he testified about himself by dying and rising, has been confirmed in their life, and he attests that they lack nothing in any grace. Who, I ask, would believe that shortly after he rebukes those whom he praises so much? For after other things he adds: "But I beseech you, brothers, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you all say the same thing, and that there be no schisms among you." For how could schism creep in among those so perfect and so praiseworthy? "For it has been signified to me about you, my brothers, by those who are of Chloe, that there are contentions among you. But this I say, that each one of you says: 'I indeed am of Paul, but I am of Apollo, but I am of Cephas, but I am of Christ.'" Behold, those whom he had praised in all speech and in all knowledge, those whom he had said lacked nothing in any grace, speaking a little while, coming gently to rebuke, he reproves as divided among themselves; and those whose health he had first described, he afterward laid open their wounds. For a skilled physician, seeing a wound that must be cut, but perceiving the patient to be fearful, stroked it for a long time, and suddenly struck. First he placed the soothing hand of praise, and afterward he drove in the blade of rebuke. For unless modest minds are reproved with gentle stroking, so that they hear from other matters what they might take for consolation, through rebuke they immediately fall into despair.

But did Paul lie, so that he first said they lacked nothing in all grace, when afterward he was going to say they lacked unity? Far be it: who, even if foolish, would believe such things of him? But because there were among the Corinthians some filled with all grace, and there were some cut off by favoritism toward persons, he began with praises of the perfect, so that by modest rebuke he might arrive at reproof of the weak. And in this too he drew upon the practice of bodily medicine for the healing of the heart. For when a physician looks at a wound to be treated, he first touches those parts around the wound that are healthy, so that afterward he may gently reach by touching those that are wounded. Therefore when Paul praised the perfect among the Corinthians, he touched the healthy parts near the wound; but when he reproved the weak for their division, he struck the wound in the body.

Let us see, however, how this same man who is led with such modesty and gentleness to correct the Corinthians conducts himself against the Galatians, who had departed from the faith. For without any patience of modesty offered beforehand, without any sweetness of speech granted in advance, those whom he knew had departed from the faith he rebukes with invective from the very beginning of his epistle. For after the greeting, he began thus: "I marvel that you are so quickly being transferred from him who called you in the grace of Christ." To whom also, after other things, he adds in open rebuke: "O foolish Galatians, who has bewitched you?" For hard minds, unless they were struck with open rebuke, would in no way recognize the evil they had done. For often those who are shameless feel they have sinned only to the degree that they are rebuked for the sins they have committed, so that they consider their faults to be lesser when a lesser invective chastises them, and those which they see are vehemently reproved they perceive to be greater. Hence it is necessary that the speech of the preacher must always be formed according to the quality of the hearers, lest he speak harshly to the modest or gently to the shameless. But what is surprising if the dispenser of God's word does this, when even the farmer who casts seeds into the ground first considers beforehand the quality of the soil, which seeds it seems suited for, and after he has considered the quality beforehand, then he scatters the seeds? But because we have drawn out the discussion about the quality of teaching too long, it is fitting that we return to the order of exposition which we had begun.
