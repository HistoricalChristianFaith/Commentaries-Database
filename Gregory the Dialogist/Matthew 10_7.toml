Now let us hear what is commanded when the preachers are sent. "Go and preach, saying: The kingdom of heaven is at hand." This, dearest brothers, even if the Gospel were silent, the world proclaims. For its ruins are its voices. For the world, which has fallen from its glory after being worn down by so many blows, shows us, as it were, from close at hand, another kingdom that follows. It is already bitter even to those by whom it is loved. Its very ruins proclaim that it should not be loved. For if a shaken house threatened to collapse, whoever lived in it would flee; and one who had loved it while it stood would hasten to withdraw as quickly as possible from it as it falls. If therefore the world is falling and we embrace it by loving it, we wish to be crushed rather than to dwell in safety, because no reasoning separates us from its ruin when love binds us to its sufferings. It is easy, therefore, now when we see all things destroyed, to separate our heart from love of it. But this was most difficult at that time when they were sent to preach the invisible kingdom of heaven while they saw earthly kingdoms flourishing far and wide on every side.
