Let us consider the grace of merciful God, and let us condemn the multitude of our own guilt. Behold, he sees sinners and endures them, tolerates those who resist, and yet daily calls them mercifully through the Gospel. He desires our confession from a pure heart, and has forgiven all that we have done wrong. He indicated this promise of mercy for us who follow, when he says through the prophet: "I do not desire the death of the sinner, but that he be converted and live."
