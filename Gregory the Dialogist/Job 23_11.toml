42.  For he ‘keeps the way and does not decline,’ who practises the thing whereon his mind is bent.  Since to ‘keep’ in the bent is ‘not to decline’ in the practice.  For this is the anxiety of the righteous, that day by day they should try their actions by the ways of truth, and proposing these as a rule to themselves, they should not decline from the track of their right course.  Thus day by day they strive to get above themselves, and in proportion as they are lifted up upon the summit of virtues, they judge with heedful censure, whatever there is of themselves left remaining below themselves.  And they are in haste to draw the whole of themselves there, where they find that they have been brought in part.

41.  For as a kind of footsteps of God are His doings which we see, by which doings both the good and bad man is governed, by which the righteous and unrighteous are arranged in their classes, whereto both everyone that is subject is led on day by day to better things, and he that is in rebellion against them is borne with going headlong into worse.  Concerning which same footsteps the Prophet said, Thy goings have been seen, O God. [Ps. 68, 24]  And so we, when we behold the efficacy of His long-suffering and pitifulness, and upon so beholding strive to imitate the same, what else do we but follow the ‘footsteps of His goings,’ in that we imitate some outskirts of His method of proceeding.  Thus these footsteps of His Father ‘Truth’ gave it in charge to imitate when He said, Pray for them which persecute you and falsely accuse you; that ye may be the children of your Father Which is in heaven.  For He maketh His sun to rise on the evil and on the good. [Matt. 5, 44. 45.]  It may be too that blessed Job who had already said with assured faith, I know that my Redeemer liveth, and that I shall arise at the latter day from the earth [Job 19, 25]; so dwelt on the future working of Wisdom Incarnate to be, in like manner as we behold by faith the works of that Wisdom now past, how that the Mediator between God and man should be kind to give, humble to bear, patient to afford an example.  Whose life while blessed Job, filled with the Spirit from above, regarded with heedful intentness, foreseeing the future lowliness of His mild character, he refers as it were to a pattern set before him, so that whatever he did in this life he might bind fast to His footsteps in imitating, that so he who was incapable of seeing the high things of His secret ordering, as it were looking on the ground, might keep His footsteps for imitation.  Of which same ‘footsteps’ of Him it is said by Peter, Because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow His footsteps. [1 Pet. 2, 21]
