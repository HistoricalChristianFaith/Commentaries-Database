Hence Paul says: "Do not become children in understanding." Behold, we have heard of the prudence of the serpent; now let us be admonished about the simplicity of the dove: "But in malice be infants." Hence it is said of blessed Job: "He was a simple and upright man." But what is uprightness without simplicity, or what is simplicity without uprightness? Therefore, because this Spirit teaches both uprightness and simplicity, He had to be shown both in fire and in a dove, so that every heart touched by His grace may become both tranquil with the gentleness of meekness and inflamed with zeal for justice.
