But the wounded Lazarus desired to be filled with the crumbs that fell from the rich man's table, and no one gave to him, because that proud people scorned to admit any Gentile to knowledge of the law. And since they held the teaching of the law not for charity but for pride, they swelled as it were with the riches they had received. And because words flowed from them out of knowledge, crumbs as it were fell from the table.

But on the other hand, dogs licked the wounds of the poor man lying there. Sometimes in sacred speech preachers are understood by dogs. For the tongue of a dog, when it licks a wound, heals it, because holy teachers too, when they instruct us in the confession of our sin, touch as it were the wound of the mind through their tongue; and because by speaking they rescue us from sins, by touching wounds as it were they restore us to health. For that by the name of dogs the tongue of preachers is signified, the Lord says through the Psalmist: "The tongue of your dogs from enemies, from him." For from the unbelieving Jews the holy preachers were chosen, who, coming against thieves and robbers in defense of the truth, gave great barkings, so to speak, for the Lord. Against this it is said of certain reprobates: "Dumb dogs, not able to bark." Because therefore holy preachers condemn sins, but approve the confession of sins, saying: "Confess your sins to one another, and pray for one another, that you may be saved," dogs lick the sores of Lazarus. For holy teachers, when they receive the confessions of the Gentiles, restore the wounds of minds to health. Hence also Lazarus is well interpreted as "one who is helped," because they help him toward deliverance, because they heal his wounds through the correction of their tongue.

The licking of dogs can also signify the broad tongue of flatterers. For flatterers lick our wounds, who often are accustomed to praise with wicked favor even those very evils which we reprove in ourselves.
