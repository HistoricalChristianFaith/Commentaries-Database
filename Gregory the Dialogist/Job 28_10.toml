“He stretches out his hand to the flint; he overturns mountains by the roots.” “He stretches out his hand to the flint” means he presented the arm of his preaching to the hardness of the Gentiles. Hence the same blessed Job, forewarned of the history of his suffering being destined to be made known to the Gentiles, says, “Let these things be engraved with an iron pen in a plate of lead or hewn in the flint.” However, whom in this place do we understand by the “mountains” except the powerful ones of this world, who because of earthly substance puff themselves up? Concerning them the psalmist says, “Touch the mountains, and they shall smoke”; but the mountains are overturned from the roots, because holy church, preaching the highest powers of this world, fell from their inmost thinking into the adoring of almighty God. For “the roots” of the mountains are the inmost thoughts of the proud. And “the mountains fall from the roots,” because for the worshiping of God, the powers of the world are laid level with the earth from the lowest thoughts. For by a root the hidden thought is rightly denoted, because by means of that which is not seen, being within, there bursts out what should be seen without. Therefore, on the side of good it is said by the prophet, “And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall again take root downward and bear fruit upward. As though it were expressed in plain speech; “Deep down below the thought springs up, that up on high the reward may be rendered back.” So then, let him say, “He stretches out his hand to the flint and overturns the mountains from the roots.” While the sacred preaching sought the hardness of the Gentiles, it entirely frustrated the loftiness of the proud, however, because those it empties of earthly thoughts, it fills with heavenly gifts. Moreover, those whom it drains of interest below, it waters with streams from above. It is directly added, “He cuts out streams in the rocks,” that is, in the hard hearts of the Gentiles he opened the rivers of preaching; as it is likewise spoken by the prophet of watering the dryness of the Gentiles, “He turns the wilderness into a standing water and dry ground into water springs.” - "Morals on the Book of Job 18.57–58"

58.  i.e. in the hard hearts of the Gentiles he opened the rivers of preaching; as it is likewise spoken by the Prophet of watering the dryness of the Gentiles; He turneth the wilderness into a standing water, and dry ground into water springs. [Ps. 107, 35]  And in the Gospel the Lord promises, saying, He that believeth on Me, as the Scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water. [John 7, 38]  What we then heard promised, we now see fulfilled.  For see how in the holy preachers, not sprung from Judaea, through the universal Church spread over the whole world, streams of heavenly precepts flow forth in abundance from the mouths of the Gentiles.  Thus because in the rocks He opened streams, from hard hearts too there flowed forth the river of holy preaching.  It goes on;
And his eye hath seen every precious thing.
59.  It is a thing to be especially borne in mind, that each individual soul is rendered the more precious in the sight of God, by bow much it is for Jove of the truth the more despised in its own eyes.  When thou wast little in thine own sight, did I not make thee the head of the tribes of Israel? [1 Sam. 15, 17]  As if he said in plain terms, ‘‘Thou wast great with Me, because thou wast contemptible to thyself, but now because thou art great to thyself, thou art become contemptible to Me.’ And hence it is said by the Prophet; Woe unto them that are wise in their own eyes, and prudent in their own sight!  Thus every man becomes the more worthless to God, in proportion as he is more precious to himself, so much the more precious to God as he is for His sake more worthless to himself; because He regardeth the lowly, and knoweth the high afar off.  Every precious thing, therefore, His eye saw. [Ps. 138, 6]  In Holy Scripture God’s ‘seeing’ is put for ‘choosing,’ as it is written in the Gospel; When thou wast under the fig tree, I saw thee, [John 1, 48] i.e. I chose thee whilst placed under the shadow of the Law.’ Therefore He ‘saw every thing precious,’ because He chose the lowly.  God hath chosen the weak things of the world to co1ifound the things which are mighty.  He’ saw the precious thing’ when the human soul, having base views of itself, He visited with the illumination of His grace.  Of which same soul it is said by the Prophet; If thou separatest the precious from the vile, thou shalt be as my mouth. [Jer. 15, 19]  For the present world is vile with God, but the soul of man is precious to Him.  He, then, that ‘separates the precious from the vile’ is called ‘as the month of God,’ because by that man God deals forth His words, who by speaking the things that he is able to speak, plucks out the soul of man from the love of the present world.  And because the teachers of the New Testament are brought to this, that even the hidden darkness of allegories in the Old Testament they search out.
