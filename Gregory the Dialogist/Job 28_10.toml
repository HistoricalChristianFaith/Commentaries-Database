He cutteth out streams in the rocks. And his eye hath seen every precious thing.

But because those whom it empties of earthly thoughts, it fills with heavenly gifts, and those, whom it drains of interest below, it waters with streams from Above, it is directly added; He cutteth out streams in the rocks. i.e. in the hard hearts of the Gentiles he opened the rivers of preaching; as it is likewise spoken by the Prophet of watering the dryness of the Gentiles; He turneth the wilderness into a standing water, and dry ground into water springs. And in the Gospel the Lord promises, saying, He that believeth on Me, as the Scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water. What we then heard promised, we now see fulfilled. For see how in the holy preachers, not sprung from Judaea, through the universal Church spread over the whole world, streams of heavenly precepts flow forth in abundance from the mouths of the Gentiles. Thus because in the rocks He opened streams, from hard hearts too there flowed forth the river of holy preaching.

It is a thing to be especially borne in mind, that each individual soul is rendered the more precious in the sight of God, by how much it is for love of the truth the more despised in its own eyes. When thou wast little in thine own sight, did I not make thee the head of the tribes of Israel? As if he said in plain terms, 'Thou wast great with Me, because thou wast contemptible to thyself, but now because thou art great to thyself, thou art become contemptible to Me.' And hence it is said by the Prophet; Woe unto them that are wise in their own eyes, and prudent in their own sight! Thus every man becomes the more worthless to God, in proportion as he is more precious to himself, so much the more precious to God as he is for His sake more worthless to himself; because He regardeth the lowly, and knoweth the high afar off. Every precious thing, therefore, His eye saw. In Holy Scripture God's 'seeing' is put for 'choosing,' as it is written in the Gospel; When thou wast under the fig tree, I saw thee, i.e. I chose thee whilst placed under the shadow of the Law.' Therefore He 'saw every thing precious,' because He chose the lowly. God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty. He 'saw the precious thing' when the human soul, having base views of itself, He visited with the illumination of His grace. Of which same soul it is said by the Prophet; If thou separatest the precious from the vile, thou shalt be as my mouth. For the present world is vile with God, but the soul of man is precious to Him. He, then, that 'separates the precious from the vile' is called 'as the mouth of God,' because by that man God deals forth His words, who by speaking the things that he is able to speak, plucks out the soul of man from the love of the present world.
