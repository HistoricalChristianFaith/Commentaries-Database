14.  If it be not so as he tells, then surely all people are able to convict him of falsehood.  Why then is it said, And if it be not so now, who will convict me of having lied?  i.e. whilst we know that, one who is false, it is allowed anyone to find fault with?  But if we sift out the sense of the speaker with exact questioning, how light the things are that he put forth, we speedily discover.  For the righteous man, though he does ever speak any thing wrong, yet it is far from meet that he should be judged by the unrighteous and ill living.  Whence the holy man lowering the pride of his friends, not even if it be so, but even ‘if it be not so’ as he set forth, is confident that he can never be found fault with, because assuredly those are able rightly to reprove things that are false, who are not taught to do things that are false.  For the daring of reproof against deceit those persons lose, who still live on principles of deceit.  Therefore he says, And if it be riot so now, who will convict me of having lied?  As if he said in plain words; ‘All things are so as I have set forth, but if they were not so, I could not a whit be charged home with them by you; for whilst ye still give way to your own deceit, ye are not able to find fault with the deceit of another.’
15.  In which place it is fitly added; And to set my words before God.  For whoever really finds fault with false sayings in the true way, in thinking on the things he has heard and estimating them by the rule of truth ‘sets words before God,’ because to himself in the eye of Truth he makes proof what he should outwardly decree against falsehood.  Since ‘to set words before God’ is with the interior Judge kept in view to estimate the exterior sayings.  Thus the holy man does not reckon it possible for his ‘words to be set before God’ by friends behaving with pride.  As if he said in plain terms, ‘The things which I utter ye are for this reason unable to set before the Judge, because by committing sin ye hide His face from you?’  Which same, however, nothing hinders from being understood in type of Holy Church as well, which whilst for her weak members she is found fault with by the scoffing of heretics, laughs to scorn that same craftiness of their scoffing, because with God it is more tolerable that a man should be prostrated in weakness and in ignorance, in conjunction with humility, than that he should compass high themes with self-exaltation.  But forasmuch as the holy man had uttered many words against those, who by transitory power are made proud, and with windy honours swell themselves out; by his rebuke Bildad the Shuhite gaining ground has his eyes opened to see with Whom true power is deposited.
