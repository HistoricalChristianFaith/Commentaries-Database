Then call Thou, and I will answer; or let me speak, and answer Thou me.

Who at the time, when He did appear by the assumption of the flesh to the eyes of mankind, disclosed to men their sins, which they were doing and knew not.

Though the 'calling' and 'answering' may likewise be understood in another way. For God's 'calling' us is His having respect to us in loving and choosing us, and our 'answering' is the yielding obedience to His love by good works. Where it is fitly added, Or let me speak, and answer Thou me. For we 'speak,' when we beg for God's face in desire, and God answers our speaking, when He appears to us that love Him. But because whoever pants with longing for the eternal world, examines his doings, taking himself to task with great exactness, and searches lest there be aught in him, whereby he might offend the face of his Creator.
