50.  What does this mean, that he said to corruption, Thou art my father; saving that every man descends from an already corrupted origin?  and hence it is added, And to the worm, Thou art my mother and my sister; in this way, viz. that we come into this world once from corruption itself, and along with corruption itself.  For as regards the matter of corruptible flesh, the worm is our ‘mother and sister,’ in that we both come forth out of corruption, and come with corruption which we carry about us.  And if we may understand it in a spiritual sense, nature is not unappropriately called our ‘mother,’ and habit too a ‘sister,’ in that we are from the one, and along with the other; which same ‘mother and sister’ are ‘worms,’ in that in virtue of a corrupt nature and evil habit we are necessitated, as by a kind of ‘worms,’ so by disquieting thoughts to be gnawed in the mind.  For the corrupted nature of the flesh, and bad habit, in that they generate numberless cares in the heart of our frailty, are well called ‘worms our mother and sister.’ For cares gnaw the mind, while they disquiet it.  For righteous men do not cease either heedfully to take thought and counsel what they are to do, or thoughtfully to look into it, whither they are destined to be led after the present life.  And so because the Elect then, before the Coming of the Lord, both saw that they were in the toils of the present life, and still after the present life did not as yet receive the heavenly blessings, they were made to smart [urebantur] with many thoughts of heart.  For they waited for the grace of the Redeemer, and yet by living in the flesh could not attain thereto.
