“Remember that you do not know the works of him whom men have sung.” … Therefore people sing to the Lord when the angelic spirits or the perfect doctors teach us his power. But they do not know his works, because they, who are now preaching, worship his judgments without understanding them. And so they know him whom they are preaching but ignore his works, because they know him through grace who created them, but [they] cannot understand his judgments, which occur through his agency even above them.… “All people have looked on him; everyone watches him from far away.” Every person, because he is endowed with reason, must infer from his own reason that God created him. To observe through reasoning his dominion undoubtedly is like seeing him already. After saying, “All people looked on him,” he rightly adds, “everyone watches him from far away.” To watch him from far away is not like seeing him directly yet, but it is like considering him by simply admiring his works.
