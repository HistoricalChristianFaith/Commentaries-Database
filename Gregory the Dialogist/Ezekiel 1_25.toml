"For when there was a voice above the firmament that was over their head, they stood and lowered their wings."

We have judged that the upper firmament should be expounded under a twofold understanding. For, as has been said, by the name of firmament the celestial powers can be understood. And by the name of firmament the incarnate Only-begotten can be designated, through the fact that in him our nature has been made firm unto eternity. Let us therefore first speak of what we think concerning the angels, and afterwards concerning the Lord of angels. For behold it is said: When there was a voice above the firmament, they stood and lowered their wings. In this passage, this must first be known, that "to lower" should be understood not as stretching from lower to higher things, but as putting down their wings from higher to lower things, on account of what was stated before: When they stood, their feathers were let down. Therefore we must inquire what the voice is that occurs above the firmament. But we understand that same voice better if, ascending from the lowest things to higher ones, we climb as if by certain steps. Just as the hearing of the body is aroused by a voice, so the sense of the mind is aroused by understanding, which is exercised concerning interior things. Therefore the voice in the mind is, as it were, a certain sound of understanding. But it must be known that sometimes the voice of the flesh speaks to our senses, sometimes the voice of the soul, sometimes the voice of the firmament, sometimes the voice that is above the firmament.

Let us set before our eyes the case of someone who has been injured by a neighbor, who thinks according to human reasoning to repay the injury in kind, to return evil for evil. To this person the voice of the flesh speaks in his mind, because when the divine commandments order us to do good to those who hate us, whoever thinks of doing evil to those who hate him, in his soul the voice of the flesh sounds. We do many earthly things daily, and after these we return to prayer. The soul is kindled to compunction, but images of those things which we have done turn about in the mind and impede the intention of compunction in prayer; and what we willingly did outwardly, we suffer inwardly against our will, so that certain phantasms of thoughts scatter the mind through bodily images, lest it gather itself wholly together in strict attention during prayer. This too is the voice of the flesh.

But when we subdue even these things and drive away all bodily images from the eyes of the mind, seeking within ourselves the very nature of the soul—what kind of thing it is that can give life to the flesh, yet cannot restrain itself in good thoughts as it desires—we find a certain intellectual spirit, living through the power of the Creator, giving life to the body it sustains, yet nevertheless subject to forgetfulness, subject to change, which fear often afflicts and joy exalts. This very intellect of the soul is its voice, because it sounds forth what it is; yet this voice is still beneath the firmament.

But transcending the soul, we seek the voice from the firmament when we investigate what that innumerable multitude of holy angels is like in the sight of the almighty Lord: what in them is the endless festival of the vision of the Lord, what joy without failing, what ardor of love not tormenting but delighting; how great in them is the desire for the vision of God together with satisfaction, and how great is the satisfaction together with desire. In them neither does desire generate pain, nor does satisfaction produce weariness. How by clinging to blessedness they are blessed, how by always contemplating eternity they are eternal, how joined to the true light they have become light, how always beholding the unchangeable they have been changed into unchangeableness. But when we think these things about the angels, the voice is still from the firmament, not above the firmament.

Let the mind therefore pass through and transcend everything that has been created. Let it fix the eyes of faith on the light of its Creator alone: that God who created all things is one and gives life to all; that He is everywhere and everywhere whole; that He is uncircumscribed and incomprehensible, able to be perceived yet unable to be seen; that He is nowhere absent, and yet is far from the thoughts of the wicked; that He is not absent even where He is far, because where He is not present through grace, He is present through vengeance; that He touches all things, yet does not touch all things equally. For some things He touches so that they exist, but not so that they live and perceive, as are all insensible things. Some things He touches so that they exist, live, and perceive, but not so that they discern, as are brute animals. Some things He touches so that they exist, live, perceive, and discern, as is human and angelic nature. And though He Himself is never unlike Himself, yet He touches unlike things in unlike ways. He who is present everywhere can scarcely be found; He whom we follow as He stands still, we are unable to grasp. Let us therefore place before the eyes of the mind what that nature is which holds all things, fills all things, embraces all things, surpasses all things, sustains all things. Nor does He sustain from one part and surpass from another; nor does He fill from one part and embrace from another; but by embracing He fills, by filling He is embraced, by sustaining He surpasses, by surpassing He sustains. When the mind, drawn close, contemplates the power of this nature, a voice is made above the firmament, because it conceives the understanding of Him who by His incomprehensibility transcends even the perception of angels.

When therefore the voice is made above the firmament, the living creatures stand and lower their wings, because when the minds of the saints consider the power of their Creator with intent contemplation, the virtues they possess become worthless in their own estimation; and they become humble in their own sight to the degree that what sounds above the angels is lofty to them. For perhaps they are teachers; but when they begin to consider in silent mind what the ineffable wisdom of God is, which teaches the minds of men without the noise of words, and how this same wisdom, if it does not teach the minds of hearers, the voice of teachers labors in vain, their own teaching immediately becomes worthless to them, because neither he who plants is anything, nor he who waters, but God who gives the increase. Perhaps they are prophets; but when they consider in silent mind that they cannot penetrate all the mysteries of Divinity at once with the eye of their prophecy, since as the Apostle says: We know in part, and we prophesy in part, in that immensity of secrets they see that all they see is little, and from that immense height of light they consider how small is what they saw with intent eye as if through cracks. Let them therefore lower their wings when the voice is made above the firmament, that is, let them be humbled in what they apprehend when they behold heavenly things that cannot be comprehended by them.

Often the good things they possess flatter even the thoughts of the saints, so as to lift up their minds in some confidence in themselves; but they immediately return to the hidden judgments of God, how some fall from virtues to hell through pride, while others, corrected from vices, are raised to heaven through humility. Hence the Prophet, calling us back to humility, terrifies and admonishes us, saying: Come, and see the works of the Lord, how terrible in His counsels over the sons of men. For who can worthily consider how great the terror of God's counsels is over us, when one person from virtues tends toward vices at the end, and another from vices concludes the end in virtues? For according to the voice of Solomon: There are just and wise men, and their works are in the hand of God. Yet man knows not whether he is worthy of love or hatred, but all things are kept uncertain for the future. And: There is a way that seems right to men, and its end leads to death. Therefore to ponder these depths of hidden judgment, what else is it but to lay down wings, that is, to trust no longer in any virtue, but to tremble under great fear? For whether they consider the nature of almighty God, or weigh His judgments, they tremble, they are afraid. So for them to lay down wings, as it were, is to humble the virtues they possess.

So Abraham laid down his wings, who when he began to speak with God, recognized himself to be dust and ashes, saying: Shall I speak to my Lord, since I am dust and ashes? So Moses laid down his wings, who, instructed in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, as soon as he heard the words of the Lord, discovered that he had no words, saying: I beseech you, Lord, I am not eloquent from yesterday and the day before. For since you have spoken to your servant, I am of more impeded and slower tongue. As if he were saying openly: After I hear the words of life from you, I recognize myself to be confused in my former words. So Isaiah, whose life had pleased the Lord for preaching, when, having contemplated the same Lord, he was touched on the mouth with a coal from the altar, said: Woe is me because I have been silent, because I am a man of polluted lips. Behold, raised up to higher things, he was displeased with himself concerning the pollution of his lips. For unless he had beheld the heights of heavenly purity, he would not have found himself to be condemnable. So when the Lord speaks, Jeremiah cries out: Ah, ah, ah, Lord God, behold I do not know how to speak, because I am a child. For according to the words he was hearing, he had recognized that he had no words. So Daniel, seeing a sublime vision, languished and was sick for many days, because those who are strong in virtues, when they behold the higher things of God, become weak and feeble in their own estimation. So blessed Job, of whom the Lord said to his friends: You have not spoken rightly before me, as my servant has, when he heard the words of God speaking with him, responded, saying: I have spoken foolishly, and things that would exceed my knowledge beyond measure. And a little later: Therefore I reproach myself, and do penance in dust and ashes. For he who had spoken wisely as far as men were concerned, hearing God speaking to him, reproached himself for having spoken foolishly, because in the contemplation of true wisdom his own wisdom became worthless to him. Therefore at the voice coming from above the living creatures lay down their wings, because whether we seek to contemplate the power of God in his nature, or think to investigate his hidden judgments, because his heights are impenetrable to us, whatever good things were believed to be in us become worthless to us. And we who were believed to fly in however small a knowledge, weighing the invisible nature above us and his impenetrable judgments, stand humbly with wings lowered.
