Commonly, since the slothful mind is brought gradually to a downfall by our neglect to guard against idle words, we come to utter harmful ones. At first we are satisfied to talk about the affairs of others, then the tongue gnaws with detraction the lives of those of whom we speak, and finally we break out into open slanders. Hence provocations are sown, quarrels arise, the torches of hatred are lit, peace of heart is extinguished. Therefore it is well said by Solomon: “The beginning of quarrels is as when one lets out water.” For to let out water is to loose the tongue in a spate of words. .
