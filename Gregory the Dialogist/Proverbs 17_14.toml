Commonly, since the slothful mind is brought gradually to a downfall by our neglect to guard against idle words, we come to utter harmful ones. At first we are satisfied to talk about the affairs of others, then the tongue gnaws with detraction the lives of those of whom we speak, and finally we break out into open slanders. Hence provocations are sown, quarrels arise, the torches of hatred are lit, peace of heart is extinguished. Therefore it is well said by Solomon: “The beginning of quarrels is as when one lets out water.” For to let out water is to loose the tongue in a spate of words. .

The indolent mind for the most part lapses by degrees into downfall. We neglect to guard against idle words, and so we go on to hurtful ones. At first it pleases us to talk of other the affairs of others; afterwards the tongue gnaws with detraction at the lives of those of whom we talk. Then at last we break out into open slanders. Thus are sown pricking thorns, quarrels arise, the torches of enmities are kindled and peace of heart is extinguished. Therefore, it is well said by Solomon, “The beginning of strife is like letting out water.” For to let out water is to let loose the tongue to a flurry of speech.
