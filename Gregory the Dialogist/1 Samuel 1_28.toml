(Verse 28.) "And they worshipped the Lord there." We also, members of the holy Church, when through the scriptures of the Old Testament we are submitted to the veneration and precept of the Creator, there indeed we worship the Lord, because we hold the faith of the ancient Fathers, and we exercise that same faith through love in good work.

(Moral Exposition) In the house of the Lord they adore the Lord, who both raise themselves with lofty mind to the contemplation of the heavenly homeland, yet through humility prostrate themselves before almighty God, and with all their heart are so sublimely elevated in the power of the Spirit. We have touched upon these things not in order, but summarily in expounding the historical or moral sense, so that we might investigate somewhat more extensively the words of the spiritual canticle which follows according to the moral and typological explanation.
