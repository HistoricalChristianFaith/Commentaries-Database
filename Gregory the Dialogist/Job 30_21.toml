Thou art changed to cruel unto me; and in the hardness of Thy hand Thou opposest Thyself against me.

In Holy Scripture when any thing is said of God unworthy, the mind of the reader is affected, as if it were ever the case that any thing that is worthy were spoken of God. Since well nigh every thing that is spoken touching God, is by this alone henceforth unworthy, that it admitted of being spoken. But for Him to Whose praise the conscious faculty, being astounded, is not equal, when may the tongue by speaking suffice? But the Holy Spirit teaching to men that understand this same truth, how unutterable are the things above and the things of God, sometimes uses even those words concerning God, which amongst men are held as a fault, that from these things which seem unworthy of men, and yet are spoken concerning God, men should be admonished to know that neither are those things even worthy of God, which whilst they are accounted worthy among men, are thought worthy of God.

For God is called 'jealous,' as it is written, The Lord, his Name is 'jealous.' He is called 'wroth,' whence it is written, The Lord was wroth against Israel. The Lord is called 'repentant,' as where it is written, It repenteth Me that I have made man upon the earth. And again; It repenteth Me that I have set up Saul to be king over Israel. He is entitled compassionate, as where it is written, Merciful and pitiful is the Lord, patient and full of compassion. He is called 'foreknowing,' as the Apostle saith concerning Him, For whom He did foreknow, He did also predestinate to be conformed to the image of His Son. Whereas neither 'jealousy,' nor 'wrath,' nor 'repentance,' nor strictly speaking 'compassionateness,' nor 'foreknowledge,' can be in God. For all these particulars are derived into Him from human qualities, while there is a descending to words expressive of infirmity, that as it were a kind of steps being made for us, and set beside us, by the things which we see close to us, we may one time be enabled to mount up to the high things of Him.

As then we understand Him 'jealous' without jealousy, 'wroth' without wrath, so He might by the holy man be also called 'cruel' without cruelty. Since he is called 'cruel,' who while smiting with severity spares not; that is to say that in this passage 'cruel' should be taken for one striking with severity, and not sparing the avenging of sin. Hence also Isaiah, when he saw the day of final Judgment was destined to come not henceforth with pardon but with rigour, says, Behold the day of the Lord cometh, cruel both with wrath, and fierce anger, to lay the land desolate; and to destroy the sinners thereof out of it. Therefore the holy man, that he might declare that this same cruelty is more suited to himself than to God, says, Thou art changed to cruel unto me. As though he said in plain terms, 'Thou, Who hast in Thine own Self nought of cruelty, to me, whom Thou sufferest not to draw breath from persecution, Thou seemest cruel.' For so God is not capable of being cruel, just as He is not in the least degree capable of being changed. But because in God there comes not either cruelty or changeableness at any time, whilst He says 'unto me,' he shews that he is sensible that God is in Himself neither 'cruel' nor 'changeable.' But because as concerns ourselves things prosperous and things adverse shift to and fro, in this that we ourselves are changed, we as it were imagine as concerns ourselves His mind changed. But He the same Being remaining unchangeable in Himself, in the thought of men's hearts comes to be felt now one way and now another, according to the character of their minds.

For 'the Hand' of the Lord is thought 'hard,' when being opposed to our will, that thing which displeases Him in us, it follows hard upon by striking; and He redoubles the strokes, when the soul of the sorrower looks for clemency.
