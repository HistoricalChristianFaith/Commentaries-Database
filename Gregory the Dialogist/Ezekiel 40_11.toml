And he measured the width of the threshold of the gate as ten cubits, and the length of the gate as thirteen cubits.

We have already said much above about the meaning of the gate, but we ought to hold to one thing through which the prudence of the reader can also penetrate the rest. Indeed it was said that Sacred Scripture can be figured through the gate. But we must now laboriously discuss why the width of the threshold of the gate is measured at ten cubits, and the length of the gate at thirteen. Moreover in this place the length of the gate is called height, just as we call someone of tall stature whom we see to be lofty. For the length of the gate cannot be said to run crosswise, whose width is shown by ten cubits. What then was the width of the threshold of the gate, except the law of the old testament, and the length of the gate, except the grace of the new testament? Because clearly Sacred Scripture, while it restrained crimes of works through the old testament, commanded tithes to be given, as if through humble commands it lay in the width of the threshold. But while through the new testament it restrained wicked thoughts, it commanded all things to be relinquished, and life of the body to be despised along with the present age for the sake of God, as if our gate rose up to the height of length. For lesser precepts were given to the Israelite people through the law: whence also Moses spoke to that same people on the plain. The Lord gave higher things to the holy apostles, whence also he taught them about the commandments of life on the mountain. When indeed our Redeemer says through the Gospel: Do not think that I have come to destroy the law or the prophets; I have not come to destroy, but to fulfill. For he had come to fulfill the law who added grace to the righteousness of the law, so that what it commanded in the least things, he himself would help to be perfected in the greatest, and what it restrained from the work, he himself would cut away from the heart. Therefore the law understood, which lay in width, rose up into height. For that very knowledge of God which was among the spiritual fathers in it was not known to the entire Hebrew people. For while the prophets proclaimed almighty God, namely the holy Trinity, the people were ignorant; they held only the Decalogue in the law, not knowing the faith of the Trinity. Therefore the width of the threshold of the gate is measured at ten cubits, because that hardened people, ignorant of the subtlety of faith, served the commandments of the Decalogue. But the length of the gate is measured at thirteen cubits, because through the new testament in the heart of the faithful people, above the commandments of the Decalogue which it more truly keeps, the knowledge of the Trinity grew. And it fulfills the commandments of the law by believing the Trinity to be the almighty Lord.

Here one may also reasonably ask why this width of the threshold of the gate, which he said above was measured by one reed, he added below was measured by ten cubits, and then it is added that the length of the gate was measured at thirteen cubits. For one reed, as has already often been said, has six cubits and a palm, but ten cubits already hold their measure above a reed, and thirteen more than ten. What then does it mean that first the threshold of the gate is measured by one reed, afterward its width by ten cubits, and finally the length of the gate by thirteen, except that the holy fathers, whom we know through Sacred Scripture to have existed before the law, indeed knew that there is one almighty God, namely the Holy Trinity, but they did not openly preach that same Trinity which they knew? They, obeying His commands and preserving purity of life, had as it were the perfection of work in the six cubits of the reed, and often seeing angels they had the palm of contemplation. But when the law was given, that unlearned people of the Hebrews strove to keep the commandments of the Decalogue, but nevertheless was not instructed concerning the knowledge of the Holy Trinity. And although the spiritual fathers had known this perfectly, nevertheless the great multitude of the Synagogue could neither discover the mystery of the Trinity nor knew how to seek it.

Through the coming of grace by the new testament, all the faithful people came to know that the one God is a Trinity, and fulfilled the power of the Decalogue in the knowledge of Him. Therefore the threshold of the gate is first measured by one reed, afterwards its breadth by ten cubits, and finally the length of the gate by thirteen cubits, because both active and contemplative life were not lacking to the holy fathers before the law, and under the Decalogue of the law the people, not knowing the mystery of the divine substance, served in the breadth of the commandments. And now under grace, with the precepts of the Decalogue more truly kept, everyone who has come to the faith knows the mystery of the Holy Trinity.

In which matter this also must be known by us: that the knowledge of the spiritual fathers grew through the advances of times. For Moses was instructed more than Abraham, the prophets more than Moses, the apostles more than the prophets in the knowledge of almighty God. I am mistaken if Scripture itself does not say this: "Many shall pass through," it says, "and knowledge shall be manifold." But let us show these same things which we have said about Abraham, Moses, the prophets and the apostles from the words of the same Scripture, if we can. For who does not know that Abraham spoke with God? And yet the Lord says to Moses: "I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, and my name Adonai I did not reveal to them." Behold, more was made known to Moses than to Abraham, since he reveals to Moses that about himself which he was recounting that he had not revealed to Abraham. But let us see if the prophets were able to apprehend divine knowledge more than Moses. Certainly the Psalmist says: "How I have loved your law, O Lord! It is my meditation all day long." And he added: "I have understood above all who teach me, because your testimonies are my meditation." And again: "I have understood above the elders." He who recalls that he meditates on the law, and testifies that he has understood above all who teach him and above the elders, makes clear that he received divine knowledge more than Moses. But how shall we show that the holy apostles were taught more than the prophets? Certainly the Truth says: "Many kings and prophets wished to see what you see and to hear what you hear, but they did not see." Therefore they knew more of divine knowledge than the prophets, because what those saw by spirit alone, these also saw bodily. Therefore that sentence of Daniel which we mentioned above is fulfilled: "Many shall pass through, and knowledge shall be manifold." Therefore let the measure of the reed, which is six cubits and a palm, be extended to ten cubits; and let the measure of ten cubits rise at the end to thirteen, because the more the world is led toward its end, the more broadly the entrance to eternal knowledge is opened to us.
