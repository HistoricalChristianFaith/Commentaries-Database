So with grace supervening through the New Testament, every faithful people knows the one God to be the Trinity, and by their recognition of him they have fulfilled the virtue of the Decalogue.

As we have often said, the chambers are the hearts of the elect burning with love for almighty God. What is expressed by the border before the chambers if not faith? For if this is not first held it does not attain to spiritual love. So charity does not precede faith but faith charity. No one can love what he has not believed.
