What happened to her we know was said through the prophet concerning Judea: Enlarge your baldness like the eagle. For the baldness of a man usually occurs only on the head, but the baldness of an eagle occurs over the whole body, because when it has grown very old, its feathers and plumes fall from all its limbs. Therefore she enlarges her baldness like an eagle, because she has lost her feathers, she who has lost her people. The feathers of her wings also fell, with which she was accustomed to fly to prey, because all her powerful men have perished, through whom she seized the things of others.
