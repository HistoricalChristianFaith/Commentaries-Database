To lead a bull by hand is to destroy the sin of pride through the affliction of penance. For while by laboring one destroys what one committed through pride, one leads the bull to be slaughtered on the stone by hand. But what does it mean when he says: "Until night," unless that it is not permitted to sin, but it is permitted to destroy sins up until death? Therefore bulls are to be slaughtered until night, not in the night, because while we live, we can destroy sins by repenting, but after death we are unable to perform fruitful penance. And well is it added in the same place: (Verse 35.) And Saul built an altar to the Lord.
