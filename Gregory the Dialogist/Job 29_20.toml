53.  Understand, I said; since all is joined on to the sentence above, that is introduced next in a continuous thread of discourse, when he says, Then I said, I shall die in my nest, and I shall multiply my days as the palm; and afterwards it is subjoined, My root is opened by the waters, and the dew shall stay on my harvest; my glory shall ever be fresh in me, and my bow shall be renewed in mine hand.  To all that know what is true it is clear, that to the old life qualities of evil are proper, to the new qualities of virtue.  Thus it is hence that Paul saith, Putting off the old man with his deeds, and putting on the new man. [Col. 3, 9]  Hence he says again, Our old man was crucified with him. [Rom 6, 6]  Hence the Psalmist speaking in a type of man, as being caught in the midst of evil spirits, saith, I have waxed old amongst all mine enemies. [Ps. 6, 7]  For unto fervour of mind, whether amidst spiritual enemies, or in the midst of our several carnal neighbours, in some degree by the mere habituation of living ‘we wax old,’ and the form of newness taken upon us we soil. Against which same oldness, however, if our earnest pains after heedfulness be daily on the watch, by praying, by reading, and living well we are renewed afresh; because our life, while it is washed with tears, exercised in good works, drawn out by holy meditations, is without ceasing restored to its newness.  Blessed Job then so tells his own case that he represents ours, because Holy Church, when she sees her faithful ones return to the transgressions of the old life, is forced to lament for those whom she sees lose the newness of the interior.  Since the great Preacher says to his disciples, For what is our hope or joy or crown of rejoicing? Are not even ye in the presence of our Lord? [1 Thess. 2, 19]  And so Holy Church bewails her glory departed, when she sees her faithful ones return to the old life.  Thus she says, I said, My glory shall always be made fresh; because those whom she believed were enlisted within her to the new life, she sees to be lending themselves to old desires.
54.  Now by the name of a ‘bow’ in Holy Scripture, sometimes the plots of evil men, sometimes the Day of Judgment, while sometimes the actual sacred Oracles themselves are denoted.  Since by a bow plots are denoted, as where it is said by the Psalmist, And have bent their bow, a bitter thing. [Ps. 64, 3]  Moreover by ‘a bow’ the Day of the Last Judgment is denoted, as where it is said again by the same Psalmist, Thou hast showed Thy people hard things, Thou hast made us to drink the wine of remorse, Thou hast given a token to them that fear Thee, that they may fly from before the bow. [Ps. 60, 3. 4.]  For in a bow in proportion as the string is drawn out far, the arrow flies off the keener from it.  Thus, yes, thus the Day of Judgment, in proportion as it is delayed for long that it should come, when it does come, the keener the sentence goes forth therefrom.  But for this reason we are now stricken with sundry losses, in order that being amended thereby, we may then be found more prepared.  Whence it is there premised, Thou hast showed Thy people hard things, i.e. the scourges of the present state, which are forerunners of the Day of Judgment, to follow far worse.  Thou hast made us to drink the wine of remorse, so that earthly joys should be converted into tears.  Thou hast given a token to them that fear Thee, that they may fly from before the bow.  As though he said in plain terms; ‘This is the season of mercy, that shall be the time of Judgment.’  Thus by these scourges of this present time Thou dost betoken how Thou wilt then strike when Thou judgest not sparing, Who dost now strike so sharply when Thou sparest.
55.  But sometimes by a ‘bow’ Holy Scripture is denoted as well.  For that is the ‘bow’ of the Church, that is the ‘bow’ of the Lord, wherefrom like arrows striking, so do terrifying sentences come to the hearts of men.  Whence also it is rightly said by the Psalmist, He hath bent His bow, and made it ready; He hath also prepared in it the vessels of death, He hath made His arrows for the burning ones. [Ps, 7, 12. 13.] For the Lord hath ‘bent His bow,’ because to all sinners He hath set forth threats in sacred Revelation.  In which same bow He ‘prepares the vessels of death,’ because according to the sentence of His Revelation, those that neglect to be reformed now, He condemns as reprobate.  In which bow also He ‘made His arrows for the burning ones,’ because against those persons, whom He amends by terror, He sends forth the kindled sentences of words.  Concerning this bow of the preachers it is declared by Isaiah; With arrows and with bows they enter in thither; [Is. 7, 24] in this way, because the holy Apostles came for the smiting the hardness of the Gentiles’ life with the keen dartings of words.  What then in this place is to be understood by the name of the bow but sacred Revelation?  For by the string the New Testament, while by the bow the Old Testament, is understood.  Now in a bow, when the string is drawn, the horn is bended: so in this same sacred Revelation, when the New Testament is read, the hardness of the Old is rendered pliant. For to the spiritual and mild precepts of this, the rigidness of the letter of the other bends itself; because whilst the New Testament as it were by a kind of arm of good practice is drawn, in the Old Testament the claims of severity are relaxed.  Nor do we improperly say that the string accords with the New Testament, which it is certain came out by the Incarnation of the Lord.  And so as it were the string is drawn and the horns bent; because when in the New Testament the Incarnation of our Mediator is seen, the rigidness of the Old Testament is made to bend to a spiritual signification.  Therefore the holy man says, I said, My glory shall always be fresh, and my bow shall be renewed in mine hand.
56.  ‘A bow in the hand’ is Holy Writ in the practising. For he holds ‘a bow in his hand,’ who performs by the practising the divine revelations which he learns by apprehension.  Thus the ‘bow is renewed in the hand,’ in that whatever is learnt belonging to Holy Revelation by studying is fulfilled by living accordingly.  Hence also Solomon when he was describing the strong warriors of the spiritual fight, says, All holding swords, being well instructed for wars. [Cant. 3, 8]  For what is represented in Divine Writ by ‘a sword,’ Paul laid open by saying, And the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God. [Eph. 6, 17]  Now Solomon saith not ‘all having’ but ‘all holding swords;’ surely because not only to know the word of God is admirable, but likewise to do it.  For he has but does not ‘hold’ a sword, who knows indeed Divine Revelation, but neglects to live according to it, and he cannot now any longer be ‘well instructed to wars,’ who never exercises the spiritual sword that he has.  For he is altogether not equal to resist temptations, who by living badly puts it behind him to hold this sword of the word of God. So then let Holy Church, which is weighed down by subsequent persecution, taking thought of the multitude of bad and the scarcity of good ones, by the accents of blessed Job foreannounce her own woes, saying, Then I said, I shall die in my nest, and I shall multiply my days as a palm. My root is opened wide by the waters, and the dew shall stay on my harvest.  My glory shall ever be fresh, and my bow shall be renewed in mine hand.  Which same, whilst taking a view of all things, was never imposed on by a false hope.  For they that be perfect now see many her supporters, but doubtless they reflect that on the crisis of temptation coming forth, the greater number of these become her enemies, who in the time of peace seem to be her citizens.  But they do not despair of all in like manner, yet nevertheless it very frequently falls out that those persons, touching whom they had entertained more confident assurance as to the Faith, themselves become fiercer enemies of the Faith, so that they then see those acting against the sacred Oracles, by whose working they had thought to restore those same sacred Oracles to the benefit of preaching.  Which same times, however, we lament have now already commenced, when we see numbers, set within the pale of the Church, who either refuse to practise what they understand, or this very sacred Revelation likewise disdain to see into and to know.  For turning away the hearing from the truth, they are turned to fables, whilst all seek their own, not the things that are Jesus Christ’s.  The written words of God every where found are presented to their eyes, but men disdain to acquaint themselves with these, scarce one seeks to know what he has believed.  So then let the multitude of good men going before grieve to have their ‘bow destroyed,’ which same always thought to have sacred Revelation restored by the efforts of those coming after.
