23.  He ‘breaks in pieces and lays bare the house of the poor,’ who is not ashamed as well to rob out of avarice him whom he crushes by power.  ‘He violently taketh it away and doth not build it.’  As if it were expressed in plain words; ‘He that ought to have builded it, he over and above takes it away.’  For the Lord Who is to come in judgment, shall say to the reprobate, For I was an hungred, and ye gave Me no meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave Me no drink: I was a stranger, and ye took Me not in; naked, and ye covered Me not, &c. [Matt. 25, 42. 43.] as the consequence of which sin it is added, Depart from Me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels.  If then he is sentenced to so great a penalty, who is convicted merely of not having given away his own, with what punishment does not that man deserve to be stricken, who is proved to have taken the things of others also?  And so he ‘took it away and did not build it up,’ in that he not only never gave any thing of his own, but also took away what was another’s.
