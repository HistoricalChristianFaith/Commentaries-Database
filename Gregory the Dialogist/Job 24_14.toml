72.  Whereas the murderer in the killing of his neighbours is wont to come upon them chiefly in the silence of the night, why is it that he is said in this place to ‘rise with the light’ in order to ‘kill the poor and needy,’ whilst ‘in the night’ he is described ‘to be as a thief?’  Now forasmuch as the letter in the bare words alone is not consistent with itself, we are called back for the investigating the hidden meanings of the Spirit.  In Holy Scripture the ‘morning’ is sometimes used to be put for the coming of the Lord’s Incarnation, sometimes for the coming of the henceforth dreadful and searching Judge, sometimes for the prosperity of the present life.  Thus the coming of the Lord’s Incarnation proved a ‘morning,’ as the Prophet saith, The morning cometh, and also the night; [Is. 21, 12] in that both the beginnings of the new light shone forth in the appearing of our Redeemer, and yet the shades of their misbelief were not cleared off from the hearts of the persecutors.  Again, by the ‘morning’ the coming of the Judge is denoted.  Whence it is said by the Psalmist, Early I will destroy all the wicked of the land. [Ps. 101, 8]  As also when personating the Elect, he says, In the morning will I stand in Thy presence, and will look up. [Ps. 5, 3]  Again, by the ‘morning’ this life’s prosperity is represented.  as where it is said by Solomon, Woe to thee, O land, when thy King is a child, and thy princes eat in the morning. [Ecc. 10, 16]  For whereas the morning is the first part of the day and the evening the last, we ought not ever to be regaled by this life’s prosperity which goes first, but by those things which at the end of the day, that is at the termination of the world, follow after.  Thus those ‘eat in the morning,’ who by this world’s successes are lifted up, and whilst they passionately interest themselves with present things, pay no heed to the things of the future.  For whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer. [1 John 3, 15]  So the ‘murderer rises up with the earliest dawn,’ in that every wicked man is set up in the glory of the present life, and bears down the life of those, who whilst they thirst after the glory to follow, as it were anxiously look out to be filled in the evening.  For the bad man in this world whilst seizing on the dignity of transitory power spreads himself out the more cruelly for the enacting of what is evil, in proportion as there is no man he loves in the bowels of charity.  For as often as in the thoughts of his heart he is maddened against the good, so often does he kill the life of the innocent.
73.  And if, God ordaining it, he suddenly lose the glory of the power he has gotten, he changes his place but not his disposition, for he directly falls away to that, which is subjoined, And in the night is as a thief.  For in the night of his tribulation and sunkenness, though he has no power to put forth the hand of cruelty, yet to those whom he sees to be empowered, he recommends counsels of wickedness, and goes about hither and thither, and prompts whatever things he is able toward the injuring of the good.  And he is rightly called ‘as a thief,’ because in all those very evil counsels of his he dreads lest he should be caught out.  He then that towards the poor and needy is a murderer in the morning, in the night like a thief is hidden out of sight, in that every bad man, who in this life’s prosperity by bearing down kills the life of the humble, being in adversity and abasement, by evil counsels does mischief in a concealed way, and what he is unable to accomplish by himself, that he puts in practice by attaching himself to the powerful ones of this world.
