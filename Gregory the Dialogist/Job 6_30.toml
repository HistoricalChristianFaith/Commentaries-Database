6.  As if it were expressed in plain words, ‘The more exactly ye weigh your own words, the more truly ye estimate  those of others, and when what ye say begins to be right, ye will recognise what ye hear to be just.  For my tongue never sounds of folly to you, unless it be what comes from your own inward thoughts.’  Thus Holy Church makes it her aim first to prove the allegations of her enemies to be false, and then to make known the announcements of the truth, for so long as they reckon themselves to hold right notions, they obstinately assail the right things that they hear.  Therefore it is necessary beforehand that heretics should feel their error, lest they gainsay the truth when it is heard.  For neither if the tiller of the soil neglect to root up the briars of the field by the cutting of the share, will the earth bring to a crop the seed received into her bosom; and 'when the physician does not get rid of the corruption, by opening the wound, healthy flesh never forms in the corrupt spot.  First then in destroying what is bad, let him say, And speaking that which is just, judge ye; but afterwards in teaching what is right, let him add, And ye shalt not find iniquity in my tongue, nor shall foolishness sound through my jaws.  Now it is the way with heretics to deliver some things openly, to hold others in secret, for by the ‘tongue,’ plain speaking is denoted, but by the ‘jaws [fauces],’ the secret harbouring.
7.  Neither in the tongue then of Holy Church does ‘iniquity resound,’ nor ‘foolishness in her jaws,’ for the things that she proclaims in open utterance, at the same time she preserves in inward faith; nor does she teach one thing in public and keep another to herself in secret; but she both delivers what she thinks by giving utterance to it, and keeps what she delivers by living accordingly; and whatever is let out belonging to the feast of heavenly wisdom by the tongue of preaching, she tastes this same by the jaws of silent expectation.  And let blessed Job, both as an individual member of the whole Church, in telling his own case, and as showing what is the heart of all of the Elect, make known all that he feels, that the testimony of his speech may manifest the uprightness of his mind.
