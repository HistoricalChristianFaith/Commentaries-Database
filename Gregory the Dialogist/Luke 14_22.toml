But let us hear what the servant adds after the poor have been brought to the supper: Lord, it is done as you commanded, and still there is room. Many such were gathered from Judea to the Lord's supper, but the multitude that believed from the people of Israel did not fill the place of the heavenly banquet. The throng of Jews has already entered, but there is still room vacant in the kingdom where the multitude of the Gentiles must be received.
