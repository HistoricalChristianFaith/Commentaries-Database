For there are many continent persons who guard themselves from outward desire, and are carried by hope toward inner things, who mortify the flesh, and pant with all longing for the heavenly homeland, who seek eternal rewards and are unwilling to receive human praises for their labors. These indeed do not place their glory on the lips of men, but conceal it within their conscience.

And there are many who afflict the body through abstinence, but from that very abstinence seek human favor, who devote themselves to teaching and give much to the needy. But these are certainly foolish virgins, because they seek only the recompense of passing praise. Hence it is aptly added: "Five were foolish."
