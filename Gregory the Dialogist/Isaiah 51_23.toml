Concerning these enemies indeed it is spoken through the prophet, for they say to your soul, “Bow down that we may cross over.” The sublime soul is indeed straight, standing tall, while the humbled one is bent, since through the heavenly quality of virtues and the heavenly longing it is lifted into the higher places, but when it is deflected to the love of this world, it fell to where the enemy attacked it and easily laid it waste. So they say to the souls, “bow down that we may cross over,” that is, to see if they bring it down to act or think in a worldly way or infiltrate its mind with mean thoughts and upset it with the warfare of vices. From this we can learn just how far away we ought to be from worldly action, word and thought.
