Concerning these enemies indeed it is spoken through the prophet, for they say to your soul, “Bow down that we may cross over.” The sublime soul is indeed straight, standing tall, while the humbled one is bent, since through the heavenly quality of virtues and the heavenly longing it is lifted into the higher places, but when it is deflected to the love of this world, it fell to where the enemy attacked it and easily laid it waste. So they say to the souls, “bow down that we may cross over,” that is, to see if they bring it down to act or think in a worldly way or infiltrate its mind with mean thoughts and upset it with the warfare of vices. From this we can learn just how far away we ought to be from worldly action, word and thought.

Hence another prophet says concerning unclean spirits: Who said to your soul, Bow down that we may pass over. For the soul stands upright when it desires heavenly things, and is by no means bent toward the lowest things. But when malign spirits see it standing in its uprightness, they cannot pass through it. For their passing through is to scatter unclean desires upon it. Therefore they say, Bow down that we may pass over, because if the soul does not cast itself down to desiring the lowest things, their perversity by no means prevails against it; and they cannot pass through her whom they fear standing rigid against them in heavenly intention.
