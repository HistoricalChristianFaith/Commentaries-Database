Though holy church is unquestionably older than its adversaries (for they went forth from it, not it from them, as is said of them by John, “They went out from us, but they were not of us”), yet Elihu is properly described as having been younger than these same adversaries. Because in truth after the contests that arose with the heretics, haughty people began to have place in the church, puffed up with the pride of learning. For when more grievous contests commenced with the enemy, there were certainly required some subtle dart points of thought, opposition of arguments and a more involved research of words. And while people of glowing genius invent these weapons to suit the circumstances, they are frequently puffed up with pride, and (as is generally the case in the sin of pride) they are themselves made to fall by the same subtle meanings with which they assail the foe, while in what they think correctly concerning God, they seek not God’s glory but their own. Thus, while Elihu says many things correctly, he is yet reproved by the divine voice, as though he had stated errors.
