33.  Now because in the very opening of our exposition we so made the Lord to be set forth in the person of blessed Job, that we said that both the Head and the Body, i.e. both Christ and His Church, were represented by him; therefore since we have shown how our Head may be taken to be represented, let us now point out, how His Body, which we are, is set forth; that as we have heard from the history somewhat to admire, and learnt from the Head somewhat to believe, we may now deduce from the Body somewhat to maintain in our lives.  For we should transform within ourselves that we read, that when the mind is moved by hearing, the life may concur to the execution of that which it has heard. 
There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job.
34.  If ‘Job’ signifies ‘grieving’ and ‘Uz’ ‘a Counsellor,' every elect person is not improperly represented by either name; in that be certainly abides in a mind of wise counsel, who hastens grieving from things present to things eternal.  For there are some that take no heed to their life, and whilst they are seeking transitory objects, and either do not understand those that are eternal, or understanding despise them, they neither feel grief nor know how to entertain counsel, and when they are taking no account of the things above which they have lost, they think, unhappy wretches, that they are in the midst of good things.  For these never raise the eyes of their mind to the light of truth which they were created for, they never bend the keenness of desire to the contemplation of their eternal country, but forsaking themselves amidst those things in which they are cast away, instead of their country they love the exile which is their lot, and rejoice in the darkness which they undergo as if in the brightness of the light.  But, on the contrary, when the minds of the elect perceive that all things transitory are nought, they seek out which be the things for which they were created, and whereas nothing suffices to the satisfying them out of God, thought itself, being wearied in them by the effort of the search, finds rest in the hope and contemplation of its Creator, longs to have a place among the citizens above; and each one of them, while yet in the body an inhabitant of the world, in mind already soars beyond the world, bewails the weariness of exile which he endures, and with the ceaseless incitements of love urges himself on to the country on high.  When then he sees grieving how that that which he lost is eternal, he finds the salutary counsel, to look down upon this temporal scene which he is passing through, and the more the knowledge of that counsel increases, which bids him forsake perishable things, the more is grief augmented that he cannot yet attain to lasting objects.  Hence Solomon well says, He that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow [Eccles. 1, 18]; for he that already knows the high state which he does not as yet enjoy, is the more grieved for the low condition, in which he is yet held.
35.  Job therefore is well said to dwell in the land of Uz, in that the mind of every elect person is kept going grieving in the counsels of knowledge.  We must also observe what absence of grief of mind there is in precipitancy of action.  For they that live without counsel, who give themselves over precipitately to the issue of events, are meanwhile harassed by no grief of reflection.  For he that discreetly settles his mind in the counsels of life, heedfully takes account of himself, exercising circumspection in his every doing, and lest from that which he is doing a sudden and adverse issue should seize him, he first feels at it, gently applying to it the foot of reflection; he takes thought that fear may not withhold him from those things which ought to be done, nor precipitance hurry him into those which ought to be deferred; that evil things may not get the better of him through his desires by an open assault, nor good things work his downfall insidiously by vain glory.  Thus Job dwells in the land of Uz, in that the more the mind of the elect strives to live by following counsel, so much the more is it worn with the grief of so narrow a way.  It goes on;
And that man sincere [simplex, E.V. perfect] and upright, one that feared God, and eschewed evil.
36.  Whoso longs for the eternal country, lives without doubt sincere and upright; I mean, perfect in practice, and right in faith, sincere in the good that he does in this lower state, right in the high truths which he minds in his inner self.  For there are some who in the good actions that they do are not sincere, whereas they look to them not for a reward within but to win favour without.  Hence it is well said by a certain wise man, Woe to the sinner that goeth two ways [Ecclus. 2, 12]; for the sinner goes two ways, when at the same time that what he sets forth in deed is of God, what he aims at in thought is of the world.
37.  Now it is well said, one that feared God and eschewed evil; in that the holy Church of the elect enters indeed upon its paths of simplicity and of uprightness in [al. from] fear, but finishes them in charity, and it is hers then entirely ‘to depart from evil,’ when she has begun now from the love of God to feel unwillingness to sin.  But whilst she still does good deeds from fear, she has not entirely departed from evil; because she sins even herein, that she would sin if she could have done it without punishment.  So then when Job is said to fear God, it is rightly related that he also ‘departs from evil,’ in that whereas charity follows upon fear, that offence which is left behind in the mind is even trodden under foot in the purpose of the heart.

15. We believe from the history that these things took place, but let us here turn to see in what way they were allegorically fulfilled; for, as we have said, Job is interpreted, ‘a mourner,’ and Uz ‘a counsellor.’  Whom else then does the blessed Job express by his name, saving Him, of Whom the Prophet speaks, saying, Surely He hath borne our griefs? [Isa. 53, 4]  He dwells in the land of Uz, in that He rules the hearts of a people of wise counsels; for Paul saith, that Christ is the Wisdom of God and the Power of God [1 Cor. 1, 24]; and this same Wisdom Herself by the lips of Solomon declareth, I Wisdom dwell with Prudence, and am in the midst of witty inventions. [Prov. 8, 12]  So Job is an inhabitant of the land of Uz, because Wisdom, Which underwent the pain of the Passion in our behalf, has made an habitation for Herself in those hearts, which are instinct with the counsels of life.
16.  And that man was perfect and upright, In uprightness, justice is signified, and in simplicity, mercy [or ‘meekness,’ mansuetudo].  We in following out the straight line of justice, generally leave mercy behind; and in aiming to observe mercy, we deviate from the straight line of justice.  Yet the Incarnate Lord maintained simplicity with uprightness; for He neither in showing mercy parted with the strictness of Justice, nor again in the exactitude of justice did He part with the virtue of mercifulness.  Hence when certain persons, having brought an adulteress before Him, would have tempted Him, in order that He might step into the fault either of unmercifulness or of injustice, He answered both alternatives by saying, He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.[John 8, 7]  He that is without sin among you, gives us the simplicity of mercy, let him first cast a stone at her, gives us the jealous sense of justice.  Whence too the Prophet saith to him, And in Thy Majesty ride prosperously, because of truth, and meekness, and righteousness. [Ps. 45, 4]  For in executing truth, He kept mercy united with justice, so that He neither lost the jealous sense of rectitude in the preponderance of mercy's scale, nor again unsettled the preponderance of mercy by that jealousy of rectitude. 
17.  And one that feared God, and eschewed evil.  It is written of Him, and the Spirit of the fear of the Lord hath filled Him; for the Incarnate Lord showed forth in His own person whatsoever He hath inspired us withal, that what He delivered by precept, He might recommend by example.  So then according to our human nature our Redeemer feared God, for to redeem proud man, He took for man's sake an humble mind.  And His acting likewise is fitly designated hereby, in that the blessed Job is said to eschew evil.  For He Himself eschewed evil, not evil which He came in contact with in the doing, but which upon meeting with it, He rejected; for He forsook the old life after man's method, which He found at His birth, and He stamped upon the character of His followers that new life, which He brought down with Him.

1. It is for this reason that we are told where the holy man dwelt, that the meritoriousness of his virtue might be expressed; for who knows not that Uz is a land of the Gentiles?   and the Gentile world came under the dominion of wickedness, in the same proportion that its eyes were shut to the knowledge of its Creator.   Let us be told then where he dwelt, that this circumstance may be reckoned to his praise, that he was good among bad men; for it is no very great praise to be good in company with the good, but to be good with the bad; for as it is a greater offence not to be good among good men, so it is immeasurably high testimony for any one to have shown himself good even among the wicked.   Hence it is that the same blessed Job bears witness to himself, saying, I am a brother to dragons, and a companion to owls. [Job 30, 29]  Hence it was that Peter extolled Lot with high commendation, because he found him to be good among a reprobate people; saying, And delivered just Lot, vexed with the filthy conversation of the wicked; for he was righteous in seeing and hearing [so Vulg.], dwelling with them who vexed his righteous soul from day to day with their unlawful deeds. [2 Pet. 2, 7.8.]  Now he evidently could not have been vexed unless he had both heard and witnessed the wicked deeds of his neighbours, and yet he is called righteous both in seeing and in hearing, because their wicked lives affected the ears and eyes of the Saint not with a pleasant sensation, but with the pain of a blow.  Hence it is that Paul says to his disciples, In the midst of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom ye shine like lights in the world. [Phil. 2, 15]  Hence it is said to the Angel of the Church of Pergamos, I know thy works,and where thou dwellest, even where Satan's seat is; and thou holdest fast My name, and hast not denied My faith. [Rev. 2, 13]  Hence the Holy Church is commended by the voice of the Spouse, where He says to her in the Song of love, As the lily among the thorns, so is my love among the daughters. [Cant. 2, 2]  Well then is the blessed Job described, (by the mention of a gentile land,) as having dwelt among the wicked, that according to the testimony borne by the Spouse, be might be shown to have grown up a lily among thorns, for which reason it is well subjoined immediately after,
And that man was simple [so Vulg.] and upright.
2.  For there are some in such wise simple as not to know what uprightness is, but these walk wide of the innocence of real simplicity, in proportion as they are far from mounting up to the virtue of uprightness; for while they know not how to take heed to their steps by following uprightness, they can never remain innocent by walking in simplicity.  Hence it is that Paul warns his disciples, and says, But yet I would have you wise unto that which is good, and simple concerning evil. [Rom. 16, 19]  Hence again he says, Brethren, be not children in understanding, howbeit in malice be ye children. [1 Cor. 14, 20]  Hence Truth enjoins Her disciples by Her own lips, saying, Be ye wise as serpents and harmless as doves. [Mat. 10, 16]  For in giving them admonition, He needfully joined the two together, so that both the simplicity of the dove might be instructed by the craftiness of the serpent, and again the craftiness of the serpent might be attempered by the simplicity of the dove.  Hence it is that the Holy Spirit has manifested His presence to mankind, not in the form of a dove only, but also in the form of fire.  For by the dove simplicity is indicated, and by fire, zeal.  Therefore He is manifested in a dove, and in fire, because all they, who are full of Him, yield themselves to the mildness of simplicity, in such sort as yet to kindle with a zeal of uprightness against the offences of sinners.  It follows,
And one ,that feared God and eschewed evil. 
3.  To fear God is never to pass over any good thing, that ought to be done.  Whence it is said by Solomon, Whoso fears God, neglects nothing [Eccl. 7, 18, (Vulg.) 19.]; but because there are some, who practise some good actions, yet in such wise that they are by no means withheld from certain evil practices; after he is said to have been one that feared God, it is still rightly reported of him that he also eschewed evil; for it is written, Depart from evil, and do good [Ps. 37, 27]; for indeed those good actions are not acceptable to God, which are stained in His sight by the admixture of evil deeds; and hence it is said by Solomon, He who offendeth in one point, spoileth many good deeds [Eccl. 9, 18].  Hence James bears witness, saying, For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all. [James 2, 10]  Hence Paul saith, A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump [1 Cor. 5, 6].  So then that it might be shown us how spotless the blessed Job stood forth in his good actions, it is wisely done that we have it pointed out how far he was removed from evil deeds.   
4.  But it is the custom of narrators, when a wrestling match is woven into the story, first to describe the limbs of the combatants, how broad and strong the chest, how sound, how full their muscles swelled, how the belly below neither clogged by its weight, nor weakened by its shrunken size, that when they have first shown the limbs to be fit for the combat, they may then at length describe their bold and mighty strokes.  Thus because our athlete was about to combat the devil, the writer of the sacred story, recounting as it were before the exhibition in the arena the spiritual merits in this athlete, describes the members of the soul [mentis], saying, And that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared God, and eschewed evil; that when the powerful setting of the limbs is known, from this very strength we may already prognosticate also the victory to follow.
