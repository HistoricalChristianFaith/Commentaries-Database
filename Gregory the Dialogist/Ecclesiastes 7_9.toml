When a person does not put up with being disregarded in this world, he tries to display what good points he may have. And so impatience leads him on to arrogance, and being unable to tolerate contempt, he ostentatiously boasts in advertising himself. Wherefore it is written, “Better is the patient man than the presumptuous.” Indeed, the patient person suffers any evil rather than that his hidden good qualities become known through the evil of ostentation. On the contrary, the arrogant person prefers that good should be attributed to him even falsely, rather than that he should suffer the slightest evil.

When the peace of the mind is lashed with anger, torn and rent, as it were, it is thrown into confusion, so that it is not in harmony with itself and loses the force of the inward likeness. Let us consider, then, how great the sin of anger is, by which, while we part with mildness, the likeness of the image of the Most High is spoiled. By anger, wisdom is cast off, so that we are left wholly in ignorance of what to do and in what order to do it.

When anyone lacks patience about being looked down upon in this world, he tries to display any hidden good qualities he may have, and so through impatience is drawn on to arrogance. While he cannot bear contempt, he boasts ostentatiously in self-display. Therefore Scripture says, “Better is the patient than the arrogant.” Indeed, one who is patient chooses to suffer evil rather than have his hidden good qualities come to be known through the vice of ostentation. But the arrogant, on the contrary, prefers to have good attributed to him falsely, rather than to suffer the slightest evil.
