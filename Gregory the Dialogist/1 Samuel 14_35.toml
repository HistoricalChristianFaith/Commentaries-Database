For when sinners are converted, a heavenly edifice is, as it were, constructed from stones. And since many manuscripts have: "And then Saul first began to build," the name of altar can be understood as compunction of heart. For when compunction of heart is raised up through the word of a teacher, an altar is surely built to the Lord. And it is said to have been built first, because there is a compunction of love. Hence in the tabernacle of the covenant, two altars were commanded by the Lord to be made: one, namely, for burning incense, and another for burning flesh (Exod. XXVII, XXXVII). The first altar was outside; the second was within the Holy of Holies. The first altar, therefore, is the compunction of fear; the second altar is the compunction of love. The former belongs to those who mourn their sins; the latter to those who yearn with all their desires for eternal joys. The stones of the former are recollections of sins; the stones of the latter are meditations on everlasting joys. Therefore the teacher builds the first altar when he sets forth the faults which the sinner, when he beholds them in himself, groans over. Rightly also is compunction called an altar, because it offers incense. But when each person is pricked with compunction for a long time over his sins, he advances through repentance to the practice of confidence. For after the times of affliction, he begins to burn for eternal life, and he who formerly wept from dread of punishment now begins to weep even more abundantly over the delay of his reward. Therefore, since the first compunction of the elect is born from fear, while through the figure of the king and the people, preachers and their recently converted subjects are signified, Saul is said to have then first built an altar. But from the progress of some, a teacher is often inflamed to pursue the gains of others. Hence it is added: (Verse 36.) And Saul said: "Let us rush upon the Philistines by night and lay waste to them until the morning light, and let us not leave a single man among them."
