When the prophet spoke at length about a single gate, faith is rightly understood because the faith of all the elect is one. When other gates are mentioned, the mouths of the preachers may be understood, where the true life is recognized, and through which lies ascent to the knowledge of spiritual mysteries.

The gate looks northward when each preacher examines the life of a sinner and opens to him the inner life through the word of preaching.

There are three orders of those who lead virtuous lives, that is, good spouses, celibates and preachers. Some who are married strive in love for the heavenly kingdom, but others in hope of eternal joy torment their flesh, flee all earthly activities and disdain to be involved in the care of this age. Others again despise earthly goods and proclaim the heavenly joys that they know. What are all these but chambers in the spiritual building, in whose thoughts and meditation the soul is joined to her heavenly groom?

This gate also has a front because there are in the life of the preacher open works that are seen.
