Readers must exercise great discernment, so that when any single word is used in sacred Scripture, it is not believed to always signify one and the same thing—just as sometimes "sun" is taken in a good sense, and sometimes in a bad sense. For by the name of sun, sometimes our Redeemer Himself is signified, and sometimes persecution. For as the Book of Wisdom attests, the impious in hell will say: "We have erred from the way of truth, and the sun of justice has not shone upon us." And concerning the seeds that were cast, the Lord says: "When the sun rose, they withered"—because, that is, when persecution arose, the words of preaching dried up in the hearts of the reprobate. Likewise, "lion" signifies the Lord. Hence it is written: "The lion of the tribe of Judah has conquered." Yet by the name of lion, the likeness of the devil is also expressed, as is said by the first pastor: "Your adversary the devil, like a roaring lion, goes about seeking whom he may devour." Likewise, by the name of ox, a wise person is designated. Hence it is written: "You shall not yoke together an ox and a donkey"—that is, you shall not join a wise person with a fool in preaching. Yet by "ox" a fool is also figured, as is said of one who has been captured in shameful love: "Immediately he follows her, like an ox led to slaughter"—that is, like a fool being dragged to death. I have said these things, therefore, lest—because I have explained that a gate can signify the Lord, or preachers, or sacred Scripture, or faith—wherever "gate" is read henceforth in this prophet, it be believed that it cannot signify something else. For when the prophet was speaking of one gate, faith was rightly understood, because there is one faith of all the elect. But when other gates are named, the mouths of preachers can be understood, through which true life is known, and through which one ascends to the knowledge of spiritual sacraments. For regarding the gate by which we said faith is signified, we should note that it is called "lower." For while we are in this life, we are held as if placed in the depths, still kept below. And rightly is the lower gate faith, because it opens to us, placed on earth, the knowledge of God.

Of the gate which looked toward the way of the North of the outer court, those same things are repeated which were already said above concerning the other gate, and other things are added which the prophet had passed over in silence concerning the aforesaid gate. Therefore, in order that we may discuss more fully those things which have not yet been examined, we ought to repeat briefly what has already been said. For the gate looks toward the way of the North when any preacher recognizes the life of a sinner and opens to him the interior things of life through the word of preaching. This gate is called the gate of the outer court. For the outer court is the present life, in which everything that is done bodily is also seen bodily. This gate is measured both in length and in breadth, because when a sinner is led to the faith, it is necessary that his teacher consider how much he advances in the length of hope or how much in the breadth of charity from his admonition. For he who is converted to God, if he still hopes for the good things of the present life, does not have length, because the life in which he has placed his hope is short. If he is confined by the desire for earthly things and still by hatred of his neighbor, he does not have breadth, because he does not know how to despise passing things or to expand himself in love of neighbor. But when anyone who has been converted hopes with longsuffering for the joys of eternal life, bears the troubles of his neighbors with charity, and despises coveting what he does not have—the gate has length and breadth, because the glory of the preacher is the progress of the hearer. Whence it is said to certain ones through the great preacher: "My joy and my crown." And again: "Behold, now I live, if you stand in the Lord." And again: "What is our hope or joy? Is it not you before the Lord?" Therefore the length and breadth of the gate is that which looks toward the North, because when a preacher has converted to the faith any unbeliever who was torpid in the coldness of his sin, through the fact that he stretches him out in the length of hope and expands him in the amplitude of charity, he makes his glory his own.
