It is said, “I know that you will bring me to death, and to the house appointed for all living.” … Before the grace of the Redeemer even the just were carried to the caverns of hell. For the mere entering of “hell” is itself called “the house of all living,” because no one came there who before the advent of the Mediator did not enter by the simple constitution of his own state of corruption. No one came there who did not go on to the death of the flesh, by the steps of that same corruption belonging to him.… The same judgment pertains to the accents of the holy church in which there are weak persons who hold the faith to the extent of the word of the lips but contrary to the precepts of faith act the slave to their desires. For [the church] says, “I know that you will deliver me to death, where the house appointed for all living is.” For because it sees multitudes in it devoted to pleasures and already foresees their destruction, [the church] reflects that in the course of the present life they serve their desires indeed, yet all are brought to the house of death who in the same way live carnally. But there are some who are brought down into the pit of their gratifications, yet by the tears of repentance quickly recover the foot from below. For them the strokes of smiting from above cut rather for instruction than destruction.“However you do not put forth your hand for their destruction; and if they are brought to the ground, you will save them.” So, while speaking of himself in arguing, [Job] subjoins cases applying to others, and he shows how many he represents in the person of himself. Accordingly, the Lord “does not put forth his hand for the destruction” of those who sin if by striking he reforms from sins. “He saves those that are falling to the ground” when those falling into transgression are brought to health of the body through their wounds. Being brought low outwardly, they arise inwardly. Those who lie prostrate in body are brought back to inward standing, while those who are standing outwardly are brought low in soul.
