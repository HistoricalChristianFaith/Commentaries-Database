45.  In Holy Scripture ‘teeth’ are sometimes used to be understood for the holy preachers, and sometimes for the interior senses [f].  Thus of the holy preachers it is said to the Bride, Thy teeth are like a flock of sheep that are even shorn, which came up from the washing. [Cant. 4, 2]  And hence it is said to one of them, when the Gentiles were represented to him in a figure, Kill and eat [Acts 10, 13], i.e.  ‘crush their oldness, and convert it into the body of the Church, i.e. into your own members.’  Again, that ‘teeth’ are wont to be understood of the interior senses, is testified by the Prophet Jeremiah, when he says, He hath broken my teeth by number. [Lam. 3, 16]   For by the ‘teeth’ the food is broken in pieces, to allow of its being swallowed.  Hence we not unjustly understand the interior senses by ‘teeth,’ which as it were chew and mince small the several particulars that occur to the mind, and transfer them to the belly of the memory, which the Prophet declares to be ‘broken by number,’ in that according to the measure of each particular sin there is blindness of understanding engendered in our perception, and in proportion to that which each person has committed outwardly, he is made dull of sense in that, which he might have understood of the inward and invisible.  Whence too it is rightly written, Everyone that hath eaten the sour grape, his teeth shall be numbed. [Jer. 31, 30]  For what is ‘the sour grape,’ saving sin?  for a ‘sour grape’ is fruit before the time.  So whosoever desires to be satisfied with the enjoyments of this present life, is as it were in a hurry to eat fruit before the time.  Thus ‘the teeth of him that eateth the sour grape are numbed,’ in that he who feeds in the gratification of the present life, has the interior perceptions tied fast, that they should no longer be able to eat, i.e. to understand spiritual things; in that from the very self-same cause that they gratify themselves in outward things, they are rendered dull in those of the interior.  And whereas the soul is fed with sin, it is unable to eat the bread of righteousness, in that the teeth being tied fast by the custom of sin, can never at all chew such good, as has a relish in the interior.  In this place then, because, as we have said, we understand ‘the teeth’ to be the interior perceptions, we ought to consider very heedfully what the righteous are wont to do.  Who, commonly, if they detect in themselves any points of a carnal sort however slightly, going over these in the interior senses, vehemently prosecute them in their own person, afflict themselves with selfchastisement, and with excessive self-inflictions visit in judgment the very least things wrong in them, and condemn them by penitence.  Which same they do for this reason, that in the sight of the eternal Judge, both they may themselves be found as far as may be without blame, and that those, who see them thus judge themselves, may be kindled to reform themselves from worse offences.  And this blessed Job had done in the presence of his friends, who kept fast temporal glory, and extolled transitory blessings.  Yet he could not bring their sense to see the usefulness of the scourge with which he was afflicted, that so they might bethink themselves that Almighty God not only bestows prosperity, but likewise brings down adversity upon us, when He is favourable.  Whence he says well in this place, Wherefore do I tear my flesh with my teeth?  As if he said in plain words, ‘Why with my interior perceptions do I hunt out things carnal, if there be any such thing done in me, if I cannot thereby benefit my spectators?’ Where too it is fitly added,
And carry my life in my hand?
46.  To ‘carry our life in our hands’ is to show forth the bias of the heart in practice.  For the righteous have this thing proper to them, that in all that they do, and all that they say, they not only seek their own increase, but the edification of their neighbours likewise.  Sometimes they judge themselves in some point, that they may recall indolent hearers to the consideration of themselves.  Sometimes they exhibit good works, that their spectators may be ashamed not to imitate what they see.  For it is written, That they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in Heaven. [Matt. 5, 16]  Thus he that exhibits the bent of his mind by his works, ‘carries his life in his hand;’ but when any good man, whether by judging himself or by exhibiting good works, furthers not his neighbour’s welfare by what he has done, he returns to words of sorrow.  Whence it is rightly said in this place, Wherefore do I take my flesh in my teeth? and carry my life in my hand?  i.e. ‘Why do I either judge myself strictly before men, or show in practice what my heart is bent on, if I do not advance my neighbour’s good either by passing judgment on my evil things, or exhibiting good ones?’  But yet the righteous, even while they speak so, never give over setting their neighbour a good example.  Hence blessed Job, still further exemplifying and exhibiting the excellence of patience before the eyes of his friends, saith,
Though He slay me, yet will I trust in Him.
47.  There is no room for the virtue of patience in prosperous circumstances.  He is really patient, who is at once bruised with misfortune, and yet not bowed down from the erectness of his hope.  Concerning the temper of mind of the reprobate man it is written, He will praise Thee, when Thou doest well to him. [Ps. 49, 18. Vulg.]  Hereby, then, the righteous mind is distinguished from the unrighteous, that even in the midst of affliction the former acknowledges the praise to Almighty God, that he is not broken down together with his worldly fortune, does not fall together with the fall of outward glory, but hereby proves the more, what he was with worldly goods, who even without worldly goods stands the stronger.
