Again, by bread is set forth the instruction of heavenly doctrine, as is said by the prophet, “You who dwell in the land of the south, meet with bread him that is flying away.” For they dwell in the land of the south who, placed within [the] holy church, are breathed upon by the love of the Spirit from on high. But he is flying who is wishing to escape from the evils of this world. He then who dwells in the land of the south should meet with bread him that is flying; that is, he who is already full of the Holy Spirit within the church should console with words of instruction the one who is endeavoring to escape from his evil ways. - "Morals on the Book of Job 5.23.49"
