And he measured the gate from the roof of one chamber to the roof of the other, a width of twenty-five cubits.

We have often said already that the gate can signify faith, and through that same faith our Lord and Redeemer himself, the Mediator of God and men, Jesus Christ, because through the faith that is in him the entrance to life lies open. But we also not undeservedly take sacred Scripture, which opens for us that same faith into the understanding of our Redeemer, as the gate, because when it is known as it ought to be, we enter into understanding invisible things. If therefore in this place, as we have said before, the gate is understood as Scripture, we must ask what is signified by the roof of the bedchamber, what by the roof of the gate. But the bedchamber has a roof, because the mind of lovers is hidden, and the fervor of love is still in secret. The gate also has a roof, because all of Scripture indeed was written for our sake, but not all of it is understood by us.

For many things in it are written so openly that they feed the little ones; but certain things are veiled with more obscure meanings, so that they may exercise the strong, inasmuch as things understood with effort are more pleasing. Some things, however, are so closed in it that while we do not understand them, recognizing the weakness of our blindness, we advance more toward humility than toward understanding. For there are certain things that speak so of heavenly matters that they lie open only to those supernal citizens remaining in their homeland, and are not yet revealed to us who are pilgrims. For if someone journeying to an unknown city should hear many things about it along the way, some things indeed he gathers by reason, but other things, because he does not yet see them, he in no way knows; but the citizens themselves who are in that city both see what is left unsaid about it and understand what is said about it. We therefore are still on the way; we hear many things about that heavenly homeland; some we already understand through spirit and reason, but certain things not understood we venerate. Whence also it is written concerning that same sacred Scripture: Stretching out the heaven like a skin, who covers its upper parts in the waters. For heaven is stretched out like a skin, because through the mouths of mortals Sacred Scripture is unfolded to us in expositions. But there are waters in heaven, namely the higher multitudes, that is, the hosts of angels, in whom the upper parts of that same heaven are covered, because those things which are higher and more obscure in sacred Scripture lie open only to angelic spirits, and remain as yet unknown to us. Therefore the bridal chamber has a roof, because the neighbor does not yet know how much he is loved by his neighbor. The gate also, that is, sacred Scripture, has a roof, because we cannot yet penetrate with our understanding all the things we hear concerning heavenly matters.

It remains therefore that in those things which we understand, we should walk in daily progress of charity. And although our neighbors do not see in us how much they are loved by us, and although we humbly venerate in sacred Scripture those things which we do not yet understand, nevertheless in those things which we have attained by understanding, we ought to be enlarged through good works. Hence it is also said: "And he measured the gate from the roof of one chamber to the roof of the other, a width of twenty-five cubits." For we are endowed with five senses of the flesh, namely sight, taste, smell, hearing, and touch. This same number five, multiplied by itself, rises to twenty-five. Moreover, we cannot perform anything outwardly from the heavenly commandments without these five bodily senses. For the mind as judge presides inwardly over these its functions, and recognizes what it can do outwardly in justice or mercy, as if these functions were reporting and serving it. When therefore the mind is filled with fear of the Almighty Lord, it is necessary that our five senses serve us as subordinate functions in good works. When through them we begin to do something mercifully, mercy itself opens wider daily, and expands as a kind of bosom of good work. Therefore the five senses are multiplied in themselves, when what is done through them in good work is multiplied daily through progress. Hence the width is said to be twenty-five cubits, because fear, stinginess, and sloth are narrowness. For whoever fears to give bread to the needy lest he himself lack it, is still in the narrowness of fear. Whoever does not extend a garment to one who is cold, because he desires to have it for himself alone, is still constrained by the narrowness of his own stinginess. Whoever does not do good because he grows lazy through lukewarmness of spirit, his very torpor is narrowness for him. But to look upon the needy, to hear their prayer, to bestow alms, to provide defense, and not to fear the enmities of any adversary for the sake of defending that poor person—this is great breadth of mind. Let therefore that width which lies between the chamber and the gate be measured at twenty-five cubits, because in the operation of the external senses it is proved and known what generosity of goodness is held within. For what you have already learned from Sacred Scripture and how much you silently love your neighbor, you show in the breadth of good work.

Let the width between the chamber and the gate be twenty-five cubits, because between charity and knowledge good work is the witness. If perhaps this should be lacking, it is certainly established that you have neither known God nor loved your neighbor; that is, you have neither the gate of sacred eloquence nor the chamber of love. And it should be noted that it is said to have been measured from the roof of the chamber to the roof of the gate. For through those things which are covered from us in sacred Scripture, our humility is proven, because whatever we do not understand in it, we ought not proudly to criticize but humbly to venerate. Hence it is also written of the Lord: His eyelids question the sons of men. For his eyelids are judgments which close something to us and open something. By opening they question us whether we are not exalted by understanding. By closing they question us whether we do not despise what we are unable to understand. Moreover, through those things which we do not speak to our neighbors concerning our charity, we are more truly proven in the sight of God. For in the mouth of some charity is feigned, but in the hearts of others it is true. And often concerning charity what is not is displayed, and what is is not demonstrated. Therefore good work speaks our love toward our neighbor more than the tongue, so that in the good work itself our neighbor may see himself loved. And when we cannot accomplish as much as we wish, let the hidden things of our love suffice for almighty God. Therefore let there be great width from the roof of the chamber to the roof of the gate, so that from the hidden things of our charity on account of our neighbor up to the humility of knowledge and on account of God, insofar as we understand and are able, we may always do good works.

The gate itself can also be understood as the entrance to the heavenly kingdom. Now the chamber has a roof, and the gate also has a roof, because both how great our charity is toward God and neighbor is not known, and when we shall be led from this world to the rest of eternal life is unknown. For our Creator willed the day of our death to be unknown to us, so that, while it is always unknown, it may always be believed to be near; and each person may be all the more fervent in action, the more uncertain he is about his calling. Hence also a width of twenty-five cubits extends from the chamber to the gate, because through the charity which we have once conceived toward God and neighbor, we ought to work manifoldly and unceasingly in every way we can until we enter the kingdom. Therefore from the roof of the chamber to the roof of the gate there is great width, because from the grace by which we begin to love God, up to that very love which opens for us the entrance to the heavenly kingdom, we ought to expand ourselves in the great performance of good works: to suffer adversities patiently, to bestow good things willingly, to love even those whom we suffer, to give away what we have, not to covet what we do not have, to love our neighbors as ourselves, to consider their goods as our own, to weep over their evils as if they were our own. In such a mind, therefore, there is great width, in which there is no narrowness of hatreds. This width we have indeed conceived from love of God and neighbor, and we have learned it through the sacred commandments. For we understand those twenty-five cubits of width not unfittingly, if we wish to examine them according to sacred Scripture. For he had said that the chambers were measured at six cubits, and on the sixth day man was created; on that day also the Lord is described as having completed His works. Hence the number six is customarily used to signify perfection. And because we have learned every good work through the four books of the holy Gospel, if we multiply six by four, we arrive at twenty-four. To this a unit is added, because there is One through whom all do good works. Therefore this width ought to be expressed as twenty-five cubits, because every good work is known, as we said, through the four books of the holy Gospel, and is completed in the knowledge and confession of the one God.

And door against door.

In this place, "contra" (against/opposite) is not placed in opposition to adversity, but to rectitude. For a door is opposite a door when one arrives by a straight path from the outer entrance to the inner one. In the knowledge of almighty God, our first door is faith, while the second is the vision of Him, to which we arrive by walking through faith. For in this life we enter through the former, so that we may afterward be led to the latter. Therefore a door is opposite a door, because through the entrance of faith the entrance to the vision of God is opened. But if anyone wishes to understand both of these doors as pertaining to this life, neither does this conflict with a sound understanding. For often we wish to consider the invisible nature of almighty God, but we are by no means able to do so; and the soul, wearied by these very difficulties, returns to itself, and makes for itself steps of ascent from itself, so that it may first consider itself, if it is able, and then investigate, as far as it can, that nature which is above it. But if our mind has been scattered among carnal images, it is by no means able to consider either itself or the nature of the soul, because by however many thoughts it is led, it is blinded as if by that many obstacles.

The first step, therefore, is for the soul to gather itself to itself; the second is to see what it is like when gathered; the third is to rise above itself and subject itself by directing its attention to the contemplation of the invisible Creator. But it can by no means gather itself to itself unless it has first learned to banish from the eyes of the mind the phantasms of earthly and heavenly images, to reject and trample underfoot whatever from sight, whatever from hearing, whatever from smell, whatever from touch and bodily taste presents itself to its thought, so that it may seek itself within as it is without these things. For when it thinks about these things, it turns over within itself, as it were, certain shadows of bodies. All things must therefore be driven away by the hand of discernment from the eyes of the mind, so that the soul may consider itself as it was created under God and above the body, so that, vivified by what is above, it may vivify the lower realm which it administers. The soul has been infused into the body in such a way that it is not divided into parts according to the parts of the limbs. For if any part of the body is struck in any place, the whole soul feels pain. In a wondrous manner, while presiding over the limbs with one and the same vivification, though it is not diverse in its nature, it nevertheless performs diverse functions through the body. For it is the soul that sees through the eyes, hears through the ears, smells through the nostrils, tastes through the mouth, touches through all the limbs, and by touching distinguishes smooth from rough. And although it performs such diverse operations through the senses, it arranges these not as diverse things but by that one reason in which it was created. Therefore, when the soul thinks about itself without images of the body, it has already entered the first door. But from this door it stretches toward another, so that it may contemplate something of the nature of almighty God. The soul in the body is the life of the flesh; but God, who vivifies all things, is the life of souls. If, therefore, the vivified life is of such magnitude that it cannot be comprehended, who can comprehend with the intellect how great is the majesty of the vivifying life? But to consider and discern this very thing is already in some measure to enter, because from its own estimation the soul gathers what it may perceive concerning the uncircumscribed Spirit, who incomprehensibly governs those things which he incomprehensibly created.

For our Creator presides over His creation in a manner far beyond comparison, and He makes certain things to exist, yet not to live; certain things indeed to exist and live, yet not to be able to discern anything about life; and certain things to exist, live, and discern. And He who is one works all things, but is not divided in all things. For He is truly supreme, and never unlike Himself. But the soul, although by nature it is not different from itself, nevertheless is different through thought. For in that very moment and instant when it thinks about sight, it forgets to think about hearing; and in that moment and instant when it thinks about hearing or taste, it cannot think about smell or touch, because through attention and forgetfulness it always becomes unlike itself, so that now it holds this in thought, now that. But Almighty God, because He is not unlike Himself, sees by the same power by which He hears all things, creates by the same power by which He judges what is created. Therefore His seeing is at the same time to administer all things, and His administering is to behold. Nor does He help the just by one thought and condemn the unjust by another, but by one and the same force of His singular nature, always unchanging in Himself, He disposes dissimilar things. But why should we marvel at this concerning the power of the Creator, when we behold traces of His power even in creatures? For the nature of clay and wax is different. But the ray of the sun is not different, and yet although it is not different, what it works in clay and wax is different, because by one and the same heat of its fire it hardens clay and melts wax. But perhaps this is in the nature of the clay or wax, not in the substance of the sun itself, which seems to work different effects in different natures. But Almighty God has it in Himself to dispose changeable things without change, to do different things without diversity in Himself, to form dissimilar things without alternation of thoughts. Therefore God, who is never unlike Himself, works dissimilar things in a manner far dissimilar, He who both is everywhere and is wholly everywhere. For He says: Heaven is my throne, and earth is the footstool of my feet. And of Him it is written: Who measures heaven with a span, and encloses the earth in His fist.

From which matter it is necessary to consider that He who presides over heaven as His seat is both above and within. And He who encloses heaven in His palm and the earth in His fist is also outside, above, and below. Therefore, to indicate that Almighty God is interior and superior to all things, He declared that heaven itself is His seat. But to show that He surrounds all things, He asserts that He measures heaven with His palm and encloses the earth in His fist. He Himself therefore is interior and exterior, He Himself is lower and higher: higher by ruling, lower by bearing; interior by filling, exterior by surrounding. And He is so within that He is also without; He so surrounds that He penetrates; He so presides that He bears; He so bears that He presides. Therefore, when the soul, lifted up to itself, understands its own measure, and recognizes that it transcends all corporeal things, and stretches from its own understanding toward the understanding of its Author, what else does it behold now but the door which is opposite the door? Whence the Prophet also says to the Author of all: Your knowledge has become wonderful from me, because however much the soul may strive, it cannot suffice to penetrate itself perfectly, how much less the magnitude of Him who was able to create the soul as well? And when he labored in understanding the knowledge of God, growing weary and failing he added: It is strengthened, and I shall not be able to reach it. But when we strive and stretch forward, desiring to perceive something of the invisible nature, we grow weary, are beaten back, are repelled; and if we cannot penetrate the interior things, nevertheless from the outer door we already see the inner door. For the very labor of contemplation is a door, because it shows something of what is within, even if there is not yet the power of entering.
