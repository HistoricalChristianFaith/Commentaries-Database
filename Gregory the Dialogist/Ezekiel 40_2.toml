"The hand of the Lord came upon me, and brought me there in visions of God: He brought me into the land of Israel, and set me down upon a very high mountain, upon which there was as it were the structure of a city facing toward the South."

The building of this city certainly cannot be understood according to the letter. For shortly afterward he adds that this same building was measured with a reed of six cubits and a palm, while the gate of the same building was measured at fourteen cubits, and he reports that the fronts of this gate are sixty cubits. All of these things cannot stand according to the letter. For how is the whole building together measured with a reed, that is, six cubits and a palm, while the gates of the building extend to fourteen cubits, and the fronts of the gates to sixty cubits? For the gate is in the city, and the fronts are in the gates. And no reasoning permits it to be accepted that what contains is less than what is contained. Moreover, in Sacred Scripture, even those things which can be understood according to history must often be understood spiritually, so that both faith may be held in the truth of the history, and spiritual understanding may be grasped from the mysteries of allegory. Just as we also know what the Psalmist says: "For I shall see your heavens, the works of your fingers, the moon and stars, which you have established." For behold, in the outward description the word of reason stands, because both the heavens are the works of God, and the moon and stars were created and established by him. But if the Psalmist asserts this according to outward works alone, and not also according to mystical understanding, he who professed that the heavens are the works of God, when about to speak of the moon and stars, why did he not also enumerate the sun equally, which we know is his work? For if he was speaking according to the letter alone, when about to speak of the lesser light, he ought first to have spoken of the greater light, so that he might report that the sun was established first, and afterward the moon and stars. But because he was speaking according to mystical understanding, so that we should understand the moon as the holy Church, and the stars as all the saints, he did not wish to name the sun, because indeed he was speaking to that eternal Sun himself, of whom it is written: "But for you who fear the Lord, the sun of justice shall rise." Of whom the reprobate will say at the end: "The sun of justice has not risen for us." Therefore by saying, "The moon and stars which you have established," and yet being silent about the sun which was made, he indicated that he spoke to that Sun who not only made the sun and moon and stars corporally, but also made the moon of the Church and the stars of all the saints spiritually. If therefore, when something is lacking to history, we are led by clear reason to the understanding of allegory, how much more should those things be understood spiritually in which, according to the reasoning of the letter, nothing historical sounds? "The hand of the Lord came upon me, and brought me there in the visions of the Lord." For the hand signifies the power of might, while the visions signify the very revelation which he had received. For the hand in vision is power in contemplation. By which words what does he openly indicate, except that he speaks nothing about the city which he had seen according to the letter? For he speaks spiritually about that which he contemplates spiritually.

And he set me upon a mountain exceedingly high. What then does the high mountain signify except the Mediator of God and men, the man Christ Jesus? Who is indeed from the earth, but beyond the earth, because the flesh of our same Redeemer has its matter from below, but excels in the heights by his power. It would have been insufficient to call him high unless he added exceedingly, because he is not only man, but from that same conception of humanity which was assumed by him, God-man, not only man beyond men, but man made even above the angels. For concerning him it is said through Isaiah: In that day the fruit of the earth shall be sublime. For our Creator, because he was incarnate for us, was made the fruit of the earth for us. But now the fruit of the earth is sublime, because man born on earth reigns above the angels in heaven, because according to the voice of David and Paul, He has subjected all things under his feet. For in that he subjected all things to him, he left nothing not subject to him. Therefore this mountain is both high and exceedingly so, because even if he is from earth through the substance of humanity, nevertheless he is incomprehensible from the height of divinity. For hence it is that when the prophet Isaiah foresaw that the same Lord was to come in the flesh, raised up by the spirit of prophecy, he said: And it shall be in the last days that the mountain of the house of the Lord shall be prepared on the summit of the mountains. For the house of the Lord was the Israelite people. Therefore he was called the mountain of the house of the Lord, who deigned to become incarnate from the Israelite people. Moreover there were in that same people holy men who might rightly be called mountains, because through the merit of their life they drew near to heavenly things. But the incarnate Only-begotten was not equal to these mountains, because by his divinity he transcends the nature, life, and merits of all. Whence also rightly he is called a mountain above the summit of mountains, because he was found to be exalted by his divinity even above the peaks of the saints, so that those who had advanced greatly in God could scarcely touch his footprints from the summit of their thought. He therefore who there is called the mountain above the summit of mountains, here is declared to be the mountain exceedingly high.

Upon which there was as it were the building of a city facing toward the South. It should be noted that it does not say, "Upon which there was a building," but "as it were a building," so that it might clearly be shown that all these things were said not of a corporeal but of a spiritual city's building. For he who declares that he saw not a building but as it were a building directs the hearts of his hearers to a spiritual construction, as is said through the Psalmist: "Jerusalem which is built as a city." For since that vision of inner peace is constructed from the congregation of holy citizens, the heavenly Jerusalem is built as a city. Yet while in this land of pilgrimage she is struck with scourges, beaten with tribulations, her stones are daily squared. And this is the city, namely the holy Church, which though destined to reign in heaven still labors on earth. To whose citizens Peter says: "And you as living stones are built up." And Paul says: "You are God's field, God's building." Which city indeed already has here in the conduct of the saints its great building. For in a building stone bears stone, because stone is placed upon stone; and he who bears another is borne by another. So therefore, so in holy Church each one both bears another and is borne by another. For neighbors mutually tolerate one another, so that through them the building of charity may rise. Hence Paul admonishes, saying: "Bear one another's burdens, and so you will fulfill the law of Christ." Declaring the power of which law, he says: "Love is the fulfillment of the law." For if I neglect to bear you in your conduct, and you disdain to tolerate me in my conduct, whence does the building of charity rise between us, whom mutual love does not join together through patience? Moreover in a building, as we said before, the stone that bears is borne, because just as I now tolerate the conduct of those who are still unpolished in the way of life of good work, so I too was tolerated by those who preceded me in the fear of the Lord and bore me, so that having been borne I might learn to bear. But they too were borne by their elders. However the stones that are placed at the top and at the end of the structure are indeed borne by others, but they bear no others at all, because those who will be born at the end of the Church, that is at the extremity of the world, are indeed tolerated by their elders, so that their conduct may be shaped to good works; but since none follow them who might progress through them, they bear no stones of the faithful structure upon themselves. Now therefore some are borne by us, but we were borne by others. Yet the foundation bears the entire weight of the structure, because our Redeemer alone tolerates the conduct of all together. Of whom Paul says: "For no one can lay another foundation besides that which has been laid, which is Christ Jesus." The foundation bears the stones and is not borne by the stones, because our Redeemer tolerates all our faults, but in him there was no evil that needed to be tolerated. Hence it is well said now: "He set me down upon an exceedingly high mountain, upon which there was as it were the building of a city," because he alone sustains our conduct and faults, who bears the entire structure of holy Church. Who says through the voice of the prophet concerning those still living perversely: "I have grown weary enduring." Yet the Lord does not grow weary by enduring, whose power of divinity no weariness touches; but, speaking in human words, he calls his very patience toward us labor.

And it should be noted that the prophet saw that same city which he beheld inclining toward the South. For those who are devoted to sacred eloquence recognize that the south wind is customarily placed as a type of the Holy Spirit; just as, on the contrary, the devil is often designated by the North wind, because the former relaxes with heat, and the latter constricts with cold. And the Truth says: Iniquity shall abound, and the charity of many shall grow cold. The prophet also asserts concerning Judea, saying: As a cistern makes its water cold, so has she made her malice cold. Hence the devil, as the same prophet attests, is reported to have said: I will sit upon the mountain of the Testament, in the sides of the North. But on the contrary, this city inclines toward the Southern part, because the grace of the Holy Spirit relaxes the torpor of the mind. Hence the Psalmist says: Turn again, O Lord, our captivity, as a torrent in the South. For our captivity, which had remained sluggish in following God due to the coldness of torpor, is relaxed through the heat of the Holy Spirit, so that it may run into the love of God. Whence it is also now said that the city which is established on the mountain inclines toward the South, because the Church of the elect opens her thoughts in the breath of the Holy Spirit, and, descending from every summit of her pride, conceives the warmth of love in God, in whom she believes, so that nothing pleases her except to be submitted to His grace, to be warmed by His love, to be always filled by the gift of His breath. Whence also the contemplator, inflamed with mighty love, was saying: My soul shall exult in the Lord, and shall delight in His salvation. For He who in Latin is called "the Savior," the same in Hebrew is called Jesus. Therefore the prophet, because he was contemplating His ways and miracles and also the mystery of our redemption through the spirit of prophecy, declares that he exults in the Lord and delights in Jesus, because from that source he had conceived joy in his mind from which he burned strongly through love. Let us therefore consider, if the minds of the spiritual fathers were delighted in Him who had not yet come, but was foreseen, how great is the guilt of one who does not love His ways, His examples, His admonitions, after He came and accomplished redemption. Therefore this city is said to incline toward the South, as if it were openly said that that former city, namely the Synagogue, stood toward the North in her unbelievers, which hardened in the coldness of unbelief. But Holy Church, which conceived the charity of faith, inclines toward the South through warmth, and leans as it were upon the warm wind, because she rejoices not in confidence in herself, but in the gift of spiritual grace.

And he brought me in there.

He enters the building of the heavenly city who considers by imitating the ways of the good in holy Church. For to enter the building upon the mountain is to consider with love how the elect of holy Church, established on the summit of virtues, advance in the Lord. For this one leads a life bound by marriage, is content with his own possessions, does not seize what belongs to others, bestows whatever he is able from his own goods upon the needy, and does not neglect to weep for the sins without which daily life cannot be led by married people. For because that very domestic care disturbs his mind, he stirs himself to tears. But that one has already abandoned all things that are of the world, desires to have nothing of it, is nourished by the exercise of contemplation alone, rejoices with weeping in hope of heavenly rewards, transcends even those things which are permitted to be possessed, seeks to have daily intimacy with the Lord; no care of the passing world disturbs his mind; he always expands his mind in expectation of heavenly joys. But another has already abandoned all things of this world, and his mind is lifted up to the contemplation of heavenly things; yet nevertheless, for the edification of many, holding a position of governance, he who does not succumb to passing things out of desire is sometimes turned back to them out of compassion for his neighbors, so that from care for them he may show mercy to the needy; he preaches the word of life to his hearers, ministers things necessary for souls and bodies alike. And he who on his own account already soars by contemplation to heavenly desire, still toils in temporal affairs for the advancement and benefit of his neighbors. Therefore whoever in holy Church diligently strives to consider, so that he may advance either in the life of the good who are married, or in the citadel of the continent who abandon all things that are of this world, or even in the height of preachers, has already entered the building of the city set on a mountain. For he who neglects to consider the life of better persons in order to advance still stands outside the structure. And if he admires the honor which holy Church now holds in the world, he gazes upon the building as if from outside and is amazed. And because he is intent only on external things, he has not entered within.
