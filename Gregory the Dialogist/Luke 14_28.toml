Because lofty precepts have been given, a comparison of building something lofty is immediately added, when it is said: "For which of you, wishing to build a tower, does not first sit down and count the costs that are necessary, whether he has enough to complete it?" Everything we do, we ought to anticipate through careful consideration. For behold, according to the voice of Truth, he who builds a tower first prepares the costs of the building. If therefore we desire to construct a tower of humility, we must first prepare ourselves against the adversities of this world. For this is the difference between an earthly and a heavenly building: an earthly building is constructed by gathering expenses, but a heavenly building is constructed by dispersing expenses. For the former we make expenditures if we gather things not possessed; for the latter we make expenditures if we relinquish even what we possess. That rich man could not have these expenditures, who, possessing many properties, sought out the Master, saying: "Good Master, what shall I do to possess eternal life?" When he had heard the command to leave all things, he went away sad, and was made anxious in his mind from the very source by which he was outwardly richer in possessions. For because he loved in this life the expenditures of exaltation, in striving toward the eternal homeland he refused to have the expenditures of humility.
