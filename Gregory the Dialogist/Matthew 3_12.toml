Hom. in Ev., 7. 3: John baptizes not with the Spirit but with water, because hehad no power to forgive sins; he washes the body with water, but not at the same time the soul with pardon of sin.
Why then does he baptize who could not remit sin, but that he may preserve in all things the office of forerunner? As his birth had preceded Christ’s birth, so his baptism should precede the Lord’s baptism.
Mor. 34. 5: After the threshing is finished in this life, in which the grain now groans under the burden of the chaff, the fan of the last judgment shall so separate between them, that neither shall any chaff pass into the granary, nor shall the grain fall into the fire which consumes the chaff.
