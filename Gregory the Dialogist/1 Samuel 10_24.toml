But I see we must enquire how this Behemoth, who eats hay like an ox, is said to destroy the life of the spiritual, when, as was said before, by the word hay is designated the life of the carnal. His food also will no longer be choice, if, in eating hay, he seizes the carnal. But it occurs at once in reply, that some people are both hay in the sight of God and among people are counted under the name of holiness, when their life displays one thing before the eyes of men and before the divine judgment their conscience intends another. They therefore in the opinion of men are “elect,” but in the accurate judgment of the Lord are “hay.” Was not Saul hay in the sight of God, of whom the prophet Samuel said to the people, “You surely see him whom the Lord has chosen,” and of whom it is just said above, “He is choice and good”? For he whom the sinful people deserved was both reprobate in the sight of God and yet in the order of causes was choice and good. - "Morals on the Book of Job 32.13"
