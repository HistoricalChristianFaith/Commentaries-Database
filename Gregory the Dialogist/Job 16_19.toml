27.  For when the Son was brought to His downfall on earth, there was a witness to Him in heaven.  Since the Father is the witness of the Son; concerning Whom He Himself saith in the Gospel, And the Father Himself, Which hath sent Me, hath borne witness of Me. [John 5, 37]  Who is also rightly called ‘mine heart’s associate,’ in that with one will, and with one counsel, the Father acts always in union with the Son.  Whose witness too He is, in that no man knoweth the Son but the Father. [Matt. 11, 27]  Thus He had then ‘a witness in heaven,’ and His ‘heart’s associate’ on high, when they, who saw Him dying in the flesh, had their eyes closed to see the power of His Divine nature; and whereas men did not know, yet in the hour of death the Mediator between God and man did know, that the Father was working together with Himself.  Which perhaps may be likewise applied to the voice of His Body.  For Holy Church for this reason undergoes the miseries of this life, that the grace above may lead her on her way to the rewards of eternity.  She slights the death of her flesh, because she is intent on the glory of the resurrection; and what she suffers is transitory, what she expects everlasting, concerning which same everlasting blessings she has no misgiving, in that she has already a faithful testimony in the glory of her Redeemer.  For she sees with the mind the resurrection of His flesh, and is strongly fortified to have hope, in that what she sees already brought to pass in her Head, she hopes without doubting will also follow in His Body, which is herself.  Which same Church the Psalmist seeing destined to continue in everlasting perfection, describes her under the title of the moon.  A perfect moon for everlasting. [Ps. 89, 37]  And whereas the Resurrection of the Lord heartens her to entertain the hope of a Resurrection, he properly added, And a faithful witness in heaven.  Forasmuch as that she may not tremble for her own resurrection, she has Him in heaven for a witness, Who rose again from the dead; and so let the faithful People when it suffers adversity, when it is harassed with sore tribulations, lift up the mind to the hope of the glory to follow, and trusting in the resurrection of the Redeemer, let it say, Also now behold my witness is in heaven, and mine associate on high.  Who is also rightly called ‘an associate,’ in that He was acquainted with our nature, not only by creating, but by taking it upon Himself.  For His knowing is His having undertaken what belongs to us.  Whence too it is said by the Psalmist, For He knoweth our frame. [Ps. 103, 14]  For what wonder is it if He is said emphatically ‘to know our frame,’ when it is plain that there is nothing that He does not know?  But His ‘knowing our frame,’ is His having taken it upon Himself out of pitifulness.
28.  Yet this voice may together with blessed Job suitably apply to each one of ourselves as well; for every man who in what he does aims at human praises, seeks a ‘witness’ on earth: but he that is eager to please Almighty God by his deeds, takes thought that he has a ‘witness in heaven.’  And it often happens that the very good things themselves in us are found fault with by inconsiderate men; but he that ‘has a witness in heaven,’ has no need to fear men’s reproofs.
