All arrogant persons have this characteristic that when they have a right notion, though the thing is little, they wrest it to serve their pride. By the same act from understanding they attempt to raise themselves higher. From swollen pride they fall into the pit of self-exalting and account themselves better instructed than the learned. They exact respect for themselves from their superiors and stand upon it to teach as with authority those who are holier people. Hence it is now said, “I will demonstrate; listen to me.”
