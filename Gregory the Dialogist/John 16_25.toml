When he declares that he will show them plainly of the Father, he alludes to the manifestation about to take place of his own majesty that would show his own equality with the Father and the procession of the co-eternal Spirit from both. For we shall then openly see how what has its existence from something else is not subsequent to him from whom it springs and how he who is produced by procession is not preceded by those from whom he proceeded. We shall then see openly how both the One is divisibly Three and the Three indivisibly One.
