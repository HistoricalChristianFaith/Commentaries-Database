Whence the Lord also says in the Gospel; The hour cometh when I shall no longer speak unto you in proverbs, but I shall shew you plainly of the Father. For He asserts that He shews plainly of the Father, because by the appearance of His Majesty, which was then manifested, He shews both how He springs from the Father not unequal to Himself, and how the Spirit of Both proceeds coeternal with Both. For we shall then openly behold, how That Which Is by an origin, is not subsequent to Him from Whom It springs; how He Who is produced by procession, is not preceded by Those from Whom He proceeded. We shall then behold openly how both The One is divisibly Three, and the Three indivisibly One.

(xxx. Moral. viii.) When He declares that He will show them plainly of the Father, He alludes to the manifestation about to take place of His own majesty, which would both show His own equality with the Father, and the procession of the coeternal Spirit from both.
