What is the garrison of the Philistines, if not the strength of malignant spirits? For holy men, when they prepare themselves for the correction of sinners, openly know that they fight against angels fallen from heaven. This battle, therefore, since it is between angels and men, is fought by the strong against the weak, by the cunning against the simple. For he had received an assault from these strong ones, who said: "The strong have rushed upon me, though neither my iniquity nor my sin, O Lord" (Psalm 58:4). Paul also, perceiving the cunning of the fallen angel, says: "We are not ignorant of his cunning" (2 Cor. 2:11). Against the cunning, therefore, the way of cautious reasoning must be sought; against the strong, however, divine help must be sought. So that it may be understood that preaching must be carried out with great caution, Jonathan is said to have invited his armor-bearer to cross over with him. And so that in driving out the enemies, confidence may be placed in God's mercy, he speaks saying: "Because it is not difficult for God to save, whether by many or by few." And because the conversion of the wicked is not easy, he says: "Perhaps God will act for us." He says "perhaps" because he does not yet fully presume upon the complete salvation of sinners.
