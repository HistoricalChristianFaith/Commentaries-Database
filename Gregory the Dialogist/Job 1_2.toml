18. What is conveyed to us in the number of seven, saving the sum of perfection?  for to say nothing of the arguments of human reasoning which maintain that it is therefore perfect, because it consists of the first even number, and of the first uneven; of the first that is capable of division, and of the first which is incapable of it; we know most certainly that holy Scripture is wont to put the number seven for perfection, whence also it tells us that on the seventh day the Lord rested from His works; and it is hence too ,that the seventh day was given to man for a rest; i.e.  for a 'Sabbath.'  Hence it is that the year of jubilee, wherein we have a full rest set forth, is accomplished in seven weeks, being completed by the addition of the unit of our uniting together. 
19.  Thus there were born to him seven sons; namely, the Apostles manfully issuing forth to preach; who in putting in practice the precepts of perfection, as it were maintained in their manner of life the courage of the superior sex.  For hence it is that twelve of them were chosen, who should be replenished with the perfection of the sevenfold grace of the Spirit.  As from the number seven we rise to twelve; for seven multiplied in its component parts is extended to twelve; for whether four be taken by three or three by four, seven is changed into twelve, and hence, forasmuch as the holy Apostles were sent to proclaim the holy Trinity in the four quarters of the globe, they were chosen twelve in number, that by their very number they might set forth that perfection, which they proclaimed both by their lips and in their lives.
20.  And three daughters.  What do we understand by the daughters but the weaker multitudes of the faithful, who, though they never adhere with a virtuous resolution to perfection of life, yet cleave with constancy to the belief of the Trinity which has been taught them.  Thus by ‘the seven sons’ is represented the order of the Preachers, and by ‘the three daughters’ the multitude of the hearers.  By ‘the three daughters’ may also be signified the three orders of the faithful, for after mention of the sons the daughters are named, in that succeeding next to the distinguished courage of the Apostles came three divisions of the faithful, in the state of life in the Church; of Pastors, of those following continence, and of the married.  And hence the prophet Ezekiel declares that he heard three men named that were set free; viz.  Noah, and Daniel, and Job [Ezek. 14, 14f]; for what is signified by Noah who guided the Ark in the waters, but the order or rulers, who, while they govern the people for the fashioning of their lives, are the directors of holy Church amidst the waves of temptation?  What is represented by Daniel, whose marvellous abstinence we have described to us, but the life of the continent, who, while they give up every thing that is of the world, rule with elevated mind over Babylon which lies beneath them?  What is signified by Job but the life of the good that are married, who, while they do deeds of mercy by the good things of the world which they possess, do as it were advance to their heavenly country by the paths of earth?  Therefore because after the holy Apostles there came these three divisions of the faithful, after the sons rightly follows the mention of the three daughters that were born to him.

And forasmuch as each particular vice is stifled by fear, whilst the several virtues spring from charity, it is rightly added,
And there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters.
38.  For there are seven sons born to us, when by the conception of good intent the seven virtues of the holy Spirit spring up in us.  Thus the Prophet particularizes this inward offspring, when the Spirit renders the mind fruitful, in these words; And the Spirit of the Lord shall rest upon Him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and piety, and the spirit of the fear of the Lord shall fill him. [Isa. 11, 2]  So when by the coming of the Holy Spirit there is engendered in each of us, ‘wisdom, understanding, counsel, might, knowledge, piety, and the fear of the Lord,’ something like a lasting posterity is begotten in the mind, which preserves the stock of our nobility that is above unto life, for so much the longer as it allies it with the love of eternity.  Yet surely the seven sons have in us three sisters, forasmuch as all that manly work which these virtuous affections [virtutum sensus] do, they unite with faith, hope, and charity.  For the seven sons never attain the perfection of the number ten, unless all that they do be done in faith, hope, and charity.

The heart of the parent is often enticed into avarice by a numerous offspring, for he is the more inflamed with ambition for laying up an inheritance, in proportion as he abounds in the number to inherit it.  In order then that it might be shown what holiness of mind blessed Job possessed, he is both called righteous, and is said to have been the father of a numerous offspring.  And the same man in the beginning of his book is declared devout in offering sacrifices, and besides he afterwards with his own mouth records himself as ready in giving alms.  Let us then consider with what resolution he showed himself to be endowed, whom no feelings of affection for so many heirs could ever dispose to be greedy of an inheritance for them.
