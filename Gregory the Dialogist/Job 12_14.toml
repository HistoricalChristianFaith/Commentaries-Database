12.  Almighty God ‘breaks down’ the heart of man, when He forsakes it; He ‘builds it up,’ when He fills it.  For He does not destroy man’s soul by consummation of war, but by withdrawing Himself from it; in that when it is left to itself, it wants nothing to its own ruin.  Whence it commonly happens, that when the heart of the hearer, in due of his sins, is not filled with Almighty God’s grace, it is in vain that he is outwardly admonished by the preacher.  For every mouth that speaks is but mute, if He does not utter a voice in the heart within, Who inspires the words that are admitted into the ears.  Hence the Prophet saith, Except the Lord build the house, they labour in vain that build it. [Ps 127, 1]  Hence Solomon saith, Consider the work of God; for who can set him right whom He hath despised? [Eccles. 7, 13]  Nor is it strange, if the preacher is not attended to by the reprobate soul, since it sometimes happens that the Lord Himself, in the things which He speaks, is withstood by the tempers of those that withstand Him.  For hence it is that Cain could be admonished even by the voice of God, yet could not be changed, because as due to the sin of his evil heart, within God had already forsaken the soul, to which outwardly He addressed words to serve for a testimony.  And it is well added, If He shut up a man, there is none that can open; in that every man, whereinsoever he does wrong, what else does he but make for himself a prison-house of his own conscience, that guiltiness of soul may oppress him even though no man accuse him without?  And when by the judgment of God he is left in the blindness of his evil heart, he is as it were shut up within himself, that he may never find a place of escape, which he never deserves to find.  For it often happens that there are persons who long to quit their bad practices, but because they are weighed to the ground by the burthen of them, being shut up in the prison-house of bad habit, they are unable to go forth of themselves.  And there are some that anxiously desiring to visit their own offences with punishment, turn into worse offences what they reckon themselves to be doing aright; and it is brought to pass in a lamentable way, that what they take for their going out they find to be their imprisoning.  Thus the reprobate Judas, when he inflicted death upon himself to spite sin, was brought to the punishment of eternal death, and repented of sin in a more heinous way than he had committed sin. 
13.  Therefore let it be said, If He shutteth up a man, there is none that can open.  For as no man withstands His bountifulness in calling, so no one withstands His justice in forsaking; and so for God to ‘shut up’ is, not to open to those that are shut up; and hence it is said to Moses concerning Pharaoh, I will harden his heart. [Gen. 27, 5]  For God is said to harden the heart in executing justice, when He does not soften the reprobate heart in bestowing grace.  And so He ‘shuts up’ the man, whom He leaves in the darkness of his own practices.  For Isaac desired to open this shutting up to his first-born son, when he endeavoured to set him before his brother in blessing him.  But the son whom the father desired, the Lord rejected; and him, whom the Lord desired, the father blessed even against his will; that he, who had sold his birthright to his brother for a meal, might not get the blessing of the first-born, which he had relinquished through a gluttonous appetite; who, whilst that aiming at earthly objects, following after transitory things, he desired to inherit the blessing, was rejected.  For he found no place for repentance, though he sought it with tears [Heb. 12, 17]; for tears have no fruit, which are spent on regretting with sighs things destined to perish.  And so Isaac could not open even to his son, whom Almighty God by a just judgment shut up in the prison-house of his evil heart.
