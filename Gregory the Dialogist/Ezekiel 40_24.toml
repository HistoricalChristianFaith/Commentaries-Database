"And he led me out to the way of the South, and behold a gate which looked toward the South; and he measured its front and its vestibule according to the measures above."

All these things have already been said regarding the gate of the East and the North, and it is not fitting that we should repeatedly go over what we have already explained once and twice. Nevertheless, we must note that in the spiritual building one entrance opens to the East, another to the North, and another to the South. For just as sinners are designated by the cold of the North, so those who are fervent in spirit are designated by the Southern way, who, kindled by the heat of the Holy Spirit, grow in virtues as if in the noonday light. Let the gate to the East therefore stand open, so that those who have well begun the sacraments of faith, and have not afterward been submerged in any depth of vices, may arrive at the secret joys. Let the gate to the North stand open, so that those who after the beginning of warmth and light have fallen away into the cold and darkness of their sins may return to pardon through the compunction of repentance, and may know what is the true gladness of internal reward. Let the gate to the South stand open, so that those who are fervent in virtues through holy desires may daily penetrate the mysteries of internal joy through spiritual understanding.
