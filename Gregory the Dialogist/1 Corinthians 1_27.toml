Behold, he who clings to earthly substance more than is right refuses to come to the Lord's supper; he who sweats at the labor of curiosity disdains the prepared nourishments of life; he who serves carnal desires rejects the feasts of the spiritual banquet. Therefore, because the proud refuse to come, the poor are chosen. Why is this? Because, according to Paul's words, God chooses the weak things of the world to confound the strong. But it must be noted how those who are called to the supper and come are described: the poor and the feeble. They are called poor and feeble who in their own judgment are weak in their own eyes. For there are poor who are as if strong, who even when placed in poverty are proud. The blind, indeed, are those who have no light of understanding. The lame also are those who do not have right steps in their conduct. But since vices of character are signified in the weakness of the limbs, it is certainly clear that just as those were sinners who when called refused to come, so also these are sinners who are invited and come. But proud sinners are rejected, so that humble sinners may be chosen.
