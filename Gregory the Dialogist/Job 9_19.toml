35.  For He tries the counts of our lives, Who does not make them out by the testimony of another; in that He, Who is one day revealed as a strict inflicter of punishment, Himself was for long the silent witness of the sin.  For it is on this account that the Prophet says, I am judge and witness. [Jer. 29, 23. Vulg.]  Hence he saith again, I have long time holden My peace; I have been still, and refrained Myself; now will I cry like a travailing woman. [Is. 42, 12]  For a woman in travail casts forth with pain, what she has long borne in her womb with burthensomeness.  And so after a long silence, like a travailing woman, the Lord utters His voice, in that what He now bears silently in Himself, He one day as it were reveals with pain in the avenging of the Judgment.  But it deserves our enquiry; this righteous man, if any had ventured to give testimony in his behalf, would he have cleared him of guilt?  And if no other gave testimony to him, then, at least, is he himself at all events of strength to offer testimony in his own behalf?
