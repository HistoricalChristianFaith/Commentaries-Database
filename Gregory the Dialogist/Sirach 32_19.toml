Through Solomon it is rightly said, “One who minds the wind will never sow, and one who watches the clouds will never reap.” What is expressed by the wind but the temptation of evil spirits? And what are the clouds, which are moved by the wind, if not the hostility of evil people? Clearly, the clouds are blown by the wind because evil people are excited by the breath of unclean spirits. Consequently, the one who pays attention to the wind will not sow, and one who watches the clouds will never reap, because the one who fears the temptation of evil spirits and the persecution of human beings will neither sow the grain of good works nor cut the sheaves of holy retribution. The precipitous, who anticipate the time for good actions, pervert their merit and frequently fall into evil, because they have no discernment of the good. They do not inquire into what would be the right moment to do something but for the most part only think of this once they have done it, with an awareness that it should have been done differently. To these, under the guise of speaking to a pupil, Solomon says, “Do nothing without counsel, and after you have done it you will not regret it.” And further, “Let your eyelids precede your steps.” Our eyelids precede our steps when good counsel precedes our action. The one who neglects to consider in advance what he expects to do straightens his steps, closes his eyes and arrives at the end of his way but does not precede his steps with foresight. Consequently, he more quickly stumbles, because he does not pay attention, with the eyelids of counsel, to where to plant the foot of his works.
