39.  Whosoever seeks present glory doubtless dreads contempt.  He, who is ever agape after gain, is ever surely in fear of loss.  For that object, the receiving of which is medicine to him, the loss thereof is his wounding, and as he is rivetted under fetters to things mutable and destined to perish, so he lies grovelling beneath, far apart from the stronghold of security.  But, on the other hand, whoever is rooted in the desire of eternity alone, is neither uplifted by good fortune nor shaken by adverse fortune; whilst he has nought in the world which he desires, there is nought which he dreads from the world.  For it is hence that Solomon saith, It shall not grieve the just whatsoever shall happen unto him. [Prov. 12, 21]  Hence he says again, The righteous as a bold lion shall be without alarm. [Prov. 28, 1]  Therefore it is rightly said here; Also thou shalt lie down, and none shall make thee afraid, in that everyone the more completely casts away from himself the fear that cometh from the world, the more thoroughly he overcomes in himself the lust of the world.  Did not Paul lie down and rest in heart without fear, when he said, For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor strength [So Vulg.], nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord. [Rom. 8, 39]  The force of which same love is commended by the true voice of the Holy Church, where it is said in the Song of songs, For love is strong as death. [Cant. 8, 6]  For love is compared to the force of death, in that that soul which it has once taken possession of, it wholly kills to the delightfulness of the world, and sets it up the stronger in authority, that it renders it indifferent towards objects of terror.  But herein it is to be known, that when bad men deliver right sentiments, it is very hard for them not to let themselves out upon that, which they are going after in secret within.  Hence Zophar forthwith adds;
Yea, many shall make suit unto thee.
40.  For the righteous do not keep themselves in the narrow paths of innocency with this view, that they may be implored by others, but whether heretics or any that be perverse, all of them, in that they live with an appearance of innocency among men, have the desire to show themselves as intercessors in behalf of men, and when in talk they convey holy truths, what they themselves are hankering after, they promise to others as something great; and whilst they tell of heavenly things, they soon show by their pledges what their hearts are bent on.  But lest by long continuing to promise earthly things, they may be made appear what they are, they quickly return to words of uprightness.
