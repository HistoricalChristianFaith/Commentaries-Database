As often happens with one who incorrectly says right words and correctly bad words, so Elihu, in his arrogance, does not speak right words correctly, because in his defense of God he speaks humble sentences with an arrogant tone. So he is the perfect example of those who, in the universal church, look for vainglory. While they believe themselves to be more expert than anybody else, they are accused of being ignorant by the judgment of God, because, as the apostle says, “If one believes to know something, he still has to learn how to know.”
