What is the meaning of Jonathan being said to appear to the Philistines with his armor-bearer, if not that the teacher himself must first display the good that he strives to teach others? For he cannot be received with reverence in preaching if he does not first exhibit the honor of his ministry through the light of a good life. Hence the outstanding preacher confidently declares, saying: "As long as I am the Apostle of the Gentiles, I will honor my ministry" (Rom. 11:13). The teacher therefore appears, not so much when he speaks a word as when he is reverently demonstrated through his life and conduct. When the prophet, then, was showing the conduct of preachers through the types of sacred history, he reasonably added, saying: "So both of them showed themselves to the garrison of the Philistines." As if to say: Because he resolved to teach, he first showed his life to those to whom he had arranged to speak. But what does it mean that the Philistines despise those who appear and yet say to them, "Come up to us," unless that very often even those who will run to the laments of repentance through the preachers' preaching despise the preachers' excellent life? And while they criticize them for abandoning the pursuit of a more secluded life, they declare that they have come out of their caves. As if they were saying: Those who seemed to have fled the world with all their intent are now going out into the world under the pretense of preaching. But many who accuse righteous preachers suspect that the evils they charge against them actually exist in them. Yet by the very fact that they condemn evil, they give hope to the preachers, because they can more easily be drawn to carry out the good that they defend. Therefore, while with good intention they censure false evils in the righteous, they are indeed mad in voice, but even in their madness they pledge to the preachers the fruit of their salvation. And since the ascent was discussed above, it remains to inquire what it means that they say: "We will show you a thing." But this literally signifies threats. It is as if they were saying: If you come up here, you will feel by suffering how strong we are. In the conversion of the wicked, likewise, it is easy to gather how much harm they are accustomed to inflicting when they drive out the righteous. But since, with God as our guide, we have led the carnal sense of the history to a spiritual understanding, when holy teachers observe the conversion of sinners through certain emerging signs, a "thing" is also promised by them, because they promise to return to true being. For a "thing" has some being, but sin has no being at all. Hence Paul also says to the Corinthians: "We know that an idol is nothing in the world" (1 Cor. 8:4). But the sinner, because by sinning he tends toward nothing, when he abandons that nothing to which he clung, returns as it were to being. He can therefore show a "thing" in himself, that is, something that has being, because he now holds works of virtue through divine grace. They say therefore: "Come up to us, and we will show you a thing." As if by a certain sign sinners were promising and saying: If you propose to labor so in us by the word, what you labor at will not be without great profit.
