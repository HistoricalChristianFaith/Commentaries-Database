In these words, if we understand the gate as the entrance by which we enter into the knowledge of the Lord, the lower gate is faith, while the inner court is contemplation. Moreover, the lower gate has width in its face, because clearly faith through the amplitude of its charity has that operation which is seen by neighbors. When we observe this being carried out strongly by those who are more perfect, we who are constrained in good actions receive through them examples of great operation. And each holy action becomes for us, as it were, a certain width of the journey, which previously was a narrowness of difficulty. The inner court also has a front, because the contemplative life through certain signs of desires and groans shows how much it sees within, which it loves so greatly. Moreover, the number ten multiplied by itself rises to one hundred. Hence rightly through one hundred great perfection is designated, just as the Truth says of the elect: Everyone who leaves house, or brothers, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or fields for my name's sake, shall receive a hundredfold, and shall possess eternal life. For no holy person abandons earthly things in order to be able to possess them more abundantly in this world, because whoever leaves earth with earthly eagerness does not leave earth but seeks it. Nor will one who abandons one wife receive a hundred; but through the number one hundred perfection is designated, after which eternal life is also promised, because whoever despises temporal and earthly things for God's name both receives here perfection of mind, so that he no longer desires what he despises, and in the age to come arrives at the glory of eternal life. Therefore he receives a hundredfold what he gave, who receiving the spirit of perfection, does not need earthly things, even if he does not have them. For he is poor who lacks what he does not have. For he who not having does not desire to have, is rich. For poverty is in the want of the mind, not in the quantity of possession. For one who gets along well with poverty is not poor. Therefore the man measured the width from the face of the lower gate to the front of the inner court on the outside, one hundred cubits, because our Redeemer daily through masters and teachers measures the life of the faithful in the measure of perfection, either in the appearance of good work through faith, or in holy desires through contemplation.

For many seem to be established in faith and to work great things, but they are not measured at a hundred cubits, because through the very things they do they seek earthly glory. And some seem to be afflicted through abstinence, to persist in groaning; but their measure is by no means extended to a hundred cubits, because in those things which they do they seek favors from human judgment. Who therefore is the one who is measured by a hundred cubits, except he whose good work employs a right intention, so that in what he does he is not turned back toward desiring earthly gains or toward transitory praises?

Behold, for to show mercy to neighbors, to give away possessions, to bestow upon the needy with swiftness, is breadth in the face of the lower gate. But if in giving your own things you do not covet what belongs to others, if you do not seek earthly glory from that good work itself, you are rightly measured in the number one hundred, that is, in perfection. For he who seems to give his own things mercifully, and yet perhaps seizes the things of others violently, still does not know what the way of perfection is, nor has he understood from where one reaches toward perfection, because he has not found even its beginning. For he ought first to have plucked out desire from his mind, and afterward to give away what he rightfully possesses. Hence it is written: Turn away from evil and do good. For what good can there be in what he does, who has not yet turned away from evil? And there are some who, as has been said, abstain from food, mortify the flesh, yet if they are struck, they are recognized as panting after worldly glory. These show the front of the inner court, but they are not measured at one hundred cubits.

These therefore are in the number of perfection, of whom it is said by Paul: "Who have crucified their flesh with its vices and concupiscences." And it should be noted that it is not said that these things are measured from within, but from without, because clearly our Redeemer, when through us He either approves or judges the deeds of men, measures not from within but from without. Hence He also says through the Gospel: "By their fruits you shall know them." For when through what we see we recognize the spirit of the worker which we do not see, we measure from without either the breadth which is in the face of the lower gate, or the front of the inner court. For when we observe others giving alms, hastening to the afflicted, coming to the aid of the oppressed, seeking nothing of glory in this world, gaping after no gains of this world, and we see others subduing the flesh, persisting in tears, occupied with heavenly words, desiring nothing of transitory honor, what else ought we to do but believe them to be perfect, esteem them holy? Therefore, because through what we behold we see them to be perfect, we measure their life from without by a hundred cubits.

And because many in Judea, and indeed most among the Gentiles, arrived at this summit of perfection, rightly it is added: "To the East and to the North." For the Jewish people is rightly called the East, from whose flesh He was born who is called the Sun of justice. Of whom it is said through the prophet: "But to you who fear the Lord, the Sun of justice shall rise." By the North, however, the Gentiles are figured, who long lay torpid in the cold of their unbelief, and in whose heart he reigned who, as the prophet attests, said within himself: "I will set my throne in the North." Therefore, since almighty God incarnate made some perfect ones from Judea and other perfect ones from the Gentiles within the holy Church, He measured a hundred cubits not only to the East, but also to the North.

But because under the name of the North a discourse about the Gentiles has arisen, it is pleasing to consider how greatly the tender mercies of our Creator have been poured out upon us. For we all came from the Gentiles. Our ancient ancestors served wood and stones, and, abandoning God by whom they were made, they venerated gods whom they themselves made. But we, through the grace of almighty God, have been led forth from darkness into light. Let us therefore recall from what darkness we came, that we may give thanks for the light we have received. For he does not understand divine mercy who is not mindful of his own misery. Hence also it is said to God through the Psalmist: "Make your mercies wonderful, O Lord, you who save those who hope in you." For then the mercies of God become wonderful to us, when our miseries are recalled to our memory, because, remembering what we were, we understand to whom we owe what we are. Let us therefore sing with joy to our Creator, because we have shaken off the yoke of servitude to creation from the neck of our mind. Let us rejoice that what was said through Isaiah has been fulfilled in us: "And the bridle of error that was in the jaws of the peoples shall be a song for you, like the voice of a sanctified solemnity." For the bridle of error had bound the jaws of the peoples, when the Gentiles, bound by the error of idols, knew not how to give the praise of confession to the true God. But this very bridle of error has now been turned into a song for us, since rejoicing we sing psalms and chant: "All the gods of the nations are demons, but the Lord made the heavens." And again: "The idols of the nations are silver and gold, the works of human hands: they have mouths, and shall not speak; they have eyes, and shall not see; they have ears, and shall not hear; they have nostrils, and shall not smell; they have hands, and shall not feel; they have feet, and shall not walk." We therefore who say these things in psalm to the almighty Lord have made the very bridle of our error, which had bound our mouths from the praise of God, a song to the true Lord. And well is it said: "Like the night of a sanctified solemnity," because while we render the praise of confession to God, we rejoice in a sanctified solemnity. Let us therefore respond in our conduct to the so great mercy of our Redeemer, and we who have known the light, let us turn away from the darkness of wicked works.

I ask, what is there now in this world that gives pleasure? Everywhere we see grief, from all sides we hear groans. Cities have been destroyed, fortifications have been overthrown, fields have been depopulated, the land has been reduced to solitude. No inhabitant remains in the fields, almost no dweller remains in the cities; and yet even these small remnants of the human race are still struck daily and without cease. And the scourges of heavenly justice have no end, because even amid the scourges the sins of conduct have not been corrected. We see some led into captivity, some mutilated, some killed. What is there, therefore, that gives pleasure in this life, my brothers? If we still love such a world, we love not joys but wounds. And we see what Rome herself has become, she who once seemed to be the mistress of the world. Worn down manifold by immense sorrows, by the desolation of citizens, by the assault of enemies, by the frequency of ruins; so that in her we see fulfilled what was said against the city of Samaria through this same prophet long before: Set on the pot, set it on, I say, and pour water into it, and gather its pieces into it. And a little later: Its cooking has boiled over, and its bones have been thoroughly cooked in its midst. And again: Heap up the bones, which I will burn with fire: the flesh will be consumed, and the whole composition will be cooked, and the bones will waste away. Also set it empty upon the coals, that it may grow hot and its bronze may melt. For the pot was set on for us when this city was established. Then water was poured into it and its pieces were gathered together, when peoples flowed together to her from all sides, who like boiling water would seethe with the activities of the world, and like pieces of flesh would melt in that very heat. Of which it is well said: Its cooking has boiled over, and its bones have been thoroughly cooked in its midst, because first indeed the pursuit of worldly glory burned intensely hot in her, but afterward that very glory failed along with its followers. For by the bones the powerful of the world are signified, while by the flesh the common people are designated, because just as flesh is supported by bones, so the weakness of the peoples is governed by the powerful of the world. But behold, now all the powerful of this age have been taken away from her; therefore the bones have been cooked out. Behold, the peoples have failed, her flesh has melted away. Let it be said therefore: Heap up the bones, which I will burn with fire; the flesh will be consumed, and her whole composition will be cooked, and the bones will waste away. For where is the senate? Where now is the people? The bones have wasted away, the flesh has been consumed, all the pride of worldly dignities in her has been extinguished. Her whole composition has been cooked out. And yet even we few who remain are still pressed daily by swords, still by innumerable tribulations daily. Let it be said therefore: Also set it empty upon the coals. For since the senate is gone, the people have perished, and yet in the few who remain sorrows and groans are multiplied daily, Rome now burns empty. But why do we say these things about people, when, as ruins multiply, we see even the buildings themselves being destroyed? Hence it is fittingly added concerning the city now empty: Let it grow hot and let its bronze melt. For now even the pot itself is being consumed, in which previously both flesh and bones were consumed, because after the people have failed, even the walls are falling. But where are those who once rejoiced in her glory? Where is their pomp? Where is their pride? Where is their frequent and immoderate joy?

In her was fulfilled what is said through the prophet against destroyed Nineveh: Where is the dwelling of the lions, and the feeding place of the young lions? Were not her leaders and princes lions, who, running through the various provinces of the world, seized plunder by raging and killing? Here the young lions found their feeding place, because boys, adolescents, worldly youths, and the sons of worldly men rushed together here from everywhere, when they wished to advance in this world. But now behold, she is desolated, behold, she is crushed, behold, she is oppressed with groans. Now no one runs to her in order to advance in this world; now no powerful and violent man remains who might seize plunder by oppressing. Let us therefore say: Where is the dwelling of the lions, and the feeding place of the young lions? What happened to her we know was said through the prophet concerning Judea: Enlarge your baldness like the eagle. For the baldness of a man usually occurs only on the head, but the baldness of an eagle occurs over the whole body, because when it has grown very old, its feathers and plumes fall from all its limbs. Therefore she enlarges her baldness like an eagle, because she has lost her feathers, she who has lost her people. The feathers of her wings also fell, with which she was accustomed to fly to prey, because all her powerful men have perished, through whom she seized the things of others.

But these things which we say concerning the destruction of the city of Rome, we know to have been done in all the cities of the world. For some places have been desolated by plague, others consumed by the sword, others tortured by famine, others swallowed up by gaping chasms of the earth. Let us therefore despise with our whole soul this present age, whether extinguished or not; let us end our desires for the world at least with the end of the world: let us imitate the deeds of the good as much as we can. For in the East and the North there are many who are measured at a hundred cubits for the perfection of their life. For from Judea and from the Gentiles, as has been said, they have grown to the summit of holiness. Although by the East and the North the just and sinners can also be understood. For the just are not undeservedly called the East, who, as they were born in the light of faith, have persisted in innocence. But by the North we rightly understand sinners, who, having fallen away through coldness of mind, have grown numb under the shadow of their sin. But because the mercy of almighty God recalls even such persons to repentance, washes them with compunction and tears, enriches them with virtues, and raises them up even to the glory of perfection, a hundred cubits are measured not only toward the East, but also toward the North, since together with the just, sinners also come to perfection through gifts and repentance, by the bounty of our Lord Jesus Christ, who with the Father and the Holy Spirit lives and reigns as God through all ages of ages. Amen.
