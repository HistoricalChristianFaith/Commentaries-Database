But to a mind that is drunk with fury every right thing that is said appears wrong. Whence to Nabal when he was drunk Abigail laudably kept silence about his fault, but, when he had digested his wine, as laudably told him of it. For he could for this reason perceive the evil he had done, that he did not hear of it when drunk.
