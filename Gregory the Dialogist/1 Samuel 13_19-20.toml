30. All these things are indeed described so that the manner of the victory that followed might be made clear. For armed men were conquered by the unarmed, so that everything that is overcome might be attributed to the praises of Almighty God. But if we pursue these things spiritually in our customary manner, we will not find them devoid of mysteries. What then does it mean when it says: "No blacksmith was found in Israel," except that for spiritual battles we are instructed not through secular letters but through divine ones? For no blacksmith is found in Israel because the faithful who see the Lord do not fight against malign spirits by the art of secular knowledge. For they would conquer aided by the blacksmith's art if they prevailed against hidden enemies by the weapons of secular eloquence. And indeed this learning of secular books, even if by itself it does not benefit the spiritual conflict of the saints, when it is joined to divine Scripture, one is more subtly instructed in the knowledge of that same Scripture. Liberal arts are to be learned for this purpose alone: that through instruction in them the divine utterances may be understood more subtly. From the hearts of some, malign spirits remove the desire for learning, so that they neither know secular things nor reach the heights of spiritual things. Therefore it is rightly said: "The Philistines had taken care lest the Hebrews should make sword or spear." The demons clearly know that when we are instructed in secular letters, we are aided in spiritual matters. When therefore they dissuade us from learning these things, what else do they guard against except that we might make a spear or sword? Let the prophet therefore declare the history and make known the zeal of the elect, and let him explain: "Israel went down to the Philistines so that each might sharpen his plowshare or his hoe." We go down to the Philistines when we incline our mind to learning secular books. And it is called a descent because Christian simplicity is on high. But what does it mean that secular letters are said to be on the plain, yet their manner of teaching is lofty? Because although they narrate nothing heavenly, they unfold what they set forth in a marvelous order of speech, and they are elevated by their narration, yet brought low by speaking of carnal things. Whoever desires to know this manner of speaking or understanding, let him go down to the Philistines, let him sharpen plowshare and hoe, so that he who strives to be thoroughly instructed by their eloquence may be brought low even to hearing the carnal things of the secular writers. Almighty God indeed set this secular knowledge on the plain before us so that it might make for us a step of ascent that ought to lift us to the heights of divine Scripture. For this reason He willed it to come first, so that in it He might instruct us to pass over to spiritual things. Hence Moses, who gave us the beginnings of the divine utterances, did not first learn divine things, but so that he might be able to grasp or express divine things, he first formed his untrained mind in all the knowledge of the Egyptians. Isaiah also proved more eloquent than the other prophets, because he was not, like Jeremiah, from Anathoth, nor, like Amos, a herdsman, but was nobly educated and urbane. Paul too, the vessel of election, was first instructed at the feet of Gamaliel before he was caught up into paradise or raised to the height of the third heaven (Acts 22). And perhaps for this reason he excelled the other apostles in teaching: because he who was destined for heavenly things first diligently learned earthly ones.

31. But now, as I think, the properties of rural implements must be examined spiritually. What then is indicated by the plowshare, which is drawn by oxen going before, if not the affection of twofold charity? And what is shown by the hoe, with which each person alone labors in the cultivation of a field, if not the pursuit of the private life? For certain wealthy and strong farmers plow with oxen: because they both love the Lord mightily and, through brotherly love, attend more diligently to the gain of souls. They therefore sharpen the plowshare at the smiths of the Philistines: because they compose the pursuit of holy preaching from secular learning. But some, being poor, use the hoe: because those who judge themselves unable to suffice for winning the souls of others do not cease to prepare for themselves alone what they can regarding eternity. Each of them uses, as it were, a hoe: because they do not cease to prepare the field of their mind for divine worship. And because in this pursuit of the private life secular learning is also greatly profitable to them, one sharpens the hoe while being taught: because a learned person in the pursuit of his own life attends to everything more keenly. With the axe, however, we do not dig the earth but cut off the branches of trees. What then does the axe signify, if not the zeal of good emulation? For when we are kindled to imitate the examples of better persons, we cut branches for ourselves, as it were, with which to feed a fire for driving away the chills of our negligence. The Apostle Paul commands us to hold this axe, saying: "Be zealous for good in all things" (Gal. 4:18). This axe is indeed sharpened: because learned believers, just as they better recognize the examples of the faithful, so also they more fervently desire to imitate them. The weeding-fork or trident digs the earth more finely, so that it is understood not so much to dig as to scrape and break up clods. What is expressed by this three-pronged weeding-fork, if not the virtue of discernment? By which, certainly, when we examine things done or to be done with subtle consideration, we level the clods of our land, as it were, into fine dust for sowing. This weeding-fork is indeed declared to be three-pronged, because the power of discernment arranges not only what is to be done, but also what is to be thought and spoken. It clears away all harmful things from the hand, the heart, and the tongue, so that the seed which we commit to the soil of our mind may bear abundant fruit. Fittingly therefore it is said: "All Israel went down to the Philistines, so that each might sharpen his plowshare, his hoe, his axe, and his weeding-fork": because the affection of twofold charity, the pursuit of the private life, and the examples of another's perfection we read in sacred eloquence; but we who are ignorant of secular knowledge are unable to penetrate the depth of that same sacred eloquence. Whence also, adding reasonably, he says: (Verse 21.) "Therefore the edges of the plowshares, and hoes, and axes, and tridents were blunted, until the goad needed correcting."
