Hence it is that this very Mary of whom we speak lives, because He who owed nothing to death lay down for the human race. Hence it is that we daily return to life after our sins, because our Creator descended without guilt to our punishment. Behold, the ancient enemy has now lost the spoils he had begun to take from the human race; he has lost the victory of his supplanting. Daily sinners return to life; daily they are snatched from his jaws by the hand of the Redeemer.

Wherefore it is also well said again to blessed Job by the voice of the Lord: "Or will you pierce his jaw with a bracelet?" Where a bracelet is placed, it constrains by encircling. What then is designated by the bracelet, if not the divine mercy embracing us? Which pierces the jaw of this Leviathan, when it still shows us the remedy of repentance after we have committed what it forbade. The Lord pierces the jaw of Leviathan with a bracelet, because by the ineffable power of His mercy He so opposes the malice of the ancient enemy that sometimes he loses even those whom he had already seized. And they fall as if from his mouth, who return to innocence after committing sins.

For who, once seized by his mouth, would escape his jaw, if it had not been pierced? Did he not hold Peter in his mouth when he denied? Did he not hold David in his mouth when he plunged himself into such a pit of lust? But when each returned to life through repentance, this Leviathan in a certain way lost them as if through the hole in his jaw. Therefore through the hole in his jaw those were withdrawn from his mouth who returned through repenting after committing such great wickedness.

But what man escapes the mouth of this Leviathan so as to commit no unlawful thing? But from this we know how much we are debtors to the Redeemer of the human race, who not only forbade us to go into the mouth of Leviathan, but also granted us to return from his mouth. He did not take away hope from the sinner, because He pierced his jaw to provide a way of escape, so that he who incautiously refused beforehand to beware lest he be bitten might at least flee after the bite. Therefore heavenly medicine meets us everywhere, because He both gave man precepts lest he sin, and yet gave remedies to the sinner lest he despair. Wherefore it must be most carefully guarded against that anyone be seized by the mouth of this Leviathan through delight in sin; and yet if he has been seized, let him not despair, because if he perfectly mourns his sin, he still finds a hole in his jaw through which he may escape.
