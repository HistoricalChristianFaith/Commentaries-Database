Or will he be able to delight himself in the Almighty? Will he always call upon God?

For he that is overcome by the love of earthly things, in no degree delights himself in God. The soul indeed can never exist without its delight, for it delights itself either in things below or in things above, and in proportion as it is employed with higher devotion towards those above, it grows deadened with the greater loathing towards those below, and as it glows with a keener interest for those below, it cools in proportion with an accursed illsensibility from those above. For both cannot possibly be loved together and alike. Hence the Apostle John, well knowing that amongst the thorns of worldly attachments the crop of heavenly charity can never shoot, before he produces the seeds of the love eternal, with the holy hand of the word eradicates from the hearts of his hearers the thorns of worldly affections, in the words, Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. And he directly subjoins, If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him. As if he said in express terms; 'Both these loves cannot contain themselves in one and the same heart, nor does the crop of charity from Above shoot in that heart, wherein the thorns of gratification down below kill it.' And he reckons up all the prickles arising from that gratification below, saying, For all that is in the world is the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, which is not of the Father, but is of the world. And the world passeth away, and the lust thereof. And so the 'hypocrite cannot delight himself in God,' because heavenly desires never spring forth in his mind, seeing surely that the thorns of earthly love overlay it. Of whom it is fitly added; Will he always call upon God?

For it is then that the hypocrite 'calls upon God,' when the wretchedness of earthly circumstances wrings him hard. For when in this world he has obtained the carrying out of the good fortune sought for, his Maker, Who vouchsafed him this same good fortune, he asks not for.
