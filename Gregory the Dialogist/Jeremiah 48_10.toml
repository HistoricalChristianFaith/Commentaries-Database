If persons by no means ignorant of the medicinal art were to see a sore that required lancing and yet refused to lance it, certainly by their mere inactivity they would be guilty of a brother’s death. Let them see, then, in how great guilt they are involved who, knowing the sores of souls, neglect to cure them by the lancing of words. And so, it is well said through the prophet, “Cursed is one who keeps back his sword from blood.” For to keep back the sword from blood is to hold back the word of preaching from the killing of the carnal life. Of which sword it is said again, “And my sword shall devour flesh.”
