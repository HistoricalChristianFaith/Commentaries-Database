60.  For the ‘onager’ is a wild ass; and in this place Heretics are rightly likened to ‘wild asses,’ in that being let loose in their pleasures, they are strange to the fetters of faith and reason.  Hence it is written; A wild ass used to the wilderness that snuffeth up the wind of his love at his pleasure.  For he is a wild ass used to the wilderness, who whilst he does not cultivate the ground of his heart with excellence of discipline, there dwells, where there is no fruit.  Since he ‘snuffeth up the wind of his love at his pleasure,’ in that the things that from the desire of knowledge he conceives in his mind, are efficacious to puff up but not to edify.  Against whom it is said, Knowledge puffeth up, but charity edifieth. [1 Cor. 8, 1]  Hence here too the words are suitably brought in; they go forth to their work.  For it is not the work of God, but their own work that they do, whereas they follow not right doctrines, but their own desires.  For it is written, He that walketh in a perfect way, he served me. [Ps. 101, 6]  So he that does not walk in a perfect way, serves himself more than the Lord.  It goes on;
Watching for a prey, they provide bread for their children.
61.  They ‘watch for a prey,’ who are always trying to seize the words of the righteous according to their own perception, that by them they may provide the bread of error for evil minded children.  Of which some bread it is said in Solomon, in the words of the woman that bears the figure of heretical wickedness, Stolen waters are sweet, and bread eaten in secret is pleasant. [Prov. 9, 17]
