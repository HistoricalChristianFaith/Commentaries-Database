7. Above, King Saul is described as having chosen three thousand men for himself. If, therefore, we wish to compare the forces of each army, against each one of Saul's men, ten chariots and two horsemen of the Philistines are assigned. For ten times three thousand is thirty thousand. In the number six as well, three is doubled. By this battle, indeed, both the multitude and the ferocity of hidden enemies is signified. They come against us in chariots and on horses, because they strive to present now evil thoughts to the hearts of the elect, now harmful enticements of visible things to their bodily senses. For horses are swift in running and strong in assault. To these, indeed, evil thoughts are fittingly compared, which come swiftly to the heart and pierce it forcefully. Horsemen come against us in battle when malign spirits both quickly arouse evil thoughts in us and powerfully assail us through them. But two horsemen come against each one of the faithful, because if we gather up the hidden ambushes of reprobate spirits into a general consideration, their special aim is this: namely, to strike at our principal virtue and to utterly extinguish the love of God and of neighbor. One horse is seen to rage when, by a reprobate thought, the malign spirit suggests to us that our neighbor should be held in hatred. But the horse that appears alone is not alone, because no one who hates his brother loves God (1 John 4:20). Likewise, since divine charity agrees with no principal vice in the mind, whenever a spiritual vice is suggested to us by the fraud of demons, we must beware the excessive speed and violent ferocity of raging horsemen. In comparison with a horseman, the blow of an archer or foot soldier is altogether feeble. But the charge of a horseman is violent with the strength of the horse, because indeed the power of the malign spirit is nothing in the contest of the elect if he is not permitted to sit upon an evil thought. Because, therefore, our enemies are exceedingly strong in battle when they are permitted to mount upon interior thoughts, a throng of horsemen is counted in the Philistine army. Ten chariots, moreover, are assigned against each elect one in battle. For we have five bodily senses through which we receive the experience of pleasure. But malign spirits, when they eagerly seek to deceive the mind through the enticements of the flesh, display to the bodily senses the appearances of things that the flesh craves, and through the appearances of those same things suggest that the mind should desire what is presented. For the adversary, as it were, raises his chariot upon its wheels when on one side he offers the enticements of things and on the other holds back the thoughts; he extends the former, he sends in the latter, and as if rolling forward he lifts himself high to assault the soul, when the malign spirit raises himself against the elect both through the enticements of things and through the craft of suggestions. There are ten chariots, therefore, because against each of our bodily senses they have the appearances of visible enticements, and against just as many senses of the soul they have the deceptive arts of persuasion.

8. But what does it mean that the remaining common crowd is said to be as numerous as the sand on the seashore, except that under the leadership of evil spirits, an innumerable throng of vices rages against us? For like a subject crowd, it follows the chariots and horsemen, when the snares of demons assail the mind by striking first: so that it may be devastated by the vices that follow, as if by the multitude of an irrational mob. And rightly in the spiritual battle of the saints, first the chariots and horsemen are described, then the multitude of the common crowd: because indeed there is no multitude, no strength of vices, if the throng of evil spirits does not precede them by arousing and sending them forth. By these words it is also suggested how cautious and circumspect the life of the saints must always be. For if the remaining crowd is compared to the abundant sand of the sea, the multitude of darts is innumerable and nearly unavoidable. For although all vices are known to the experienced faithful, yet by how many impulses they strike the heart, in what ways, or for what reasons they always come to the heart, they cannot fully know. Indeed they powerfully cast off the open darkness of temptations; but often in lighter matters they do not escape the fog of ignorance, like the fine grains of sand. They always display the strength of good works, but those who overcome great armies of horsemen with great virtue do not entirely restrain their tongue from all superfluous speech. With continual practice they direct their body in the service of almighty God; but their mind, which outwardly orders the members perfectly, sometimes by no means avoids superfluous thoughts. For what else do they then experience but the troublesome multitude of the common crowd — they who have laid low the chariots and horsemen with great virtue?

9. But the excellent doctor says: 'For those who love God, all things work together for good' (Rom. 8:28). God indeed permits His elect to be assailed by great temptations, so that they may be crowned most magnificently in the heavenly kingdom; but He permits great battles, which they may win, and stirs up light ones, in which they may fall—so that the victory of the strong may be great, and the fall harmless; so that those who fall may easily raise themselves up, and the great battles in which they stood as victors may not puff them up. For if we conquer chariots and horsemen, we ought not to be puffed up by the victory, because innumerable are the sins we commit by thinking, speaking, living, tasting, hearing, and doing. For even he could not avoid the weapons of this innumerable crowd, who said: 'In many things we all offend' (James 3:2). Hence likewise the beloved of Jesus speaks, saying: 'If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us' (1 John 1:8). Who then would dare to be puffed up as a victor, if such great men reveal that they cannot altogether escape the weapons of sins? But since these things are described in spiritual warfare, we ought not now to consider what we suffer, but how we may weaken the assault of our enemies. The multitude of the Philistines is compared to the sand, which is most abundant on the seashore, because all the power and number of vices is increased by the disturbances of the world. For the sea signifies this present age, because while it is driven by the great variety of things and times, it is disturbed as if by raging winds. But on the shore, when the driven water of the sea is poured back, innumerable tiny grains of sand are gathered together. What then is the seashore, if not the heart of each person who is negligent in spiritual life? For through the order of religious life, he is seen to stand as if on solid ground; but while he does not restrain worldly thoughts, he receives, as it were, the breaking waves of the sea upon himself, and heaps of sand; and from the very place where he does not fear to draw near to the sea, he can be driven by waves and buried in sand—because if he were to restrain worldly thoughts by the contemplation of spiritual things, he would not feel the vices of mind and body which worldly preoccupation brings in like sand and waves. Why then is the multitude of enemies said to be like sand, except because evil spirits attack the chosen athletes of Christ with the same vices by which they overcome the negligent? They come with a crowd of worldly clamor against those who have learned with their whole mind to despise the world in its pleasures. They fashion the pomp of visible things; by feigning attraction, they renew the love of the world already held in contempt, so that they may drag hearts burning with heavenly love toward harmful pleasures. But holy men, because they consider that this innumerable crowd of wicked thoughts comes forth from the deep of the world, by fleeing the world with their whole mind, avoid becoming the shores of the sea, and no longer fear so great a multitude of enemies—because while they keep themselves in inward contemplation, the crowd of vices cannot gain access to them. There follows: (Verse 5.) 'And going up, they encamped at Michmash, to the east of Beth-aven.'

10. For malign spirits to ascend is to strive for lofty things through heavenly desire in order to deceive the hearts of the saints. And it is well said: "They encamped at Magmas," because they dwell in those hearts which, elevated in the lofty love of heavenly things, do not see them. For Magmas is interpreted as "humility." But to be humbled in sacred speech is often taken as a failing of virtue. Whence also in this same history of the Kings, Tamar, daughter of King David, whom her brother Amnon is recorded to have violated, is said to have been humbled. She was indeed humbled by being corrupted, because she had stood sublime as a virgin, and when she lost the lofty summit of virginal honor, she came as it were from a high place to a flat and lowly place (2 Kings 13). Concerning the future abasement of the proud it is also said: "Everyone who exalts himself will be humbled" (Luke 14:11), because at the examination of the heavenly Judge, those fall who vainly glory in the eminence of this world. Rightly therefore are the Philistines said to pitch camp at Magmas, because through wicked counsels demons dwell in those who do not care to hold the lofty summits of virtue. For while they seek earthly things, they inhabit, as it were, flat and lowly places, where invisible enemies can easily pitch their camps. Of these enemies, indeed, it is said through the prophet: "They say to your soul: Bow down, that we may pass over" (Isaiah 51:23). For the soul standing upright is sublime, bowed down it is lowly, because through the height of virtues and through heavenly desire it is raised to lofty things; but when it falls away to vices or to love of the world, it falls to that place where the enemy, rushing in, easily tramples it. They say therefore to your soul, "Bow down, that we may pass over," because if they do not humble it to doing or thinking earthly things, they neither penetrate it with malign persuasions nor disturb it with the warfare of vices.

11. From this, therefore, we can gather how far we ought to distance ourselves from the world in deed, word, and thought. For our words, thoughts, and works are level and lowly when they are worldly. Through these indeed we are where the camps of hidden enemies are freely pitched, where we can be captured all the more easily as we are raised up by no citadel of fortification. For what faithful person is now unaware that they collect the faults of our words, thoughts, and works, and preserve them for our accusation at the coming of the future Judge? Whence also the Lord, suggesting that this lowly and despised place of Machmas must be fled by us, says: "Every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment" (Matt. 12:36). The place of the enemies is therefore called lowly, so that it may indeed suggest to us that we ought always to be exalted in word, thought, and deed. And because while the reprobate are captured in the lowly place of their more lax life, they display examples of depravity that are set forth for others to imitate, Machmas is said to be east of Beth-aven. From the east indeed we see the light of the sun rise. But the life of the reprobate, although it possesses the reality of darkness—those who nevertheless always pursue it for the vain delight of the world are indeed deceived as if by the splendor of a false light. Whence also it is said through blessed Job: "Their light shall be taken from the wicked" (Job 38:15). For now indeed the flattery of the world pleases them as something bright; but when they depart from the world, they will enter into perpetual darkness, which they believed to be light. Then they will see that it was not light, when prosperity is changed into adversity, light into darkness, laughter into grief, sweetness into the worm, beauty into deformity, honor into disgrace, flatteries into punishments and eternal torments. Because the hearts of the wicked do not now feel these things, they refuse to imitate the ways of the good; and by the example of the lost, they in no way fear to take up whatever pleases them from the world, because they imitate those who through a reprobate life have become dwelling-places of demons. Whence also they are rightly called a useless house, because they often receive the preaching of the saints, but they in no way allow the word which they hear from their mouth to dwell in them through love. They are therefore a useless house, because they do not make in themselves a fitting dwelling for God. Truth itself designates this useless house in the Gospel, saying: "Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of man has nowhere to lay his head" (Matt. 8:20). Hence again it is written: "The Holy Spirit of discipline will flee from the deceitful, and will not dwell in a body subject to sins" (Wis. 1:5). Well therefore is the useless house said to have Machmas on its eastern side, because those who spurn the preaching of the saints rejoice in the example of the reprobate who seek the lowest and earthly things, as if in the rising of a great light. But while the conduct of the wicked is demonstrated through the mysteries of sacred history speaking, how cautious the life of the saints is, is subsequently shown. For there follows: (Verse 6) "When the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait, the people were afflicted, and they hid themselves in caves, and in thickets, in rocks also, and in dens, and in cisterns."
