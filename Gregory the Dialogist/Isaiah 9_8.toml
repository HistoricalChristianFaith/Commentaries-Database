Jacob is called the destroyer, but Israel the one who sees God. Does not Jacob symbolize the Jews? And what does Israel represent, if not the people of the Gentiles? The latter, whom Jacob strove to destroy by bodily death, have surely come to see God with the eyes of faith. The word sent to Jacob fell on Israel, therefore, because the one whom the Jews rejected when he came to them has now been discovered and believed by the Gentiles.
