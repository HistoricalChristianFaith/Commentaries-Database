And because in the knowledge of the Holy Trinity hearers advance from the word of preaching in love of the same Trinity, this same gate has three chambers on one side and three on the other, because everything that the Creator speaks concerning the Trinity through the New Testament, He also shows from the Old Testament. And the heart of hearers advances in love of the heavenly fatherland, so that the soul clinging to God may sit as a bride with the bridegroom in a certain chamber already, and turn itself completely away from earthly desires.

Or certainly, as was said far above, because there are three orders of those living well, namely of the good married, the continent, and the preachers, and because some even placed in marriages long for the heavenly fatherland with love, while others through hope of eternal joy even mortify the flesh, and flee all earthly activities, and scorn to be entangled in the care of this world, while others both despise earthly goods and preach the heavenly joys which they have come to know, what are these if not chambers in the spiritual building, in whose thought and meditation the soul is joined to the heavenly spouse? Because the Church from the Gentiles not only has these three orders of the good, but also the Synagogue once had them, while a great multitude of spiritual persons ardently awaited the grace of the Redeemer, the gate of the heavenly building has three chambers on this side and three on that side, because every preacher, when he summons his hearer to the heavenly fatherland, demonstrates that both new and old fathers longed with heavenly desire. For examples often pierce more than words of reasoning; and when the preacher says what kind of persons others were in marriage, or in continence, or in preaching regarding love of almighty God in the New Testament, or what kind others were in the Old, the gate which speaks shows that it has three chambers on each side. This gate also has a front, because there are in the preacher's life open works which are seen. It also has a vestibule before the front, because before he introduces good works, he preaches faith, through which the soul coming humbly may be lifted up to the height of good actions. All of which are according to the measure of the former gate, according to what is added: "That he measured its length at fifty cubits, and its width at twenty-five cubits."

You remember that I have said these things more extensively above. For we said that rest is signified by the number fifty, because the fiftieth year was given to the ancient people for rest, since it was called the jubilee; and the number seven, through which this entire time unfolds, multiplied seven times leads to forty-nine. To this a unit is added, because eternal rest is perfected in the contemplation of the One. Therefore the same number fifty is for us in length, because one cannot arrive at that rest unless one can now patiently extend one's hope toward it. For since we are called to eternal rest through the number fifty, this also instructs us completely: that in the tabernacle ten curtains were commanded to be made, which would have fifty loops each, and fifty golden rings on the side and at the top. For the curtains of the tabernacle are all the saints who advance in the adornment of Holy Church from the diverse colors of virtues. They both veil the interior things and adorn the exterior things in every way, because their life, insofar as it is seen, is an ornament; and their understanding is hidden within, while the heavenly things which they keep in mind and cannot express are in some way veiled in them. Rightly there are ten curtains, because through the keeping of the Decalogue the very hearts of the saints have progressed. The hyacinth-colored loops of the curtains were commanded to be made fifty in number. Hyacinth has the appearance of the sky. Therefore the loops of the curtains are the heavenly precepts, by which souls are bound, so that lifted up from lower things they may hang above. These loops indeed have golden rings, namely understanding shining with true wisdom. This understanding, because it ought to be circumspect in all things and fortified by the vigilance of cautious solicitude, is rightly designated by rings.

And it should be noted that loops or rings are commanded to be made on the side and at the top of the curtains, because heavenly precepts and spiritual understanding ought not only to suspend us upward in the love of God, but also to unite us with our neighbor in charity. For in that we love our Creator, we hang in the air, as it were, by the upper loops. But in that we love our neighbors as ourselves, we have loops and rings on the side, so that the curtains of the tabernacle, that is, the souls of the faithful, may be joined together through charity and not divided through discord. Hence here also, after the length of fifty cubits, the width of twenty-five cubits is immediately added, which width indeed pertains to love of neighbor. For it expands itself into love of the brethren and exercises toward them every good work that it can. Moreover, all the good works that are done bodily are performed through the five senses of the body, namely through sight, hearing, touch, taste, and smell. The number five multiplied by itself arrives at twenty-five, because good works, when they have begun to be done, stir up the mind through fervor to increase, and are multiplied through themselves. Hence they also create breadth for the mind, so that it may not be narrow through lukewarmness, but expanded in good actions through charity. For all sluggishness of lukewarmness is narrowness, but all kindness of charity is great breadth. For even if resources are lacking that might perhaps be offered to a needy neighbor, the substance of good will is ample, which suffices for the reward of the kingdom, as it is written: "On earth peace to men of good will."
