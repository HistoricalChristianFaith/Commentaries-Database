Here is what Isaiah deeply deplored by saying, “We all have fallen like leaves, and our sins have carried us off like the wind.” … But the righteous are able, through innocence they have received, to ward off the charges of the present accusation, but they are not strong enough in their own strength to drive out the bonds of death that result.… The Redeemer of the human race, who became the mediator of God and humanity through the flesh, … alone showed himself righteous among people, yet he received the punishment of blame without blame. He convicted humanity lest it get worse and stood before God lest he smite; he offered examples of innocence and took the punishment for evil.
