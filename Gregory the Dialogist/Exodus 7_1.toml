And there are some who so dominate all vices and all desires within themselves that by the very right of their purity they are called gods among men; whence also it is said to Moses: "Behold, I have made you a god to Pharaoh." Where then do these run except among the numbers of Dominations? For since that heavenly city consists of angels and men, to which we believe the human race ascends in such number as equals the elect angels who remained there, we too ought to draw something from those distinctions of the heavenly citizens for the use of our own way of life, and inflame ourselves with good pursuits toward growth in virtues. For the different ways of life of men correspond distinctly to the orders of individual hosts, and they are assigned to their lot through similarity of life.
