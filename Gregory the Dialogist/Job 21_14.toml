50.  To say this in words even foolish men have not the boldness, yet all wicked persons say to God, not by their words but by their ways, Depart from us.  For they that do those things which Almighty God forbids, what else are they doing but shutting up their soul against the Almighty.  For just as to think of His precepts, is to introduce Him into one’s self, so to resist His commandments is to keep Him away from the dwelling-place of the heart.  And so they say, Depart from us, who refuse to yield Him an approach to them; and assail Him with wicked deeds, even if they seem to praise Him in words.  Moreover they say;
For we desire not the knowledge of Thy ways.
51.  And that by this alone, that they are too indifferent to acquire the knowledge of Him.  For there be some who from this that ‘Truth’ saith; And that servant, which knoweth not his Lord’s will, and doth things worthy of stripes, shall be beaten with few.  But he that knoweth his Lord’s will, and did not according to it, shall be beaten with many [Luke 12, 47. 48.]; choose not to know what they should do, and reckon as if they will be beaten less, if they are ignorant of what they ought to have put in practice.  Yet it is one thing not to have known, and another thing not to have chosen to know.  For he knoweth not, who is willing to make the acquisition, but is not able.  But he who, that he may not know, turns away his ear from the voice of truth, such a person is brought in, not one in ignorance, but a despiser.  Now ‘the way’ of God is peace, ‘the way’ of God is humility, ‘the way’ of God is patience.  But whilst the wicked disregard all these, they say, We desire not the knowledge of Thy ways.  For whilst they are big with pride in this life, whilst they are swollen with honours, whilst, even if they have not, they covet, they slight ‘the ways’ of God in the thoughts of their hearts.  For because God’s way in this world was humility, this very Lord and God, the Redeemer of us men, came to reproaches, to mockery, to the Passion; and He underwent the adverse treatment of this world with patience, resolutely eschewed its good fortune, that He might both teach the prosperity of the eternal life to be aimed at, and the adversities of the present life not to be dreaded.  But because the wicked covet the glory of the present life, and eschew disgrace, they are described as saying, We desire not the knowledge of Thy ways.  For they are unwilling to know, what they scorn to do.  Whose words are further continued.
