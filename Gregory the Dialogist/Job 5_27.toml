63.  Assuredly it is clear, that in these words he says nothing upon a view of the surface, in that a thing, that is ‘searched,’ is not set before the face.  He then, who shows that he had ‘searched’ these things, proves that in outward words inward things were what he had in view.  And after the whole he is brought to the foolishness of boasting, in that he thereupon adds;

64.  With whatever lessons of instruction the mind may be furnished, it argues great want of skill to wish to instruct one that is superior, whence the very things which are rightly delivered by the friends, are not pronounced right by the interior Judge.  For they lose the efficacy of their rightness herein, that they are not suited to the hearer.  For even medicines lose their efficacious properties when they be administered to sound limbs.  In all, then, that is said, it is necessary that the occasion, the time, and the individual, be taken into account, whether the truth of the sentiment confirms the words delivered, whether the fitting time calls for it, whether the character of the person does not impugn both the truth of the sentiment, and the suitableness of the time.  For he launches his darts in a manner to deserve praise, who first looks at the enemy that he is to strike.  For he masters the horns of the strong bow amiss, who in sending the arrow with force, strikes a fellowcountryman.
