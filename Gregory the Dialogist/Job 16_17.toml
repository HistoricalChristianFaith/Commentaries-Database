25.  He suffered without the wickedness of His hand; Who did no sin, neither was guile found in His mouth, [1 Pet. 2, 22] and yet endured the pain of the Cross for our redemption.  Who only above all others ‘made pure prayers to God,’ in that even in the very anguish of His Passion He prayed in behalf of His persecutors, saying, Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do. [Luke 23, 24]  For what can be described, what can be conceived more pure in prayer, than when the mercifulness of intercession is vouchsafed even those, from whose hands pain is undergone?  Whence it was brought to pass, that that Blood of our Redeemer, which His persecutors in raging had spilt, afterwards in believing they drank, and proclaimed Him to be the Son of God.
