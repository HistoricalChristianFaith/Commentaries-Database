20.  In her weak members Holy Church is ‘broken with breach upon breach,’ when sin is added to sin, that transgression should be brought to a more dreadful pitch.  Thus for him, whom avarice forces to robbery and robbery leads into deceit, so that the sin committed is further defended by falsehood, how else is it with this man, but that he is broken with breach upon breach?  When too it is well said by the Prophet; Cursing, and lying, and killing, and stealing, adultery, have overflowed, and blood toucheth blood.  [Hos. 4, 2]  For by the title of ‘blood’ sin is used to be denoted; whence one who longs to be set free from sin exclaims in penitence, Deliver me from blood [sanguinibus]. [Ps. 51, 14]  So ‘blood toucheth blood,’ when sin has heaped on sin; and whereas when breach is added to breach, the powers of our old enemy are the more terribly increased against us, it is rightly added;
He runneth upon me like a giant.
21.  The enemy is easy to be resisted, if he is not consented to, whether in many backslidings, or in one for a continuance.  But if the soul has been accustomed to submit to his persuasions, the oftener it subjects itself to him, it makes him the harder to itself to bear, so that it has not the power to struggle against him; in that our wicked adversary, ‘like a giant,’ fights against it, when it is vanquished by bad habit: yet very often Holy Church, even after sins have been committed, brings back the minds of the faithful to penitence, and cleanses away the sins of practice by the efficacy of a voluntary self-chastening.

22.  What ought to be understood by ‘sackcloth and ashes,’ but penance; what by ‘the skin’ and ‘the flesh,’ but sin of the flesh?  And so whereas there are persons who after the backsliding of the flesh are brought back to penance, it is as if ‘sackcloth were sewn upon the skin,’ and ‘the flesh covered with ashes;’ because the guilt of the flesh is ‘covered with ashes’ by penance, that it should not be seen for its avenging in the inquest of the strict Judge.  But Holy Church, when she withdraws her weak members from sins, and conducts them to the remedy of penance, these she surely aids with her tears, that they may recover strength to receive the grace of their Maker, and in the strong she bewails what she has not done, which yet in her weak members she has as it were done herself.
