Four tables on this side, and four tables on that side, by the sides of the gate.

But let it be said: Four tables on this side, and four tables on that side by the sides of the gate. For while faith and life, doctrine and prophecy are kept in the minds of the good, our gate, that is the understanding of sacred speech, has four tables on its side. And when holy preaching maintains patience and kindness in progressing peoples, which previously kept circumcision and sacrifice in carnal ones, four tables are shown as if from the other side as well. All of which together make eight for immolation, namely four interior ones for the holocaust, but four exterior ones for the sacrifice, because both those who in the holy Church keep faith, life, patience and kindness, undoubtedly now excel in the highest virtues; and those who in the synagogue knew doctrine and prophecy, circumcision and sacrifice, by offering some things and retaining other things for themselves, gave the victim of their devotion to the almighty Lord.
