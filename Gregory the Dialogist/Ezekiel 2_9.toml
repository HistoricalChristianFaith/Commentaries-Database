As the order of preachers is signified by the prophet, so the pages of holy Scripture are meant by the book that he received. For the rolled book is the obscure speech of holy Scripture, which is enveloped in a profundity of sayings so that it is not easily penetrated by the understanding of all. But the book is spread out before the prophet because the obscurity of holy Scripture is opened for the preachers.
