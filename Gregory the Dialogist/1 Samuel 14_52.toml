Such men, because they profitably stand over the chosen faithful, because they mightily advance their subjects to victories of virtues, it follows: "And there was fierce war against the Philistines all the days of Saul."

The war of those teachers is weak and altogether feeble who have neither the light of divine knowledge nor the strength of good work. Therefore war is called powerful when harsh sons rule over the chosen peoples, because he is able to speak good things profitably to others who has been accustomed to precede his words with great deeds. But we must also subtly consider what is said in a more complex way: 'All the days of Saul'. What are the days of Saul, if not works of light? What is the war of a teacher other than what is waged by the tongue? Therefore he fights all his days who teaches others many things, yet puts forth nothing in his teaching except what first shines forth in his own work. For he fights in his own day who draws the words of preaching from the light of his own virtue. He therefore wishes to fight in another's day who strives to oppose wicked spirits not by speaking what he does, but by preaching what he knows. But he fights all his days, because he displays all the commandments of God in the light of his work, which he then wishes to set forth through the care of preaching. Rightly therefore is the war called powerful in which one fights with every kind of light of virtues and works. It can also be that by the statement that he fights all his days, the urgency of spiritual combat is signified. For he who leads a life full of virtues lives in days. Therefore the powerful war of the chosen teacher is recognized in all his days, because he is always seen to overcome evil spirits who is never separated from the light of virtues. But chosen men have the virtue of fighting and also the humility of fear. Through virtue they triumph, but through fear they do not cease to gather reinforcements. Hence they fight all the more bravely, the more they do not stop gathering forces for the conflict. Rightly therefore the cause of the powerful war is added: 'For whomever Saul saw to be a strong man and fit for battle, he joined him to himself.'

As if to say: He was able to wage war powerfully for this reason, because he did not cease to gather an army. But since he is said to have allied to himself not only strong men but also those fit for battle, the prudent teacher is shown in choosing Christ's soldiers. For some are strong for bearing burdens, not for waging battles, because when they do not know how to fight from their own strength, they are utterly unable to do so. Therefore men who are strong and fit for battle are those who know how to fight and are willing. By their will they are indeed strong, and by their knowledge they are fit for fighting. The recklessness of some is therefore repelled from Christ's war, since those chosen are remembered as both fit and strong. For some know how to fight against the devil but are unwilling. They are indeed wise to do evil, but they do not know how to do good (Jer. 4:22). These wish to serve the ancient enemy; they refuse to resist him. For what would a teacher accomplish if he allied such men, fit for battle, to himself? Such men are more able to destroy others by their examples than the teacher himself is able to build up by his word. For often such men even dare to teach, yet they do not maintain the power of teaching by their practice. When they speak with us, they rush against the enemies, but through their deeds they suddenly turn their weapons into our own bowels. Like certain traitors in an army, they put on the armor of Christian doctrine, and by their examples they suddenly strike the little ones of Christ whom we thought they wished to protect by their speaking. Therefore strong men who are not fit must be repelled, not allied to us, because through wise but reprobate men our strength is destroyed, not increased. Who then are those who are strong but not fit, except those whom we see bearing the burdens of the world bravely, yet not knowing how to transfer their strength into the service of their Creator? For they bear the yoke of men and the great labors of the world bravely, but they are afraid to approach the service of God as though they were weak. What then are these, if not strong yet not fit — those who accomplish great things of the world yet cannot perform the light and gentle tasks of Christ? Often they are even converted in monasteries, and those who had bravely borne the burdens of the world sweat over the small tasks they perform as though amid great labors. What then is shown by these words, except that we should ally men to Christ's service with great discernment, and not grant entrance to those approaching before we know them to be both fit through knowledge and strong through good will? Moreover, the reason they can be called men strong and fit for battle is that they follow up the wars against Amalek, that is, the wars against lusts. For those who cannot extinguish carnal desires are not strong men. And those who are not fit for fighting on behalf of chastity do not appear fit for battle. Let the teacher therefore choose Christ's soldiers; let him choose strong men, so that while they bravely subdue the flesh, they may powerfully conquer the unclean spirits. Let him therefore choose men fit for battle, so that while they do not grow proud amid the gifts of their strength, they may be exalted in heavenly places by the glory of triumph.
