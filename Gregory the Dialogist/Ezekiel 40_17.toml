After the prophet, introducing oblique windows concerning the grace of contemplation, spoke many things, he says he was led outside, and recalls having seen treasuries. In these treasuries, what else is designated but the knowledge of teachers? But rightly in this matter it can be asked, since holy teachers teach spiritual and internal things, why does the prophet say he was led outside, and saw treasuries outside? But it must be known that contemplation is one thing, which sees only as much as it is unable to speak, while knowledge and doctrine are another thing, which sees only as much as it can express through the tongue. For in comparison with that light which cannot be expressed by voice, almost all that can be expressed by voice is as if outside.

Because in the Greek language φυλάττειν means "to keep," and in the Persian language treasures are called gazae, the place where riches are kept is customarily called a treasury. What therefore is designated by treasuries, except, as we said before, the hearts of teachers filled with the riches of wisdom and knowledge? Because, according to Paul's words: "To one is given through the Spirit the word of wisdom, to another the word of knowledge in the same Spirit." For there are some who through the gift of grace understand even those things which they have not heard expounded by teachers; these clearly have received the word of wisdom. And there are some who cannot understand by themselves what they have heard, but retain those things which they have read in commentators, and knowledgeably bring forth what they have learned by reading. From what then are these filled except with the word of knowledge? Although this can also be understood in another way, because wisdom pertains to life, while knowledge pertains to teaching. Therefore whoever lives well and preaches prudently is rightly called a treasury of spiritual building, because heavenly riches are dispensed from his mouth. The same teacher of the Gentiles had seen that the disciples abounded in these riches when he said: "You have been made rich in Him, in all speech and all knowledge." Therefore treasuries have been built in the edifice of the holy Church, because the tongue of teachers abounds with the riches of knowledge. That these are true riches, Truth Himself declares on His own authority, when He says of transitory riches: "The deceitfulness of riches chokes the word." For wisdom and knowledge of spiritual teaching are true riches, in comparison with which those that can pass away are called false. Concerning these riches it is said through Solomon: "A desirable treasure rests in the mouth of the wise." But apart from the fact that spiritual riches lead to the eternal homeland, there is a great difference between them and earthly riches, because spiritual riches increase when distributed, while earthly riches either are distributed and diminish, or are retained and are not useful. Therefore those who contain these true riches within themselves are rightly called treasuries.

And these treasuries have a pavement all around, because the humility of the hearers clings to and lies beneath them. This pavement is rightly said to be paved with stone in the court, because in the breadth of charity the souls of the faithful are joined to one another. They are called stones in the strength of faith, and they are laid in the pavement in the bond of humility. The apostle Peter had beheld these minds of the faithful as strong in faith when he said: "And you, like living stones, are being built up as a spiritual house." Concerning these stones of the holy Church, the Lord says through Isaiah: "I will make your ramparts of jasper, and your gates of carved stones, all your borders of desirable stones, all your children taught by the Lord." For Almighty God placed jasper, which is a green-colored stone, as the ramparts of the holy Church, because He strengthened the minds of her preachers with the love of inner greenness, so that they might despise all transitory things, desire nothing in this world which is enclosed by an end, and scorn all its joys as withered. Hence also the shepherd of the Church himself, calling his hearers to the pastures of eternal greenness, speaks of God, saying: "According to His great mercy, He has regenerated us into a living hope, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, into an inheritance incorruptible and undefiled and unfading, reserved in heaven."

The gates of this holy Church are set upon carved stones, because those through whose voice we enter into eternal life, while they displayed in themselves the holy works that are divinely commanded, held them as if carved within themselves. For the gates would be uncarved but plain if they merely uttered words but did not demonstrate holy works in themselves. But when they show themselves to live according to what they speak, they are both gates, because they lead within, and carved, because by living they preserve what they speak to others. We see all the borders of this holy Church set in precious stones, when we behold in it all the faithful who are strong in faith and charity. To demonstrate what stones he meant, he added: "All your children taught by the Lord." Therefore what Isaiah saw—that all the borders of the Church were precious stones—this Ezekiel declared to be a pavement paved with stone round about, because he further adds concerning the treasuries: "Thirty treasuries in the circuit of the pavement."

The number ten is always taken for perfection, because observance is contained in the ten precepts of the law. For the active and contemplative life are joined together in the commandments of the Decalogue, because in it both love of God and love of neighbor are commanded to be kept. Indeed, love of God pertains to the contemplative life, while love of neighbor pertains to the active. But every teacher, in order to extend himself fully into the active life and rise vigilantly into the contemplative, ought to be perfect in faith in the Holy Trinity. Hence these same treasuries are also mentioned as being thirty, so that when ten is multiplied by three, the life and tongue of the teacher may be established in the Trinity.
