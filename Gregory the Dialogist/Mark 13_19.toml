Hence we must also consider that these tribulations differ from that final tribulation as much as the person of a herald differs from the power of the judge. Therefore, dearest brothers, think upon that day with all your attention, correct your life, change your ways, overcome evil temptations by resisting them, and punish sins committed with tears. For you will one day behold the coming of the eternal judge with as much greater security as you now anticipate his severity by fearing it.
