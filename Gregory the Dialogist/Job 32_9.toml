14. As far as regards the literal meaning, Eliu proves to us, when he speaks, how proudly he remained silent. For when he says, For I waited for your words, and I was thinking that ye would say something, he plainly shows that he remained silent, while the aged were speaking, rather with the desire of judging, than with the wish of learning from them. Though these expressions are even a better description of the conduct of proud men, who, when at length brought within Holy Church, are accustomed on looking at her opponents, to consider not so much the years of their age, as the intention of their words. For however older the heretics may be than these same haughty men, they boldly overbear those persons in whose words they reprove false doctrine.
