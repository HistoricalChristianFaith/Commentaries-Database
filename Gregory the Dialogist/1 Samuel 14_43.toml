For what is it that the captive is interrogated, except because faults which seem to have been detected by signs or conjectures are not yet to be struck? For it is as though the wound is already held, but it is still covered. Let it therefore be uncovered, so that it may be able to be healed and cured. He must indeed be compelled or admonished to confess the fault which is already perceived as if openly. He therefore says: "Show me what you have done," because a crime which is known by certain open indications is not to be judged before it is most openly demonstrated. And because it belongs to the elect to sin and come to their senses, to commit faults and to uncover those committed by confessing them, there follows: And Jonathan showed him and said: "Tasting I tasted a little honey with the tip of the rod that was in my hand, and behold I die."

What does it mean that he says: "Tasting I tasted"? Why did he not say above: "Tasting I tasted a little of this honey," when he said: "You have seen that my eyes were enlightened, because I tasted a little of this honey"? But certain people, when they confess their sins, diminish them with certain words, while they show that they did not commit them with their whole heart. On the contrary, however, when the elect accuse themselves of the smallest things, they pronounce them not as small, but as great. What does it mean to say: "Tasting I tasted," except: I carried out the sin outwardly, I fulfilled it with a great burning of desire? And what does it mean to say after the confession of sin, "I die," except to drive death away from oneself by repenting and confessing, and to fear it once driven away? This indeed is properly characteristic of the elect, who abandon their sins and yet fear them as though they were not abandoned. And indeed they blot them out with pure confessions and the harsh torments of penance, but they vehemently fear them as though they were not blotted out. But what does it mean that he says: "On the tip of the rod"? — except that when we pursue our sins by confessing, we ought not to bring forth falsehood against ourselves. Sin indeed must be revealed in confession, but it must not be enlarged by lying. It ought to be such in confession as it was in deed. Therefore, so that the burning of desire may be well revealed, he says: "Tasting I tasted"; and so that its quality may appear, it is added: "On the tip of the rod," as if to say: Boldly inflamed I did it, but this is what I did. And because it is the son of the king who confesses, he says: "Which was in my hand." The rod of Jonathan signifies the teaching and discipline of the preacher. It is held in the hand when one not only teaches, but practices by doing what one teaches. What then does it mean that he says: "Which was," not "Which is in my hand"? — except that he suggests the estimation of the elect, who even when they commit evil deeds, judge themselves unworthy of the ministry of preaching. He says therefore: "On the tip of the rod, which was in my hand." As if to say: I sinned in pride over that very thing by which, in sinning, I made myself unworthy. It was therefore in my hand, and is not, because even if I once practiced what I taught, what I held by practicing I lost by being proud. Now therefore, struck with fear, he says: "Behold, I die."
