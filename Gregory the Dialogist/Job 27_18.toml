27.  ‘The moth builds a house’ for itself by corrupting.  Nor could the heretic have been shown by a better comparison, who makes a dwelling for his misbelief no where else save in the minds which he has corrupted, who also engages for his followers to be free from everlasting fire.  For he pledges to them ‘the refreshment of eternal rest, but his words ‘have no solidity, because they lack the fulness of truth.  Whence it is added, And as the keeper he maketh a booth.  For’ the booth of the keeper’ is not set firm by any foundation, but the time passing it is directly destroyed.  And the rest promised by heretics is destroyed together with the time, in that after this life it is not found at all.  And because oftentimes Heretics in contempt of the Church Universal are supported by the patronage of the powerful ones of the world, and the rich do not cease to aid them with all the countenance of active agency that they are empowered with, that identical person also, whoever he be, that is made to swell against the face of his Maker by temporal good things, is now touched by the sentence of the holy man, and from the particular ruin of heretics, the discourse is drawn off to a general characterizing of all the self-exalted.
