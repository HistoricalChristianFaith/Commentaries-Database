For death indeed climbs in through the windows and enters houses, in that through the body’s sense lust comes and enters the dwelling of the mind. Quite to the contrary is this which we have often cited from Isaiah concerning the righteous: “Who are they who fly like clouds and like doves come to their windows?” The righteous are said to be like clouds since they are raised above earthly contagions, just as doves go to their own windows, since each one does not pay much attention to their exterior senses, and fleshly lust does not catch them when they are far from home.… For the holy person who receiving the senses of his body like servants to help him is in control of them; and the fairest judge sees sins before they come and closes the windows to the plundering death of the body, saying, “I have made a covenant with my eyes, that I should not gaze at a young woman.”
