87.  In that assuredly when the Strict One appeareth in the Judgment, He will at once lift up the despisedness of the simple by glorifying them, and break in pieces the greatness of the evil-minded [malignorum] by condemning them.  For hypocrites are called evil-minded, who do good acts but not well, and practise every thing right only in eagerness after praise.  Now anyone, to whom we stretch out our hand, we plainly lift up from below.  Thus God does not stretch out His hand to the evil-minded, in that all that seek earthly glory He leaves below, and how right soever the things that they do may seem to be, He doth not advance them to the joys above.  Or, as may well be, hypocrites are for this reason called evil-minded, because they make a shew of being wellminded toward their neighbours, and cover over the arts of their wicked designs.  For in all that they either do or say, they shew simplicity externally, but they are inwardly conceiving in the subtleties of double-mindedness; they counterfeit purity on the outside, but they conceal an evil heart at all times under the semblance of purity.  In respect of whom it is well spoken by Moses, Thou shalt not wear a garment woven of woollen and linen together. [Deut. 22, 11]  For by ‘woollen’ is denoted simplicity, by ‘linen’ subtlety.  And it is the fact that a garment made of ‘wool and linen’ hides the linen within and shews the wool on the outside.  And so he ‘puts on a garment of woollen and linen together,’ who in the mode of speech or behaviour that he adopts conceals within the artfulness of an evil purpose, and exhibits without the simplicity of an innocent mind.  For whereas it is impossible to detect craftiness under the semblance of purity, it is as if linen were hidden under the thickness of wool.  But after the condemnation of the double-minded, the recompensing of the righteous is duly exhibited.
