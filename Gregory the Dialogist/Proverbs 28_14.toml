You ought not, in this life, to have security, whereby you may be rendered careless. For it is written, “Happy is the one who always fears [the Lord].” And again, it is written, “Serve the Lord in fear, and rejoice in him with trembling.” In short, then, it must be that in the time of this life trembling will possess your soul, to the end that it may hereafter rejoice without end through the joy of security.
