Thou oughtest not, then, in this life to have security, whereby thou mayest be rendered careless. For it is written, "Happy is the man that is always afraid." And again it is written, "Serve the Lord in fear, and rejoice unto him with trembling." In short, then, it must needs be that in the time of this life trembling possess your soul, to the end that it may hereafter rejoice without end through the joy of security.
