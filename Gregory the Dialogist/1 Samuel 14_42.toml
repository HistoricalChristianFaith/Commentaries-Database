Those who cast lots often discover hidden things through conjectures drawn from visible things. Thus indeed Jonah is identified while fleeing (Jon. 1); thus Matthias the Apostle is found worthy of apostolic eminence (Acts 1). We therefore cast spiritual lots when, through the outward signs of works, we arrive at knowledge of hidden things. For the lot of each person is his own manner of life. Hence in Wisdom the wicked say: "Let us crown ourselves with roses before they wither; let no meadow be left untouched by our luxury; let us leave signs of our merriment everywhere, for this is our portion and this is our lot" (Wis. 2:8). But on the contrary, the Psalmist prays, saying: "Let my portion, O Lord, be in the land of the living" (Ps. 141:6). Paul also declares the same, saying: "Our manner of life is in heaven" (Phil. 3:20). The teacher therefore holds, as it were, the lots of each individual when he observes the manner of life of each one. And when the fault is known but the person of the guilty one is not known, he casts lots, as it were, when he compares the nature of the crime to the person of the negligent one. And perhaps he discovers the fault when, by a certain sign of conjecture, he arrives at the evident truth of the crime. He who does not know both the strength and the weakness of the faithful committed to him presides negligently indeed. For he ought to know the strong among his subjects — for which virtues they are suited, and by which vices the weak are prone through the negligence of their neighbor. He ought to know what devotion to virtues stirs these, and what character of vices disturbs the negligence of those. He therefore holds, as it were, the lots of each in outward things, when he foresees by which vices the latter can be overwhelmed and by which virtues the former can be exalted. Therefore, once the cause is known, he imprints marks upon the lots, as it were, when we ascribe the stain of an evident fault to the manner of life of the one who, through negligence, previously appeared inclined and close to perpetrating that very crime. But let this conjecture be held for the purpose of investigating the truth, not for the certainty of an established case.
