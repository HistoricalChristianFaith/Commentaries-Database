92.  He shows himself to live with good heed and circumspection, who, in considering the shortness of the present life does not look to the furtherance but to the ending of it, so as to gather from the end, that all is nought that delights while it is passing.  For hence it is said by Solomon, But if a man live many years and rejoice in them all, yet let him remember the time of darkness, and the days that shall be many; and when they come, the past shall be convinced of vanity. [Eccles. 11, 8]  Hence again it is written, Whatsoever thou takest in hand, remember thine end, and thou shalt never do amiss. [Ecclus. 7, 36]  Therefore when sin tempts the mind, it is requisite that the soul should regard the shortness of its gratification, lest iniquity hurry it on to a living death, when it is plain that a mortal life is quickly speeding to an end.  But often the eye of our contemplation is bewildered, while our pain is heightened by thickening scourges.  It is good to bewail the exile of the present life, yet for mere anguish alone the mind cannot take account of the ills of its blind state.  Hence he directly adds,
And let me go, that I may bewail my sorrow a little.
93.  For as moderate distress gives vent to tears, so excessive sorrow checks them, since that grief itself is as it were made void of grief, which by swallowing up the mind of the person afflicted, takes away the sense of grief.  Therefore the holy man shrinks from being stricken more than he is equal to bear, saying, And let me go, that I may bewail my sorrow a little.  As if it were in plain words, ‘Qualify the strokes of Thy scourging, that, my pains being made moderate, in weeping I may have power to estimate the miseries I endure.’ Which same nevertheless may likewise be understood in another sense.  For oftentimes the sinner is so bound by the chains of his wickedness, that he bears indeed the burthen of his sins, and knows not that he is bearing it.  Often if he does know with what an amount of guilt he is burthened, he strives to break loose and cannot, so as to hunt it down in himself with free spirit and full conversion.  Thus he is unable to ‘bewail his sorrow,’ for at once he sees the guilt of his sinful state, and by reason of the weight of earthly business, is not at liberty to bewail it.  He is unable to ‘bewail his sorrow,’ who strives indeed to resist evil habits, yet is weighed down by the still increasing desires of the flesh.  The presence of this sorrow had inflicted anguish upon the spirit of the Prophet, when he said, My sorrow is continually before me; for I will declare my iniquity, I will be sorry for my sin; [Ps. 38, 17. 18.] but the bands of his sin being loosed, he knew that he was ‘let go,’ who gave vent to his exultation, saying, Thou hast loosed my bonds, I will offer to Thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving. [Ps. 116, 16. 17.]
94.  Therefore God then ‘lets us go’ to bewail our sorrow, when He both shows us the evil things that we have done, and helps us to bewail the same, when we know them; He sets our transgressions before our eyes, and with the pitying hand of grace unlooses the bands of the heart, that our soul may lift itself up to liberty for the work of repentance, and loosed from the fetters of the flesh, may with free spirit stretch out towards its Maker the footsteps of love.  For it very commonly happens that we the same persons blame our course of life, and yet readily do the very thing that we justly condemn in ourselves.  The spirit lifts us up to righteousness, the flesh holds us back to habit; the soul struggles against self-love, but quickly overcome with delight is made captive.  Thus it is well said, Let me go that I may bewail my sorrow a little.  For except we be ‘let go’ in mercy from the guilt of sin, with which we are tied and bound, we cannot lament that which we grieve for in ourselves being set against ourselves.  But the woe of our guiltiness is then really bewailed, when that dark retribution of the place below is fore-reckoned with lively apprehension.
