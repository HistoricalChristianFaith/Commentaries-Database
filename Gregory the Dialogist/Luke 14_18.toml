But what are we to do, we who see that what follows still happens among many? "And they all began at once to make excuse." God offers what ought to have been asked for; He wishes to give unasked what could scarcely have been hoped for even if He had deigned to grant it when asked, yet He is despised; He announces that the delights of eternal refreshment are prepared, and yet all together make excuse. Let us place before the eyes of our mind the least things, that we may be able to worthily weigh the greater. If some powerful man were to send to invite any poor person, what, brothers, I ask, what would that poor man do, except rejoice at that very invitation of his, give a humble response, change his garment, hasten to go as quickly as possible, lest another arrive at the banquet of the powerful man before him? Therefore a rich man invites, and a poor man hastens to come; we are invited to God's banquet, and we make excuses. But behold, amid these things I can estimate what your hearts answer to themselves. For perhaps in secret thoughts they say to themselves: We do not wish to make excuse, for we rejoice both to be called and to arrive at that banquet of heavenly refreshment.

Those who speak such things to you, their minds speak truth, if they do not love earthly things more than heavenly, if they are not occupied more with bodily matters than with spiritual. Hence here also the very cause of those making excuses is added, when it is immediately brought in: The first said: I have bought a farm, and I must go out and see it; I pray you, have me excused. What is designated by the farm except earthly substance? He went out therefore to see the farm who thinks only of external things on account of his substance.
