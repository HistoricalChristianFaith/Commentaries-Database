Concerning “the exhortation of the captains and the howling of the army,” the tempting vices that fight against us in invisible contest in behalf of the pride that reigns over them, some of them go first, like captains, others follow, after the manner of an army. For all faults do not occupy the heart with equal access. But while the greater and the few surprise a neglected mind, the smaller and the numberless pour themselves upon it in a whole body. For when pride, the queen of sins, has fully possessed a conquered heart, she surrenders it immediately to the seven principal sins, as if to some of her generals, to lay it waste. And an army in truth follows these generals, because doubtless there spring up from them importunate hosts of sins. - "Morals on the Book of Job 31.87"

84. For their own good fortune has more fatally over-thrown many, and a long-continued peace has rendered many slothful; and the unexpected enemy has struck them the more heavily, the more he has found them careless, from being long used to quiet. Whence holy men, when they observe that they are advancing in great prosperity of virtues, rejoice that they are exercised also with temptations, by a kind of adjustment of heavenly dispensation; because they guard the more firmly the glory received in their virtues, the more humbly they acknowledge their own infirmity, from being assaulted with the shock of temptation. The horse, therefore, says, ‘Vah,’ when he has heard the trumpet, because, namely, the warrior of God, when he beholds the force of temptation pressing on him, considering the benefit of the heavenly dispensation, is more firmly confident, from his very adversity. And the assaults of this adversity therefore do not overcome him, because they never attack him unexpectedly. For he marks long beforehand, from each circumstance, of what vice the assault is coming on. Whence it also follows;
He smelleth the battle afar off.
85. For, to ‘smell the battle afar off,’ is to discern from preceding causes, what contests of vices succeed. For because, (as has been already frequently said,) a thing which is not seen, is discerned by its smell, to smell the battle afar off is to search out lurking wickedness, by the looking forward of our thoughts, as if by the breath of our nostrils. Of which power of scent the Lord rightly says in the praise of His Church, Thy nose is as the tower, which is in Libanus. [Cant. 7, 4] We distinguish also by the nose between odours and foul smells. And what is designated by the nose, but the farseeing discernment of the saints? But a watch-tower is placed on high, that the approaching enemy may be seen from far. The nose of the Church is therefore rightly said to be like the tower in Libanus; because while the far-seeing discernment of the saints, being placed on high, looks anxiously on all sides, it discovers a fault before it arrives; and as it watchfully marks it beforehand, so it boldly avoids it. Hence Habakkuk says, I will stand upon my watch. [Hab. 2, 1] Hence Jeremiah, admonishing the soul of each Elect one, says, Set thee up a watch-tower, place thyself bitternesses. [Jer. 31, 21] For, to set one’s self a watch-tower, is to foreknow by lofty considerations the approaching struggles of vices. And the soul of an Elect person places itself bitternesses, when firmly rooted even in the peace of virtues, it consents not to rest secure, on beholding evils in ambush.
86. But he takes thought, first, not to commit any evils, and secondly, not to do good things inconsiderately; and, after he has subdued wickednesses, he strives also to subject to himself his very virtues, lest they should be converted into the sin of pride, if they should get beyond the control of the mind. For since, as has before been said, evils frequently spring from good deeds, through the vice of negligence; he observes with watchful zeal how arrogance rises from learning, cruelty from justice, carelessness from tenderness, anger from zeal, sloth from gentleness. And, when he performs these good deeds, he observes that these enemies are by these means able to rise against him. For when he is labouring diligently in acquiring learning, he anxiously prepares his mind for the struggle with arrogance. And when he desires to punish justly the faults of offenders, he most skilfully avoids the severity of punishment exceeding the measure of justice. When he endeavours to restrain himself by tenderness, he carefully provides not to be overcome by any relaxation of discipline. When he rouses himself by the stimulants of right zeal, he specially takes care, that the flame of anger may not kindle him more than is necessary. When he controls himself with great tranquillity of gentleness, he keeps careful watch, not to be chilled by torpor. Because, therefore, in the thought of the spiritual soldier every vice is detected before it can steal in secretly, it is rightly said of the horse of God; He smelleth the battle afar off. For he considers what a crowd of iniquities would rush on him, were he to allow ever so few sins to enter within him. Whence it also follows;
The exhortation of the captains, and the howling of the army.
87. For the tempting vices, which fight against us in invisible contest in behalf of the pride which reigns over them, some of them go first, like captains, others follow, after the manner of an army. For all faults do not occupy the heart with equal access. But while the greater and the few surprise a neglected mind, the smaller and the numberless pour themselves upon it in a whole body. For when pride, the queen of sins, has fully possessed a conquered heart, she surrenders it immediately to seven principal sins, as if to some of her generals, to lay it waste. And an army in truth follows these generals, because, doubtless, there spring up from them importunate hosts of sins. Which we set forth the better, if we specially bring forward in enumeration, as we are able, the leaders themselves and their army. For pride is the root of all evil, of which it is said, as Scripture bears witness; Pride is the beginning of all sin. [Ecclus. 10, 1] But seven principal vices, as its first progeny, spring doubtless from this poisonous root, namely, vain glory, envy, anger, melancholy, avarice, gluttony, lust. For, because He grieved that we were held captive by these seven sins of pride, therefore our Redeemer came to the spiritual battle of our liberation, full of the spirit of sevenfold grace.
88. But these several sins have each their army against us. For from vain glory there arise disobedience, boasting, hypocrisy, contentions, obstinacies, discords, and the presumptions of novelties. From envy there spring hatred, whispering, detraction, exultation at the misfortunes of a neighbour, and affliction at his prosperity. From anger are produced strifes, swelling of mind, insults, clamour, indignation, blasphemies. From melancholy there arise malice, rancour, cowardice, despair, slothfulness in fulfilling the commands, and a wandering of the mind on unlawful objects. From avarice there spring treachery, fraud, deceit, perjury, restlessness, violence, and hardnesses of heart against compassion. From gluttony are propagated foolish mirth, scurrility, uncleanness, babbling, dulness of sense in understanding. From lust are generated blindness of mind, inconsiderateness, inconstancy, precipitation, self-love, hatred of God, affection for this present world, but dread or despair of that which is to come. Because, therefore, seven principal vices produce from themselves so great a multitude of vices, when they reach the heart, they bring, as it were, the bands of an army after them. But of these seven, five namely are spiritual, and two are carnal.
89. But they are, each of them, so closely connected with other, that they spring only the one from the other. For the first offspring of pride is vain glory, and this, when it hath corrupted the oppressed mind, presently begets envy. Because doubtless while it is seeking the power of an empty name, it feels envy against any one else being able to obtain it. Envy also generates anger; because the more the mind is pierced by the inward wound of envy, the more also is the gentleness of tranquillity lost. And because a suffering member, as it were, is touched, the hand of opposition is therefore felt as if more heavily impressed. Melancholy also arises from anger, because the more extravagantly the agitated mind strikes itself, the more it confounds itself by condemnation; and when it has lost the sweetness of tranquillity, nothing supports it but the grief resulting from agitation. Melancholy also runs down into avarice; because, when the disturbed heart has lost the satisfaction of joy within, it seeks for sources of consolation without, and is more anxious to possess external goods, the more it has no joy on which to fall back within. But after these, there remain behind two carnal vices, gluttony and lust. But it is plain to all that lust springs from gluttony, when in the very distribution of the members, the genitals appear placed beneath the belly. And hence when the one is inordinately pampered, the other is doubtless excited to wantonness.
90. But the leaders are well said to exhort, the armies to howl, because the first vices force themselves into the deluded mind as if under a kind of reason, but the countless vices which follow, while they hurry it on to every kind of madness, confound it, as it were, by bestial clamour. For vain glory is wont to exhort the conquered heart, as if with reason, when it says, Thou oughtest to aim at greater things, that, as thou hast been able to surpass many in power, thou mayest be able to benefit many also. Envy is also wont to exhort the conquered heart, as if with reason, when it says, In what art thou inferior to this or that person? why then art thou not either equal or superior to them? What great things art thou able to do, which they are not able to do! They ought not then to be either superior, or even equal, to thyself. Anger is also wont to exhort the conquered heart, as if with reason, when it says, The things that are done to thee cannot be borne patiently; nay rather, patiently to endure them is a sin; because if thou dost not withstand them with great indignation, they are afterwards heaped upon thee without measure. Melancholy is also wont to exhort the conquered heart as if with reason, when it says, What ground hast thou to rejoice, when thou endurest so many wrongs from thy neighbours? Consider with what sorrow all must be looked upon, who are turned in such gall of bitterness against thee. Avarice also is wont to exhort the conquered mind, as if with reason, when it says, It is a very blameless thing, that thou desirest some things to possess; because thou seekest not to be increased, but art afraid of being in want; and that which another retains for no good, thou thyself expendest to better purpose. Gluttony is also wont to exhort the conquered heart, as if with reason, when it says, God has created all things clean, in order to be eaten, and he who refuses to fill himself with food, what else does he do but gainsay the gift that has been granted him. Lust also is wont to exhort the conquered heart, as if with reason, when it says, Why enlargest thou not thyself now in thy pleasure, when thou knowest not what may follow thee? Thou oughtest not to lose in longings the time thou hast received; because thou knowest not how speedily it may pass by. For if God had not wished man to be united in the pleasure of coition, He would not, at the first beginning of the human race, have made them male and female. This is the exhortation of leaders, which, when incautiously admitted into the secresy of the heart, too familiarly persuades to wrong. And this a howling army in truth follows, because when the hapless soul, once captured by the principal vices, is turned to madness by multiplied iniquities, it is now laid waste with brutal cruelty.
91. But the soldier of God, since he endeavours skilfully to pursue the contests with vices, smells the battle afar off; because while he considers, with anxious thought, what power the leading evils possess to persuade the mind, he detects, by the sagacity of his scent, the exhortation of the leaders. And because he beholds the confusion of subsequent iniquities by foreseeing them afar off, he finds out, as it were, by his scent the howling of the army.
Because, then, we have learned, that either the preacher of God, or any soldier in the spiritual contest, is described in the account of the horse, let us now behold the same person under the signification of a bird; that we, who have learned his strength by the horse, may learn his contemplation also by the bird. For since we have heard in the description of the greatness of the horse, how much a holy man endures through patience against the assaults of vices, let us now learn by the appearance of birds, how high he soars by contemplation.

69. By which words this also is plainly shewn, that, in this place, nothing is said by the Lord of the irrational horse. For a brute animal cannot say, ‘Vah;’ but while it is said to say that, which it is quite unable to say, it is pointed out whom it designates. For ‘Vah’ is a word of exultation. The horse, therefore, says ‘Vah,’ on hearing the trumpet, because every bold preacher, when he thinks the contest of suffering approaching, exults in the exercise of virtue: and is not alarmed at the peril of the contest, because he rejoices in the triumph of victory. For the horse, therefore, to say, ‘Vah,’ is for a holy preacher to rejoice in his approaching suffering. But if a bold preacher seeks the glory of suffering, if he seeks with joy to undergo the peril of death for the Lord’s sake; why is it that the Truth declared to Peter, that boldest preacher, who from his sturdy heart, adopted his virtue in his name; When thou shall be old, thou shall stretch forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee, and lead thee whither thou wouldest not? [John 21, 18] How does he rejoice in his suffering, who being girt by another, will not go whither he is led? But if we consider how the mind is shaken by the approach of suffering, and the fear of death, and yet rejoices at the coming reward of the kingdom, we understand how it is willingly unwilling to undergo the peril of a glorious contest: because it both considers in death what to endure and fear, and it beholds in the fruit of death what to long and seek for.
70. Let us see how Paul loves what he shrinks from, how he shrinks from what he loves. For he says, I have a desire to be dissolved, and to be with Christ. [Phil. 1, 23] And, To me to live is Christ, and to die is gain. [ib. 21] And yet he says, We that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burdened, not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon, that mortality might be swallowed up of life. [2 Cor. 5, 4] Behold he both longs to die, and yet is afraid of being stripped of the flesh. Why is this? Because, though victory makes him joyful for ever, punishment nevertheless disturbs him for the present: and though the love of the subsequent gift prevails, yet the blow of sorrow grazes the mind, not without pain. For as a bold man, when he girds himself with arms, as the strife of battle is now approaching, both palpitates, and is in haste, trembles, and is wroth; seems, through his paleness, as if afraid, but is urged on vehemently by his anger; in like manner a holy man, when he sees himself drawing near to his suffering, is both agitated by the weakness of his nature, and strengthened by the firmness of his hope; both trembles at approaching death, and yet exults at living, through his death, a truer life. For he cannot pass over to the kingdom, except by the intervention of death; and is therefore doubtful, as it were, in his confidence, and confident, as it were, in his doubts; both fears with joy, and rejoices with fear; because he knows that he cannot arrive at the prize of rest, without passing with labour that which intervenes. Thus we, when we wish to repel diseases from our body, take with sorrow, indeed, the bitter cup of purgation; but rejoice as being certain of subsequent health. For since our body cannot otherwise attain to health, we are pleased even with that which is offensive in the draught. And when the mind beholds that life dwells in the bitterness, it rejoices when agitated with sorrow. Let it be said then, when he heareth the trumpet, he saith, Vah; because a bold preacher, on hearing tidings of the contest, though, as a man, he trembles at the violence of persecution, yet, through the certainty of hope, exults at the reward of the recompense. But he would not remain unmoved at this contest of suffering, if he did not anticipate this same suffering by meditating intently in thought upon it. For an evil, which is anticipated by wisdom, is, by reason, overcome by the mind which is struggling against it. Because a person is less overcome by adversity the more he is found prepared against it, by knowing it beforehand. For a heavy burden of fear is frequently made lighter by habit. Death itself, as it frequently startles when unexpected, so does it give us joy when anticipated by deliberation. Whence it is also rightly subjoined concerning this horse;
He smelleth the battle afar off.
71. As if it were said more plainly; He overcomes in every contest whatsoever, because before the contest he prepares his mind for the contest. For to ‘smell the battle afar off,’ is so to foresee in thought misfortunes when yet far distant, that they may not, by being unexpected, be able to overcome him. Paul was admonishing his disciples to smell this battle afar off, when he was saying, Examine yourselves whether ye be in the faith, prove your own selves. [2 Cor. 13, 5] As if he were openly charging them, saying, Call to mind the contests of persecutions, and considering the inmost and secret thoughts of your hearts, discover, what ye are able to continue in the midst of sufferings. Holy men smell this battle from afar, when dwelling even in the peace of the Church Universal, they behold either contests with heretics, or the tortures of persecutions hanging over them from unbelievers. Who while they live uprightly, often receive evil for good, and bear contentedly the insults of detractions, in order that if an occasion of persecution should arise, their open enemies may find them the more resolute, the more the shafts of false brethren also within the Church overcome them not. For he, who falls from a state of patience before the wounds of tongues, witnesses for himself, that he stands not firm against the swords of open persecution. Because therefore a man of God, being exercised by present trials contends against future, and exercised by the smallest trials contends against greater; it is rightly said of the horse of God, that he smelleth the battle afar off. It follows;
The exhortation of the captains, and the howling of the army.
72. The captains of the adverse part are the authors of error, of whom it is said by the Psalmist, Contention is poured forth over their princes, and their vain things led them astray, and He caused them to wander in the pathless place, and not in the path. [Ps. 107, 40] Of whom the Truth says by Itself, If the blind lead the blind, both fall into the ditch. [Matt. 15, 14] But an army follows these captains, that is to say the crowd of the wicked, which obeys their unjust commands. It must also be observed, that He says that the captains exhort, and that the army howls; because, namely, they who rule over unbelievers or heretics enforce, as if by reason, the wicked practices they order to be observed. But the crowd subject to them, because it follows their commands without judgment, whilst it clamours through the madness of confusion, is said to howl with bestial mind. For howling properly belongs to wolves. And, because the bands of the reprobate are eager with rapacity alone, against the life and habits of the faithful, they shout as if with howling. The horse of God, therefore, smelleth afar off the exhortation of the captains, and the howling of the army, when each holy preacher considers long beforehand, either what the authors of errors are able to command against the Elect, or how fiercely the crowd which is subject to them can rage. Paul was smelling this exhortation of the captains, when saying, By sweet words and fair speeches they seduce the hearts of the innocent. [Rom. 16, 18] He was smelling this howling of the army, when saying, After my departure shall grievous wolves enter in among you. [Acts 20, 29] Peter had smelled out the exhortation of the captains, when he was warning the disciples against certain persons, saying, Through covetousness shall they with feigned words make merchandize of you. [2 Pet 2, 3] He was smelling the howling of the army, when he was premising, saying, And many will follow their lasciviousnesses, by whom the way of truth is evil spoken of. [ib. 2]
73. Because, therefore, we have related, what kind of person each holy preacher, and leader of the faith in the war of persecution, is able to display himself, let us now describe, under the figure of this horse, each single soldier of Christ: that he also, who considers that he has not yet arrived at the height of preaching, may yet know, that he is described by this voice of the Lord, if he has already begun to live aright; in order to infer from hence, how much he may be known to God, if he attain to greater things, if God omits not to speak of him significantly, even in his smallest deeds. Let us repeat, therefore, the particulars which have been mentioned of the horse, and make known how the soldier of God advances from his original conversation, how he increases, from the least to greater things, or by what steps he arrives from the lowest to the highest.
