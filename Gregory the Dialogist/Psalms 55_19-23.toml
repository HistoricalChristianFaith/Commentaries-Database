Moreover there is this by the great favor of almighty God; that among those who are divided from the doctrines of the holy church there is no unity, since every kingdom divided against itself shall not stand. And holy church is always more thoroughly equipped in its teaching when assaulted by the questionings of heretics; so that what was said by the psalmist concerning God against heretics is fulfilled, “They are divided from the wrath of his countenance, and his heart has drawn near.” For while they are divided in their wicked error, God brings his heart near to us, because, being taught by contradictions, we more thoroughly learn to understand him.
