Whoever strives to accomplish great things knows how to weigh these matters well, if he has always been zealous to attribute them to divine praises. Rightly therefore Jonathan, trusting in the attainment of victory, declared that the enemies would be delivered not into his own hands, but into the hands of Israel, so that he might show the triumph and at the same time designate what kind of person the triumphant one ought to be. For Israel is interpreted as "seeing God." He into whose hands the enemies are delivered is therefore called "seeing God," so that he may be taught not to attend to those things which have been given into his hand, but while holding what has been given, to lift up his heart to the bestower of gifts. For he holds one thing in his hands and sees another with his eyes, so that he may firmly hold the palm of triumph, but the retained palm of victory may not puff up the one who sees God. But since he speaks these things in confidence, not yet in possession, let us hear how he comes to possess them.
