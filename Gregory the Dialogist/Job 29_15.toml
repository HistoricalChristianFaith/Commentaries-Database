36.  Herein the mind of the reader might perchance put the question, wherefore it is that blessed Job reckons up his own virtue with so much particularity.  For it is a mark of holy men to conceal the good things they may have done, lest it chance that they bring upon themselves the downfall of exaltation.  Whence Truth saith by Itself, Take heed that ye do not your righteousness before men, to be seen of them. [Matt. 6, 1]  It is hence, too, that in giving light to the two blind men sitting by the way-side, He charged them, saying, See that no man know it. [Matt. 9, 30]  Of which persons it is thereupon said, that they ‘departed and spread abroad the fame of Him throughout all that region.’  Now it is a question for us to consider, what this means, that the Almighty Himself, unto Whom to have the will is the same thing as to have the power, both wished that His extraordinary powers should be kept secret, and notwithstanding by those that were illumined with sight as it were against His will He is made manifest.  Which is nothing else than that to His servants following after Him He gave an example, that of themselves indeed they should desire to have their extraordinary endowments kept hidden from sight, and yet, that others might profit by their example, they should be brought to view against their will, and indeed by concealing their own achievements keep themselves safe, but whilst they are brought to view against their will, convey good examples on to their neighbours.  So then let them be hidden in set purpose, and made public by necessity, and let the hiding of them be the safe keeping of self, and the making them public usefulness to others.  Again, because it is written, Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel, but in a candlestick, and it giveth light to all that are in the house, Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father, Which is in heaven. [Matt. 5, 15. 16.]  There are times when holy persons are compelled to do good things even in the presence of their fellow-creatures, or else to tell these very deeds of theirs to their fellow-creatures, but only to this end relating every thing, viz. that by those works not they themselves, but their Father, Which is in heaven, may be glorified.  For whilst they preach things holy, the very preaching itself perhaps goes for nought, of those whose life is not known.  So they are forced to tell their own life, that they may be able to change the life of their hearers.  And they relate their deeds that they may be held in veneration, and they seek to be venerated, that they may be listened to with awe.  Since it is written; And when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up over against them. [Ez. 1, 21]  Because it is so that when the minds of the hearers take in the life of those that preach, surely they necessarily admire the force of the preaching as well.
37.  Hence it is therefore that good preachers at once eschew honour on account of being set up, and yet wish to be honoured on account of being imitated.  In the same way surely Paul the Apostle, when speaking to the disciples, at once flees honour, and yet shows how greatly he deserved to be honoured.  For when he said to the Thessalonians; For neither at any time used we flattering words, as ye know; nor a cloak of covetousness, God is witness:  he adds going on; Nor of men sought we glory, neither of you, nor of others, when we might have been, burthensome to you as the Apostles of Christ; But we were gentle among you. [1 Thess. 2, 5. 6. 7.] Again to the Corinthians, avoiding honour he saith; For we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord, and ourselves your servants for Jesus Christ’s sake. [2 Cor. 4, 5]  Which same however he seeing to be led aside from the track of the true faith by the persuasions of false apostles, with the greatest pains shows to them how much he was worthy to be held in reverence, saying, Howbeit whereinsoever any is bold, (I speak foolishly,) I am bold also.  Are they Hebrews? so am I.  Are they Israelites? so am I.  Are they the seed of Abraham? so am I.  Are they ministers of Christ? (I speak as a fool,) I am more. [2 Cor. 11, 22. 23.]  To which particulars he likewise adds how that to him the secrets of the third heaven also were set open, how that being caught up he even penetrated the mysteries of Paradise.  See, how eschewing honour he proclaims himself the servant of the disciples.  See how for the use of his hearers seeking honour, he advances the claims of his life above the false apostles.  Since the great teacher acted with this view, that whilst he himself is seen and known for what he was, both the life and the tongue of those that preached amiss might by comparison with him be made worthless.  Therefore in a wonderful way he both exhibits the grace of humility, and seeks accessions of usefulness, so as both to proclaim himself a servant of the disciples, and prove himself better than the adversaries.  He displays to the disciples what he had been vouchsafed of humility, he displays to the opponents what he had been vouchsafed of loftiness.  He makes appear in opposition to adversaries what he had by gift, he makes appear to disciples what he remains in himself in thought, he makes known to opponents what he is presented without in practice.  So holy men, when they are constrained to relate the good things that they do, do not lend themselves to exaltation but usefulness.  Whence to his friends, unjustly upbraiding him, and so not knowing the good things in him, blessed Job telling reveals them, that surely they might learn, not whilst upbraiding him to lift themselves up against his life, but holding their peace to copy the same. Though, as we have already often said above, the despair urged on him by those upbraiding him, forced him to recall his own deeds to remembrance.  For amidst so many pains of wounding and words of despair, when he tells the things which he did, his mind as it were sunk down by words and wounds he sets anew to hope.  So let him say the good things that he has done, that he may not be forced in the midst of so many evil things that he hears to despair of himself. I was eyes to the blind, feet was I to the lame.
38.  When we are estimating the examples of holy practice, we ought first to mark what a right order is observed in relating them, so that first works of righteousness, next works of mercy should be described.  For that man does well what is pitiful, who is taught first to observe what is just, so that the stream of mercy bestowed on our neighbours be brought from the fountain-head of righteousness.  For there are many that in a manner render works of mercy to their neighbours, but do not abandon the deeds of unrighteousness, which same if they are anxious truly to show mercy to their neighbours, ought first by living justly to have shown pity to themselves.  Whence it is written; Have mercy upon thine own soul by pleasing God. [Ecclus. 30, 23. (Vulg. 42)]  He then that would pity his neighbour must needs derive the original of pitying from himself.  For it is written; Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. [Matt. 19, 19]  How, then, is he pitiful to another by showing mercy, who by still living unjustly becomes pitiless to himself?  Whence it is also said by one that was wise; He that is evil to himself, to whom will he be good? [Ecclus. 14, 5]  Since for showing forth mercy, that it may be rendered to the needy outwardly in perfection, two things necessary agree together, i.e. the man that is to give, and the thing to be given.  But the man is by far and without comparison better than the thing.  And so he who gives up his outward substance to his neighbour in want, but does not keep his own life from doing evil, gives his estate to God, but himself to sin.  The thing which is the lesser he offered to the Creator, and that which is the greater he reserved to wickedness.  And so it is well said first by blessed Job, With justice I was clothed and arrayed myself as with a garment, and with my judgment as with a diadem: and is next added; I was eyes to the blind, and feet was I to the lame.  Because there is then in God’s sight the offering of true righteousness, when from the root of righteousness the branches of pitifulness proceed.  But because in the very work of mercy itself the spirit is wont to be thought more of with the interior Judge than the thing done, observe that he declares that to ‘the blind he had been eyes, to the lame feet.’  For by saying these things assuredly he points out that both to the one he had held out a hand by himself, and that the other he bore up by carrying.  From which it is gathered how greatly the bowels of his mercy were poured out upon the weak and needy
