18.  The righteous when they see the unrighteous erring here cannot be glad for the error of persons ruining themselves.  For if they rejoice in errings, they cease to be righteous.  Again, if in the feeling of triumph they be glad, for this that they are not such as they see others are, they are altogether full of pride.  Hence the Pharisee lost his justification, because being glad he set himself above the merits of the Publican, saying, I thank Thee that I am not as other men are, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this Publican.  Again, if we say that the righteous can triumph with a perfect joy over the death of the wicked, what sort of thing is joy for vengeance on sinners in this world, wherein the life of the righteous is still uncertain?  Let us then distinguish between the times of trembling and exulting.  For the righteous see the unrighteous now, and pine at their wickedness; and when they see those smitten, they are made distrustful touching their own life too.  When then shall the righteous see the destruction of the wicked and be glad, saving when with the strict Judge they incorporate henceforth with perfect sureness of triumphing, when in that final Inquest they shall see the condemnation of those, and shall now no longer have aught to fear for themselves?  Now therefore they see the children of perdition and groan, then they shall see them and laugh them to scorn, because in triumphing they shall set at nought those, whom now they neither see doing wickedness without groaning nor dying for their wickedness without fearing.  Hence by that which is added it is proved that the thing is spoken as concerning their final condemnation.
