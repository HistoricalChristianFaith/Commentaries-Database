Hence also miracles were added to the holy preachers, so that the power displayed might give faith to their words, and that those who preached new things might do new things, as is added in this same reading: "Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse the lepers, cast out demons." When the world was flourishing, when the human race was increasing, when the flesh was subsisting long in this life, when the abundance of things was overflowing, who upon hearing would believe that there was another life? Who would prefer invisible things to visible things? But when the sick were returning to health, when the dead were rising to life, when lepers were receiving cleanliness of flesh, when demoniacs were snatched from the power of unclean spirits, with so many visible miracles performed, who would not believe what he heard about invisible things? For visible miracles shine forth for this purpose: that they may draw the hearts of those who see them to faith in invisible things, so that through what is done wondrously on the outside, what is within may be perceived to be far more wondrous. Hence now also, when the number of the faithful has increased, there are many within the holy Church who hold to a life of virtues but do not have the signs of virtues, because a miracle is shown outwardly in vain if what it should work inwardly is lacking. For according to the voice of the Teacher of the Gentiles: "Tongues are for a sign not to believers, but to unbelievers." Hence also that same distinguished preacher, amidst the words of his preaching, raised by praying, in the sight of all the unbelievers, Eutychus who had fallen asleep and fallen from the window and was completely extinguished from life. Coming to Malta, and knowing the island was full of unbelievers, he healed by praying the father of Publius who was afflicted with dysentery and fevers. But his companion on his journey and helper in his holy preaching, Timothy, who was growing weak from a stomach ailment, he does not cure by a word but restores by the art of medicine, saying: "Use a little wine, for your stomach and your frequent infirmities." Why then does he who saves an unbelieving sick person with a single prayer not also strengthen his sick companion with prayer? Because surely that one who was not inwardly alive needed to be healed outwardly through a miracle, so that through what the external power displayed, the internal virtue might animate him to life. But to the faithful sick companion, outward signs did not need to be shown, since he was living healthily within.

But having granted the power of preaching, having granted the miracles of virtues, let us hear what our Redeemer adds: Freely you have received, freely give. For he foreknew that some would bend this very gift of the received Spirit to the use of commerce, and turn the signs of miracles to the service of avarice. Hence it is that Simon Magus, seeing miracles performed through the laying on of hands, wished to obtain the gift of the Holy Spirit with money, namely so that he might sell more wickedly what he had acquired wrongly. Hence our Redeemer, having made a whip of cords, drove the crowds from the temple and overturned the seats of those selling doves. Indeed, to sell doves is to give the laying on of hands by which the Holy Spirit is received, not for the merit of life, but for payment. But there are some who indeed do not receive rewards of money from ordination, yet bestow sacred orders for human favor, and from that very generosity seek only the recompense of praise. These certainly do not bestow freely what was freely received, because from the service of holiness they have rendered, they seek the coin of favor. Hence the prophet spoke well when describing the just man, saying: Who shakes his hands free from every gift. For he does not say: Who shakes his hands from a gift, but added from every, because one thing is a gift from service, another a gift from the hand, another a gift from the tongue. A gift from service is deference unduly rendered, a gift from the hand is money, a gift from the tongue is favor. Therefore he who bestows sacred orders shakes his hands free from every gift when in divine matters he seeks not only no money, but also no human favor.

But why do we speak of these things, when we still see many burdened by more atrocious deeds? For I speak to you priests with grief, because we have learned that some of you perform ordinations for payments, selling spiritual grace and accumulating temporal gains from the iniquities of others along with the harm of sin. Why then does the voice of the Lord commanding not return to your memory, saying: Freely you have received, freely give? Why do you not recall before the eyes of your mind that our Redeemer, entering the temple, overturned the seats of those selling doves and poured out the money of the money-changers? For who are those in the temple of God today who sell doves, if not those who in the Church receive payment for the imposition of hands? Through which imposition, namely, the Holy Spirit is given from heaven. Therefore the dove is sold, because the imposition of hands, through which the Holy Spirit is received, is offered for a price. But our Redeemer overturned the seats of those selling doves, because he destroys the priesthood of such merchants. For hence it is that the sacred canons condemn the simonian heresy, and command that those be deprived of the priesthood who seek payment for bestowing ordinations.
