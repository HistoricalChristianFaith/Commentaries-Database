You have heard in the Gospel reading, my brothers, that sinners and tax collectors approached our Redeemer; and they were received not only for conversation, but also for dining together. When the Pharisees saw this, they were indignant. From this matter, understand that true justice has compassion, while false justice has disdain, although even the just are accustomed to be rightly indignant at sinners. But it is one thing that is done from the swelling of pride, another from zeal for discipline. For they show disdain, but without being disdainful; they despair, but without being despairing; they stir up persecution, but lovingly, because although outwardly they intensify rebukes through discipline, inwardly they preserve sweetness through charity. They often place before themselves in their minds the very ones whom they correct, and they consider as better even those whom they judge. By doing this, they guard their subjects through discipline and themselves through humility.
