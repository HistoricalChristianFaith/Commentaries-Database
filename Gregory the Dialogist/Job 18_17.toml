25.  It is deserving of our notice, that Bildad the Shuhite so expresses himself of each one of the wicked, that his words are secretly directed against the head of all the wicked; for the head of the wicked is the devil.  And he in his own person having in the last times entered into that vessel of perdition, shall be called ‘Antichrist,’ who will endeavour to spread his name far and wide, which same every individual now likens himself to, when, by the memorial of an earthly name, be strives to extend the gloriousness of his praise, and exults in transitory reputation.  Therefore let these words be so understood of each one of the wicked, that they be referred in a particular manner to the head of the wicked himself.  Therefore let him say, Let his remembrance perish from the earth, and let not his name be repeated in the streets.  For streets [platea from platuv ‘broad’] are called by a Greek term from width, and so Antichrist aims to settle the remembrance of himself upon earth, when he longs, if it were possible, to remain for ever in temporal glory He delights to have ‘his name celebrated in the street,’ whilst he spreads the working of his wickedness far and wide.  But whereas this wickedness of his is not permitted to be reared to a height for a long time, let it be said, Let his remembrance perish from the earth, and let not his name be repeated in the street; i.e. that he should both quickly part with the fame of his earthly power, and lose all the pleasures of his name, which he had spread far and wide in the shortlived prosperity of time.
