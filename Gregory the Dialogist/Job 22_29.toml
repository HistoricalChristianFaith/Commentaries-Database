For he that has been abased shall be in glory, and he that has bent down his eyes, the same shall be saved.

Which same sentence is not at variance with the mouth of 'Truth,' when It says, For whosoever exalteth himself shall be abased, and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted. And hence it is said by Solomon, Before destruction the heart of man is haughty, and before honour is humility. But it is properly said, For he that has bent down his eyes, the same shall be saved; in that so far as it is to be discovered through the ministering of the members, the first manifestation of pride is used to be with the eyes. Hence it is written, And wilt bring down high looks. Hence it is said of the very head himself of those that behave proudly, He beholdeth all high things. Hence it is written concerning her, who by unbelief attached herself to him, There is a generation, O how lofty are their eyes! and their eyelids are lifted up. So to 'bend down the eyes, is no man on looking upon him to look down upon, but one's self to look upon as inferior and below all one sees. He then that 'bends down his eyes shall be saved'; because he who quits the false height of pride, scales the loftiness of truth.
