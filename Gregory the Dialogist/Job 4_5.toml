32.  All men of froward mind assail the life of the righteous in two ways; for either they assert that what they say is wrong, or that what they say aright they never observe; and hence blessed Job is reproved by his friends further on for his mode of speech, whereas now he is torn in pieces for having spoken right things, but not having observed them.  And so at one time the speech, and at another time the practice of the good meets with the disapproval of the wicked, in order that either the tongue being rebuked may hold its peace, or the life, being convicted by the testimony of that same tongue of theirs, may give way under the charge.  And mark that first they bring forward commendations of the tongue, and afterwards complain of the weakness of the life.  For the wicked, that they may not openly show themselves to be evil, sometimes say such good things of the just, as they know to be already received concerning them by others also.  But as we have said above, these very points they forthwith strain to the increase of guilt, and from hence, that they spoke favourable things also, they point out that credit is to be given them in the reverse, and with more seeming truth they intimate evil things, in proportion as they commended the good with seeming zeal.  Thus they wrest words of favourable import to the service of accusation, in that they afterwards more deeply wound the life of the righteous from the same source, whence a little before in semblance they vindicated it.  But it often happens that their good qualities, which they first condemn when possessed, they afterwards admire, as if departed.  And hence Eliphaz, as he declares them to be departed, subjoins the virtues of the holy man, enumerating them.
