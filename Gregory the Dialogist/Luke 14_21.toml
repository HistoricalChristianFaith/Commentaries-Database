There follows: The servant returned and reported these things to his master. Then the angry master of the house said to his servant: Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city, and bring in here the poor and the feeble, and the blind and the lame. Behold, he who clings to earthly substance more than is right refuses to come to the Lord's supper; he who sweats at the labor of curiosity disdains the prepared nourishments of life; he who serves carnal desires rejects the feasts of the spiritual banquet. Therefore, because the proud refuse to come, the poor are chosen. Why is this? Because, according to Paul's words, God chooses the weak things of the world to confound the strong. But it must be noted how those who are called to the supper and come are described: the poor and the feeble. They are called poor and feeble who in their own judgment are weak in their own eyes. For there are poor who are as if strong, who even when placed in poverty are proud. The blind, indeed, are those who have no light of understanding. The lame also are those who do not have right steps in their conduct. But since vices of character are signified in the weakness of the limbs, it is certainly clear that just as those were sinners who when called refused to come, so also these are sinners who are invited and come. But proud sinners are rejected, so that humble sinners may be chosen.

Therefore God chose these whom the world despises, because very often that contempt itself calls a person back to himself. For he who left his father and squandered prodigally the portion of substance he had received, after he began to hunger, returned to himself and said: "How many hired servants in my father's house have bread in abundance?" Indeed he had departed far from himself when he was sinning. And if he had not hungered, he would never have returned to himself, because only after he lacked earthly things did he begin to consider what he had lost of spiritual things. Therefore the poor and the weak, the blind and the lame are called, and they come, because all who are infirm and despised in this world very often hear the voice of God more quickly, precisely because they have nothing in this world in which to take delight.

This is well represented by that Egyptian boy of the Amalekites, who, when the Amalekites were plundering and advancing, remained sick on the road, and wasted away from hunger and thirst. Yet David found him and provided him food and drink; and he, immediately recovering, became David's guide. He found the Amalekites feasting, and with great strength he overthrew those who had abandoned him in his weakness. For the Amalekite people are called "the licking ones." And what is designated by the licking people except the minds of worldly persons? They lick, as it were, all earthly things by grasping at them, since they delight only in temporal matters. For like a licking people taking plunder, those who love earthly gains heap them up from the losses of others. But the Egyptian boy is left sick on the road, because whenever any sinner begins to weaken from his standing in this world, he soon becomes an object of contempt to worldly minds. Yet David finds him and offers him food and drink, because the Lord, strong of hand, does not despise those cast off by the world, and very often he converts to the grace of his love those who, being unable to follow the world, remain as it were on the road, and he extends to them the food and drink of his word; and he chooses them as guides for himself on the way, as it were, when he makes them his preachers as well. For when they bring Christ into the hearts of sinners, they lead David, as it were, against his enemies. They strike the feasting Amalekites as if with David's sword, because by the Lord's power they overthrow all the proud who had despised them in the world. Therefore the Egyptian boy who had remained on the road kills the Amalekites, because very often those same ones overcome the minds of worldly persons by preaching, who previously were unable to run with the worldly in this world.
