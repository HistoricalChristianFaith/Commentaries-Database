12. For what is in this place designated by the name of ‘river,’ except the downward course of the human race, which rises at its birth, as if from the source of its fountain, but passes down, as if flowing to its lowest level at its death? But who are signified by the expression ‘Jordan,’ except those who have been already imbued with the sacrament of Baptism? For since our Redeemer deigned to be baptized in this river, all who have been baptized must needs be expressed by the name of that stream, in which this very sacrament of Baptism happened to be begun. Because, therefore, this Behemoth has drawn to himself like a river the human race flowing downward from the beginning of the world, even to the times of redemption, but a few Elect ones escaping him, it is now well said; He will drink up a river, and will not wonder. But since even after the coming of the Mediator he seizes some even of the faithful, who neglect to live righteously, it is rightly subjoined; And trusteth that Jordan can flow into his mouth. As if it were plainly said, Before the coming of the Redeemer of the world, he drank up the world without wondering, but, which is far worse, even after the coming of the Redeemer, he trusts that he is able to swallow up some, who have been sealed with the sacrament of Baptism. For he devours some who have been placed in the profession of Christians, because he supplants them by causing error in their faith itself. But others he does not turn aside from the uprightness of the faith, but inclines to the practice of wicked works. Others he is unable to bend as much as he wishes in deeds of impurity, but he inwardly turns them aside from the zeal of their intention; so that, when they sever their minds from charity, whatever they may do outwardly may not be right. And they retain the faith, but they retain not the life of faith; because they either openly do those things which are unlawful, or else from their perverted heart, their doings are wicked, even though they seem to be holy. For since some persons are faithful in their professions, but not in their lives, it is said by the voice of the Truth, Not every one that saith unto Me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven. [Matt 7, 21] Hence He says again; But why call ye Me, Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say? [Luke 6, 46] Hence Paul says, They profess that they know God, but in works they deny Him. [Tit. 1, 16] Hence John says, He that saith that he knoweth God, and keepeth not His commandments, is a liar. [1 John 2, 4] Hence it is that the Lord complains of His own ancient people; This people honoureth Me with their lips, but their heart is far from Me. [Mark 7, 6; Is. 29, 13] Hence also the Psalmist says, They loved Him with their mouth, and they lied unto Him with their tongue. [Ps. 78, 36] But it was no wonder that this Behemoth before the water of the laver, before the heavenly sacraments, before the corporeal presence of the Redeemer, drank up, with the yawning gulph of his deep persuasion, the river of the human race. But it is very wonderful, it is very terrible, that even after the knowledge of the Redeemer, he seizes many with his open mouth, that he pollutes them after the water of the laver, that after heavenly sacraments he hurries them away to the depth of hell. Let it be said then, let it be said fearfully by the voice of the Truth; He will drink up a river, and will not wonder, and trusteth that Jordan can flow into his mouth. For the devil counted it not a great thing that he seized unbelievers, but he now rouses himself with all his efforts to destroy those, whom he pines at seeing regenerated against him. Let no one then trust that faith without works can be sufficient for him, when we know that it is written; Faith without works is dead. [James 2, 20] Let no one think that he has entirely escaped the bite of Behemoth by a mere confession of faith. Because he has already drunk up a river, but still thirsts after Jordan. And Jordan flows into his mouth as often as any Christian sinks down into iniquity. We have now escaped his mouth, by the aid of faith, but we must take earnest heed, not to fall therein by slippery doings. If care in walking is neglected, it is in vain that we keep the straight road by faith. Because the way of faith leads indeed to the heavenly country, but it does not carry to the close those who stumble therein.
13. We have another point to consider more minutely on this head. For those who we said were expressed by ‘Jordan,’ can also be designated by the ‘river.’ For they who have already confessed their belief in the truth, but neglect to live faithfully, can rightly be called a ‘river:’ namely, because they flow downwards. But ‘Jordan’ in the Hebrew word means ‘the descent of them.’ And there are some who in seeking the way of truth cast away their own selves, and come down from the pride of their former life. And when they desire eternal things, they entirely estrange themselves from this world, by not only seeking after the goods of others, but even abandoning their own. And so far from seeking glory therein, they despise it even when it offers itself. For hence is that which is said by the voice of the Truth, If any man will come after Me, let him deny himself. [Luke 9, 23] For a man denies himself, if, having trampled down the haughtiness of pride, he shews before the eyes of God that he is strange to himself. Hence the Psalmist says, I will remember thee from the land of Jordan, and of the Hermonites. [Ps. 42, 6] For Jordan, as I said, is interpreted ‘Descent,’ but Hermonites, Anathema, that is, ‘Alienation.’ He therefore remembers God from the land of Jordan, and of the Hermonites, who by humbling himself, and by living estranged from himself, is recalled to think on his Creator. But the ancient enemy considers it no great matter, that he holds under the rule of his tyranny those who seek after earthly things. For we know, as the Prophet witnesses, that His food is choice. [Hab. l, 16] Nor does he count it a wonderful thing if he swallows up those whom pride exalts, covetousness wastes away, pleasure relaxes [‘dilatat’], wickedness contracts [‘angustat’], anger inflames, discord separates, envy exulcerates, lust pollutes and kills. He will therefore swallow up a river, and will not wonder, because he counts it no great thing, when he devours those, who by the very pursuits of their life run downwards. But he earnestly endeavours to seize those whom he sees already united to heavenly things, from their contempt of the things of earth. And hence, when the river has been swallowed up, it is rightly subjoined, And he trusteth that Jordan can flow into his mouth, because he is anxious to lurk in ambush, and seize those, whom he sees casting themselves down from the glory of the present life through love of their heavenly country. For some in truth forsake the world, abandon the vanities of transient honours, and, seeking the lowliness of humility, transcend by good living the custom of human conversation; and advance in such lofty pursuits [‘tanta studiorum arce’], as even now to perform mighty wonders. But because they neglect to protect themselves by circumspection, they are wounded by the shaft of vain glory, and fall the more fatally from on high. For hence it is that the eternal Judge, Who weighs the secrets of the heart, foretells this same fall and ruin, and threatens, saying, Many will say to Me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in Thy Name, and in Thy Name have cast out devils, and in Thy Name have done many wonderful works? And then will I profess unto them that I never knew you: depart from Me, ye that work iniquity, I know not who ye are. [Matt. 7, 22. 23.] Hence also it is said by the Prophet, The Lord called judgment to the fire, and it devoured the great abyss, and will eat up a part of the house of the Lord. [Amos 7, 4] For judgment is called to the fire, when the sentence of justice is already displayed for the punishment of eternal burning. And it devours the great abyss, because it consumes the wicked and incomprehensible minds of men, which now conceal themselves from men even under the miracles of signs. But a part of the house of the Lord is eaten up; because Gehenna devours those also, who now boast, as it were, by their holy deeds, of being in the number of the Elect. They therefore who are here called ‘Jordan,’ are there called ‘a part of the house of the Lord.’ The ancient enemy therefore trusts that even Jordan can flow into his mouth, because he sometimes destroys, by the stratagems of his cunning, those even who are now considered Elect. But whose hardness of heart would not these words of the Lord arouse? Whose firmness of mind would not be shaken from the inmost depths of his thoughts, when our enemy is shewn to be of such great power against us? Will there be no aid of consolation?
