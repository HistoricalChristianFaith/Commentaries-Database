16.  It is common with righteous men, in that which they themselves feel to be sure and well grounded, to urge something as if in doubting, so as to put the words of the weak into their own lips; and again by a strong sentence they gainsay utterly him that halts in doubtfulness, that by that which they are seen to put forth doubtfully, they may in some degree condescend to the weak, and hereby, that they deliver a sure sentence, they may draw the doubtful minds of the weak to firm ground.  Which whilst they do, they are following the pattern of our Head.  For our Lord, when He was near to His passion, took up the voice of those that were weak in Himself, saying, O My Father, if it be Possible; let this cup pass from Me; [Matt. 26, 39] and that He might remove their fear, He took it in Himself.  And again shewing by obedience the force of strength, He saith, Nevertheless, not as I wilt, but as Thou wilt.  That so when that thing threatens us which we would not have take place, we should so in weakness pray that it may not, as that in strength we may be ready for the will of our Creator to be done, even in opposition to our own will.  After this pattern, then, the words of weakness are sometimes proper to be adopted by the strong, that by their strong preachings afterwards the hearts of the weak may be more acceptably strengthened.  Hence blessed Job when he uttered words as of one in doubt, saying, Thinkest thou that a dead man shall live again? presently added the sentence of his sure belief, whereby he saith,
All the days that I now serve militant will I wait, till my change come.
17.  He that waits for his change with such ardent longing, shews how great his certainty was of the Resurrection, and he makes it appear how greatly he looks down upon the course of the present life, who designates it a ‘service militant.’  For in the militant state there is the going on continually to an end, day by day the finishing of the conclusion is expected.  Thus he despises the course of this life, and looks for the settling of fixedness, who hereby, that he is serving subject to changeableness, is in haste to attain to his change.  For to the just man in this life the very load of his corruption is burthensome.  Because watchings exhaust with weariness, sleep is sought, that the labour and harassing effect of watchings may be moderated: but sometimes even sleep kills.  Hunger wastes the body, and that its craving may be banished, victuals are sought after: but frequently even the very victuals oppress, which had been sought in order to banish the oppression of debility.  And so the load of corruption is a heavy burthen, which except it were so heavy, Paul would never have said, For the creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of Him Who hath subjected the same in hope.  Because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage into the glorious liberty of the children of God.  For we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now. [Rom. 8, 20—22]  So let the holy man, longing for the state of incorruption, say, All the days that I now serve militant will I wait till my change come.
