But after hope concerning himself is taken from the burning rich man, his mind runs back to the relatives whom he had left behind, because the punishment of the reprobate sometimes unprofitably instructs their mind toward charity, so that they then love their own spiritually, who here, while they loved sins, did not even love themselves. Hence it is now added: "I ask you therefore, Father, to send him to my father's house; for I have five brothers, that he may testify to them, lest they also come into this place of torments."

Moreover the rich man placed in torments declares that he has five brothers, because that same proud Jewish people, which has already been condemned for the most part, knows that his followers whom he left upon the earth are given over to the five senses of the body. Therefore by the number five he expresses the brothers he had left behind, because he who is placed in hell groans that they do not rise to spiritual understanding, and asks that Lazarus be sent to them.
