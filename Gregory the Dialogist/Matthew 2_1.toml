He is also fittingly born in Bethlehem: for Bethlehem is interpreted as "house of bread." For he himself is the one who says: I am the living bread who came down from heaven. The place, therefore, in which the Lord is born was previously called "house of bread," because it was surely going to happen that he would appear there through the substance of flesh, who would refresh the minds of the elect with inner satisfaction.

As you heard in the Gospel reading, dearest brothers, when the King of heaven was born, the king of earth was troubled, because earthly height is confounded when heavenly height is revealed.
