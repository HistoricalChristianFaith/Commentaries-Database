Hence, adding further, he says: "Now therefore, your king is here, whom you have chosen and requested. Behold, your God has given you a king. If you will fear God and serve Him and hear His voice and not provoke the mouth of the Lord, then both you and the king who rules over you will continue following the Lord your God. But if you will not hear the voice of the Lord, but provoke His words, the hand of the Lord will be against you and against your fathers."

7. These things are certainly not mystical but historical in every respect. For where both prelates and subjects lead a reprobate life, they equally undergo the punishment of divine vengeance. But because good things are spoken of separately and evil things separately, those things for which the hand of the Lord is foretold as coming upon them must be considered more carefully. What then does it mean when he says: "If you will fear the Lord and serve Him," unless that many dread the judgments of divine severity and yet do not cease to do wicked things? With a trembling heart indeed they think upon future judgments, but conquered by present pleasure, they by no means avoid committing evil. Rightly therefore after the fear of the Lord, service to Him is mentioned: because that fear alone is worthy of approval which, while it shakes the mind, draws it to the pursuit of good works. Likewise, because there are some who through the fear of the Lord reject certain evils and do some good things, and yet neither fully abandon evil nor sufficiently perform good, it is added: "And you will hear His voice." He who hears the voice of the Lord both fully does good and utterly abandons evil. But these same good works must be held in the delight of sweetness, not in the estimation of harshness. For those to whom the things commanded by the Lord always seem hard and harsh gradually fall away and fail. For this reason Truth says through Himself: "For My yoke is sweet and My burden is light" (Matt. 11:30). For this reason John says: "His commandments are not heavy" (1 John 5:3). They are indeed not heavy for the elect: because while they seek the glory of eternal life with great desire, they gladly bear the precepts of the Gospel. The mouth of the Lord can also be understood as the preaching of perfect charity. For He wished, as it were, to show the endearments of His mouth when He said: "This is My commandment, that you love one another as I have loved you" (John 15:12). This indeed is the Lord's commandment, this is the yoke of divine sweetness. For what is borne more lightly, or ever more gladly, than love? What heavy thing, moreover, does one who loves not bear lightly? For whatever is loved is carried with great devotion. Therefore, because the bond of perfection is the charity of God and neighbor, rightly in the last place the prophet declares, saying: "If you will not provoke the mouth of the Lord, both you and the king who rules over you will be followers of the Lord your God." As if to say: Then you rightly fulfill the divine will, if you ground both the contempt of wickedness and the pursuit of good works in divine charity. Then you rightly run after the Redeemer toward the highest blessedness of eternal life, if you carry out with joy to the end of life those precepts of charity which are harsh to the carnal.
