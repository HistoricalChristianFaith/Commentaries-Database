A general statement is also immediately added, in which it is said: "For to everyone who has, it shall be given, and he shall abound; but from him who has not, even what he seems to have shall be taken away from him." For to him who has it shall be given, and he shall abound, because whoever has charity also receives other gifts. Whoever does not have charity loses even the gifts he seemed to have received. Therefore it is necessary, my brothers, that in everything you do, you watch over the keeping of charity. True charity is to love a friend in God, and to love an enemy for the sake of God. Whoever does not have this loses every good thing he has, is deprived of the talent he had received, and according to the Lord's sentence is cast into the outer darkness.
