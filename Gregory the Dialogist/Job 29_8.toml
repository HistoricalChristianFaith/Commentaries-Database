26.  If we give heed to the history, the things that he said we believe, if to the allegory, we see the things that he foretold; for those use to be called ‘young men’ who are not burdened with any weightiness of counsels.  But Holy Scripture is used to call those ‘elders,’ not who are ripe by amount of years alone, but by ancientness of character.  Hence it was said by one that was wise; For venerable old age is not that of long time, nor counted by the number of years; but the understanding of a man is grey hairs, and a spotless life is old age. [Wisd. 4, 8. 9.]  Whence the Lord also rightly saith to Moses; Gather unto Me seventy men of the elders of Israel, whom thou knowest that they are elders of the people. [Num. 11, 16]  In whom what else is required saving the old age of the heart, when such sort of persons are bidden to be chosen who are known to be elders?  For if it were the old age of the body that were sought for in them, they might have been known by as many as they might have been seen by.  But whereas it is said, whom thou knowest that they are elders of the people; doubtless it is clear that the old age of the mind and not of the body is told as fit to be chosen.  Thus now ‘the young men see Holy Church, and hide themselves, and the old men rise up and stand,’ because her activity and uprightness the immature are afraid of, the aged magnify.  They that are light of mind flee, but the grave and perfect do homage to her by rising up to the merits of her life.  Since the discipline thereof the perfect sort love, the imperfect ones blame.  And so ‘the young men see her and hide themselves,’ because they are afraid to be detected in their hidden courses of conduct.  But ‘the elders rise up and stand,’ because all the perfect make it appear by humility how much they have gained ground in good practice.  But because he describes all this of his own people, let him describe as well how he is feared by foreign people.
