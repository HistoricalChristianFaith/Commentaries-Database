Now it happened that both died. The rich man, who was clothed in purple and fine linen, was buried in hell; but Lazarus was led by angels into Abraham's bosom. What does Abraham's bosom signify but the secret rest of the fathers? Of which the Truth says: "Many will come from the East and the West, and will recline with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven; but the children of the kingdom will be cast out into outer darkness." For he who is said to have been clothed in purple and fine linen is rightly called a child of the kingdom. He who lifts his eyes from afar to see Lazarus, because while the unfaithful are in the depths through the punishments of their damnation, they behold the faithful above them in rest before the day of the last judgment, whose joys afterward they can in no way contemplate.

And it came to pass that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels into Abraham's bosom. And the rich man also died, and was buried in hell. This rich man, when placed in his own torment, seeks as a patron the one on whom he was unwilling to have mercy in this life.
