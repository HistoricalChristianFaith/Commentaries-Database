4.  In this place, Turn from him, means, ‘remove from him the force of the stroke,’ for who can rest when He turns away from him, when He Himself alone is rest, and the further off a man is from Him, he is also rendered void of rest in proportion?  Thus it is in such sort said, Turn from him, that you should understand, ‘from smiting;’ for it is fitly added, till his longed for day come as an hireling’s.  In proportion as an hireling is far from the end of his work, so is he far from the recompense of his wages.  Thus every holy man being set in this life, whilst he sees that he is far from departing out of the present life, laments that he is far from the eternal bliss.  What then is it to say, Turn from him a little while, that he may rest; but, ‘withdraw now the strokes of the present life, and show the blessings of eternal rest?’  Whence too it is added concerning that rest itself; till his longed for day come, as an hireling’s; for then the longed for day as of an hireling comes to man, when he receives eternal rest in compensation for his labour.  But as far as relates to the aspect of the present life, how despicable is the race of man, so full of miseries, blessed Job yet further tells, and describes how greatly the very things without sense seem to surpass him.
