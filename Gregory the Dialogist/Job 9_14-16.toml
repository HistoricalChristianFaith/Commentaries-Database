It is as though Job said in plain words, “If a created being unburdened by a physical body cannot think clearly about God, how can I dispute God’s judgments, as I am hampered by the burden of corruption?” God’s words to us are frequently his judgments, declaring God’s sentence upon our actions. Our words to God are the deeds that we set forth. A human being, however, cannot use words to reason with God. For in the eye of God’s exact judgment, he cannot rely on his own actions. Hence, Job appropriately adds, “Even if I possessed anything righteous, I would not answer. Rather, I would make supplication to my Judge.” For, as we have often said, all human righteousness is proved to be unrighteousness, if it is judged by strict rules. And so there is need for prayer to follow righteous actions.… The human mind with difficulty puts into practice the truths that it apprehends, and the things that it apprehends are nothing more than the outskirts. Therefore, let Job say, “Though I possessed nothing righteous, yet I would not answer, but I would make supplication to my Judge.” It is as if Job acknowledged in plainer words, “And if I should grow to the practicing of virtue, I am strengthened to life not by merit but by pardoning grace.” Therefore, we must be strenuous in prayer when we act rightly, so that all the righteous ways in which we live may be seasoned by humility.
