12. We are indeed in a narrow place when we are tempted inwardly by unclean spirits and outwardly behold the examples of evil men. Against the internal temptation of evil spirits, therefore, it is well said: "The people were afflicted," and against the outward examples of ungodly men: "They hid themselves." Because the cunning adversary suggests to us pleasant and joyful things to be desired, and he is never better conquered than if, when tempted, we run to the laments of devout prayer. And we can more quickly avoid the examples of the wicked if we judge that they are not even to be looked upon. Therefore, for the saints to hide is to disdain to look upon reprobate things. And because they guard the five senses of the body from the imitation of the reprobate, five kinds of hiding places are also described: namely caves, hidden places, rocks, caverns, and cisterns. Caves are indeed the hidden recesses of mountains: because the hearts of the saints are truly lofty in heavenly desire, and are closed and inaccessible to malignant spirits. We enter caves, therefore, when we retreat to the secrets of our minds, lest with wandering eyes we see things to be desired outside. We are hidden in secret places when we keep the hidden silence of a closed mouth. We ascend rocks when we place the activity of the body in vigorous work. Whence also concerning these hiding places, it is said through the prophet under one designation: "He who closes his eyes lest he see evil, and stops his ears lest he hear of blood, and shakes his hands free from every bribe: he shall dwell on high, the fortifications of rocks shall be his lofty refuge" (Isa. 33:15). We enter caverns and cisterns when we guard both our sense of smell from the obscenities of the world and our ears from hearing vain talk. For cisterns of water are the words of the Holy Scriptures. We are therefore hidden in cisterns when we enter into the waters of sacred speech, so that through the service of our ears we may water the meadows of our minds. And rightly are hiding places mentioned in the type of Israel as the elect: because whoever does not protect the senses of the body from the defilement of carnal pleasures does not escape the sword of hidden enemies. Let him therefore proclaim the victory of that hidden encounter, let him say: "The people were afflicted." Let him openly proclaim the triumphs of the outward conflict set before them: "They hid themselves." For the affliction of the elect mind is the deadly sword-point against every diabolical temptation. For while it is deeply pierced with compunction, it is raised up to the love of heavenly joy; and the more fervently it already loves the heavenly things to which it ascends through weeping, the more strongly it now rejects the offered pleasures of the world. For the illustrious teacher says: "Through many tribulations we must enter into the kingdom of God" (Acts 14:21). This entrance into the heavenly kingdom is certainly hoped for at the end of time in such a way that it is also experienced in the daily life of the saints. Our tribulation, therefore, is the entrance to heavenly joy. Rightly, therefore, as often as the elect mind is pierced with compunction in the lament of its affliction, by afflicting itself it obtains this: that it enters into the contemplation of that heavenly kingdom, in which it may ineffably rejoice. And while holy men flee from seeing the lovers of the world in the flower of passing joy, while they hide their bodily senses from the imitation of them, what is seen in their case is not flight but glorious victory. They flee indeed from earthly activities, but they attain heavenly ones; they seem to hide from the world, but they are revealed to heavenly glory. Therefore, by fleeing from harmful things, they more powerfully pursue their enemies, and they triumph far more nobly, since they so hasten toward heavenly things that the polluted savagery of their adversaries does not touch them. There follows: (Verse 7.) "But the Hebrews crossed over the Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead."
