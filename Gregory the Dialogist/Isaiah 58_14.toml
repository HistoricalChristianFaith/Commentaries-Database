“I will lift you up upon the high places of the earth.” For he is lifted up on the high places of the earth who treads under foot through looking down on them in his mind, even the very things of the present world, which seem lofty and glorious. But, having been suddenly dashed from this summit of things by the whirlwind of this trail, I have fallen into fears and tremors, since, even though I have no fears for myself, I am greatly afraid for those who have been committed to me. On every side I am tossed by the waves of business and sunk by storms, so that I may truly say, “I am come into the depth of the sea, and the storm has overwhelmed me.” After business I long to return to my heart; but driven from there by vain tumults of thoughts, I am unable to return.
