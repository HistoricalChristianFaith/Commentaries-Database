But the Magi bring gold, frankincense, and myrrh. Gold indeed befits a king, frankincense was placed in sacrifice to God, and with myrrh the bodies of the dead are preserved. Therefore the Magi proclaim through mystical gifts the one whom they adore: by gold a king, by frankincense God, by myrrh a mortal. But there are certain heretics who believe him to be God, but do not believe that he reigns everywhere. These indeed offer him frankincense, but refuse to offer gold as well. And there are some who consider him a king, but deny he is God. These offer him gold, but refuse to offer frankincense. And there are some who confess him to be both God and king, but deny that he assumed mortal flesh. These offer him gold and frankincense, but refuse to offer myrrh of assumed mortality. Let us therefore offer gold to the newborn Lord, that we may confess he reigns everywhere; let us offer frankincense, that we may believe that he who appeared in time existed as God before time; let us offer myrrh, that we may believe him whom we believe to be impassible in his divinity to have also been mortal in our flesh.

Although in gold, frankincense, and myrrh something else can also be understood. For by gold wisdom is designated, as Solomon attests, who says: A desirable treasure rests in the mouth of the wise. By frankincense, which is burned to God, the power of prayer is expressed, as the Psalmist testifies, who says: Let my prayer be directed as incense in your sight. By myrrh the mortification of our flesh is figured; hence the holy Church says of her workers who strive for God even unto death: My hands have dripped with myrrh. Therefore we offer gold to the newborn King if we shine in his sight with the brightness of heavenly wisdom. We offer frankincense if we burn the thoughts of the flesh on the altar of the heart through holy devotion to prayer, that we may be able to give forth a sweet fragrance to God through heavenly desire. We offer myrrh if we mortify the vices of the flesh through abstinence. For by myrrh, as we said, dead flesh is prevented from putrefying. But for dead flesh to putrefy is for this mortal body to serve the flow of lust, as is said of certain people through the prophet: The beasts of burden have rotted in their dung. For beasts of burden to rot in their dung is for carnal men to end their lives in the stench of lust. Therefore we offer myrrh to God when we preserve this mortal body from the putrefaction of lust through the seasoning of continence.
