For behold, concerning the description of hell it is said: There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth. But because present joys are followed by perpetual lamentations, here, dearest brothers, flee vain joy if you dread weeping there. For no one can both rejoice here with the world and reign there with the Lord. Therefore restrain the fleeting pleasures of temporal joy, subdue the lusts of the flesh. Whatever in the soul smiles upon you from the present age, let it become bitter from the consideration of eternal fire. Whatever rejoices in the mind in a childish manner, let the censure of youthful discipline restrain it, so that while you willingly flee temporal things, you may seize eternal joys without labor, through the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ.
