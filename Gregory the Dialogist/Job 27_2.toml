3.  By which same words blessed Job at once tells his own circumstances, and represents the times of Holy Church under affliction, wherein she is borne down by the open frowardness of unbelievers, and vexed by the bitterness of persecution.  For in two ways the Church is subject to be tried by her adversaries, viz.  that she should suffer persecution either by words or swords.  Now Holy Church aims with the greatest diligence to possess wisdom and patience.  And her wisdom is exercised when she is tried with words, her patience is exercised when she is tried with swords.  Now, however, he is speaking of that persecution, wherein she is provoked not by swords, but by false statements.  Now we know numbers, who when they encounter some things adverse in this life, do not believe that God is, but there are some that hold that God is, but does not concern Himself in the least with the affairs of men.  For of the one it is said by David, The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. [Ps. 14, 1]  But the latter say in him, How doth God know?  And is there knowledge in the Most High’!  And again; Yet they say again; The Lord shall not see, neither shall the God of Jacob regard it. [Ps. 94, 7]  Thus this person who bore a type of Holy Church, whilst set fast in the very bitterness of his affliction, made answer against them both, For as life has ‘being,’ but death has not, to avow that God is, he saith, As God liveth, but that he might tell that God concerns Himself with the affairs of mortals, he added, Who hath taken away my judgment, and hath brought my soul to bitterness.  For these ills which he suffers he bears record that he suffers not by accident, but by God Who ordereth all things, nor does he attribute the power for his bitterness to his tempter, but to his Creator.
4.  For he knows that the devil, though he is ever aiming at the afflicting of the just, yet if he do not receive the power from our Maker is not empowered in the least degree for any tittle of temptation.  And hence all the devil’s will is unjust, and yet whilst God permits it, all his power is just.  For of himself he does unjustly seek to try men indifferently, but those that require to be tempted, in so far as they require to be tried, God does not permit to be tried otherwise than justly.  Whence also in the Books of the Kings it is written of the devil, That the evil spirit of the Lord came upon Saul. [1 Sam. 18, 10]  Where the question justly occurs, ‘If it was the Spirit of the Lord, why should it be called an evil spirit?  and if an evil spirit, why the Lord’s?’ But in two words there is comprehended at once the just power and the unjust will in the devil.  For both he himself is called an evil spirit in respect of a most evil will, and the same spirit is called the Lord’s spirit in respect of the most just power bestowed on him.  And so it is well said; God liveth, Who hath taken away my judgment; and the Almighty, Who hath brought my soul to bitterness.  For though the enemy rage furiously, who longs to deal the blow, yet it is the Creator, Who permits him to have power for any thing.  But forasmuch as the holy man by invoking the life of God bound himself to somewhat, let us hear what in so obliging himself he subjoins.
