When in another place his disciples asked our Lord about the coming of Elijah, he answered, “Elijah has already come, and they did not know him but did to him whatever they please; and if you want to know, John is Elijah.” John, when he was asked, said, “I am not.” …If we carefully examine truth himself, what sounded contradictory is found to be not contradictory. The angel said to Zechariah, of the promised birth of John, that “he will come in the spirit and power of Elijah.” This is said because just as Elijah is the forerunner of the Lord’s second coming, so was John the forerunner of his first; as Elijah will come as the forerunner of the Judge, so was John the forerunner of the Redeemer. John, then, was Elijah in spirit; he was not Elijah in person. What the Lord spoke of the spirit, John denied of the person. It was right that the Lord should make a spiritual assertion about John to his disciples and that John should answer the same question to the materialistic crowds not about his spirit but about his body. What John said appears to contradict truth, yet he did not depart from the path of truth. FORTY GOSPEL HOMILIES 4.
For it has been established that those who sent knew that John had been born of Zechariah and Elizabeth, and even more so that those who were sent, since they belonged to the priestly house and would not be unaware of the incredible good offspring of so renowned a fellow kinsman as Zechariah, also knew. What did they have in mind then when they asked, “Are you Elijah?” since they were men who had read that he was taken up as though into heaven and they were waiting for his coming? Perhaps, then, since they expect Elijah before Christ at the consummation, and Christ after him, they seem to ask figuratively, as it were, “Are you the one who announces in advance the word that will precede Christ at the consummation?” He wisely responds to this, “I am not.” …
It is not strange, therefore, that, just as in the case of the Savior—although many knew of his birth from Mary, others were deceived—so also in the case of John, some were aware of his birth from Zechariah, but others were in doubt whether the awaited Elijah had appeared in the person of John.

When John himself was asked, he answered, “I am not a prophet.” He who knew that he was more than a prophet said he was not a prophet. He is said to be more than a prophet because it is a prophet’s task to foretell things to come, not to point them out as well. John is more than a prophet because with his finger he pointed to the one he spoke of [right at that moment].
