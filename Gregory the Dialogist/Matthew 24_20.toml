Remember what the Truth says: "Pray that your flight be not in winter or on the Sabbath." For by the commandment of the law it is not permitted to walk far on the Sabbath; winter also is a hindrance to walking, because the numbness of cold restrains the steps of those who walk. He says therefore: "Pray that your flight be not in winter or on the Sabbath." As if He were to say openly: See that you do not seek to flee your sins when it is no longer permitted to walk. That time therefore when flight is not permitted ought to be thought about now while it is permitted. That hour of our departure is always to be kept in view, this admonition of our Redeemer is always to be placed before the eyes of our mind, wherein He says: "Watch therefore, for ye know neither the day nor the hour."
