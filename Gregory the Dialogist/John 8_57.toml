(Hom. xviii. in Evang.) The carnal minds of the Jews are intent on the flesh only; they think only of His age in the flesh: Then said the Jews unto Him, Thou art not fifty years old, and hast Thou seen Abraham? that is to say, Many ages have passed since Abraham died; and how then could he see thy day? For they took His words in a carnal sense.

But the carnal minds of the listeners do not raise their eyes above the flesh, while they consider only the age of His flesh, saying: "You are not yet fifty years old, and have you seen Abraham?"
