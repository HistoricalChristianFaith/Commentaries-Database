73.  The friends of blessed Job could not console him, in whom they gainsaid the truth by their discourse, and when they called him a hypocrite or ungodly, hereby that they themselves by lying were guilty of sin, assuredly they augmented the chastisement of the righteous man chastened with wounds.  For the minds of the Saints, because they love the truth, even the sin of anotherâ€™s deceit wrings.  For in proportion as they see the guilt of falsehood to be grievous, they hate it not only in themselves, but in others also.
