What do we understand by “the heavens,” but the righteous, and what by “the earth,” but sinners? Hence, in the Lord’s Prayer we pray, “Your will be done on earth as it is in heaven.” This means that the will of our Creator, in the same way as it is accomplished in all the righteous, may be fulfilled in all sinners as well. Moreover, of the righteous it is said, “The heavens declare the glory of God.” To man, when he sinned, the sentence is pronounced, “You are earth, and to earth you shall return.” And so of this ungodly man, when dragged to that awful judgment, “the heavens reveal his iniquity, and the earth rises up against him,” that that man, who never spared either the good or the bad, should in that tremendous inquest have the life of the righteous and of sinners alike accusing him. - "Morals on the Book of Job 15.37"

37.  What do we understand by ‘the heavens,’ but the righteous, and what by ‘the earth,’ but sinners?  And hence in the Lord’s prayer we pray; Thy will be done on earth, as it is in heaven, meaning this, that the will of our Creator, in the same way as it is accomplished in all the righteous, may also be fulfilled in all sinners as well.  Moreover of the righteous it is said, The heavens declare the glory of God [Ps. 19, 1].  And to man when he sinned the sentence is pronounced, Earth thou art, and unto earth thou shalt return.  And so of this ungodly man, when dragged to that awful judgment; ‘the heavens reveal his iniquity, and the earth rises up against him,’ that that man, who here never spared either the good or the bad, should in that tremendous inquest have the life of the righteous and of sinners alike accusing him.  And of the two indeed it is worse if a man injure the good rather than sinners; and hence it is said by the Prophet, For her blood is in the midst of her: she poured it upon the smoothest rock [super limpidissimam petram V.];  she poured it not upon the ground to cover it with dust: [Ez. 24, 7] by ‘the ground’ and ‘the dust’ indeed denoting sinners, but by the ‘very smooth rock,’ the righteous man, who is not made rough by the hard grazes of sins; and so ‘the blood is poured upon the very smooth rock,’ when the wickedness of a bloodthirsty mind rages in the afflicting of the righteous soul.  While then it is worse unjustly to distress the righteous than the unrighteous, yet it is much worse to hurt the righteous and unrighteous together; and therefore whereas the wicked have injured both the good and the bad alike, in the accusing to damnation, ‘the heavens shall reveal his iniquity, and the earth shall rise up against him, because he at one and the same time set himself against those who savoured the things of heaven, and oppressed those who savoured of things below.  But it may be that by ‘the earth’ we have denoted not the sinful and reprobate, but those that being busied in earthly courses, by the help of alms and of tears attain to eternal life.  Concerning whom it is said by the Psalmist, when the Lord is proclaimed as coming to Judgment, He shall call to the heavens from above, and to the earth that He may Judge His people. [Ps. 50. 4]  For He ‘calls the heavens from above,’ when they, who, leaving all that they had, held on the tenour of the heavenly life, are called to sit with Him in judgment, and come with Him as judges; but ‘the earth is called from above,’ when they who were tied down to earthly courses of action, yet sought therein for heavenly more than for earthly profit and advantage, to which persons it is said, I was a stranger, and ye took me in; naked, and ye clothed Me.  So ‘the heaven reveals the wickedness’ of the hypocrite, and ‘the earth rises up against him,’ in that both they who come in company with God as judges, and they who through the ordeal of the Judgment are set free, become the witnesses of his iniquity.  Thus nought of the things he has committed is hidden from sight in the time of condemnation, and if indeed many of his deeds are now concealed from his fellow-creatures by double-dealing, yet in the day of condemnation; whatever there was that lay hidden within him, it is brought to light.
