46.  The Holy Church of the Elect sees that the spaces of her life pass in periods of day and night, in that it is hers in adversity to have ‘a night,’ and in prosperity, ‘a day.’  For there riseth as it were light unto her from the tranquillity of peace, and night from the grief of persecution.  Now as often as after the pauses of rest she returns to the toilsomeness of persecution, growing to a head against her, she testifies that her ‘days have past;’ in which days, however, she is accustomed to be weighed down with so much the heavier cares, in proportion as she bethinks her that for that very tranquillity of rest a more exact reckoning is required of her by the Judge.  For in the tranquil state of peace, at one time she is employed with the profits of souls, at another time she attends to the ministrations of earthly things, which same ministrations of earthly affairs are more burthensome to the minds of good men, in proportion as by the act of looking at them they are torn away though but for a brief space from looking at the things of heaven.  Whence blessed Job, whether in his own voice, or the voice of the Church Universal, after testifying that ‘his days were past,’ thereupon subjoined, My thoughts are scattered, racking my heart; in that when temporal glory is gone to the minds of the good, even that charge of earthly stewardship is likewise removed from them, which seemed to be torturing them within their thoughts; for while they aim to be always bent upward for the perception of the things of heaven, by this very circumstance that sometimes in their earthly stewardships they are made to descend to take thought of the lowest matters, they feel themselves to be put to torture.  Whence it is brought to pass, that the very hostility of persecution is itself too changed into a mighty exultation of joy, on account of the repose of the heart that is obtained.
