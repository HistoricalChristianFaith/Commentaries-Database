23.  As if it were in plain words; ‘If those very persons also cannot be void of contagion, who amidst the darkness of the present life shine bright by virtuous attainments, with what guilt of wickedness are they bound, who still live after the flesh?  If those persons cannot be free from sin, who are already walking in the way of heavenly desires, what they who still lie under the loads of sinful habits?  who whilst they are abandoned to the gratifications of their fleshly part, still bear the yoke of rottenness?  Hence Peter saith; And if the righteous scarcely be saved, where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear? [1 Pet. 4, 18]  Hence it is said by Isaiah, Upon the land of My people shalt come up thorns and briars; how much more upon all the houses of joy in the joyous city. [Is. 32, 13]  For by ‘the land of His People,’ the Lord meaneth the mind of all of the Elect.  Upon which He tells of ‘thorns and briars coming up;’ because He sees that not even that very mind is free from the prickles of bad habits.  But ‘the house of joy in the joyous city’ is the mind of the wicked, which whilst it neglects to regard the punishments that are destined to come, in the gratification of the flesh going away from itself, revels in empty mirth.  Thus he saith; Upon the land of My people shalt come up thorns and briars, how much more upon all the houses of joy in the joyous city.  As if He said in plain words; If evil habits sink low even the minds of those, who for desire of the heavenly country put themselves to pain, what guilty courses are they brought under, who without any apprehension abandon themselves in the gratification of the flesh?
24.  But it is a point to be noticed in his discourse how Bildad observed the order of our creation and of our birth, in that he calls ‘man’ not ‘a worm,’ but ‘rottenness,’ but ‘the son of man’ ‘a worm.’  For the first parent of the human race was ‘man,’ not ‘the son of man;’ from whom whosoever came forth, was not only ‘man,’ but ‘the son of man’ as well.  As then from man springs the son of man, so from rottenness springs the worm.  Whence man is lightly called ‘rottenness,’ but the son of man ‘a worm.’  For the first man was ‘rottenness’ not ‘a worm,’ in that though by death he turned to ‘rottenness,’ yet he did not come by a birth out of rottenness.  But he that is the son of man is called ‘a worm,’ because he is henceforth propagated from the corruption of mortal bodies.
25.  Therefore because the words of his friends are concluded, blessed Job sets on with a more penetrating acuteness of the suing, and his words are proportionably strong as they are the last; seeing that even in the same way it is the usage of lawyers, that the argument, by which they beforehand see that they are above their adversaries, they reserve for the conclusion of the suit.
