31.  If the text of the historical account be regarded in itself, it is of great service to the reader, that in blessed Job, instead of the ripping up of vices, proclaim is made of his virtues by his reviling friends; for the testimony to our manner of life is never so strong, as when commendable things are told by him, who aims to fasten guilt upon our head.  But let us consider of what a lofty height that man was, who by instructing the ignorant, strengthening the weak, upholding the faltering, amid the cares of his household, amidst the charge of countless concerns, amidst anxious feelings for his children, amidst the pursuit of so many laborious occupations, devoted himself to putting others in the right way.  And being busied indeed, he executed these offices, yet being free, he did service in the master's office of instruction.  By exercising superintendence, he disposed of temporal things, by preaching, he announced eternal truths; uprightness of life, both by practice he showed to all beholders, and by speech he conveyed to all that heard him.  But all that are either heretics or bad men, in recording the excellencies of the good, turn them into grounds of accusation.  Hence Eliphaz deduces occasion of reviling against blessed Job from the same quarter, whence he related commendable things of him.
