I beg you, in all this recall to your mind what I believe you must never forget: “All who would live godly in Christ suffer persecution.” And with regard to this I confidently say that you would live less godly if you suffered less persecution. For let us hear what else the same teacher of the Gentiles says to his disciples. “You yourselves know, brothers, how we came to you; we did not come in vain, for we had already suffered and been shamefully treated.” My most sweet son, the holy preacher declared that his coming to the Thessalonians would have accomplished nothing if he had not been shamefully treated.… On the basis of Paul’s example be even more disciplined in the midst of adverse circumstances. In this way adversity itself may increase significantly your desire for the love of God and your earnestness in good works. Similarly, the seeds planted for a future harvest germinate more fruitfully if they are covered over with frost. Likewise fire is increased by blowing on it that it may grow greater.
