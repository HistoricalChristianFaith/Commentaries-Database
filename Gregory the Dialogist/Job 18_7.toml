11.  For now as it were he puts forth ‘the steps of his strength,’ as often as he executes the violent acts of his power.  But ‘the steps of his strength shall be straitened,’ in that the resources of his wickedness, which he now displays in his own gratification, punishment hereafter binds fast.  It goes on;
And his own counsel shall cast him down.
12.  Every bad man makes it his counsel now to aim at present things, to abandon the things of eternity, to do what is unjust, to sneer at what is just; but when the Judge of the just and unjust shall come, every ungodly person is ‘cast down by his counsel,’ in that for this that he chose to go after here with bad intent, he is drowned in the darkness of eternal woe.  For that man whom temporal glory uplifts here, punishment without end there sinks down.  He who here revels in self-gratification, is there tortured with everlasting vengeance.  And it often happens that the very prosperity of this life, which is so eagerly hankered after by the ungodly, so clogs their steps, that even when they have the mind to return to good works, they are scarcely able: in that they have not the power to do what is right, while they fear to displease the lovers of this world.  Whence it is brought to pass, that through that glory which the ungodly man derives from sin, his sins are yet further doubled and redoubled.
