Moreover he is shown to burn more in his tongue, when he says: "Send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, to cool my tongue, for I am tormented in this flame." The unbelieving people held the words of the law in their mouth, which they scorned to keep in deed. Therefore he will burn more there, where he showed himself to know what he was unwilling to do. Wherefore it is well said of the learned and negligent through Solomon: "All the labor of man is in his mouth, but his soul will not be filled," because whoever labors only to know what he ought to say, fasts with an empty mind from the very refreshment of his knowledge. He desires to be touched by the tip of a finger, because given over to eternal punishments he wishes to share in even the least work of the just.

But it must be carefully noted what it means that the rich man placed in the fire asks for his tongue to be cooled. For it is the custom of sacred Scripture sometimes to say one thing, but to indicate another by that same saying. Now above the Lord had described this proud rich man not as given to talkativeness, but as feasting excessively. And He did not narrate that he sinned by talkativeness, but that he sinned by pride and greed through gluttony. But because talkativeness usually abounds at feasts, he who is said to have feasted wickedly here is reported to burn more grievously in his tongue in hell. For the sin of talkativeness first serves those who feast wickedly, and after talkativeness the levity of jesting also follows. For that jesting follows gluttony, sacred Scripture testifies, which says: "The people sat down to eat and drink, and they rose up to play." But before the body is moved to play, the tongue is moved to jokes and empty words. What therefore is indicated by the fact that the rich man placed in torments asks for his tongue to be cooled, except that he who by feasting had sinned more by talkativeness was burning more fiercely in his tongue through the justice of retribution?
