30.  For ‘the heart of the chief of the earth was changed,’ when the chief priests and elders of the people in Judaea set themselves to withstand Him by their counsels, Whom they beforehand proclaimed, that He was to come.  And when they strove to put out His Name by persecuting Him, being deceived by their own wickedness they vainly essayed to ‘wander where there is no way,’ because it was impossible that a ‘way’ could be open to their cruelty directed against the Creator of all things.  They saw the miracles, they were made to fear by His power [c], but refusing to believe, they still sought signs, whilst they said, what sign shewest Thou then, that we may see and believe Thee? [John 6, 30]  Therefore it is well said, They grope in the dark without light?  For he that hesitates in the midst of so many manifest miracles, as it were ‘gropes in the dark,’ in that he sees not what he is touching.  But every man that ‘staggers,’ is borne now hither, now thither: And because they were shown at one time to believe, as when they said, If this man were not of God He could do nothing [John 9, 33], and at another time denied that He was from God, as when they said contemning Him, Is not this the carpenter’s son?  Is not his mother called Mary?  and His brethren, James, and Joseph, and Simon, and Judas?  And His sisters, are they not all with us? [Matt. 13, 55. 56.] it is rightly added, He maketh, them to stagger like a drunken man.  For they saw both that He raised the dead, and yet that He was a mortal being.  Who would not believe that He was God, Whom they beheld raise the dead to life?  But on the other hand, when they saw that He was mortal, they scorned to believe that He was immortal God, and so herein, viz. that Almighty God manifested Himself such to their eyes as to be both capable of exhibiting divine signs and of undergoing human sufferings, He ‘made them to stagger like drunken men,’ that their pride, which chose rather to spurn the mystery of the Incarnation, than to follow it, should at one and the same time lift itself up against His human nature, and wonder at the power of His Divine nature shining within.  And because all these were made present to the eyes of blessed Job by the spirit of prophecy.
