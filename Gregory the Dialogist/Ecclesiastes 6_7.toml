The rich man reveals the great burning in his tongue when he says, “Send Lazarus to dip the end of his finger in water and cool my tongue, since I am tormented in this flame.” The unbelieving people keep the words of the law in their mouths but refuse to act on them. The burning will be greater in the place where they manifested that they knew what to do, but that they were unwilling to do it. Solomon said concerning those who are knowledgeable but remiss, “All the toil of a man is in his mouth, but his soul will not be filled.” Whoever labors only for this, to know what he should say, fasts with an empty heart from the nourishment that should provide him with knowledge.

A person's true life is not found here on earth, for he claims that it is found elsewhere. This, then, is the great advantage humankind has over the animal: The animal does not live on after death, while a person begins to live only when he has completed this visible life through bodily death.

Moreover he is shown to burn more in his tongue, when he says: "Send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, to cool my tongue, for I am tormented in this flame." The unbelieving people held the words of the law in their mouth, which they scorned to keep in deed. Therefore he will burn more there, where he showed himself to know what he was unwilling to do. Wherefore it is well said of the learned and negligent through Solomon: "All the labor of man is in his mouth, but his soul will not be filled," because whoever labors only to know what he ought to say, fasts with an empty mind from the very refreshment of his knowledge.
