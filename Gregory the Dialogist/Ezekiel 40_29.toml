"And he measured the gate according to the former measures, its chamber, and its front, and its vestibule with the same measures, and its windows, and its vestibule round about, fifty cubits in length, and twenty-five cubits in width, and the vestibule all around." What, therefore, is signified by the inner court, by the chamber, by the fronts, by the vestibule, by the windows, by the length and width, by the carving of palms, we have already spoken of extensively above, and it is not fitting that we should occupy ourselves again with the same things, but only with those which have not yet been said. Hence their ascent is first described through seven steps, and afterward through eight. For by the eighth step are signified the mysteries of that life which the perfect understand in their secret places, who have already learned to transcend all temporal things in mind, who fully despise the present life which unfolds in the course of seven days, who are nourished by intimate contemplation. Therefore the gates of the spiritual building have seven steps, because they preach to their hearers the fear of the Lord, piety and knowledge, fortitude and counsel, understanding and wisdom. But when they now command all things to be relinquished, when they admonish that nothing in this world be loved, nothing be held by affection, when they urge that one attend to the contemplation of the heavenly fatherland and delight in its mysteries, they add a step and bring them across to interior things.
