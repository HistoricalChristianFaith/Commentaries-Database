28. If this is read according to the historical sense, it is indicated that the boy Samuel grew in bodily age; but if, as with the rest, we examine these things by spiritual investigation, the Lord is described as being with him who is recorded to have grown. But he grows who advances in the age of mind toward a perfect man. Whence also through the Prophet it is said of the elect who are advancing: 'They shall walk from virtue to virtue; the God of gods shall be seen in Zion' (Psalm 83:8). Hence Paul says: 'Until we all come to meet him in a perfect man, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ' (Ephesians 4:13). But there are some who, while they grow in virtues, fall through pride. These indeed appear to grow, but nevertheless the Lord is not with them, because by thinking lofty things of themselves they cast away from themselves him whom, when established in the progress of virtues, they could have had with them through humility. Or if he is understood to have grown through outward dignity, the Lord is recorded as being with him, because indeed many are devout in a humbler rank; but when they suddenly reach the summit of dignity, they abandon their first works together with humility. Samuel therefore both advanced and in advancing had the Lord with him, so that he indeed displayed the manner of the elect preachers, who when they obtain gifts and dignities by which they may benefit others, do not neglect to please God in themselves, and from that source they multiply the gifts which they received for others, whereby they show forth in themselves the good which they desire to spread among them by speaking. Wherefore it is also added: (Verse 19.) 'And none of all his words fell to the ground.'

29. Indeed, the word of the preacher falls on the ground when it becomes worthless because of the preacher's reprobate conduct. Hence it is said by the voice of Truth: "It is good for nothing anymore, except to be cast out and trampled underfoot by men" (Matt. 5:13). And it should be noted that of all his words not one is said to have fallen to the ground, so that assuredly the preacher may do nothing that he rightly condemns. For whatever he forbids to be done, if he himself does it, his word falls to the ground, because while it is despised by the one speaking it, those who hear it by no means revere it. The Lord was forbidding any word from falling to the ground when He set forth to negligent preachers the sentence of their own negligence, saying: "Whoever breaks one of the least of these commandments and teaches men so, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but whoever practices and teaches them, shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven" (Matt. 5:19). For the preacher breaks not even the least commandment whose word, of all his words, does not fall to the ground. Moreover, when it is said that of all Samuel's words not one fell to the ground, whose character does Samuel represent, if not those who by the merit of both their preaching and their works are great in the kingdom of heaven? And so of all his words not one falls to the ground, because everything lofty that the perfect preacher of Holy Church speaks is also proclaimed by him through his sublime manner of life, since, as though stationed on a high watchtower, he both instructs the wise by his word and shows the simple by his works the path by which they ought to enter the eternal homeland. Hence it is also added: (Verse 20.) "And all Israel from Dan to Beersheba knew that Samuel was a faithful prophet of the Lord."

27. What does it mean that after Eli explained the vision, Samuel is said to have grown, except that the order of our teachers, after it repelled the sons of the Synagogue by the word, found a glory of greater reverence among the Gentiles? He grew, therefore, because he who first confined himself through the ministry of the word to one nation, afterward spread the fame of his holiness and teaching throughout the whole world. Whence it is also said through the Psalmist: "Their sound has gone out into all the earth, and their words to the ends of the world" (Ps. 19:4). Again, speaking of the holy Church, he says: "Instead of your fathers, sons have been born to you; you shall make them princes over all the earth" (Ps. 45:16). He grew, therefore, when he shone throughout the whole world. The Lord is also said to have been with him, because everything that gave forth the fragrance of holy fame, everything that shone brightly through the word, he received from the presence of the Redeemer whom he had with him. For even if Paul by the word penetrates not only what is weak and earthly, but also what is highest and heavenly, he obtains this power of speaking from him whom he affirms to be with him, saying: "Do you seek a proof of Christ who speaks in me" (2 Cor. 13:3)? For he who spoke in him was with him. He gives forth fragrance to the whole world through his life, but he draws the odor of life from him whom he reveals, saying: "We are the good fragrance of Christ in every place" (2 Cor. 2:15). John indicates that all things come from the presence of the Redeemer, for he says: "Of his fullness we have all received" (John 1:16). Therefore, when Samuel is said to have grown, the Lord is recalled as being with him, because when the order of teachers shone throughout the whole world with the grace of great holiness and teaching, it was able to appear so great because of him who did not abandon it while it was placed in the world. There follows: (Verse 20.) "And all Israel from Dan to Beersheba knew that Samuel was a faithful prophet of the Lord."
