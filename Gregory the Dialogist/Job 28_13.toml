66.  What is denoted in this passage by the title of the ‘land,’ saving the soul of man?  Concerning which the Psalmist saith, My soul thirsteth after Thee, as a land without water. [Ps. 143, 6]  But this wisdom cannot be ‘found in the land of those that live sweetly;’ because the man that is still fed with the pleasures of this life, is severed from the perception of Eternal Wisdom.  For if he were truly wise-minded, being banished from the interior delights, he would mourn over that blind estate of his exile, whereinto he has fallen.  For hence it is said by Solomon; He that addeth knowledge, addeth pain also. [Eccl. 1, 18]  For the more a man begins to know what he has lost, the more he begins to bewail the sentence of his corruption, which he has met with.  For he sees whence and whereto he has fallen; how that from the joys of Paradise he has come to the woes of the present life, from the companyings of the Angels to carings for necessities; he considers in what a number of perils he now lies prostrate, who before without peril disdained to stand; he bewails the exile which being accursed he undergoes, and sighs after the state of heavenly glory, which he might be enjoying in security, if he had not had a mind to commit sin.  Which same the Psalmist regarding rightly, saith, I said in my fear, I am cast out from the face of thine eyes. [Ps 31, 22]  For after contemplating the interior joys of the vision of God, and the assemblage in fellowship of the Angels holding fast, he brought back his eyes to things beneath, he saw where he was laid low, who was created for this end that he might have been able to stand in heavenly realms; he considered where he was, and where he was not he grieved to think, he mourned for himself as ‘cast out from the face of God’s eyes,’ because by comparison with the interior light, he had felt the darkness of his exile, that he was undergoing, to be the heavier.  Hence it is that he admits not to his soul the solace of any favouring from the present life, saying, I refused my soul to be comforted.  For oftentimes the rich ones of this world, being afflicted with weariness of spirit, are used to regard the good gifts bestowed on them in time, and to soften down their sadness.  For when they feel themselves affected with something of sadness, they look at their horses, they survey the vessels of their gold and their silver, they go the round of their estates.  And while they gladly carry their eyes through the range of these temporal things, they get the better of the sadness of soul that has risen up.  And hence Truth saith to them also in the Gospel; But woe unto you that are rich, for ye have your comfort here. [Luke 6, 24]  But the holy man, who mourns for this, that he has fallen from everlasting joys, does not admit consolation on the ground of things temporal, saying, I have refused my soul to be comforted.  As though he said in plain speech; ‘I, who do not grieve for the loss of temporal things, am utterly unable to be comforted by the abundance thereof.’  And as though we ourselves on hearing these things said to him, ‘What then dost thou seek, who refusest to find comfort in those things that are of the world?’ he thereupon added; I remembered God, and was delighted.  As if he said in plain terms; ‘Me not even the abundance of things earthly doth cheer, but even able to see, gives me delight.’  So then, this is the bitterness the remembrance only of my Maker, Whom as yet I am not of the wise, that whilst they are lifted up on high in hope, they do not bow down the mind here to any delights.  For hence it is written; The heart of the wise is where there is sorrow, and the heart of fools where there is mirth. [Eccl. 7, 4]  Hence James saith: Be afflicted and mourn and weep; let your laughter be turned to mourning, and your joy to heaviness. [James 4, 9]  Hence ‘Truth bears witness by Itself, saying, Blessed are they that mourn, for they shall be comforted.’ [Matt. 5, 4]  So wisdom cannot be ‘found in the land of those that live sweetly;’ because they are the more really foolish, in proportion as whilst parting with the greater things they delight themselves in the least.  Hence Peter blames that same folly of the wicked, saying, That count for pleasure the indulgence of the day of defilement and stain [Reading ‘coinquinationis,’ ‘coinquinationes.’  Vulg. as ours.]. [2 Peter 2, 13]  Hence Solomon saith, I counted laughter an error; and said to mirth, Why art thou vainly deceived? [Eccl. 2, 2]  Accordingly let the holy man say concerning Wisdom, Neither is it found in the land of those that live sweetly.  In this way plainly, that those who in this world live sweetly, are still so besotted, that this very thing too they know not, viz.  Whence they have fallen.
