“To whom have you given counsel? Perhaps to him that has no wisdom?” To “give counsel to one who is foolish” is an act of charity. To give it to one that is wise is an act of ostentation. But to pretend to give it to Wisdom itself is an act of perversity. Those visitors, who we have said are like those today who insist on their own way, were by their mode of speech playing toward ostentation rather than usefulness. Thus it is yet further rightly added against Bildad, “And you have displayed your prudence overmuch.” One who is rightly prudent does not overextend oneself because according to Paul’s declaration, he seeks “not to be wise above the degree that he ought to be wise.” But to one who is excessively prudent, the result is imprudence. For when prudence is carried beyond due measure, it is made to turn off the path on one side or another. “Excessive” prudence becomes evident when one seeks to appear more full of prudence than anyone else. Those who do not have the art to be wise in moderation are prone to mouth off with foolishness.
