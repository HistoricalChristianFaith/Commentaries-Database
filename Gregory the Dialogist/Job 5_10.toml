20.  Forasmuch as we believe that the friends of blessed Job were enlightened by their intercourse with him, we must needs handle these words of Eliphaz in a mystical manner.  Thus Almighty God ‘gives rain upon the earth,’ when He waters the withered hearts of the Gentiles with the grace of heavenly preaching, and He ‘sendeth waters upon all things,’ in that by the fulness of the Spirit He fashions the barrenness of lost man to fruitfulness; as ‘Truth’ says by His own lips, Whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him, shall never thirst.  But by the title of the universe man is denoted, in that in him there is set forth a true likeness and a large participation in common with the universe.  For every thing that is either is, yet does not live; or is and lives, yet does not feel; or is and lives and feels, yet neither understands nor discriminates; or is and lives and feels and understands and discriminates.  For stones are, yet do not live.  Trees both are and live, yet do not feel.  For their verdure is called the life of herbs and of trees, as is declared by Paul concerning seeds, Thou fool! that which thou sowest is not quickened except it die. [1 Cor. 15, 36]   Brute creatures both are and live and feel, yet do not understand.  Angels both are and live and feel, and by understanding they exercise discernment.  Man, then, in that he has it in common with stones to be, with trees to live, with animals to feel, with angels to discern, is rightly represented by the title of the ‘universe,’ in whom after some sort the ‘universe’ itself is contained.  And hence ‘the Truth’ saith to His disciples, Go ye into all the world, and preach the Gospel to every creature.  That is, He would have every creature to be taken for man only, in whom He created something common with all things.
 
21.  Though in this place, ‘all things’ may be understood in another sense also.  For the grace of the Holy Spirit in bringing the rich under its influence, does not keep back the poor; while it abases the strong, it does not forbid the weak to come to it; while it gathers together the noble, at the same time it lays hold of the base-born; while it takes up the wise, it disdains not the foolishness of the unskilful.  God, then, ‘sendeth waters upon all things,’ Who by the gift of the Holy Spirit calleth to the knowledge of Himself from every class of men.
 
22.  Again it may be that by the designation of ‘all things,’ the mere diversities of characters are set before us.  For one is lifted up by pride, another is bent down by the weight of fear, one burns with lust, another pants with avarice, one lets himself sink from listlessness, another is fired with rage.  But while, by the teaching of Holy Writ, humility is given to the proud man, confidence bestowed upon the fearful, the lustful cleansed from impurity by devotedness to chastity, the avaricious by moderation cooled from the heat of his covetous desires, the careless liver made erect by the uprightness of an earnest mind, the passionate man restrained from the hastiness of his headlong disposition, God ‘sendeth water upon all things,’ for He adapts the power of His Word in each severally according to the diversity of their characters, that each may find in His revelation that, whereby he may yield the produce of the virtue that he needs.  Hence it is said by a wise man of the sweetness of manna, Thou didst send them from heaven bread prepared without their labour, having in itself all delight, and the sweetness of every taste. [Wisd. 16, 20]  For the manna contained in itself all manner of delight and the sweetness of every taste, for this reason, that in the mouth of the spiritual sort it yielded a taste, according to the eater's will, in that the Divine Word, being at the same time suited to all minds, yet never at variance with itself, condescends to the kind and character of its hearers; and whereas every elect person understands it with profit according to his own fashion, he as it were turns the manna he received into a taste at will.  And forasmuch as after the toils of good practice comes the glory of compensation, it is rightly subjoined after the sending of water, Who setteth up on high those that be low, and those which mourn He exalteth with safety.
 
23.  ‘Those that be low are set on high,’ in that they, who are now despised for the love of God, shall then come as judges along with God, as ‘Truth’ pledges this which we have just named to the same humble ones, saying, Ye which have followed Me, in the Regeneration, when the Son of Man shall sit on the throne of His glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel. [Matt. 19, 28]  Then ‘those that mourn the Lord exalts with safety,’ in that they who, being inflamed with desire of Him, flee prosperity, endure crosses, undergo tortures at the hands of persecutors, chasten their own selves with grieving, are then vouchsafed a safety so much the more exalted, as they now from devout affection kill themselves to all the joys of the world.  Hence it is that it is said by Solomon, The heart knoweth his own soul's bitterness, and a stranger doth not intermeddle with his joy. [Prov. 14, 10]  For the human mind ‘knoweth its own soul's bitterness,’ when inflamed with aspirations after the eternal land, it learns by weeping the sorrowfulness of its pilgrimage.  But the ‘stranger doth not intermeddle with his joy,’ in that he, that is now a stranger to the grief of compunction, is not then a partaker in the joy of consolation.  Hence it is that ‘Truth’ saith in the Gospel, Verily, verily I say unto you, that ye shall weep and lament, but the world shall rejoice; and ye shall be sorrowful, but your sorrow shall be turned into joy. [John 16, 20]  And again, And ye therefore now have sorrow, but I will see you again, and your heart shall rejoice, and your joy no man taketh from you. [ver. 21. 22]  The Lord, then, is said ‘to exalt with safety those which mourn,’ in that to all, who for His sake are stricken with grief in time, He vouchsafes true salvation for their comfort.  But at the same time nothing hinders but that this may be understood of God's Elect even in this life.
 
24.  For those that be ‘low are set on high,’ in that when they abase themselves in humility, they mount above all sublunary things in the discernment of a lofty mind.  And, while they reckon themselves to be worthless in all things, by the discriminating view of a right mind, they surmount and trample upon the glory of this world.  Let us look at lowly Paul.  Mark how he says to his disciples, For we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord, and ourselves your servants for Christ's sake. [2 Cor. 4, 5]  Let us see this ‘humble man set up on high.’  He says, Know ye not that we shall judge Angels? [1 Cor. 6, 3] and again, And hath raised us together, and made us sit together in heavenly places. [Eph. 2, 6]  Perchance at that moment the chain was holding him outwardly fast bound.  Yet he had been ‘set on high’ within, who, by the certainty of his hope, was already sitting in heavenly places.  Holy men then are objects of scorn without, and as unworthy persons have every indignity put upon them, yet in sure confidence that they are meet for the heavenly realms, they look with certainty for the glory of the Eternal world.  And when they are hard pressed without in the assaults of persecution, they fall back within into the fortified stronghold of their mind; and thence they look down upon all things passing far below them, and amongst them they see passing even themselves as in the body.  They dread no threats, for even tortures they so endure as to set them at nought.  For it is hence that it is said by Solomon, But the righteous shall be bold as a lion. [Prov. 28, 1]  Hence it is written again by the same, The righteous man shall not be grieved by any thing that shall happen to him. Prov. 12, 21]  For because all the righteous are seated on the lofty height of their purposed mind, whereas in dying they are not sensible of death, it is so in a marvellous manner, that the missiles of the reprobate at the same time both strike them, and do not reach them.  Those then that are ‘low are set up on high,’ in that from the very circumstance that they despise themselves in all things, they are rendered the more secure against them all.
 
25.  Contrary to which it is rightly delivered by the Prophet to the lost soul under the likeness of Babylon, Come down and sit in the dust, O virgin daughter of Babylon, sit on the ground; there is no throne for the daughter of the Chaldeans. [Is. 47, 1]  For here I think the human mind is called a virgin, not as undefiled, but as unproductive.  And forasmuch as Babylon is rendered ‘confusion,’ the barren soul is rightly named the daughter of Babylon, who, in that she never puts forth good works, whilst she is framed on no method of a right life, is as it were engendered of the parentage of confusion.  But if she is called a virgin not as being barren but undefiled, after that she is fallen from the state of saving health, it is only to the increase of her ‘confusion’ that she is called that which she once was.  And it is fitly that the Divine voice, in rebuking her, saith to her, Come down; for the human mind is stationed on high, when it covets the rewards above; but it ‘comes down’ from this station, when being overcome it yields itself cowardly to decaying worldly desires.  And it is immediately subjoined to her with justice, And sit in the dust.  For ‘coming down she sits in the dust,’ in that quitting heavenly scenes, she grovels in the very lowest [b], being stained with earthly imaginations.  And here it is yet further added by way of repetition, Sit on the ground.  As if in uttering reproaches he said in plain words, ‘Because thou refusedst to lift thyself by a heavenly conversation, laid prostrate beneath thyself, be degraded in earthly courses.’ And hence it is forthwith added by a necessary consequence, There is no throne for the daughter of the Chaldeans.  For the Chaldeans are translated ‘fierce.’  And they are very fierce, who, pursuing their own wills, refuse to spare even their own lives.  Earthly desires are ‘fierce,’ which render the mind hard and insensible not only to the precepts of the Creator, but also to the blows of stripes.  But the ‘daughter of the fierce ones has no throne,’ in that the mind that is born to the love of the world by bad desires, and is by those same desires rendered obdurate, herein that she yields herself to earthly concupiscence, parts with the seat of judgment, and she sits as mistress upon no throne within her, in that she lacks the balance of discernment, and is withheld from the sitting of her judgment, because she ranges abroad among external lusts.  For it is clear that that mind, which has lost the seat of counsel within, in a thousand ways dissipates itself without in desires.  And because it shut the eyes to doing what it understands, it is deservedly blinded, so as not even to know what it does; and oftentimes by a deserved visitation it is left in its own will, and is set loose under those very toilsome services of the world, which it pants after with solicitude.  Hence it is fitly added in that place, For thou shall no more be called tender and delicate.  Take the millstones, and grind meal. [Is. 27, 2]  It is well known that parents spare their tender daughter, nor charge her with hard and servile employments.  So Almighty God as it were calls a daughter tender when He recalls the well-beloved soul of each person from the wearisome services of this world, that, whilst it is charged with external works, it be not hardened to internal desires.  But the ‘daughter of the Chaldeans’ is not called ‘soft and tender,’ in that the mind, which is abandoned to evil inclinations, is left in this world's travail, the thing which it most anxiously desires.  So that like a handmaid she drudges in the service of the world without, who refuses as a daughter to love God within.  Hence she is bidden to ‘take the millstone, and grind meal.’  A millstone is whirled round in a circle, and the meal is thrown out.  Now each separate course of this world's action is a mill, which, while it heaps up a multitude of cares, as it were whirls the minds of men in a circle, and she as it were throws forth the meal from herself, in that, when the heart is turned wrong, she is ever producing infinitely little thoughts.  But it sometimes happens that he, who while at rest is accounted of some worth, on being placed in any scene of action is stripped bare.  Hence we have it forthwith subjoined in that place, Uncover thy baseness, make bare the shoulder, uncover the thighs, pass over the rivers.  For in the execution of a work ‘baseness is uncovered,’ in that the base and abject soul is made known in the manifestation of working, whereas before while at rest, it was accounted great.  The mind ‘makes bare the shoulder,’ when it brings to light its practice, which was kept from view.  It ‘uncovers the thighs,’ in that it plainly discovers, by what strides of desire it reaches after the advantages of the world.  Furthermore ‘it passes over the rivers,’ in that it unceasingly pursues the courses of this present life, which are daily running out to their end.  And, whilst it gives over one set, and follows after another, it is as it were ever going on from river to river.  These things we have delivered by way of discussion in few words, in order to show where that mind lies grovelling, which has been unseated from the throne of a holy purpose.  For if it ever cease to pant after the things which are above it, it plunges even unceasingly below itself.  But it is fixed on high, if, abandoning the love of temporal things, it is bound fast to the hope of a changeless eternity.
