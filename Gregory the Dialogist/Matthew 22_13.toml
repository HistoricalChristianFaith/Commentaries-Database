But since we have said these few things for the consolation of one who has it but is weak, let us now turn our words to him who does not have it at all. It follows: "Then the king said to the servants: Bind his hands and feet, and cast him into the outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth."

Then the feet and hands are bound by the strictness of the sentence, which now refused to be bound from wicked works through amendment of life. Or certainly, punishment then binds those whom guilt now bound from good works. For the feet that neglect to visit the sick, the hands that give nothing to the needy, are already bound from good work by their own will. Therefore, those who now are willingly bound in vice will then be unwillingly bound in punishment.

Moreover, it is well said that he is cast into the outer darkness. For we call the inner darkness the blindness of the heart, but the outer darkness the eternal night of damnation. Therefore, every condemned person is sent not into the inner but into the outer darkness, because he who here willingly fell into blindness of heart is there unwillingly cast into the night of damnation. Where there is said to be weeping and gnashing of teeth, so that there the teeth may gnash which here rejoiced in gluttony; there the eyes may weep which here were occupied with unlawful desires; so that each and every member may be subjected to punishment which here served in subjection to each and every vice.
