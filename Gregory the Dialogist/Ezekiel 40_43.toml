This is indeed the office of discipline, so that it knows how prudently to punish sins as well as how piously to remit them. But those who do not possess the spirit of discernment remit the sins so that they do not correct them or strike in such a way that they pretend to correct them but do not actually remit them. Therefore let the teacher who must speak of the control of discipline know that he is a table of God, and let him bend his lip inward so that what he says in preaching he may vigilantly practice beneath the spirit of discernment.
