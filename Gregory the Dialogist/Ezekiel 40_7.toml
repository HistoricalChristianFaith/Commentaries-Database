And every little chamber was one reed long, and one reed broad.

Let us consider what usually happens in a bridal chamber, and from that let us understand what takes place in the holy Church. In the bridal chamber, of course, the bridegroom and bride are joined in covenant and united to each other in love. What then are the bridal chambers in the holy Church, if not the hearts of those in whom the soul is joined through love to the invisible bridegroom, so that it burns with desire for him, no longer covets the things that are in the world, considers the length of this present life a punishment, hastens to depart, and rests in the embrace of love in the vision of the heavenly bridegroom? The mind, therefore, that is already such receives no consolation from the present life, but sighs from its inmost depths for him whom it loves, burns, pants, is filled with anxiety. The very health of the body becomes worthless to it, because it has been pierced by the wound of love; hence in the Song of Songs it says: I am wounded by love. But it is an evil health of the heart that knows not the pain of this wound. But when it has begun to pant for heavenly desire and to feel the wound of love, the soul becomes healthier from the wound, whereas before it was sick from health.

But for the soul that strongly loves her spouse, there is usually one consolation for the delay of this present life: that through the very fact that she herself is deferred from the vision of him, the souls of others may profit by her word and be kindled with the flames of love toward the heavenly spouse. She grieves because she sees herself delayed; everything she beholds is sad to her, because she does not yet see him whom she longs to see. But as I said, it is no small consolation if, while a fervent soul is delayed, many are gathered through her, so that she may see late with many the one whom she wished to see sooner alone. Hence again the bride says in the Song of Songs: "Stay me with flowers, and surround me with apples, for I languish with love." For what are flowers except souls already beginning a good work and giving forth the fragrance of heavenly desire? What are apples from flowers except the already perfect minds of the good, who arrive at the fruit of good work from the beginning of holy purpose? She who languishes with love therefore seeks to be stayed with flowers and surrounded with apples, because if she is not yet permitted to see him whom she desires, it is a great consolation to her if she may rejoice in the progress of others. Therefore the soul languishing with holy love is stayed with flowers and apples, so that she may find rest in the good work of her neighbor, she who is not yet able to contemplate the face of God.

Let us consider, I ask, what kind of bridal chamber the mind of Paul had been, who said: "For me to live is Christ, and to die is gain." How greatly had he joined himself to almighty God in love, he who reckoned that Christ alone was life to him, and that to die was gain? Hence it is that he says again: "Having a desire to be dissolved and to be with Christ, which is far better." But behold, you who desire to be dissolved, let us see with what love you languish. Since you perceive that you are being delayed in the meantime, do you not seek, I ask, to be supported with flowers? You do indeed seek this, for it follows: "Nevertheless to remain in the flesh is necessary for your sake." And to his advancing disciples he says: "For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of glory? Is it not you before our Lord Jesus Christ?"

Hence it is that the same chamber is said to be measured at one reed in length and one reed in breadth. For length pertains to the longsuffering of expectation, and breadth to the amplitude of charity. Therefore each chamber has as much in length as it could have in breadth, because the mind kindled with heavenly desire exhibits as much longsuffering in waiting for God as it has love for gathering in the neighbor, and patiently bears the delays of length because the amplitude of charity expands itself in the advancement of the neighbor. The length can also designate the longsuffering of patience which is shown to the neighbor. And because breadth signifies charity, which opens the bosom of the mind and receives both friends and enemies alike into love, the length of the chamber is as great as its breadth, because as broad as the mind has been through love, so patient will it also be through longsuffering. For one bears the neighbor as much as one loves. For if you love, you bear; if you cease to love, you cease to tolerate. For the one whom we love less, we also tolerate less, because, when weariness rushes in, the deeds of the neighbor are more quickly brought into the weight of a burden which the wing of charity does not lighten for us.

And between the little chambers were five cubits.

He had said one above concerning the bedchamber, and afterwards he relates that there are five cubits between the bedchambers: for the reason evidently that many bedchambers make one, just as many Churches are also called one Church. Hence also in the Apocalypse of John it is written to seven Churches, through which one catholic Church is designated. Therefore those who in the holy Church, as we have said, thirst with fervent love to see God, and are now joined to Him through desire, are called bedchambers. But nevertheless there are in her certain ones who, not being able to penetrate subtle things, and still weighed down by the five bodily senses, love Him who made all things so much less as they are more bound up in those things which have been made. And indeed they now strive to exercise themselves in the fear of the Lord, and to extend themselves in love of neighbor, to do good works bodily, to redeem sins through almsgiving; but because they do not know how to burn with intimate love toward heavenly desire, they are held as if still bound by bodily senses. Therefore these are not bedchambers, but nevertheless they are contained among the bedchambers, because through the guidance of those who perfectly love the vision of God, they themselves also are directed toward advancement of mind. Therefore there are five cubits between the bedchambers, because those who from the five exterior senses do not yet rise up to mystical understanding, while they are among those who burn with the spirit of love, as if remaining among the bedchambers they make progress in the construction of faith, and are not separated from the measure of the heavenly building. For they also withdraw themselves somewhat from the appetite of bodily senses, and with the space of the mind enlarged, imitating the charity which they behold, they are extended on this side and that toward the bedchambers. The fact therefore that they are described not by six cubits, but by five, designates their very imperfection still remaining.

But nevertheless through good desire they are remembered in the measure of the spiritual edifice, because by the voice of holy Church it is said through the Psalmist: Your eyes saw my imperfection, and in your book all shall be written. Hence again the same Psalmist says: The Lord has blessed all who fear him, the small with the great. Therefore even if these are imperfect and small, yet insofar as they are able to know, they love both God and neighbor, and therefore do not neglect to do the good works they can. Even if they do not yet advance to spiritual gifts, so as to raise their soul either to perfect action or to fervent contemplation, nevertheless they do not withdraw from the love of God and neighbor, insofar as they are able to grasp in their mind. Whence it happens that they too, though in a lesser place, are nevertheless set in the edification of holy Church, because even if they are perhaps lesser for teaching, for prophecy, for the grace of miracles, for more fully carrying out contempt of the world, nevertheless they are in the foundation of fear and love, in which they are made firm, because even if they do not burn with the fire of heavenly desire, they are animated by the warmth of charity in those outward things which they are able to practice, and are contained among the edifices of their more excellent neighbors. Whence the bride also rightly speaks in the Song of Songs, saying: King Solomon made himself a litter from the woods of Lebanon, its pillars he made of silver, its reclining seat of gold, its ascent of purple, its middle he spread with love on account of the daughters of Jerusalem. For it should not be believed that Solomon, a king of such greatness, who so abounded in immense riches that the weight of his gold could not be estimated and silver in those days had no value, made himself a wooden litter. But our Solomon is clearly the peaceful one, who made himself a litter from the woods of Lebanon. For the cedar woods of Lebanon are indeed very resistant to decay.

The banquet litter of our King, therefore, is the holy Church, which is constructed from strong fathers, that is, from incorruptible minds. It is rightly called a banquet litter because it carries souls daily to the eternal feast of its Creator. Silver columns have been made for this litter, because the preachers of the holy Church shine with the light of eloquence. Moreover, with the silver columns there is a golden reclining place, because through what is spoken luminously by the holy preachers, the minds of the hearers find the splendor of inner brightness in which they may recline. For through what they hear lucidly and openly, they rest in that which shines bright in the heart. Therefore its columns are silver and a golden reclining place has been made, because through the light of the word, brightness of rest is found in the soul. Indeed, that inner splendor illuminates the mind, so that through contemplation it rests there where the grace of preaching is not sought. For concerning this same holy Church it is written: "The wings of a dove covered with silver, and the feathers of her back with the gleam of gold." For she who here, filled with the spirit of meekness, has silvered wings like a dove, contains in the feathers of her back the appearance of gold, because here she clothes her preachers with the light of the word; but in the age to come she displays the splendor of brightness in herself. But to that which is shown bright within, what the ascent is like he adds, when he immediately continues concerning the same litter: "A purple ascent." For true purple, because it is dyed with blood, is not undeservedly seen in the color of blood. And because a very great multitude of the faithful in the beginning of the nascent Church came to the kingdom through the blood of martyrdom, our King made a purple ascent in the litter, because to that bright place which is seen within, one arrives through the tribulation of blood.

What then shall we miserable ones, destitute of all fortitude, what shall we do? Behold, we cannot be pillars in this litter, because in us neither the fortitude of work nor the light of preaching shines forth. We do not have a golden reclining place, because we do not yet behold, as we ought, through spiritual understanding, the rest of inner clarity. We are not a purple ascent, because we are unable to pour out our blood for our Redeemer. What then is to be done about us? What hope will there be, if no one reaches the kingdom except one who has been endowed with the highest virtues? But our consolation is also at hand. Let us love God as much as we can, let us love our neighbor also, and at the same time we too belong to God's litter, because as it is written there: "The middle he spread with love." For have love, and you will without doubt arrive there where the silver pillars are raised up and the purple ascent is held. For that this is said on account of our weakness is openly shown, when it immediately adds there: "For the daughters of Jerusalem." For the word of God, which says not sons but daughters, what else did it signify through the female sex than the weakness of minds? Therefore, that which is said there—that love is in the middle among the silver pillars, the golden reclining place, and the purple ascent for the sake of the daughters of Jerusalem—this is designated here among the chambers by the five cubits, because even those who are weak in virtues, if they do not neglect to do the good things they can with love, are not strangers to the building of God.

And the threshold of the gate by the porch of the gate within was one reed.

While the threshold which is now described is mentioned to be inside next to the vestibule of the gate, it is openly shown that the threshold which was described before was outside. But if the gate is the Lord, let us inquire what the threshold of the gate inside and outside might be. For through the threshold everyone enters the gate. And what are these two thresholds, except the fathers of the Old Testament and the fathers of the New Testament? For not only those from whom the Lord deigned to become incarnate, but all the fathers of the Old Testament were the threshold of this gate, because those who merited to foretell Him and to hope in Him opened the entrance of faith to all coming to Him; and all who believed in the Lord through these, as it were, already entered the gate of this threshold. But why is it called before the outer threshold and after the inner threshold, except because first were the fathers of the Old Testament, and afterward the teachers of the New Testament? Rightly, moreover, the outer threshold designates the fathers of the Old Testament, because through their preaching perverse works were punished. But through the sayings of the new fathers, the mind of each person is restrained even from illicit thoughts, while guilt is shown to be complete even in the deliberation of the heart. For those took care to prohibit the souls of their hearers from shameful acts, from cruelties, from robberies; but these, since they cut off not only perverse works but also illicit thoughts, what else have they become for us except an inner threshold? Hence Truth Himself also speaks, saying: "You have heard that it was said to the ancients: You shall not kill, and whoever kills will be guilty of judgment. But I say to you that everyone who is angry with his brother without cause will be guilty of judgment." Rightly also the outer threshold designates those fathers who stood at a greater distance through intervals of time from the very incarnation of our Redeemer. And indeed from the blood of Abel the passion of the Church already began, and there is one Church of the elect who preceded and who followed. But nevertheless, because it is said to the disciples: "Many kings and prophets wished to see what you see, and did not see," for the ancient fathers to have stood as it were outside is not to have seen corporally the presence of our Redeemer. Therefore they were outside, but nevertheless not separated from the holy Church, because in mind, in work, in preaching, they already held these sacraments of faith, they already beheld this loftiness of the holy Church, which we behold not yet by awaiting but already by possessing. For just as we are saved in the past passion of our Redeemer, so they were saved through faith in the same passion to come. Therefore they were outside not beyond the mystery, but beyond the time.

Hence also in the construction of the tabernacle, so that the silver columns might stand within, bronze pegs were commanded to be fixed around the outside, by which the tabernacle would be held bound. Thus silver columns are fixed within, but bronze pegs without, and ropes are tied to these so that the tabernacle might remain fixed, because clearly so that the holy apostles might stand firm in the light of their preaching, so that the whole tabernacle, that is, the holy Church, might stand in the integrity of faith, the fathers of the Old Testament and the prophets were fixed outside like bronze pegs, who would bind the minds of preachers in firmness by the ropes of their words, and would tie this dwelling place of God in the state of faith. Therefore the pegs are outside, those who existed before the time of this holy Church. But nevertheless they bind those who are within it, because while they proclaim the heavenly mysteries to come, they made these things credible to all after they were revealed. Therefore, so that the columns might stand immovable within, the pegs outside hold the ropes, because so that the holy apostles might perfectly believe the mystery of the Lord's incarnation, the preaching of those prevailed who were able both to see and to foretell this before it happened. Hence rightly also the first of the apostles himself, that great column of the true tabernacle, speaks saying: "We have the more sure prophetic word, to which you do well to attend, as to a lamp shining in a dark place." By these words he indicates that although it has risen to higher things from the summit, it persists bound there in faith. Yet this lamp of the prophetic word indeed shines for those who understand, but still remains covered with the obscurities of allegories for those who do not understand. Hence also through the Psalmist it is said of the same sayings of the prophets: "Dark water in the clouds of the air," because clearly the knowledge is hidden in the prophets. And not undeservedly were the columns made of silver, but the pegs of bronze, because what the apostles now preach clearly, the prophets spoke obscurely under mystical understanding. Rightly therefore they were signified by the metal of bronze, who were not clear in their preaching. But the holy apostles, because they had the light of preaching concerning the mystery of our Redeemer, were represented by silver columns. And it should be noted that silver both sounds and shines, but bronze sounds and does not shine, because the preachers of the New Testament spoke openly what they were also able to show. But the preachers of the Old Testament, because they brought forth obscure sayings about the heavenly mystery through the shadows of allegories, gave forth sound as it were without light. Therefore what is designated there by pegs and columns is designated here by the outer threshold and the inner threshold.

But if in this place we understand the gate to mean Holy Scripture, it too has two thresholds, an outer and an inner, because it is divided into the literal sense and the allegorical. The outer threshold of Holy Scripture is indeed the letter; but its inner threshold is allegory. For since we proceed through the letter to allegory, we come as it were from the threshold which is outer to that which is inner. And there are very many things in it which so edify the mind according to the letter that through what is outwardly treated, the mind of the hearer is drawn inward. For there we find the precepts of work from the examples of virtue; there it is commanded what we ought to do even bodily; there what is prescribed for doing is shown in the action of holy and brave men, so that after the clearer precepts and examples of the just instruct us for good work, then we may direct the foot of the mind, if we can, to the inner threshold, that is, to the mystical understanding of intimate contemplation. Strive, I beseech you, dearest brothers, to meditate on the words of God; do not despise the writings of our Redeemer which have been sent to us. It is of very great value that through them the soul is rekindled to warmth, lest it grow numb from the cold of its iniquity.

When we learn that the righteous who came before us acted bravely, we ourselves are girded for the strength of good work, and the soul of the reader is set aflame by the flame of holy examples. He sees what brave deeds were done by them, and is greatly indignant with himself because he does not imitate such things. Hence it is rightly said in the voice of the bridegroom to the bride in the Song of Songs: "Your neck is like the tower of David, which was built with its battlements. A thousand shields hang from it, all the armor of the mighty." For in the neck is the throat, and in the throat is the voice.

What therefore is designated by the neck of holy Church, if not her sacred utterances? When a thousand shields are mentioned as hanging upon it, by this perfect number the universal number is shown, because all our protection is contained in sacred utterance. For there are the commandments of God, there the examples of the righteous. For if the soul grows sluggish from desire for its Creator, let it hear what is said: "You shall love the Lord your God with all your mind, and with all your strength." Perhaps one slips into hatred of neighbor? Let him hear what is said: "You shall love your neighbor as yourself." Does he covet another's possessions? Let him hear what is written there: "You shall not covet your neighbor's goods." Is the mind kindled to anger over an injury inflicted by a neighbor's word or deed? Let him hear what is said: "You shall not seek vengeance, nor be mindful of the injury of your fellow citizens." Is a badly wounded mind kindled to lust of the flesh? Lest the eye follow the mind, let him hear what was said a little earlier: "Whoever looks at a woman to lust after her has already committed adultery with her in his heart." Does someone perhaps dispose his soul to relax into hatred against an enemy? Let him hear what is written there: "Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you." But he who no longer seizes another's goods, does he perhaps still retain his own in a disordered way? Let him hear what is said there: "Sell what you possess, and give alms." Does a weak soul desire to enjoy both God and the world at the same time? Let him hear what is written there: "No one can serve two masters." Does another retain his possessions not for the necessity of sustenance, but according to the will of desire? Let him hear what is said there: "Whoever does not renounce all that he possesses cannot be my disciple." For some leave all things, but many even while possessing them renounce them, because they retain their possessions for use in such a way that they do not succumb to them through desire. Does someone wish to be idle, and even when he has the strength, does he flee from undertaking labor for the Lord? Let him hear what is written there: "He who does not gather with me, scatters." Therefore in the neck of the Church, that is, in the preaching of sacred utterance, which is said to be like the tower of David because of its protection and height, a thousand shields hang, because however many commandments are there, so many also are the defenses of our heart.

To preserve innocence, then, do we hasten to endure in humility even when harmed by our neighbor? Let Abel come before our eyes, who is both written to have been killed by his brother and is not read to have resisted. Is purity of mind chosen even in the conjugal bond? Enoch ought to be imitated, who, though placed in marriage, walked with God and was not found, because God translated him. Do we hasten to place God's precepts before our present advantage? Let Noah come before our eyes, who, setting aside domestic care, at the command of the almighty Lord, lived occupied for a hundred years in the construction of the ark. Do we strive to undertake the virtue of obedience? We ought to look upon Abraham, who, leaving behind home, kindred, and country, obeyed to go out to the place he was to receive as an inheritance, and went out not knowing where he was going; who stood ready to kill, for the sake of an eternal inheritance, the beloved heir he had received. And because he did not delay to offer his only one to the Lord, he received the whole multitude of nations in his seed. Does simplicity of character please us? Let Isaac come to mind, whom the tranquility of his life adorned in the eyes of almighty God. Is laborious fortitude sought, that it may be obtained? Let Jacob be brought to memory, who, after he learned to serve a man bravely, was also brought to such virtue that he could not be overcome by the wrestling angel. Do we endeavor to conquer the enticement of the flesh? Let Joseph return to memory, who, when his mistress was tempting him, strove to guard the continence of the flesh even at the peril of his life. Whence it came about that because he knew how to rule his own members well, he was also set over all Egypt to rule. Do we seek to obtain meekness and patience? Let us bring Moses before our eyes, who, ruling six hundred thousand armed men, not counting the little ones and women, is described as being meek above all men who dwelt upon the face of the earth. Are we kindled by zeal for righteousness against vices? Let Phinehas be brought before our eyes, who, piercing with a sword those who were lying together, restored chastity to the people, and being angry, appeased the wrath of God. Do we seek to presume upon the hope of almighty God in doubtful matters? Let us recall Joshua to memory, who, while he undertook doubtful battles with a certain mind, arrived at victory without doubt. Do we now desire to lay aside enmities of the mind and enlarge our soul in benignity? Let Samuel be brought into thought, who, cast down from leadership by the people, when the same people asked that he pour out prayers to the Lord for them, responded saying: Far be this sin against the Lord from me, that I should cease to pray for you. For the holy man believed he would perpetrate a fault if he did not return the benignity of grace in prayer to those whom he had endured as adversaries even to the point of being cast down. Who again, when, at the Lord's command, he was being sent to anoint David as king, responded: How shall I go? For Saul will find me and kill me. And yet because he knew God was angry with the same Saul, he had afflicted himself with such great mourning that the Lord said to him directly: How long will you mourn for Saul, when I have rejected him? Let us consider, therefore, how great an ardor of charity had inflamed his soul, who both wept for the one by whom he feared to be killed. But do we wish to beware of one whom we fear? We must consider with anxious mind, lest if perhaps we find an opportunity, we render evil for evil to the very one we flee. Therefore let David return to memory, who both found the king persecuting him so that he could have killed him, and yet, placed in that very power of striking, chose the good that he himself ought to do, not however the evil that the other deserved to suffer, saying: Far be it from me that I should put my hand upon the Lord's anointed. And when the same Saul had afterward been slain by enemies, he wept for the one slain whom he had endured as a persecutor while he lived. Do we determine to speak freely to the erring powers of this world? Let the authority of John be brought back to mind, who, reproving the wickedness of Herod, did not fear to be killed for the rectitude of his word. And because Christ is the truth, he therefore laid down his life for Christ, because for the truth. Do we hasten now to lay down our flesh for God in death? Let Peter come to mind, who rejoices amid scourgings, who resists the rulers though beaten, who despises his life for the sake of life. With the desire for death, do we resolve to despise adversities? Let us bring Paul before our eyes, who, prepared not only to be bound but also to die for Christ, does not make his life more precious than himself. Do we seek to have our heart kindled with the fire of charity? Let us consider the words of John, whose every utterance breathes with the fire of charity.

Because therefore in the voice of sacred Scripture, while we seek the protection of any virtue we find it, a thousand shields hang from it, all the armor of the mighty. For if we wish to fight against spiritual wickedness, let us seek weapons of protection in the neck of the Church, which has been raised up for us like a tower of David, that is, in the divine Scripture, so that from the discernment of the commandment, the strength of assistance may be taken up against vices. For behold, do we hasten to be strong against the powers of the air? In this tower we find the armor of our mind, so that from there we may take up the commandments of the Creator, from there the examples of those who went before, through which we may be armed invincibly against our adversaries. For when you desire to undertake any virtue, and you see it already fulfilled there by the fathers, there you find your armor, through which you may be fortified against spiritual battles. Indeed a thousand shields hang from it: if anyone desires to fight, let him take it up, and from that virtue let him fortify his breast, and let him send forth the javelins of words.

And it should be noted that it is said to be built with its battlements. For battlements serve the same purpose as shields, because both protect the one fighting. But between the two there is this difference: we move a shield wherever we wish for our protection; but we can defend ourselves with a battlement, yet we cannot move it. A shield is in the hand, for a battlement is not held. What then is the difference between battlements and shields, except that in sacred Scripture we read both the miracles of the preceding fathers and hear of the virtues of their good works? For there we learn that one was able to divide the sea, another to make the sun stand still, another to raise the dead, another to lift up a paralytic by his word, another to heal the sick by his shadow, another to drive away fevers through his handkerchiefs. Yet all these men were gentle with the longsuffering of patience and fervent with zeal for righteousness; rich in the preaching of the word and likewise in the generosity of mercy. Therefore their miracles testify how truly they spoke of God, because they would not have done such things through Him unless they had spoken truly about Him. And their deeds testify how pious, how humble, how kind they were. If therefore we are tempted regarding the faith which we have received from their preaching, let us behold the miracles of those who spoke, and we are confirmed in the faith which we received from them. What then are their miracles if not our battlements? Because we can be protected by them, and yet we do not hold these in the hand of our own choice, for we are not able to do such things. But a shield is in the hand and defends, because the virtue of patience, the virtue of mercy, with grace going before us, is both within the power of choice and protects from the danger of adversity. Therefore our tower has been built with its battlements, on which a thousand shields hang, because in sacred Scripture we are hidden from the darts of adversity under the miracles of the fathers, and we also hold the defenses of holy conduct in the hand of our work. But it should be noted that the threshold of the gate is measured by one reed. Now the reed extends to six cubits and a handbreadth, because clearly in sacred Scripture both the teaching of perfect action and the beginning of heavenly contemplation are found. But if by gate in this place each preacher is understood, the outer threshold in the gate is the active life, while the inner threshold is the contemplative life. For through the former one walks in faith, through the latter one hastens toward sight. The former leads outwardly, so that each person ought to live well; the latter leads inwardly, so that from the good life one may attain to eternal joys. Let it suffice that we have treated these matters today. For since, passing on to other things, we have spoken at length through digression, let us reserve what follows for another reading, hoping to be refreshed through silence in the Word, who lives and reigns with the Father in the unity of the Holy Spirit, through all ages of ages. Amen.
