Hence the Lord also explains this same comparison briefly when he adds: So it will be at the end of the world. The angels will go out and separate the wicked from among the righteous, and will cast them into the furnace of fire. There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. This, dearest brothers, is to be feared rather than expounded. For the torments of sinners have been spoken in plain words, lest anyone resort to the excuse of ignorance if something about eternal punishment were spoken obscurely.
