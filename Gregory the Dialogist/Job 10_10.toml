78.  For man when fashioned was moulded like clay, but being propagated he is ‘poured out like milk’ in the seed, and is ‘curdled like cheese’ in the flesh, and he is ‘clothed with skin and flesh,’ and is rendered firm by bones and sinews.  Therefore by clay we have set forth to us the character of the first creating, but by milk the order of the subsequent conception, in that by the stages of curdling, it goes on little by little to be wrought strong into bones.  But the account of the body as it was created is but slender praise of God, unless at the same time there be afterwards set forth the marvellous inspiration of its quickening.  Hence it is added,
Thou hast granted me life and mercy.
79.  But the Creator vouchsafes to us blessings in vain, except He Himself keep safe all whatsoever He giveth.  It follows, And Thy visitation hath preserved my spirit.  Now all this that we have spoken of the exterior man, in what sense it may accord with the interior man, it is well to unfold and exhibit in few words,
Remember, I beseech Thee, that Thou hast made me as the clay.
80.  For our interior man proves like clay, in that the grace of the Holy Spirit is, infused into the earthly mind, that it may be lifted up to the understanding of its Creator.  For the thinking faculty in man, which is dried up by the barrenness of its sin, through the power of the Holy Spirit grows green, like land when it is watered.  Now it very often happens that whilst we use without let or hindrance the endowments of virtue by gift from above, by being used to such uninterrupted prosperity we are lifted up to self-confidence.  Whence it very often happens that the same Holy Spirit, Which had exalted us, leaves us for a time, in order to show mere man to himself.  And this is what the holy man immediately sets forth, when he adds, And wilt Thou, bring me into dust again?  For as by the withdrawal of the Spirit the soul is left for a space under temptation, it is as if the ground were dried of its former moisture; that by being so forsaken it may be made sensible of its weakness, and learn how man was dried up without the infusion of heavenly grace.  And he is fitly described as being ‘brought into dust again,’ in that when he is left to himself he is caught up by the breath of every temptation.  But whereas on being left we are exposed to shocks, those gifts which we knew when we were inspired, we now think of more nicely.  Whence he adds, Hast Thou not poured me out like milk, and curdled me like cheese?  For when by the grace of the Holy Spirit our mind is withdrawn from the way of its former conversation, it is as if ‘milk poured out,’ in that it is formed in the sort of tenderness and delicacy of a new beginning.  And it is ‘curdled like cheese,’ in that it is bound up in the consistency of consolidating thought, never from henceforth to let itself go loose in desires, but concentrating itself in a single affection, to rise up into a substantial remoulding.  But it very often happens that the flesh, from old habit, murmurs against this spiritual embryo, and the soul meets with war from the man which it bears about without it.  And hence he adds, Thou hast clothed me with skin and flesh.  For the interior man is ‘clothed with skin and flesh,’ since wherein it is raised up to things above, it is straitly blockaded with the besieging of fleshly motions.  Now one that is going on to righteousness our Creator never forsakes under temptation, Who by the inspiration of His Grace preventeth even him that is sinning; but the soul that is lifted up He both lets loose to wars without, and endues with strength within.  And hence it is yet further fitly subjoined, And hast fenced me with bones and sinews.  With ‘flesh and skin we are clothed,’ but we are ‘fenced with bones and sinews,’ in that though we receive a shock by temptation assaulting us from without, yet the hand of the Creator strengthens us within, that we should not be shattered.  And so by the promptings of the flesh, He abases us in respect of His gifts, but by the bones of virtue He strengthens us against temptations.  Therefore he says, Thou, hast clothed me with skin and flesh, and hast fenced me with bones and sinews.  As if it were in plain words, ‘Without Thou dost abandon me to undergo trial, yet within, that I may not perish, Thou keepest me by bracing me with virtue.’ And for this reason He gives us righteousness to live as we ought, because in His loving-kindness He spares the past misdeeds whereby we have done amiss.  And hence it is further added with propriety,
Thou hast granted me life and mercy.
81.  For ‘life’ is granted, when goodness is inspired into evil minds, but ‘life’ cannot be had without ‘mercy,’ in that the Lord does not aid us to obtain the endowments of righteousness, unless He first in mercy remit our past iniquities.  Or surely, He ‘grants us life and mercy,’ in that by the same mercy, with which He prevents us that we may lead a good life, continuing on afterwards He keep us safe.  For except He add mercy, the life which He vouchsafes cannot be preserved; since we are daily growing old by the mere customariness of our human life, and by the impulse of the outward man we are carried out of interior life by loose thought; so that unless heavenly visiting either by piercing our hearts quicken us in love, or by scourging us renew us in fear, the soul is wholly and entirely ruined by a sudden downfall, when it seemed to be made new by a long course of devotion to virtue.  Hence he subjoins, And Thy visitation hath preserved my spirit.  For the visitation of the Most High preserves man's spirit, when, it being richly endowed with graces, He does not cease either to scourge it with the rod, or to pierce it with love.  For if He bestows gifts, but does not raise it up by continually restoring it, the blessing is speedily lost, which is not preserved by the Giver.  But mark how the holy man, whilst he views himself in a humble light, discovers the secrets of Divine mercy destined to be universally bestowed, and whilst he truly confesses his own weakness, he is suddenly transported on high to learn the calling of the Gentiles.
