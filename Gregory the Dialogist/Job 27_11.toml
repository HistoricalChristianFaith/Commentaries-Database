18.  In such a way does blessed Job speak in his own words as to denote something connected with what relates to us.  For Holy Church in teaching, in so far as it is expedient to know it, hides not a particle of truth.  Thus because ‘the Hand of God’ is a name for the Son; for, by Him were all things made [John 1, 3]; she tells that by the Hand of God she teaches those, whom she sees continuing foolish in their own wisdom.  As if she said in plain words; ‘I know not any thing of myself; but whatever I perceive of the Truth, this I comprehend by the bountifulness of that same Truth.  Ye for this reason are not embued with right wisdom, because this same wisdom that you have yon ascribe not to the Hand of God, but to your own selves.’  For the adversaries of Holy Church, if they do at times perceive any thing true, this they attribute to their own powers, and they deprive themselves so much the more of the Wisdom from Above, in the same proportion as they wish to have it appropriated to themselves as being derived from their own wits.  Unto whom it is sometimes vouchsafed for their judgment, that they should indeed know some things aright, but by this very same knowledge be rendered the more obnoxious to punishment.
