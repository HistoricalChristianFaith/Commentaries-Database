(Hom. in Ev. i. 7. 2.) It is well known that the Only-begotten Son is called the Word of the Father; as in John, In the beginning was the Word. (John 1:1.) But it is by our own speech that we are known; the voice sounds that the words may be heard. Thus John the forerunner of the Lord's coming is called, The voice, because by his ministry the voice of the Father is heard by men.

(Hom. in Ev. i. 7. 2.) Crying in the desert, because he shows to deserted and forlorn Jud√¶a the approaching consolation of her Redeemer.

(Hom. in Ev. i. 20. 3.) Every one who preacheth right faith and good works, prepares the Lord's way to the hearts of the hearers, and makes His paths straight, in cleansing the thoughts by the word of good preaching.
