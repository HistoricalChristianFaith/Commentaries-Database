And oblique windows in the chambers.

In slanted windows, the part through which light enters is narrow, but the interior part which receives the light is wide, because the minds of those who contemplate, although they may see something slight of the true light, are nevertheless expanded within themselves with great amplitude. And indeed these minds can scarcely grasp even a few of the things they behold. For truly what those contemplating see of eternity is exceedingly small, yet from this small amount the bosom of their minds is enlarged into an increase of fervor and love; and hence they become spacious within themselves, from whence they admit the light of truth to themselves as if through narrow openings. Because this greatness of contemplation can be granted only to those who love, slanted windows are said to be in the chambers, or in those things which are said to be near the chambers, no longer on the outside but on the inside.

And in their fronts which were within the gate on every side round about.

For there were windows in the chambers, and there were also windows in their fronts, which had been constructed within the gate on every side all around, because he who has a heart within also receives the light of contemplation. For those who still think immoderately about external things do not know what the openings of contemplation concerning eternal light may be. For that infusion of incorporeal light is not grasped together with images of corporeal things, because while only visible things are thought about, invisible light is not admitted to the mind. But whoever now attends to the light of contemplation must take great care to always guard the mind in humility, never to exalt himself because of the grace with which he is filled, and to consider what the oblique windows that mark the minds of contemplatives are like. For through oblique windows light enters, and a thief does not enter, because those who are true watchmen always keep their understanding pressed down in humility, and the understanding of contemplation enters their minds, but the boasting of pride does not enter. And so the windows are both open and fortified, because the grace with which they are filled is open in their minds, and yet they do not permit the adversary to enter through pride.

It should be noted that within the gate, windows slanting inward are mentioned on every side throughout the circuit. For the grace of contemplation is not given only to the highest and denied to the lowly, but often the highest receive it, often the lowly, more frequently those who have withdrawn from the world, and sometimes even the married. If therefore there is no office among the faithful from which the grace of contemplation can be excluded, whoever has a heart within can also be illuminated by the light of contemplation, because within the gate windows slanting inward are constructed on every side throughout the circuit, so that no one may boast of this grace as though it were something singular to himself. Let no one think he possesses the gift of true light as his own private possession, because in that which he thinks he has as something special, often another is richer—one whom he did not think possessed any good within himself.

And likewise there were windows round about within in the vestibules.

After he said there were windows in the fronts, he adds windows in the vestibules round about on the inside, because not only do the lofty members of holy Church who stand out have the grace of contemplation, but often even those members receive this gift who, although they already spring up toward the highest things through desire, nevertheless still lie low through their office. For unless almighty God poured the light of contemplation even into those who seem despised, there would not have been windows in the vestibules. And so we see some who are placed in the highest positions of holy Church speaking lofty things about heavenly matters, searching out with wondrous zeal, insofar as the illuminated mind suffices, the secrets of the heavenly fatherland: these are windows in the fronts. But others are contained within the bosom of holy Church and seem despised in human eyes, yet within themselves they are occupied with the pursuits of wisdom, they yearn for heavenly things, and insofar as they are able, they consider what the eternal joys may be: these therefore are oblique windows, but in the vestibules.

It is well said "round about," because all inquiry into hidden things involves a circuit, since in its cogitation the mind says: "Do you suppose it is this? Do you suppose it is that?" It goes around, as it were, in order to find what it seeks. When the uncircumscribed light begins to break forth into knowledge, it is as though a ray of truth comes through an oblique window. For thus in our contemplation we make progress by circling around many things in our thoughts, just as we often seek examples of good people in order to make progress in our conduct. For when the mind is already thinking of passing on to better things, it seeks out whatever better thing it can hear about from others; it examines now the life of this holy person, now of another. Hence a certain chosen one, who had cast the eyes of his mind throughout the whole world in the broad embrace of Holy Church, seeking the life of good people for imitation, said: "I will go about and sacrifice in the tabernacle of God a sacrifice of jubilation." Behold, in order to sacrifice a sacrifice of jubilation, he was going about, because unless he sent his mind here and there to seek out the life of good people, he himself would not arrive at the sacrifice of jubilation. But when holy men are brought to the highest places within Holy Church, their life is set as if in a mirror, so that all may see the good things they ought to imitate.

And before the fronts was a picture of palm trees.

What is designated by palms, if not the rewards of victory? For these are customarily given to victors. Hence also concerning those who in the contest of martyrdom had conquered the ancient enemy, and were now rejoicing as victors in their homeland, it is written: "And palms in their hands, and they cried out with a loud voice, saying: Salvation to our God, who sits upon the throne, and to the Lamb." For to have palms in their hands is to have held fast to victories in their deeds. The palm of this deed is repaid there, where one now rejoices without struggle. Hence also here it does not say: "Palms before the fronts," but "a picture of palms before the fronts." For there the palm of victory will be seen, where one will now rejoice without end. For here we often observe holy men doing wondrous things, performing many miracles, cleansing lepers, casting out demons, driving away bodily illnesses by touch, predicting future things by the spirit of prophecy. All these things are not yet palms, but still a picture of palms, for these are sometimes given even to the reprobate. Hence also through the Gospel, Truth says: "Many will say to me on that day: Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and perform many miracles in your name? And then I will confess to them: I never knew you; depart from me, you who work iniquity." But the one true sign of election is the steadfastness of charity, as it is written: "By this it shall be known that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another." Moreover, when the elect perform these miracles, they do so in a manner far different from the reprobate, because what the elect do from charity, the reprobate strive to do through pride. But even for those same elect, the very wonders they perform through charity are not yet palms, but still a picture of palms, because through these things it is shown outwardly what sort of people they are held to be inwardly before the almighty Lord. But there the palm will be theirs, where there will no longer be any struggle with death. For the outstanding preacher then beheld the true palm being given to victors, when he foresaw the resurrection of the dead taking place, as he says: "For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality. But when this mortal has put on immortality, then shall come to pass the saying that is written: Death is swallowed up in victory. Where, O death, is your victory? Where, O death, is your sting?" Then therefore there will be perfect victory, when death shall have been fully swallowed up. But in everything that we now observe being done wondrously through signs, we see not yet victory itself, but still images of victory. Therefore, because virtues and signs are often given even to saints placed in more exalted positions, so that others may be stirred to good works, a picture of palms is shown before the fronts of the inner building. Let what has been treated today suffice, so that we may come, with the help of our Lord Jesus Christ, more vigorous to those things that follow—he who lives and reigns with God the Father in the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, through all ages of ages. Amen.
