A person sleeps in the midst of the sea who in the temptations of this world neglects to look out for the motions of vices that rush in on him like impending heaps of waves. And the steersman, as it were, lets the rudder go when the mind loses earnestness in guiding the ship of the body. For, indeed, to let the rudder go in the sea is to abandon intentness of forethought among the storms of this life. For, if the steersman carefully holds the rudder fast, he now directs the ship against the billows right and cleaves the assaults of the winds. So, when the mind vigilantly guides the soul, it now surmounts some things and treads them down, now warily turns aside from others, so that it may by hard exertion overcome present dangers and by foresight gather strength against future struggle.
