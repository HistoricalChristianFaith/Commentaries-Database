59.  This man, if whilst placed in this life he had been willing to open his eyes to his sin, would not hereafter ‘drink of the wrath of the Almighty.’  But he that here turns away his eyes from the sight of his guilt, cannot there avoid the sentence of condemnation.  But often those that do not fear eternal punishments, at all events on account of temporal chastening are afraid to do what is bad.  But there are some that have become so hardened in wickedness that they do not fear to be stricken even in the very things that they love, if only they can accomplish what they have iniquitously planned.
