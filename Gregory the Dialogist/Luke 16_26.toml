There follows: "And in all these things, between us and you a great chasm has been established, so that those who wish to cross from here to you cannot, nor can they pass from there to here." In this matter, it must be carefully investigated how it is said, "Those who wish to cross from here to you cannot." For there is no doubt that those who are in hell desire to cross over to the lot of the blessed. But those who have already been received into the lot of blessedness—in what sense is it said that they wish to cross over to those who are tortured in hell?

But just as the reprobate desire to cross over to the elect, that is, to migrate away from the affliction of their punishments, so for the just to cross over to those who are afflicted and placed in torments means to go in mind through mercy and to wish to free them. But those who wish to cross from the seat of the blessed to those who are afflicted and placed in torments cannot do so, because the souls of the just, although they have mercy in the goodness of their nature, being now joined to the justice of their Creator, are bound by such great rectitude that they are moved by no compassion toward the reprobate. For they are in harmony with the Judge to whom they cling, and they do not condescend out of mercy to those whom they cannot rescue, because they will then see them as foreign to themselves to the same degree that they perceive them to be rejected by their Creator whom they love.

Therefore neither do the unjust cross over to the lot of the blessed, because they are bound by perpetual damnation; nor can the just cross over to the reprobate, because, already raised up through the justice of judgment, they have no mercy on them from any compassion whatsoever.
