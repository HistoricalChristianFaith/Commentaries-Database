The preacher of Almighty God, Paul the apostle, says, "Rebuke not an elder" (1 Tim. v. 1). But this rule of his is to be observed in cases where the fault of an elder does not draw through his example the hearts of the younger into ruin. But, when an elder sets an example to the young for their ruin, he is to be smitten with severe rebuke. For it is written, "Ye are all a snare to the young" (Isai. xlii. 22). And again the prophet says, "The sinner being an hundred years old is accursed" (Isai. lxv. 20).
