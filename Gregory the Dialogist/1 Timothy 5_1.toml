The preacher of almighty God, Paul the apostle, says, “Do not rebuke an older man.” This rule is to be observed in cases where the fault of an older man does not draw the hearts of the younger into ruin through his example. But when an elder sets an example to the young for their ruin, he is to be confronted with severe rebuke. For of him it is written, “You are all a snare to the young.”
