57.  We know that it is written; Visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, and upon the children’s children unto the third and fourth generation. [Ex. 34, 7]  And again it is written, What mean ye that ye make this a proverb among you concerning the land of Israel, saying, The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children’s teeth are set on edge?  As I live, saith the Lord, ye shall not have this for a proverb any more in Israel.  Behold all souls are Mine; as the soul of the father, so also the soul of the son is Mine: the soul that sinneth, it shall die. [Ezek. 18, 2-4]  Thus in these two sentences whereas there is found a dissimilar meaning, the mind of the hearer is instructed, that it should search out with minute care the way of discernment.  Since original sin we derive from our parents, and, except by the grace of Baptism we be loosed from it, we bear with us the sins of our very parents, seeing that surely we are still one with them.  And so ‘He visiteth the iniquity of the fathers upon the children,’ when on account of the guilt of the parent, the soul of the offspring is polluted by original sin.  And again He does not ‘visit the sins of the fathers upon the children,’ in that when we are freed from original guilt by Baptism, we no longer own the sins of our fathers, but those which we have ourselves been guilty of.  Which however may be understood in another way as well, in that whosoever imitates the wicked ways of a bad father, is bound in his sins also.  But whosoever does not follow the wickedness of his parent, is never burthened by his offence.  And hence it comes to pass that the bad son of a bad father not only pays for his own sins, which he has added; but the sins of his father as well; seeing that to the evil practices of his father, which he is not ignorant that the Lord is angry with, he is not afraid to add yet further his own wickedness too.  And it is meet that he who being liable to a strict Judge does not fear to follow the ways of a wicked parent, should be compelled in this present life to pay for even his parent’s misdeeds.  And hence it is there said, The soul of the father is Mine, and the soul of the son is Mine: the soul that sinneth, it shall die, because in the flesh by the sin of the father the sons too are sometimes ruined.  But now that original sin has been done away, they are not bound in the soul by the parent’s wickedness.  For how is it that little children are very often seized by devils, saving that the flesh of the son is mulcted in punishment of the father?  For the bad father is stricken in his own person, and is too stubborn to feel the force of the blow.  Very often he is stricken in his children, so as to be more sharply stung, and the sorrow of the father is rendered to the flesh of the children, to the end that the evil heart of the parent may be chastened by inflictions on the children.  But when not little children, but such as are now more advanced in years, are stricken by the parent’s sin, what else are we given clearly to understand, but that they likewise pay the penalties of those whose deeds they have imitated?  And hence it is rightly said, Even unto the third and fourth generation.  For whereas it is possible that ‘even to the third and fourth generation,’ children may witness the life of their father, which they copy, vengeance extends even to them, who witnessed what they might mischievously imitate.
58.  And because sin shuts the eyes of the ungodly, but punishment opens them wide at the last, it is rightly subjoined; And when He repayeth, then he shall know it.  For the ungodly man knows not the evil things he has done, except when he has already begun to be punished for those same evil deeds.  Hence it is said by the Prophet; And the vexation alone shall give understanding to the hearing.  For he then ‘understands’ what he has heard, when he now grieves that he is ‘vexed’ for the neglect of it.  Hence it is said by Balaam concerning himself; the man whose eye is shut hath said: He hath said which heard the words of God, which saw the vision of the Almighty, which shall fail, and so his eyes shall be opened. [Num. 24, 3. 4.]  For he gave counsel against the children of Israel, but he saw afterwards in punishment what it was he had been guilty of before in sin.  Now the Elect, forasmuch as they see beforehand so that they should not sin, the eyes of these surely are open before their fall.  But the wicked man opens his eyes after his fall, because after his sin he now in his own punishment sees that he ought to have avoided that ill which he did.
