“The ways of those who do not work are strewn with thorns, but the ways of the strong are trodden down.” Thus wandering from the king’s highway, they can never arrive at that metropolis to which our course should ever be directed without swerving. Ecclesiastes also significantly expressed this saying: “The labor of fools wearies those who do not know how to go to the city;” namely, that “heavenly Jerusalem, which is the mother of us all.”
