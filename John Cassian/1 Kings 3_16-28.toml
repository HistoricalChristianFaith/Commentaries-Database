What about Solomon, who in his first judgment manifested the gift of wisdom, which he had received of God, only by making use of falsehood? For in order to get at the truth which was hidden by the woman’s lie, even he used the help of a lie most cunningly devised, saying: “Bring me a sword and divide the living child into two parts, and give the one half to the one and the other half to the other.” And when this pretended cruelty shook the heart of the true mother, but was received with approval by the one who was not, then at last by this most sagacious discovery of the truth he pronounced the judgment which every one has felt to have been inspired by God, saying: “Give her the living child and do not slay it; she is the mother.”
