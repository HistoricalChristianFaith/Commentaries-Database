No one doubts that when the judgment of the heart goes astray and is seized by the night of ignorance, our thoughts and our deeds, which proceed from the deliberation of discretion, are involved in the greater darkness of sin. Finally, because he never had this eye of discretion, he who by God’s judgment first deserved to rule over the people of Israel was cast out of his kingdom like something dark out of a healthy body. Having been deceived by the darkness and error of this light, he decided that his own sacrifices were more acceptable to God than obedience to Samuel’s command, and in the very act by which he had hoped that he would propitiate the divine majesty he committed sin instead. Ignorance of this discretion, I say, constrained Ahab, the king of Israel, after the triumph of the glorious victory that had been conceded to him by God’s favor, to believe that his own mercy was better than the very severe execution of the divine command, which seemed to him to be a cruel decree. Enfeebled by this thought, he wished to temper a bloody victory with clemency and, having been made dark throughout his body because of his impudent mercy, he was condemned to a death from which there was no recourse. - "Conference 2.2.6-3.2"

For no one can doubt that when the judgment of our heart goes wrong and is overwhelmed by the night of ignorance, our thoughts and deeds, which are the result of deliberation and discretion, must be involved in the darkness of still greater sins. Finally, the man who in the judgment of God was the first to be worthy to be king of his people Israel, because he was lacking in this “eye” of discretion, was, as if his whole body were full of darkness, actually cast down from the kingdom. While being deceived by the darkness of this “light” and in error, he imagined that his own offerings were more acceptable to God than obedience to the command of Samuel. And so he failed in that very act by which he had hoped to propitiate the Divine Majesty. And ignorance, I say, of this discretion led Ahab the king of Israel, after a triumph and splendid victory which had been granted to him by the favor of God, to imagine that mercy on his part was better than the stern execution of the divine command, which seemed a cruel rule to him. Moved by this consideration, while he desired to temper a bloody victory with mercy, he was on account of his indiscriminating clemency rendered full of darkness in his whole body and condemned irreversibly to death.
