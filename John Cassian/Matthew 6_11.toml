(Coll. ix. 21.) In that He says, this day, He shows that it is to be daily taken, and that this prayer should be offered at all seasons, seeing there is no day on which we have not need, by the receiving of this bread, to confirm the heart of e inward man.

(ubi sup.) Though the expression to-day may be understood of this present life; thus, Give us this bread while we abide in this world.
