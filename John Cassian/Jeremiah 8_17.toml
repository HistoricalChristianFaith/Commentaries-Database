You should know that the disease of envy is harder to cure than any other. I would say that someone tainted by its poison is almost beyond healing. This is the plague described figuratively by the prophet: “See, I will send you serpents against which there are no incantations, and they will bite you.” The bites of envy are quite rightly compared by the prophet with the lethal poison of the basilisk.
