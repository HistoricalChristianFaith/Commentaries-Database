It happens that, whatever state of life a man has reached, he sometimes can offer pure and devout prayer. Even in the lowliest place, where a man is repenting from fear of punishment and the judgment to come, his petitions can enrich him with the same fervor of spirit as the man, who attained to purity of heart, gazes upon God’s blessing and is filled with an overwhelming happiness. As the Lord said, “The one who knows he has been forgiven more begins to love more.”
