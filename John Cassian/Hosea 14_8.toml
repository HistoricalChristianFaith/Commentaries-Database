Holy people have never testified that they attained by their effort the right path to travel on as they made their way to the increase and perfection of virtue. Rather they would plead to the Lord and say, “Direct me in your truth,” and, “Direct my way in your sight.” Another one declares that it is not by faith alone but also by experience and, as it were, in the very nature of things that he has seized upon this, [saying], “I have known, O Lord, that a person’s way is not in him, nor is it in a man to walk and to direct his own steps.” And the Lord himself says to Israel, “I will direct him like a green fir tree; from me your fruit has been found.”
