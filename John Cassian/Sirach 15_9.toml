Of those then who seem to acquire some show of knowledge or of those who while they devote themselves diligently to reading the sacred volume and to committing the Scriptures to memory, yet do not leave behind carnal sins, it is well said in Proverbs: “As a golden ring in a swine’s snout, so is the beauty of an evil-disposed woman.” For what does it profit someone to gain the ornaments of heavenly eloquence and the most precious beauty of the Scriptures if by clinging to filthy deeds and thoughts he destroys it by burying it in the foulest ground or defiles it by the dirty wallowing of his own lusts? For the result will be that which is an ornament to those who rightly use it is not only unable to adorn them but becomes dirty by the increased filth and mud. For “from the mouth of a sinner praise is not attractive.” In fact, the prophet says about souls like this, “Why do you declare my righteous acts and take my covenant in your lips?” They never possess in any lasting way the fear of the Lord of which it is said, “The fear of the Lord is instruction and wisdom.” And yet, they try to get at the meaning of Scripture by continual meditation on them. Thus, it is appropriately asked about them in Proverbs: “What use are riches to a fool? For a senseless person cannot possess wisdom.”
