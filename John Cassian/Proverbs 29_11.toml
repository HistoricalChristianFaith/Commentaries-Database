It behooves us, therefore, to contain every movement of wrath and to temper it with discretion as our guide lest, overcome with rage, we be swept up into what is condemned by Solomon: “The wicked person expends his anger all at once, but the wise person dispenses it gradually.” That is to say, in the heat of his anger the fool is inflamed to revenge himself, but by mature deliberation and moderation the wise person slowly diminishes and releases his. .

We ought then to restrain every movement of anger and moderate it under the direction of discretion, that we may not by blind rage be hurried into that which is condemned by Solomon: “The wicked man expends all his anger, but the wise man dispenses it bit by bit.” That is to say, a fool is inflamed by the passion of his anger to avenge himself; but a wise man, by the maturity of his reflection and moderation, diminishes it little by little and gets rid of it.
