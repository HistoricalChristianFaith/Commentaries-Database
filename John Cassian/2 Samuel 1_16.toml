We know that David went beyond the precepts of the law when, despite Moses’ command to pay back one’s enemies in kind, he not only did not do this but even embraced his persecutors in love, prayed devoutly to the Lord on their behalf, even wept mournfully for them and revenged them when they were slain. - "Conference 21.4.2"
