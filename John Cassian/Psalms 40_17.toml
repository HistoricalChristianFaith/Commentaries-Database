Truly, what higher or holier poverty can there be than this, that a person knowing he is defenseless of his own, asks help for daily life from another’s generosity and realizes his life and being to depend every moment on God’s help. Such a one truly confesses himself “the beggar of the Lord,” like the psalmist, who said, “I am a beggar and a poor man, and God helps me.”
