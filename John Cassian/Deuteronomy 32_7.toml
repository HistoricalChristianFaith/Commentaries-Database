Who then would be so presumptuous and blind as to dare to trust in his own judgment and discretion when the vessel of election testifies that he needed to confer with his fellow apostles? From this it is clearly proven that the Lord shows the way of perfection to no one who has the means of being educated but who disdains the teaching and the instruction of the elders and who considers as insignificant that saying which ought to be diligently observed: “Ask your father, and he will declare it to you, your elders, and they will tell you.”
