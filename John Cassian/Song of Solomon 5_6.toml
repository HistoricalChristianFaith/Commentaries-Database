The Lord seeks us when he says, “I sought, and there was no one. I called, and there was no one who responded.” And he himself is sought by his bride, who mourns tearfully, “In my chamber at night I sought him whom my soul loved. I sought him, and I did not find him; I called him, and he did not answer me.” - "Conference 13.12.12"
