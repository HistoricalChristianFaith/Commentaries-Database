“I said, ‘You are gods, and all children of the Most High.’ And yet you will die like human beings and fall like one of the mighty.” Thus they fell from the true discipline dictated by the knowledge of nature, that which was passed down to them by their ancestors and that the first man, he who appeared just after the creation of the universe, could obviously perceive directly and pass on to his posterity with his certain reason. That first man saw the very infancy of the world, when it was still young and, in a certain way, throbbing and uncultivated. The fullness of wisdom, however, dwelled in him to such a high degree, along with the grace of being able to see the future, given him by divine infusion, that he was able to name all the living creatures, though he was still only a rude inhabitant of this world. And he not only knew how to distinguish all the species of beasts and the fury of serpents but also the virtues of herbs and plants, as well as the qualities of minerals. He also knew the changes of the seasons, even when they had not yet occurred, such that he could say of himself, “He has given me the knowledge of what exists, to understand the structure of the world and the power of the elements, the alternations of times and the succession of the seasons, the cycle of the years and the position of the stars, the nature of animals and the ferocious instincts of wild beasts, the power of spirits and the thoughts of human beings, the variety of plants and the properties of roots. All that is hidden and all that is clear, I know.”
