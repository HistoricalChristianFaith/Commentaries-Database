In some cases he so richly poured forth the mighty work of healing that the Evangelist was led to exclaim: “He healed all their sick.” But among others the unfathomable depth of Christ’s goodness was so thwarted that it was said: “And Jesus could do there no mighty works because of their unbelief.” So the bounty of God is actually curtailed temporarily according to the receptivity of our faith. So it is said to one: “According to your faith may it be to you,” and to another: “Go your way, and as you have believed so let it be to you,” and to another “Let it be to you according as you will,” and again to another: “Your faith has made you whole.”

If the faith of those who bring them or of the sick is lacking, it may prevent those who possess the gift of healing from exercising it.
