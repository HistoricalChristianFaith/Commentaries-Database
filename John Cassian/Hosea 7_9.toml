Not content with these words, the blessed Anthony entered upon a wider field of discussion, and he said, “This way of life and this most lukewarm condition not only causes you the loss that I have spoken of, even though you yourself may not feel it now. You may even somehow say in keeping with a sentence from Proverbs: ‘They strike me, but I did not grieve, and they mocked me, but I was unaware.’ And remember what is said by the prophet Hosea: ‘Aliens devoured his strength, and he himself did not even recognize it.’ ”
