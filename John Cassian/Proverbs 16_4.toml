Only God does what is good, acting from love of goodness for its own sake and not moved by fear or hope of reward. As Solomon says, “The Lord has done all things for his own sake.” For the sake of his own goodness he bestows an abundance of goodness upon the worthy and the unworthy, because he can neither be wearied by wrongdoing nor provoked to painful emotion by human wickedness. He always remains what he is, perfect in goodness and unchanging in nature.
