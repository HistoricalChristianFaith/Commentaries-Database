Above all we should know what the three sources of our thoughts are: They come from God, from the devil and from ourselves. They are from God when he deigns to visit us by the illumination of the Holy Spirit, which raises us up to a higher level of progress; and when we have made little gain or have acted lazily and been overcome and he chastens us with a most salutary compunction; and when he opens to us the heavenly sacraments and changes our chosen orientation to better acts and to a better will. This was the case when King Ahasuerus was chastised by the Lord and was moved to examine the annals, whereupon he remembered the good deeds of Mordecai, exalted him to the highest degree of honor and immediately recalled his exceedingly cruel sentence concerning the killing of the Jewish people. - "Conference 1.19.1"
