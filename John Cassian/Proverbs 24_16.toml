There will be no end of penance for those little offenses by which “the righteous person falls seven times,” as it is written, “and gets up again.” For we commit these frequently every day, unwillingly or willingly, whether through ignorance or forgetfulness or thought or word or surprise or necessity or weakness of the flesh or pollution during a dream. On account of these David asks the Lord in prayer for purification and forgiveness, saying, “Who understands his sins? From my hidden sins cleanse me, and from those of others spare your servant.” And the apostle says, “The good that I want, I do not do, but the evil that I do not want, this I do.” -.

For those small offences by which “the righteous falls seven times and will rise again” penitence will never cease, as it is written. For either through ignorance, or forgetfulness, or thought, or word, or surprise, or necessity, or weakness of the flesh, or defilement in a dream, we often fall every day either against our will or voluntarily. On account of these offences—for which he also prays to the Lord and asks for purification and pardon—David says: “Who can understand sins? Cleanse me from my secret sins; and spare your servant from those of others.” And the apostle says: “For I do not do the good that I desire, but the evil that I do not desire, that I do.”
