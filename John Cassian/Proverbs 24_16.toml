There will be no end of penance for those little offenses by which “the righteous person falls seven times,” as it is written, “and gets up again.” For we commit these frequently every day, unwillingly or willingly, whether through ignorance or forgetfulness or thought or word or surprise or necessity or weakness of the flesh or pollution during a dream. On account of these David asks the Lord in prayer for purification and forgiveness, saying, “Who understands his sins? From my hidden sins cleanse me, and from those of others spare your servant.” And the apostle says, “The good that I want, I do not do, but the evil that I do not want, this I do.” –.
