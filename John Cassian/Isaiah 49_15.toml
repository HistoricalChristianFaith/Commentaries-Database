This design and love of his, which the Lord deigns with unwearying kindness to benefit us with and which he wishes to express by an act of human affection, although he discovers no such loving disposition in his creation to which he could worthily compare it, he has compared with the most tender heart of a loving mother. He uses this example because he can find nothing dearer in the nature of human beings. - "Conference 13.17.4"
