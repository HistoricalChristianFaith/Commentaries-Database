This design and love of his, which the Lord deigns with unwearying kindness to benefit us with and which he wishes to express by an act of human affection, although he discovers no such loving disposition in his creation to which he could worthily compare it, he has compared with the most tender heart of a loving mother. He uses this example because he can find nothing dearer in the nature of human beings. - "Conference 13.17.4"

This providence and love of God therefore, which the Lord in unwearied goodness deigns to show us, he compares to the tender heart of a kind mother. He does so because he wishes to express that love by a figure of human affection, and he finds in his creatures no such feeling of love to which he could better compare it. And he uses this example, because nothing dearer can be found in human nature.
