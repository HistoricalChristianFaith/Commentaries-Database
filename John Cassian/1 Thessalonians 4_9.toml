The blessed apostle, like a true and spiritual physician, either seeing this disease which springs from the spirit of lethargy already creeping in, or foreseeing through the Holy Spirit that it would arise among monks, is quick to anticipate it by the healing medicines of his directions. For when he writes to the Thessalonians, he first sounds like a skillful and excellent physician, applying the soothing and gentle remedy of his words to the sickness of his patients. He begins with charity … that this deadly wound, having been treated with a milder remedy, might cease its angry festering and more easily bear severer treatment. He writes, “But concerning brotherly charity you have no need that I write to you, for you yourselves are taught of God to love one another. For this you do toward all the brothers in the whole of Macedonia.” He first began with the soothing application of praise and made their ears submissive and ready for the remedy of the healing words.… At last with difficulty he breaks out into that at which he was driving before. He gave the first aim. “Take pains to be quiet.” Then Paul adds a second: “Mind your own business.” And a third as well: “Work with your own hands, as we commanded you.” … [The upshot is] that one who does not dutifully and peacefully work for his daily food with his own hands is sure to view enviously another’s gifts and blessings. You see what conditions, serious and shameful, may spring solely from the malady of leisure.
