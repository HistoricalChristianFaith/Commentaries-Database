“Give strong drink to those who are in gloom and wine to those who are sad so that they may forget their poverty and be reminded no more of their grief.” What [Solomon] means is this. To those filled with bitter regret and sadness over their earlier lives give abundantly the joy of spiritual knowledge like “a wine which gladdens the heart of a man.” Warm them with the headiness of saving words lest they sink into gloom and deadly despair.
