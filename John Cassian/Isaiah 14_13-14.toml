The one says, “I will exalt my throne above the stars of God”; the other, “Learn of me, for I am meek and lowly of heart.” The one says, “I know not the Lord and will not let Israel go”; the other, “If I say that I know him not, I shall be a liar like unto you: but I know him and keep his commandments.” The one says, “My rivers are mine, and I made them”; the other, “I can do nothing of myself, but my Father who abides in me, he does the works.” The one says, “All the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them are mine, and to whomsoever I will, I give them”; the other, “Though he were rich, yet he became poor, that we through his poverty might be made rich.” The one says, “As eggs are gathered together which are left, so have I gathered all the earth, and there was none that moved the wing or opened the mouth, or made the least noise”; the other, “I am become like a solitary pelican; I watched and became as a sparrow alone upon the roof.” The one says, “I have dried up with the sole of my foot all the rivers shut up in banks”; the other, “Cannot I ask my Father, and he shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels?” If we look at the reason of our original fall and the foundations of our salvation, and [if we] consider by whom and in what way the latter were laid and the former originated, we may learn, either through the fall of the devil or through the example of Christ, how to avoid so terrible a death from pride.

And because he “loved the words of ruin,” with which he had said, “I will ascend into heaven,” and the “deceitful tongue,” with which he had said of himself, “I will be like the Most High,” and of Adam and Eve, “You shall be as gods,” therefore “shall God destroy him forever and pluck him out and remove him from his dwelling place and his root out of the land of the living.” Then “the just,” when they see his ruin, “shall fear, and shall laugh at him and say” (what may also be most justly aimed at those who trust that they can obtain the highest good without the protection and assistance of God): “Behold the man that did not make God his helper but trusted in the abundance of his riches and prevailed in his vanity.”
