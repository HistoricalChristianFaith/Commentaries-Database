Whoever then by this love has attained the image and likeness of God will now delight in goodness for the pleasure of goodness itself. Now having a similar feeling of patience and gentleness, they will no longer be angered by the faults of sinners, but in compassion and sympathy will rather ask for pardon for their infirmities. And remembering that for so long they themselves were was tried by the stings of similar passions till by the Lord’s mercy they were saved, they will feel that, as they were saved from carnal attacks not by the teaching of their own exertions but by God’s protection, pity and not anger ought to be shown to those who go astray. With full peace of mind they will sing to God the following verse: “Thou hast broken my chains. I will offer to you the sacrifice of praise.” And also: “Unless the Lord had helped me, my soul would have dwelt in hell.”
