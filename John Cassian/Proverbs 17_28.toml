It falls to the intellect to discern the divisions and the outlines of questions, and understanding’s highest function is to know that you do not know. Hence it is said, “Wisdom will be credited to the fool who asks questions,” for although the questioner does not know the answer to his question, nonetheless, because he inquires prudently and comes to understand what he does not understand, this very thing—his having prudently acknowledged what he does not know—is credited to him as wisdom. .

Understanding is required to discern the distinctions and the drift of questions; and it is a main part of knowledge to understand how ignorant you are. Hence it is said that “if a fool asks questions, it will be accounted wisdom,” because, although one who asks questions is ignorant of the answer to the question raised, yet as he wisely asks and learns what he does not know, this very fact will be counted as wisdom in him, because he wisely discovers what he was ignorant of.
