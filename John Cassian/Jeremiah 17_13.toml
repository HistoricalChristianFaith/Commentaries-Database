We must therefore not doubt that at the time when he was chosen by Christ and obtained a place in the apostolate, the name of Judas was written in the book of the living, and then he heard as well as the rest the words, “Rejoice not because the devils are subject to you, but rejoice because your names are written in heaven.” But because he was corrupted by the plague of covetousness and had his name struck out from that heavenly list, it is appropriately said of him and of people like him by the prophet: “O Lord, let all those who forsake you be confounded. Let them who depart from you be written in the earth, because they have forsaken the Lord, the vein of living waters.” And elsewhere, “They shall not be in the counsel of my people, nor shall they be written in the writing of the house of Israel, neither shall they enter into the land of Israel.”

And again when all their efforts are exhausted and they have failed to deceive us, they must “be confounded and be ashamed” at the failure of their efforts, “who seek our souls to destroy them. Let them be covered with shame and confusion who desire evil against us.” Jeremiah also says, “Let them be confounded, and let not me be confounded; let them be afraid, and let not me be afraid; bring on them the fury of your wrath, and with a double destruction destroy them.”
