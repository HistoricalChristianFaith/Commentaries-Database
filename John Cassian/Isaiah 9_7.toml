Surely the coming of God in the flesh could not remain hidden from humanity, since the prophet had openly said about him, as though to the whole human race: “behold your God,” and “this is your God,” and again “the mighty God, Father of the coming world, Prince of peace,” and “of his kingdom there will be no end.” Once God had come, however, did his coming remain hidden from those who openly confessed? Was Peter ignorant of the advent of God when he said, “You are Christ, the Son of the living God”? Did Martha not know the one in whom she believed or the meaning of what she was saying when she declared, “Lord, I believe that you are Christ, the Son of the living God who has come into the world”? Finally, was not everyone who asked him to heal diseases or to replace lost limbs or to raise the dead petitioning God’s omnipotence rather than humanity’s weakness?
