“It is written in the law: ‘You shall not commit fornication.’ ” This is kept in a beneficial way according to the simple sound of the letter by the person who is still entangled in the passions of fleshly impurity. It is necessarily observed in spiritual fashion, however, by one who has already left behind this filthy behavior and impure disposition. This person also rejects not only all idolatrous ceremonies but also every superstition of the Gentiles and the observance of auguries and omens, and of all signs and days and times, and is certainly not engaged in the divination of particular words or names. [This] befouls the wholesomeness of our faith. Jerusalem is said to have been debauched by this fornication, having fornicated “on every high hill and under every green tree.” And the Lord, rebuking [Jerusalem], says by the prophet: “Let the astrologers stand and save you, who gazed on the stars and counted the months, so that from them they might announce the things that are to happen to you.” Concerning this fornication the Lord reproaches them elsewhere when he says, “The spirit of fornication has deceived them, and they went fornicating away from their God.”
