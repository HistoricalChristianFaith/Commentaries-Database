Therefore, if you are concerned to attain to the light of spiritual knowledge not by the vice of empty boastfulness but by the grace of correction, you are first inflamed with desire for that blessedness about which it is said, “Blessed are the pure of heart, for they shall see God.” [Thus] you may also attain to that about which the angel said to Daniel: “Those who are learned shall shine like the splendor of the firmament, and those who instruct many in righteousness like the stars forever.” And in another prophet: “Enlighten yourselves with the light of knowledge while there is time.”
