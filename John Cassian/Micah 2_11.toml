St. Paul wished that he could be accursed if the people of Israel be saved to God’s glory. The man who knows that death is not the end is confident in his readiness to die for Christ. Again, “We rejoice when we are weak, but you are strong.” It is no wonder if St. Paul, for the glory of Christ and the conversion of his brother Jews and of the Gentiles, should be ready to be accursed of Christ. Even the prophet Micah wanted to be a liar and to lose the inspiration of the Holy Spirit if the Jews could escape the punishment and the destruction which he had prophesied: “Would that I were not man that had the Spirit, and that I rather spoke a lie.” And there was the case of the lawgiver, Moses, who did not refuse to perish with his brothers who were doomed to die but said, “I beseech you, O Lord, this people have sinned a heinous sin; either forgive them this trespass, or, if you do not, blot me out of the book which you have written.”
