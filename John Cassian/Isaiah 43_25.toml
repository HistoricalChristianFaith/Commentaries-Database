“Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us.” Whoever, therefore, desires to obtain the forgiveness of sins should strive to use these methods. The obstinacy of a hardened heart should turn no one away from a salutary healing and from the source of so great mercy, for even if we did all these things they would not be ineffective for the expiation of our crimes unless the goodness and mercy of the Lord destroyed them. When he has seen the services of a devout effort rendered by us with a humble mind, he supplements these feeble and small efforts with his own measureless generosity, as he says: “I am the one who destroys your iniquities for my own sake, and I will not keep record of your sins.” - "Conference 20.8.8-9"

“Forgive us our debts as we also forgive our debtors.” Whoever then desires to obtain forgiveness of sins, should strive to use these means. Let not the stubbornness of an obdurate heart turn away any from the saving remedy and the source of so much goodness, because even if we have done all these things, they will not be able to expiate our offences, unless they are blotted out by the goodness and mercy of the Lord, who when he sees us engaged in pious efforts with a humble heart, supports our small and puny efforts with the utmost bounty, and says: “I even I am the one that blots out your iniquities for my own sake, and I will remember your sins no more.”
