“Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us.” Whoever, therefore, desires to obtain the forgiveness of sins should strive to use these methods. The obstinacy of a hardened heart should turn no one away from a salutary healing and from the source of so great mercy, for even if we did all these things they would not be ineffective for the expiation of our crimes unless the goodness and mercy of the Lord destroyed them. When he has seen the services of a devout effort rendered by us with a humble mind, he supplements these feeble and small efforts with his own measureless generosity, as he says: “I am the one who destroys your iniquities for my own sake, and I will not keep record of your sins.” - "Conference 20.8.8–9"
