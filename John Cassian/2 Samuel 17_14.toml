For what shall we say about Hushai’s pious deception of Absalom for the sake of King David’s safety which, although formulated with good will by the deceiver and cheater and opposed to the well-being of the questioner, is approved by the text of divine Scripture that says, “By the will of the Lord the useful advice of Ahithophel was undone, so that the Lord might bring evil upon Absalom”? For what was accomplished with a right intention and pious judgment for a good purpose and conceived for the safety and religious victory of a man whose piety was pleasing to God, all by way of deception, could not be blamed.
