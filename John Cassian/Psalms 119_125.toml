The blessed David asks the Lord for that very understanding by which he can recognize God’s commands, which he well knew were written in the book of the law, when he says “I am your servant: O give me understanding that I may learn your commandments.” Certainly he was in possession of understanding, which had been granted to him by nature, and also had at his fingers’ ends a knowledge of God’s commands which were preserved in writing in the law. Still he prayed to the Lord that he might learn this more thoroughly because he knew that what came to him by nature would never be sufficient for him, unless his understanding was enlightened by the Lord by his daily illumination, to understand the law spiritually and to recognize his commands more clearly.
