Through the prophet Hosea the divine word well expressed God’s concern and providence toward us. He speaks of the image of Jerusalem as a prostitute who is drawn with wicked ardor to the worship of idols. She says, “I will go after my lovers, who give me my bread and my water, my wool and my flax, my oil and my drink.” The divine condescension replies, with a view to her salvation and not to her will, “Behold, I will hedge in her paths with thorns, and I will hedge her in with a wall, and she will not find her ways. And she will pursue her lovers and not lay hold of them, and she will seek them and not find them, and she will say, ‘I will return to my first husband, because then it was better for me than it is now.’ ”
