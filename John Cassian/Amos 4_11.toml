They [who refuse to repent] do not deserve to be saved by the Lord’s visitation or to be healed by temporal afflictions. They are like those “who in despair have handed themselves over to lasciviousness in the working of every error, unto uncleanness.” In their hardness of heart and with their frequent habit of sinning, they are beyond the purgation of this very brief age and the punishment of the present life. The divine Word reproves them too through the prophet: “I have destroyed you as God destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, and you have become like a firebrand snatched from the fire, and not even thus have you returned to me, says the Lord.”
