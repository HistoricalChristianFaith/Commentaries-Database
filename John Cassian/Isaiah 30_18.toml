For he calls and invites us, when he says, “All the day long I stretched forth my hands to a disobedient and gainsaying people”; and he is invited by us when we say to him, “All the day long I have stretched forth my hands unto you.” He waits for us, when it is said by the prophet, “Therefore the Lord waits to have compassion upon us”; and he is waited for by us, when we say, “I waited patiently for the Lord, and he inclined to me,” and “I have waited for your salvation, O Lord.”
