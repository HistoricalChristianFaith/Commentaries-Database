Humility, then, is the teacher of all the virtues; it is the most firm foundation of the heavenly edifice; it is the Savior’s own magnificent gift. For a person may perform without danger of pride all the miracles that Christ worked if he strains after the meek Lord not because of his exalted signs but because of his patience and humility. But a person who itches to command unclean spirits, to bestow the gift of health on the sick, or to show some wondrous sign to the people is far from Christ even though he invokes the name of Christ in his displays, because by reason of his proud mind he does not follow the teacher of humility.… [Christ] did not say, “If you perform signs and mighty deeds,” but, “If you have love for one another.” Certainly no one can observe this but the gentle and the humble. Therefore our forebears never considered those monks to be upright or free of the disease of vainglory who presented themselves as exorcists before men and who, in the midst of admiring crowds, proclaimed by a boastful display this grace that they had either deserved or arrogated to themselves. Hence, if someone does one of these things in our presence, we should think him praiseworthy not for his wonderful signs but for his splendid behavior, and we should not ask whether demons are subject to him but whether he possesses the parts of love that the apostle describes. -.

Humility therefore is the teacher of all virtues; it is the surest foundation of the heavenly building; it is the special and splendid gift of the Savior. For anyone who follows the gentle Lord not in the grandeur of his miracles, but in the virtues of patience and humility. can perform all the miracles which Christ worked without danger of pride. But anyone who aims at commanding unclean spirits, or bestowing gifts of healing, or showing some wonderful miracle to the people, even though when showing off invokes the name of Christ, yet that person is far from Christ, because in pride of heart he does not follow his humble teacher … Christ did not say: “If you do signs and miracles …,” but “if you love one another.” Certainly no one can observe this but the meek and humble.Therefore our predecessors never considered those monks to be good or free from the fault of pride who professed themselves exorcists or proclaimed boastfully among admiring crowds the grace which they had obtained or which they claimed to be theirs.… And so if any one does any of these things in our presence, he ought to be commended by us not out of admiration of his miracles, but for the beauty of his life, and we should not ask whether the devils are subject to him, but whether he possesses those features of love which the apostle describes.
