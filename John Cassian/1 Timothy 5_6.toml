No one—not even though he call himself a Christian or a monk a thousand times over—confesses God while he is sinning. No one remembers God while he allows what the Lord hates. It is like pretending he is a faithful servant while he takes no notice of his master’s commands. St. Paul says of a widow, “She that gives herself to pleasure is dead while she lives.” This is the kind of death he means. Many whose bodies are alive are dead and in hell and cannot praise God. And many whose bodies are dead bless and praise God together in the spirit.… In the Apocalypse the souls of the martyrs are described as praying to God as well as praising him.
