Does not Scripture say universally of all the things that were created by God, “Behold, everything that God made was very good”? … The things that belong to the present, then, are not declared good in a merely minimal sense but are emphatically “very good.” For, in fact, they are useful for us while we are living in this world, whether to sustain life or as medicine for the body or on account of some benefit unknown to us. Or else they are very good in that they let us “see the invisible things of God, his eternal power and his divinity, from the creation of the world, through things that have been made graspable”23—that is, from the great and well-ordered construction and arrangement of the world—and let us contemplate them from the existence of everything that is in it. Yet all of these will be unable to maintain their title to goodness if they are compared with the future age, where no mutability in good things and no corruption of true blessedness is to be feared. The blessedness of this world is described as follows: “The light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold, as the light of seven days.” The things that are great, then, and splendid and marvelous to behold will immediately seem empty if they are compared with the future promises in faith.
