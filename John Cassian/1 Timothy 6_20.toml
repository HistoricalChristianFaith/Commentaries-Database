The psalmist also declares that this is the sequence we must follow. He says, “Blessed are those who are unsullied upon their journey, who walk in the law of the Lord. Blessed are those who pay heed to his witness.” … In this way he shows clearly that no one can manage to engage in the correct scrutiny of God’s Word unless in his daily life he proceeds unstained along the road of Christ. Therefore those whom you have mentioned cannot possess this knowledge if they are unclean. What they have is a false so-called lore, the kind about which the apostle has this to say, “O Timothy, guard what has been given to you. In all that you say avoid profane novelties and the claims of a falsely named knowledge.”
