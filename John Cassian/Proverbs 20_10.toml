We must be careful not to have either unjust weights in our hearts or double measures in the storerooms of our conscience, not only in the way that we have spoken but also in the following way. That is, we must not burden those to whom we preach the word of the Lord with stricter and heavier precepts than we ourselves are able to bear, while taking it upon ourselves to lighten with a greater and more indulgent relaxation the things that pertain to our rule of strictness. If we do this, what are we doing but weighing and measuring the revenue and fruit of the Lord’s precepts with a double weight and measure? For if we weigh them out in one way for ourselves and in another for our brothers, we are rightly rebuked by the Lord for having deceptive balances and double measures, according to the words of Solomon, where it is said, “A double weight is an abomination to the Lord, and a deceptive balance is not good in his sight.” .

We must strive not to have unfair weights in our hearts nor double measures in the storehouse of our conscience. We must not overwhelm those to whom we are to preach the word of the Lord with precepts that are too strict and heavier than we ourselves can bear, while we take for granted that for ourselves those things which have strict rules are to be softened and relaxed. For when we do this, what is it but to weigh and measure the goods and fruits of the Lord’s commands with a double weight and measure? For if we dispense them in one way to ourselves and in another to our brothers and sisters, we are rightly blamed by the Lord because we have unfair balances and double measures, in accordance with the saying of Solomon which tells us that “a double weight is an abomination to the Lord, and a deceitful balance is not good in his sight.”
