It is clear, then, that no one can be deceived by the devil except one who has chosen to yield to him the consent of his own will. As Ecclesiastes clearly puts it in these words: “For since there is no speedy opposition to those who do evil, therefore the heart of the children of men is fully set to do evil.” It is therefore clear that each person goes wrong from this; namely, that when evil thoughts assault him he does not immediately meet them with refusal and contradiction.

Until now, never confuting him with your own answer or that of another, you allowed him to lord it over you, according to that saying of Solomon’s: “Because sentence is not speedily pronounced against the evil, the heart of the children of men is full within them to do evil.” Therefore after his exposure that evil spirit will no longer be able to disturb you, nor will that foul serpent ever again make his lurking place in you, since he has been dragged out into light from the darkness by your life-giving confession.”
