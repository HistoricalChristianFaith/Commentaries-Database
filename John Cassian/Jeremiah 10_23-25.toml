The saints have never claimed that their own efforts would have enabled them to find their way along the road they were traveling to perfect virtue. Rather, they sought it from the Lord, praying, “Direct me in your truth” and “direct the road I take in your sight.” And someone else asserts that he grasped this not only through faith but also through direct experience of how things are: “I learned, Lord, that a person is no master of the road he takes, nor is it in man’s power as he goes his way to control his steps.” The Lord had this to say to Israel: “I will lead him on, like a greening fir tree, and the fruit you bear comes from me.”
