For it is but little for a monk to have once made his renunciation, that is, in the early days of his conversion to have disregarded the present world, unless he continues to renounce it daily. For to the very end of this life we must with the prophet say this: “And I have not desired the day of man, you know it well.” Wherefore also the Lord says in the Gospel: “If anyone will come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me.”
