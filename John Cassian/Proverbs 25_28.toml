The example and image used in this text, which compares a person with a city that is broken down and without walls, demonstrates how dangerous it is for a monk to be deprived of [selfcontrol]. Herein is wisdom; herein is knowledge and understanding. Without them can neither our interior dwelling be built nor spiritual riches be gathered, as it is written: “With wisdom a dwelling is built, and with knowledge it is set up again; with understanding its cellars are filled with all precious riches and good things.” .

The illustration and image in the passage quoted shows, by comparing it to a city that is destroyed and without walls, how injurious the absence of [self-control] is in a monk. Herein lies wisdom, herein lies intelligence and understanding without which our inward house cannot be built and spiritual riches cannot be gathered together. As it is written, “A house is built with wisdom, and again it is set up with intelligence. With understanding the storehouses are filled with all precious riches and good things.”
