The example and image used in this text, which compares a person with a city that is broken down and without walls, demonstrates how dangerous it is for a monk to be deprived of [selfcontrol]. Herein is wisdom; herein is knowledge and understanding. Without them can neither our interior dwelling be built nor spiritual riches be gathered, as it is written: “With wisdom a dwelling is built, and with knowledge it is set up again; with understanding its cellars are filled with all precious riches and good things.” .
