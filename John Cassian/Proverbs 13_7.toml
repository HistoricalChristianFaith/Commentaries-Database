A person who, because of his undisciplined heart and daily distraction of mind, loses whatever he seemed to have acquired by the conversion of others truly puts his profits in a bag with holes. And so it is that, while believing themselves able to make greater profit by instructing others, they are deprived of their own betterment. For “there are those who make themselves out as rich, although they have nothing, and there are those who humble themselves in the midst of great wealth.” .
