A person who, because of his undisciplined heart and daily distraction of mind, loses whatever he seemed to have acquired by the conversion of others truly puts his profits in a bag with holes. And so it is that, while believing themselves able to make greater profit by instructing others, they are deprived of their own betterment. For “there are those who make themselves out as rich, although they have nothing, and there are those who humble themselves in the midst of great wealth.” .

For indeed a person who loses by daily distractions of mind and lack of self control what he appears to gain by the conversion of others puts his profits into a bag with holes. And so it is that while they fancy that they can make larger profits by the instruction of others, they are actually deprived of their own improvement. For “there are who make themselves out as rich though possessing nothing, and there are who humble themselves amid great riches.”
