And so God, the Creator and Healer of all, knowing that pride is the cause and fountain head of evils, has been careful to heal opposites with opposites, that those things which were ruined by pride might be restored by humility. For the one says, “I will ascend into heaven,” and the other, “My soul was brought low even to the ground.” … The one says, “As eggs are gathered together which are left, so have I gathered all the earth”; the other says, “I am like a pelican of the wilderness … and am become as a sparrow dwelling alone on a roof.” … If we look at the reason for our original fall and the foundations of our salvation, and [if we] consider by whom and in what way the latter were laid and the former originated, we may learn, either through the fall of the devil, or through the example of Christ, how to avoid so terrible a death from pride.
