For it is not free will but the Lord who “looses those who are bound.” It is not our strength, but the Lord who “raises those who have fallen.” It is not our diligence in reading, but “the Lord who enlightens the blind” where the Greek says kyrios sophoi typhlous, that is, “the Lord makes wise the blind.” It is not our care, but “the Lord who cares for the stranger.” It is not our courage, but “the Lord who assists (or supports) all those who are down.”
