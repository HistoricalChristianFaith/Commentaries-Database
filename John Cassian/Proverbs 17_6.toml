Instead of the pleasure that a person has in possessing one field and house, he who has passed over into the adoption of the children of God will enjoy a hundred times more all the riches that belong to the eternal Father and that he will possess as his own, and in imitation of the true Son he will proclaim by disposition and by virtue, “All that the Father has is mine.” No longer occupied with the criminal concern of distraction and worry, but secure and happy, he will enter everywhere as it were into his property, and every day he will hear it said to him by the apostle, “All things are yours, whether the world or things present or things to come.” And by Solomon, “The faithful man has a world of riches.” .
