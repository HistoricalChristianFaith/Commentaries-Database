Instead of the pleasure that a person has in possessing one field and house, he who has passed over into the adoption of the children of God will enjoy a hundred times more all the riches that belong to the eternal Father and that he will possess as his own, and in imitation of the true Son he will proclaim by disposition and by virtue, “All that the Father has is mine.” No longer occupied with the criminal concern of distraction and worry, but secure and happy, he will enter everywhere as it were into his property, and every day he will hear it said to him by the apostle, “All things are yours, whether the world or things present or things to come.” And by Solomon, “The faithful man has a world of riches.” .

Instead of the joy that people experience from the possession of a single field or house those who have been adopted as children of God will enjoy a delight in riches a hundred times greater and possess as their own all things which belong to the eternal Father, and assert in heart and soul like the true Son: “All things that the Father has are mine.” If no longer occupied by criminal anxiety in distractions and cares, but free from care and glad at heart they go everywhere as to their own, they will hear daily the announcement made by the apostle: “For all things are yours, whether the world or things present or things to come;” and by Solomon: “The faithful has a world of riches.”
