According to the plain teaching of the Lord, the king’s highway is easy and smooth, though it may be felt as hard and rough. For those who piously and faithfully serve him, when they have taken on them the yoke of the Lord and have learned of him, that he is meek and lowly of heart, at once [they] somehow or other lay aside the burden of earthly passions and find no labor but rest for their souls, by the gift of the Lord. [To this] he himself testifies by Jeremiah the prophet, saying, “Stand on the ways and see, and ask for the old paths, which is the good way, and walk in it: and you shall find refreshment for your souls.” For to them at once “the crooked shall become straight and the rough ways plain”; and they shall “taste and see that the Lord is gracious.” And when they hear Christ proclaiming in the Gospel, “Come unto me, all you that labor and are heavy laden, and I will refresh you,” they will lay aside the burden of their sins and realize what follows: “For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.” The way of the Lord then has refreshment if it is kept according to his law.
