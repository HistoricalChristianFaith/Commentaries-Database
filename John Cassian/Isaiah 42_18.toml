“Who is deaf but my servant?” And who is blind, but the one to whom I have sent my messengers?” And so that no one might ascribe their blindness to their nature instead of to their own will, he says elsewhere: “Bring forth the people that are blind and have eyes, that are deaf and have ears.” And again he says, “You have eyes, but do not see, ears but do not hear.”
