“Who is deaf but my servant? And who is blind but the one to whom I have sent my messengers?” And so that no one would be able to ascribe this blindness of theirs to nature and not to will, he says elsewhere, “Lead out the people who are blind and who have eyes, who are deaf and who have ears.” And again he says, “You who have eyes and do not see, and ears and do not hear.” - "Conference 13.12.3–4"
