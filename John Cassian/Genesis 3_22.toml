And how will that statement of the Lord stand, after the sin of the first man: “Behold, Adam is become like one of us, knowing good and evil?” For he must not to be thought to have been such before the sin that he was wholly ignorant of good. Otherwise, it must be admitted that he was created like an irrational and senseless animal; and this is quite absurd and foreign to the Catholic faith. No, rather, according to the pronouncement of the most wise Solomon, “God made man right,” that is, to enjoy continually the knowledge of good alone. But they sought many thoughts. So they were made, as it was said, “knowing good and evil.” After the fall, therefore, Adam conceived a knowledge of evil, which he did not have. But he did not lose the knowledge of good, which he did have.
