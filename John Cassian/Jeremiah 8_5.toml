Those then who perish, perish against his will. This he testifies against each one of them day by day: “Turn from your evil ways. Why will you die, O house of Israel?” And again: “How often would I have gathered your children together as a hen gathers her chickens under her wings, but you would not.” And: “Why has this people in Jerusalem turned away with a stubborn revolting? They have hardened their faces and refused to return.” The grace of the Christ then is at hand every day. For it “wills all to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth.” It calls all without any exception, saying, “Come to me, all you who labor and are heavy laden, and I will refresh you.” - "Conference 2.13.7"
