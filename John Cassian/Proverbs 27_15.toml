Solomon remarks that the same thing happens to the soul in a spiritual way when he says in other words, “Leaks drive a person out of his house on a stormy day.” Neatly, then, does he compare spiritual carelessness with a neglected roof, through which as it were certain tiny leaks of passion penetrate to the soul. If these little and insignificant leaks are let go unattended, they weaken the structure of the virtues, and afterward they pour in a heavy shower of sinfulness. As a consequence, on a stormy day—that is, in time of trial—the mind is expelled by the onrushing assault of the devil from the dwelling place of virtue, in which it had once reposed as if it were its own house when it maintained a careful watchfulness. .

Solomon tells us that the same thing happens spiritually to the soul when he says in other words: “Dripping water drives a man out of the house on a stormy day.” Elegantly then he compares spiritual carelessness to a roof and tiles that have not been looked after, through which in the first instance slight drippings of the passions make their way to the soul. If these are not heeded, being considered but small and trifling, then the beams of virtues will decay and be carried away by a great tempest of sins, through which “on a stormy day,” that is, in the time of temptation, the devil’s attack will assail us, and the soul will be driven forth from the abode of virtue, in which it had remained as in its own house as long as it persevered in watchful diligence.
