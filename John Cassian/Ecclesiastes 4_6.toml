According to the words of Solomon, “A single handful with repose is better than two handfuls with toil and presumption of spirit.” All those who are very weak are inevitably entangled in these illusions and losses. Even though their own salvation is in doubt and they still stand in need of others’ teaching and instruction, they are prompted by diabolical illusions to convert and to govern others. And even if they have been able to acquire some gain and to make some conversions, they will lose whatever they got because of their impatience and their immoderate behavior. .
