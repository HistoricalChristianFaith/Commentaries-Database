According to the words of Solomon, “A single handful with repose is better than two handfuls with toil and presumption of spirit.” All those who are very weak are inevitably entangled in these illusions and losses. Even though their own salvation is in doubt and they still stand in need of others’ teaching and instruction, they are prompted by diabolical illusions to convert and to govern others. And even if they have been able to acquire some gain and to make some conversions, they will lose whatever they got because of their impatience and their immoderate behavior. .

As Solomon says, “Better is a single handful with rest than both hands full with labor and vexation of mind.” And in these allusions and inconveniences all that are in the least weak are sure to be entangled. Even as they doubt their own salvation and stand in need of the teaching and instruction of others, they are incited by the devil’s tricks to convert and guide others. And even if they succeed in gaining any advantage from the conversion of some, they waste whatever they have gained by their impatience and rude manners.
