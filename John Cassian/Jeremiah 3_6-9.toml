It is written in the law: “You shall not commit adultery.” This is rightly observed according to the simple meaning of the letter by one who is still in bondage to foul passions. But by one who has already forsaken these dirty acts and impure affections, it must be observed in the spirit, so that he may forsake not only the worship of idols but also all heathen superstitions and the observance of auguries and omens and all signs and days and times, or at any rate he should not be entangled in the conjectures of words and names that destroy the simplicity of our faith. This is the kind of fornication by which Jerusalem is said to have been corrupted, the fornication “on every high hill and beneath every leafing tree.” The Lord criticized Jerusalem for this through the words of the prophet, “Let them stand and save you, these astrologers who studied the stars and counted the months so as to tell from these what was coming to you.”
