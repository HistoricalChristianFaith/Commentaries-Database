But there are many also who while still living in this body are dead and incapable of praising God while lying in the grave. However, there are others of us who, although dead in the body, bless and praise God in the spirit, according to the words of the text, “Bless the Lord, spirits and souls of the righteous,” and “Let every living spirit praise the Lord.” And in the Apocalypse it is said that the spirits of those who have been killed not only praise God but also speak directly with him.
