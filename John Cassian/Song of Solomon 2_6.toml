Solomon also speaks of the right hand and the left hand in the Song of Songs in the person of the bride: “His left hand is under my head, and his right hand will embrace me.” Although she indicates that both are beneficial, yet she puts the former under her head because adversities should be subject to the guidance of the heart. They are beneficial only to the extent that they discipline us for a time, instruct us for salvation and make us perfectly patient. But for being fondled and forever protected she desires the bridegroom’s right hand to cling to her and to hold her fast in a saving embrace. - "Conference 6.10.9"
