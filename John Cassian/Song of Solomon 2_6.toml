Solomon also speaks of the right hand and the left hand in the Song of Songs in the person of the bride: “His left hand is under my head, and his right hand will embrace me.” Although she indicates that both are beneficial, yet she puts the former under her head because adversities should be subject to the guidance of the heart. They are beneficial only to the extent that they discipline us for a time, instruct us for salvation and make us perfectly patient. But for being fondled and forever protected she desires the bridegroom’s right hand to cling to her and to hold her fast in a saving embrace. - "Conference 6.10.9"

Solomon speaks in the person of the bride of this right and left hand in the Song of Songs: “His left hand is under my head, and his right hand shall embrace me.” And while this passage shows that both are useful, yet it puts the left hand under the head, because misfortunes ought to be subject to the control of the heart. Misfortunes are only useful for this—namely, to train us for a time and discipline us for our salvation and make us perfect in the matter of patience. But the right hand she hopes will always cling to her to cherish her and hold her fast in the blessed embrace of the Bridegroom, uniting her to him indissolubly.
