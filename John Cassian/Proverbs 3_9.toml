“Honor the Lord from your righteous labors, and offer to him the fruits of your righteousness; that your barns may be full of an abundance of wheat, and your vats may overflow with wine.” Know that as you are faithfully carrying out this service, you have fulfilled the righteousness of the old law, under which those who then lived if they transgressed it inevitably incurred guilt, while if they fulfilled it they could not attain to the height of perfection.

Our Lord wants nothing done for his honor and glory without it being tempered by judgment, for “the honor of a king loves judgment.” Therefore Solomon, the wisest of men, urges us not to let our judgment tilt to either side, saying: “Honor God with your righteous labors and offer to him of the fruits of your righteousness.” For we have in our conscience an uncorrupt and true judge who, when all others are wrong, is the only person not deceived as to the state of our purity.
