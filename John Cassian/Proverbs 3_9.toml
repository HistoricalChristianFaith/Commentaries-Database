“Honor the Lord from your righteous labors, and give to him from the fruits of your righteousness, so that your barns may be full of an abundance of wheat and your winepresses may be overflowing with wine.” Know that when you exercise this devout practice in faith you have fulfilled the righteousness of the old law, which those who were under it then transgressed, unavoidably incurring guilt, while even when they did fulfill it they were unable to attain to the summit of perfection. .

Our Lord wants nothing to be done for his worship and honor without the moderating force of judgment, because “the king’s honor loves judgment.” Therefore, so that we might tip to neither side by an erring judgment, the most wise Solomon says by way of admonition: “Honor God from your righteous labors, and give to him from the fruits of your righteousness.” For there is in our conscience an incorrupt and true judge, who alone is never mistaken about the state of our impurity, even though all others may be misled. .
