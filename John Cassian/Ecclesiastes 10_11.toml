These silent bites are alone in fending off the medicine of the wise people. This deadly menace is so utterly incurable that it is worsened by soothings, inflamed by serious treatment, and irritated by gifts.

“If a snake bites without hissing,” it says, “there is no abundance for the charmer,” indicating that the bite of a silent snake is dangerous. This means that if a diabolical suggestion or thought has not been disclosed by confessing it to the charmer (namely, to a spiritual man, who by the songs of Scripture can heal a wound immediately and draw the snake’s harmful venom out of a person’s heart), he will not be able to help the one who is in danger and about to perish.
