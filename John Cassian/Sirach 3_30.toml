Eternal salvation is promised not only under the particular name of repentance, of which the blessed apostle Peter says, “Repent and be converted that your sins may be forgiven.” John the Baptist and the Lord himself said, “Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.” The burden of our sins is also overwhelmed by the affection of love, for “love covers a multitude of sins.” In the same way, by the fruits of almsgiving a remedy is also provided for our wounds because “as water extinguishes fire, so does almsgiving extinguish sin.” So also the washing away of offenses is gained by the shedding of tears, for “every night I will wash my bed; I will water my couch with tears.” Finally, to show that they are not shed in vain, he adds, “Depart from me all you who work iniquity, for the Lord has heard the voice of my weeping.” Moreover, by means of confession of sins, their absolution is granted, for “I said, I will confess against myself my sin to the Lord, and you forgave the iniquity of my heart,” and again, “Declare your iniquities first, that you may be justified.” Forgiveness for crimes committed is obtained also by afflicting the heart and body, for he says, “Look on my humility and my labor, and forgive me all my sins.” This is especially true when considering the amendment of one’s life. “Take away,” he says, “the evil of your thoughts from my eyes. Stop doing evil; learn to do good. Seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge the orphan, defend the widow. And come, reason with me, says the Lord, and though your sins were as scarlet, yet they shall be as white as snow, though they were red as crimson, they shall be as white as wool.”
