We find that the word flesh is used in holy Scripture with many different meanings: for sometimes it stands for the whole person, that is, for that which consists of body and soul, as here: “And the Word was made flesh,”? and “All flesh shall see the salvation of our God.” Sometimes it stands for sinful and carnal people, as here: “My spirit shall not remain in those men, because they are flesh.” Sometimes it is used for sins themselves, as here: “But you are not in the flesh but in the spirit,” and again, “Flesh and blood shall not inherit the kingdom of God.” Lastly there follows, “Neither shall corruption inherit incorruption.” Sometimes [as with David] it stands for unity and relationship, as here: “Behold we are your bone and your flesh,” and the apostle says, “If by any means I may provoke to emulation them who are my flesh, and save some of them.” We must therefore inquire in which of these four meanings we ought to take the word flesh in this place.
