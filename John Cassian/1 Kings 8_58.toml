Divine Scripture corroborates the freedom of our will when it says, “Guard your heart with all care.” But the apostle lays bare its weakness when he says, “May the Lord guard your hearts and your understanding in Christ Jesus.” David proclaims the power of free will when he says, “I have inclined my heart to do your righteous deeds.” But he also teaches its weakness when he prays and says, “Incline my heart to your testimonies and not to avarice.” Solomon says as well, “May the Lord incline our hearts to himself, so that we may walk in all his ways and keep his commands and his ceremonies and his judgments.” - "Conference 13.10.1"
