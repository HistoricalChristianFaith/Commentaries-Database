Divine Scripture corroborates the freedom of our will when it says, “Guard your heart with all care.” But the apostle lays bare its weakness when he says, “May the Lord guard your hearts and your understanding in Christ Jesus.” David proclaims the power of free will when he says, “I have inclined my heart to do your righteous deeds.” But he also teaches its weakness when he prays and says, “Incline my heart to your testimonies and not to avarice.” Solomon says as well, “May the Lord incline our hearts to himself, so that we may walk in all his ways and keep his commands and his ceremonies and his judgments.” - "Conference 13.10.1"

For Holy Scripture supports the freedom of the will where it says: “Keep your heart with all diligence,” but the apostle indicates its weakness by saying “The Lord keep your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus.” David asserts the power of free will, where he says, “I have inclined my heart to do your righteous acts,” but he also teaches us its weakness, by praying and saying, “Incline my heart unto your testimonies and not to covetousness.” Solomon also: “The Lord incline our hearts to himself that we may walk in all his ways and keep his commandments and ordinances and judgments.”
