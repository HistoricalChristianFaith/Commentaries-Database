From your own example, therefore, learn to be compassionate toward those who struggle, and never frighten with bleak despair those who are in trouble or unsettle them with harsh words. Instead, encourage them mildly and gently and, according to the precept of that most wise Solomon: “Spare not to save those who are being led to death and to redeem those who are being slain.” .

Learn from your own experience to sympathize with those in trouble and never terrify with destructive despair those who are in danger, nor harden them with severe speeches, but rather restore them with gentle and kindly consolations. As the wise Solomon says, “Spare not to deliver those who are led forth to death, and to redeem those who are to be slain.”
