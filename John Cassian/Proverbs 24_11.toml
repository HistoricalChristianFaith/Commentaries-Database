From your own example, therefore, learn to be compassionate toward those who struggle, and never frighten with bleak despair those who are in trouble or unsettle them with harsh words. Instead, encourage them mildly and gently and, according to the precept of that most wise Solomon: “Spare not to save those who are being led to death and to redeem those who are being slain.” .
