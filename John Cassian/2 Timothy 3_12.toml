Abba Germanus said: “Since you have given us the remedies for every illusion, and since the diabolical snares that used to trouble us have been disclosed to us by your teaching and by the Lord’s gift, we beseech you likewise to explain to us completely this phrase from the Gospel, “My yoke is easy and my burden is light.” For it seems quite contrary to the words of the prophet, which say, “On account of the words of your lips I have kept to hard ways.” Indeed, even the apostle says, “All who wish to live devoutly in Christ suffer persecution.” Whatever is hard and has reference to persecution, however, can be neither light nor easy.” Abba Abraham said, “We shall demonstrate by the easy proof of experience itself that the words of our Lord and Savior are most true, if we set out on the path of perfection in lawful manner and in accordance with the will of Christ.… For what can be heavy or hard to the person who has taken up Christ’s yoke with his whole mind, is established in true humility, reflects constantly upon the Lord’s suffering and rejoices in all the hardships that come upon him?”
