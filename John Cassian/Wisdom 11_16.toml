If it happens that the yoke of Christ seems to us neither light nor sweet, this must be attributed to our obstinacy. Affected as we are by diffidence and by lack of faith regarding his precept, indeed his counsel, which says, “If you want to be perfect, go, sell (that is, abandon) all of your belongings, then come and follow me,” we rebel with a futile perverseness, turning again to the pursuit of earthly goods. And then, once the devil has our soul bound by these chains, what else does he need to do, when he wants to remove our spiritual joy, than to sadden us by the decrease or the total loss of earthly goods? He seeks a very precise goal with his clever deceptions. Indeed, once the sweetness of the Savior’s yoke and the lightness of his burden become heavy (through the perversity of our vicious longing), once we are trapped by the snares of those riches we have acquired in view of our rest and tranquility, will he not continuously torment us with the lash of worldly cares, drawing from our very selves the reasons for tearing us to bits? “Everyone is caught in the snares of his sins.” The prophet also says, “Look, all you who light the fire and surround yourselves with flames: walk by the heat of your fire, in the midst of the flames you have ignited.” Solomon also testifies to this: “Everyone will be punished through that by which he has sinned.” The pleasures that we enjoy end in torments, and the delights and pleasures of the body will turn against their author like executioners.
