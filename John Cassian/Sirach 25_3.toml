Just as young people are not all fervent in the Spirit in the same way and not all are completely formed in learning and good morals, so also old people are not always found equally perfect and exemplary. In fact, the wealth of old people is not to be measured by gray hairs but by their diligence in youth and the rewards of their past hard work. For, it says in Scripture, “How will you find in your old age the things you did not collect in your youth?” “For venerable old age is not longevity or counted by the number of years, but the understanding of a person is gray hairs, and a spotless life is old age.” Therefore, we are not to follow in the steps or embrace the traditions and advice of every old person whose head is covered with gray hairs and whose age is his sole claim to respect. Rather, we should only follow those whom we find to have distinguished themselves in youth in an approved and praiseworthy way—those who have been trained not in self-assurance but in the tradition of the elders.
