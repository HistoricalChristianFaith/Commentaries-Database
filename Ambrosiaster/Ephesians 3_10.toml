So abundant was God’s wisdom that he not only gave this teacher (Paul) to the Gentiles but also caused the truth to be-come known to the angelic spirits in heaven, who are the principalities and powers. They are powers because they have more power among the other spirits and are principalities because they are the principal powers.… The goal of all this is that the preaching of the church should be profitable to the Gentiles also. They are called to forsake their allegiance to the devil’s tyranny.
