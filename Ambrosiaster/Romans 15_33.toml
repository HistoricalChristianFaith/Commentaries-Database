The God of peace is Christ, who said: “My peace I give to you, my peace I leave with you.” This is what he prays for them, knowing that the Lord said: “Behold I am with you always, even to the end of the world.” Paul therefore wants them to be the kind of people in whom the Lord Jesus Christ dwells, who has shown them that all the discord caused by human sin has been taken away and who has given them what is true, that they may live peacefully in that truth.
