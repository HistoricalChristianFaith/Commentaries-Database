“The body is dead because of sin, but the spirit is alive because of righteousness.” The apostle declares that the bodies of those who have been abandoned by the Holy Spirit are dead because of sin, yet their experience of death does not touch him, that is, the Spirit. In fact, the Spirit of God does not know how to sin: he is given for justification and to justify by his help. Because he does not know how to sin, he is life, and he certainly cannot die, given that death is a result of sin. It is for this reason that the sinner harms himself, but not the Spirit whom he has received. The Spirit certainly cannot be affected—he whose purpose it is to justify. Thus, the sign of a person’s justification consists in this: that through the one who lives in him, the justified one shows himself to be a child of God. In fact “not in a false person or in a body enslaved to sin” can the Holy Spirit live, as Solomon says. Certainly, if one returns to a carnal life, abandoned by the Holy Spirit, he will die in his unrighteousness.
