“Night” means the old man, who is renewed through baptism. Paul says that he has passed away like the night and that the day is near, i.e., the sun of righteousness, by whose light the truth appears to us so that we may know what to do. For before we were in the dark, being ignorant of Christ. But when we learned of him the light rose on us and we passed from the false to the true. The “darkness” refers to carnal sins, which are done by worldly enticements…. But to “put on the armor of light” is to do good deeds. Commentary on Paul’s Epistles.
