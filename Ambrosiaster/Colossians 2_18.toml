It happens that persons become bound up with the worship of earthly things under the form of philosophy, so that, held by these, they do not riseâ€¦. They end up simulating true religion. They become inflated by watching the movements of the stars, which Paul calls angels, not by divine authority but by human superstition, which brings nothing but damnation. .
