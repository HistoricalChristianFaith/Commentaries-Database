Paul urges us to rest assured on account of our faith by showing us that God gave up his Son to death on our behalf even before we had ceased being sinners, because he knew in advance that we would believe. He says that God long ago decided that all those who believed in Christ would be rewarded. Thus if God is prepared to give us the greatest things, even to the point of sacrificing his own Son on our behalf, how can we not believe that he will give us the lesser things as well? For the believer’s rewards are already waiting. Giving them to us is not nearly as difficult as handing Christ over to death for our sake.
