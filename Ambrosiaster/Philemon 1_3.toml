Paul claims that the human race has been blessed by both the Father and the Son. He indicates that the Son is not inferior to the Father when he calls him our Lord, and that the Father is not greater than the Son, when he calls him our God, because the Father will not truly be the Father unless he is also Lord, and the Son will not truly be Lord unless he is also God.
