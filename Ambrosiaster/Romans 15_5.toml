As if he had been sent for their salvation, the apostle charges the people with a good wish, praying that God may grant them a common understanding of his wisdom according to Christ Jesus, so that they may be wise in the teaching of Christ. For then they will be able to please God by following the example of the Lord, who said: “Greater love has no man than this, that a man should lay down his life for his friends” and his brethren, and with one voice and one confession magnify God the Father in Christ.
