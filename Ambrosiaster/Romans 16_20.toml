Paul says this about his own coming to them, for then he will crush the devil so that they will be able to receive spiritual grace. Satan gets angry at that, because he wants people to remain in sin. The grace which he has promised he will give them when he comes he now prays that they will have. For if they deserve to receive that grace, then he is already with them in spirit.
