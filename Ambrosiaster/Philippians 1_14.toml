His constancy inspires others to be fearless in preaching. They are learning by the apostleâ€™s example that God is present to watch over those who love him. This itself has an effect upon the misguided brethren who have been preaching the Word of God as if from envy, prompted not by confidence or love of God but by competitiveness.
