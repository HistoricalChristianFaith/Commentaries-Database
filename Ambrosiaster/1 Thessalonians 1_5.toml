In order to indicate that he showed all humility among the Thessalonians and in order to adopt a gentle approach in dealing with them, Paul makes it clear that none of the powerful means by which they have been brought to faith is lacking. His preaching was accompanied by signs and wonders and was empowered by the Holy Spirit. It embodied the fullness of truth rather than fantasy. This could be seen in the teaching of grace, in the quality of discourse among them and in the healing of the sick. By these they could be seen to be the true heirs of the gift of God in the promises to Abraham.
