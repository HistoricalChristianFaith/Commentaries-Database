After showing that no one can be justified before God by the works of the law, Paul goes on to say that Abraham could not merit anything according to the flesh either. In saying “the flesh,” Paul meant circumcision, because Abraham sought nothing on the basis of his circumcision. For he was already justified before he was circumcised.
