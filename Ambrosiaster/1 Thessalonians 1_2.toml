We give thanks to God always for all of you:
Since all things come from God, they first offer thanks for their progress, because God has been pleased not only to give His gift to people who were still in bondage to sin, but also to adopt them as His children, at the same time helping them to put up with all suffering so that they might become worthier. 
Keeping the memory of you: 
This is because they have grown in the work of faith more than other churches and by God's grace were perfecting the work which they had eagerly begun.
