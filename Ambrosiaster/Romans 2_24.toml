Isaiah the prophet said this because God’s name was being blasphemed among the Gentiles when the Jews, by their misdeeds, did not observe the things which were handed down to them but instead gave glory to idols.… So also at the time of the apostles, God’s name was being blasphemed in Christ, because the Jews, by denying that Christ was God, were blaspheming the Father also, as the Lord said: “Whoever receives me does not receive me, but him who sent me.” Therefore God was blasphemed among the Gentiles because when they believed in Christ the Jews tried to persuade them not to call Christ “God.”
