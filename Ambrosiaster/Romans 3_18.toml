Since people of this kind have no sense, they have no fear of God. For “the fear of God is the beginning of wisdom,” says Solomon. But Scripture did not say that they did not have the fear of God. It said: “There is no fear of God before their eyes.” For seeing how evil their works were and not being horrified by them, they are said not to have the fear of God before their eyes.
