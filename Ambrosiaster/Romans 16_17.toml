Now Paul goes on to mention the false apostles, whom he warns against throughout the epistle just as he does here as well. But he attacks their teaching without saying what it is. They were forcing believers to become Jews and thereby making the benefits of God worthless.… They compiled long genealogies and used them to support their teaching, by which they were deceiving the hearts of the simple.
