[[commentary]]

The present time means our time, in which God has given what long before he had promised to give at the time at which he gave it. Paul has rightly said that God gave what he promised in order to be revealed as righteous. For he had promised that he would justify those who believe in Christ, as he says in Habakkuk: “The righteous will live by faith in me.” Whoever has faith in God and Christ is righteous.
