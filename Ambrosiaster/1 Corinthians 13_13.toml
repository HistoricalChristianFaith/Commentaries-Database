Love is the greatest because while faith is preached and hope pertains to the future life, love reigns. As  John [:] says: “By this we know his love, that he laid down his life for us.” Love is therefore the greatest of the three, because by it the human race has been renewed. Commentary on Paul’s Epistles.
