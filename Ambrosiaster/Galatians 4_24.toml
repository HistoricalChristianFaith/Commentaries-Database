These women represent the two covenants. Moses, taking the blood of a calf in a vessel, sprinkled the people, saying “this is the blood of the covenant, etc.” … The law was given on Mount Sinai. In reciting it to the people, Moses called this the book of the testament. He then sprinkled the people with blood, as I have said. This law held sinners as offenders. They soon began to be slaves of sin, as if they had been made sons of Hagar, as if returning to slavery.
