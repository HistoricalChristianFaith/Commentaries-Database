Just as it is the glory of a doctor if he cures many, so it is to the praise of God’s glory when many are won for the faith. And so it is part of God’s glory to have called the Gentiles that they might obtain their salvation through the faith promised to the Jews. The Gentiles have as a sign of their redemption and future inheritance the Holy Spirit, given at baptism.
