Timothy was a fellow worker of Paul’s as a cobishop, and he governed the church with great care. The Jews hated him to the point that he was circumcised because of it, in that his mother was Jewish and he could not be a teacher without being circumcised. Paul calls these people his kinsmen, partly by blood and partly by faith. Commentary on Paul’s Epistles.
