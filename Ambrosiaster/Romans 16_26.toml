The mystery which is eternally hidden in God was revealed in the time of Christ, for God is not alone, but from all eternity he has his Word and the Paraclete with him. God decreed that every creature was to be saved by coming to a knowledge of this truth. For the truth of this mystery had been indicated by the prophets in symbols, and it was known only to God.… This wisdom is Jesus Christ, who is from God and was with God forever.
