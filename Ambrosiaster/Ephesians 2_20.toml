This means that the household of God is built upon both the old and the new covenants. For what the apostles preached had been foretold by the prophets. In his words to the Corinthians, that “God placed in the church first apostles then prophets,” he is concerned with the order of the church. But in this case he is speaking of the foundation in the prophets of old.
