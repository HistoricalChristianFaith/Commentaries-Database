Balaam prophesied even though he was not a prophet, and Caiaphas also prophesied. So did Saul when, because of his disobedience, he was filled with an evil spirit. Judas accompanied the other disciples and understood all the mysteries and knowledge given to them, but as an enemy of love he betrayed the Savior. Both Tertullian and Novatian were men of no small learning, but because of their pride they lost the fellowship of love and falling into schism devised heresies, to their own damnation.
