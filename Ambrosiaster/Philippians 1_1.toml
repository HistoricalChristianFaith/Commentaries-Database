He keeps silence about his status as an apostle. He is writing to people who already know who he is and have an informed opinion of him. He suppresses his dignity. He declares his lowly state, because the one who confesses Christ as Lord is all the more free and has salvation.

He writes to the saints in his customary manner, but his intent is to write to those who are “saints in Christ Jesus,” specifically those who confess that he is divine and human.… He is not writing to those who by their own deceptions suppress the truth.
