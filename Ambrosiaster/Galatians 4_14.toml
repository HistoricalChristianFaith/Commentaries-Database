The ailment of the apostle was a temptation to the Galatians. But they were found constant, not doubting as to his faith. For they could have stumbled and said, “What virtue or hope is there in this faith when its minister is so humiliated?” But when he had inspired their minds with future hopes, they did not fear present death for the sake of Christ’s name.… This caused them later to blush, because after these laudable acts they became again entrapped so as to deserve reproach.
