Paul asserts that the bodies of those whom the Holy Spirit has abandoned because of sin are dead, nor does the feeling of their murder touch him, i.e., the Spirit. For the Spirit of God cannot sin. He is given for righteousness in order to make people righteous by his assistance.If a believer returns to the life of the flesh, the Holy Spirit will leave him and he will die in his unrighteousness. In saying “the body” Paul means that the whole person will die because of sin.
