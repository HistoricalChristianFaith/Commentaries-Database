He reminds us that we were brought close to God by the blood of Christ in order to show how great is Godâ€™s affection toward us, since he allowed his own Son to die. We too, enduring in faith, should not yield to despair in any of the agonies inflicted on us for his sake, knowing that what he deserves from us exceeds all that our enemies can bring upon us.
