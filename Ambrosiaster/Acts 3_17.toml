Paul also says that the Jews did not believe in Christ because they were ignorant (Rom. 10:3). They wanted to show their zeal for God, but not knowing his will or plan, they acted against him even though they claimed to be defending him. Paul says of them that it was not out of malice or envy but out of ignorance that they did not accept Christ. Not realizing that this was the Christ whom God had promised, they said they were waiting for someone else. Preferring the righteousness which they had from the law over him who is the righteousness of God in faith.
