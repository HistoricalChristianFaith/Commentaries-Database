Paul takes advantage of his authority only to the extent that he glories in the progress of believers, so that his power may be conducive to salvation and not selfaggrandizement. He did not boast beyond the power that was given to him, nor did he claim any authority in places where his preaching had not been heard. Commentary on Paulâ€™s Epistles.
