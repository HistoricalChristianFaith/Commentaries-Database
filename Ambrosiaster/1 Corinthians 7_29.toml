Paul means by this that the end of the world is coming soon. Given this fact, believers should not worry about having children and instead should dedicate themselves to the service of God. For there will be many unprecedented pressures on them, and many will fall into the devil’s trap. No one among us who has a proper fear of the pressures which the Savior predicted will want to be caught like that.
