Paul wants them to be imitators of him in these things, so that just as he has endured many hardships from unbelievers for their salvation and is still doing so as long as he preaches the free gift of God’s grace day and night, so they too ought to remain in his faith and doctrine and not accept the evil teachings of false apostles.
