Those who bring him to tears are the very ones who had already overthrown the Galatians. By treacherous proceedings they were destroying the churches in the name of Christ.… He speaks of these people with grief and tears. They were impeding the salvation of the faithful by raising questions about the eating of or abstinence from food. It is as though salvation were in food or as if “God were a belly,” one whom they believed to take delight in worldly foods according to the law while they gloried in the circumcision of their private parts. This is what it is to “think earthly thoughts.” One who “thinks spiritual thoughts” glories in faith, hope and charity.
