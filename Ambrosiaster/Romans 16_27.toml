Without Christ nothing is complete, because all things are through him. It is acknowledged that praise is given to God the Father through him, because it is understood that “through Christ” means “through his wisdom,” in whom he has saved believers. Therefore glory to the Father through the Son is glory to both in the Holy Spirit, because both are in the one glory.
