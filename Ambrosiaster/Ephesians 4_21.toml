It is Christ himself who teaches us about himself! When we are “taught in him,” we learn who he is, how great we should reckon him to be and what hope is in him. We learn “in him” what sort of people believers ought to be. Any one who has “learned Christ” knows that he rose from the dead to be the pattern for the faithful. He teaches that there is great hope after this death for those who love God.
