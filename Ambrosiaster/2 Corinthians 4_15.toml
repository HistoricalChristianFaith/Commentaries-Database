God does not want anyone to be excluded from his gift. But because not everyone had received the word of faith, God’s apostle, who knew God’s will, was not afraid to suffer persecutions and perils as long as he could preach to everyone faithfully, so that more people might believe. Commentary on Paul’s Epistles.
