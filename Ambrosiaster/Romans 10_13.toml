God himself, when he was seen by Moses, said to him: “My name is the Lord.” This is the Son of God, who is said to be both a messenger and God. The Son is not to be confused with the Father from whom all things come, but is to be acknowledged as the One through whom all things come and to whom all things belong. He is called God because the Father and the Son are one. He is also called an angel, because he was sent by the Father to announce the promised salvation.
