Although he extols the grace of Christ on many occasions, he offers a special kind of honor to the Philippians in this passage. He says: “God has allowed you to suffer for Christ.” He does not propose this distinction to any but true lovers of Christ. His paradoxical reasoning is that this gift “is given to you for Christ!” This means that God the Father gives this special gift to lovers of his Son. Why? That their blessings might increase correspondingly through their participation in suffering on Christ’s behalf. Paul speaks as one who himself has received this gift.
