In the sixtyeighth Psalm [lxx] the Savior says that he did not come to please himself but God the Father. For because he said: “I did not come down from heaven to do my will but the will of him who sent me,” the Jews objected and put him to death as a sinner. Therefore the psalmist puts himself in Christ’s place and says: “The reproaches of those who reproached thee fell on me.” Commentary on Paul’s Epistles.

In the sixty-eighth Psalm [LXX] the Savior says that he did not come to please himself but God the Father.

Therefore the psalmist puts himself in Christ’s place and says: “The reproaches of those who reproached thee fell on me.”
