quote='''
If we are going to receive what we have done in the body, it is clear that we shall not be judged without a body, good or bad. Paul does not say “in the flesh,” because the deeds of the flesh always deserve punishment, but “in the body,” because sometimes the body acts spiritually and sometimes it acts carnally.
