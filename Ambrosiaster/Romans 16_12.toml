Persis appears to be more honored than the other two, because she has worked hard in the Lord. This work is one of encouragement and of service to the saints for Christ’s sake when they are under pressure and in need, because they had fled their homes and were being attacked by unbelievers. Commentary on Paul’s Epistles.
