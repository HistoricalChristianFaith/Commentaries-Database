This seed, which alone remains reserved for the conversion of the human race is Christ and his teaching, as he himself said: “The seed is the Word of God.” Therefore what was long ago promised to us who have been delivered from the burden of the law remains for our redemption, so that by receiving the forgiveness of sins we might not be punished by the law and perish as Sodom did. Commentary on Paul’s Epistles.
