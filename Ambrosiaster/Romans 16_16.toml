Paul asks that all those to whom he has written and whom he names be greeted with a holy kiss, that is, in the peace of Christ, not in the desire of the flesh, because these kisses are spiritual, not physical.By saying “churches of Christ” Paul is saying that there is a church which is not Christ’s. For David called the company of evildoers an assembly of the wicked.
