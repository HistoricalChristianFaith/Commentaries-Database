Paul is exhorting the Corinthians to avoid any connection with idolatry, so that not only their bodies but their minds as well might be separated from it in order to destroy any form of temptation. For anyone involved in idolatry will expect something out of it. To trust in an idol is to turn away from God. Commentary on Paulâ€™s Epistles.
