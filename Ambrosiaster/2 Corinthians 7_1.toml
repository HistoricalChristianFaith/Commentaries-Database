What Paul is saying is clear, but “defilement of the flesh” is to be interpreted in a complex way. Notice that he did not say “from defilement of the flesh” but “from every defilement of the flesh” in order to encourage us to flee from all carnal vices—everything which the law prohibits—so that we might perfect holiness of the Spirit in the fear of God. We do this by pursuing the things which are right in the fear of God and which are therefore holy, abstaining from sins in the name of Christ. People who restrain themselves from vices without professing Christ may seem to be set apart according to the world but not according to the Spirit of God. Only those who believe are made clean. Others, whatever they may be like, remain unclean.
