Then, too, while we were with you, we insisted on this to you
Paul not only taught with words but encouraged others by his deeds. It is the sign of a perfect teacher when he backs up his teaching with deeds. Those who learn know what they are hearing is true if they see that these things are not neglected by their teacher. Even if they know that what they are being taught is obviously true, if they see that it is ignored by their teacher, it will make little impression on his hearers, because actions speak louder than words. 

that if anyone was not willing to work, neither should he eat
 Whoever dines often at someone else's house is given over to idleness and must flatter the person who is feeding him, but our religion calls people to freedom. So Paul says that if someone refuses to eat then he does not have to work, because nobody can live without food, everyone should strive to live independently and in that way please God.
