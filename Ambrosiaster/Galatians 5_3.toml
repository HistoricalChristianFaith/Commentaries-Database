There are some who serve the law to a certain extent without being circumcised; for many Romans in Judea served the law without circumcision.â€¦ Yet there is no one who is circumcised without being required to serve the whole law. He is a debtor, since the law was given to the circumcised. His meaning here was that they had become so negligent as to deserve to bear all the burdens of the law.
