The prophet Isaiah said: “He was led like a sheep to the slaughter” [Is :] and so on. Revelation [:] adds that he was slain from before the foundation of the world. And Deuteronomy [:] says: “You will see your life hanging before your eyes, yet you will not believe.” This is expressed in the future tense, to prevent the wicked from claiming that it does not apply to Christ. Commentary on Paul’s Epistles.
