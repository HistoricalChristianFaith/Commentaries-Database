The law said: “Love your neighbor and hate your enemy,” but the Lord says: “Unless your righteousness exceeds the righteousness of the scribes and the Pharisees, you will not enter the kingdom of God.” Therefore, in order for this to be the case, it is taught that we should not repay evil with evil. Commentary on Paul’s Epistles.
