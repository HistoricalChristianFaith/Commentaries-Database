Here Israel refers to the Israel of the flesh, those who are children of Abraham but not according to faith. For the true Israel is spiritual and sees God by believing in him. “All day long” means “always.”This passage may also refer to the Savior, who held out his hands on the cross to plead forgiveness for those who were killing him.
