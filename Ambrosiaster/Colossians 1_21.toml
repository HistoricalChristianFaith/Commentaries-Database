As he recalls God’s gift to the Gentiles, Paul shows by how much more they are debtors with respect to God’s grace. For they were enemies of his counsel, by which he had decided to visit the human race through his servant Moses. They did not receive his teaching and power but worshiped their own idols, even the evil works. They adored the works which they themselves had fabricated. .
