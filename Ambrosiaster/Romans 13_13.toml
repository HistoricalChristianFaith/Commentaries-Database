It is true that people do not sin in public, so let us behave as if we were constantly in the public eye. For there is nothing more public than the truth…. Crimes are hatched in large supplies of wine, and many kinds of lust are stirred up. Therefore banquets of this kind are to be avoided…. Debauchery is another result of this sort of thing. Paul was right to warn them against quarreling and jealousy, because both of these things lead to enmity. Commentary on Paul’s Epistles.
