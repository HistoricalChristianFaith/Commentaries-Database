God is no respecter of persons. Even Saul and Judas had been good at one time. How could someone who was not good have a share in the Savior's ministry? In the plan of God it was decided that we would be considered worthy for the time for which he was chosen. It is no wonder that these men were considered good, because all nature is good and no substance is evil, but rather transgression, which arises from the will.
