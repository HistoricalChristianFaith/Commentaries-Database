It is not that God, knowing the intention of their heart and their ignorance, gives them the opposite of what they ask for. Rather he teaches them what ought to be given to people who love God. This is what the Lord says in the Gospel: “For your Father knows what you need, even before you ask him.” Those who are called according to the promise are those whom God knew would believe in the future.
