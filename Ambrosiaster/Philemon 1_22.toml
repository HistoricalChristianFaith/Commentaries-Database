In order to make Philemon more concerned and more willing to obey, Paul indicates that he will be coming to visit him, for those who are absent are usually ignored. Why should the apostle have refused to go there, when he was always suffering trials and afflictions, beatings, persecutions and imprisonment, and who had no rest other than in Christ? But Paul offered his flesh to suffering for the benefit of believers, in order to obtain immortal crowns for his soul and body. That way the enemies of Christ would be confounded and God's glory would be increased.
