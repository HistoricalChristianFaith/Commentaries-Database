In order to give the Gentiles greater assurance and a surer hope, Paul backs up God’s decree with many examples.Why is Christ said to be from the root of Jesse and not from the root of Boaz, a righteous man, or of Obed? It is because he is said to be the Son of David on account of the kingdom, and just as he was born of God to be king, so also he was born of David according to the flesh. Therefore, the root of Jesse is the tree of David, which bore fruit on the branch which is the Virgin Mary, who gave birth to Christ.
