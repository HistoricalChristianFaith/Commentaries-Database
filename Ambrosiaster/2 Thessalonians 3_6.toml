Since every congregation not everyone is obedient to the word of doctrine and some prefer their own pleasure and determination, not that of the law, Paul directs the Thessalonians to turn away from them so that they will realize their error. *A brother who is caught doing such things the bishop can bar him not only from the Sacraments but also from common intercourse with his fellows, so that when he is avoided by them he may feel ashamed and repent.
