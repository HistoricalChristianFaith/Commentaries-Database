“Then Jezebel sent a messenger to Elijah, saying, ‘So may the gods do to me, and more also, if I do not make your life like the life of one of them by this time tomorrow.’ ” The insane woman contemplated that after learning from the king what Elijah had done to the prophets of Baal. However, she postponed the revenge that she desired, until the people, who were around [the prophet], were dispersed. In fact, in spite of her madness, she feared to be stoned if the people discovered her scheme to kill the prophet, who was well-known for the justice of his customs and had been seen in the act of releasing the clouds and making rain and fire, through which he had benefited his people by humiliating the arrogance of the friends of Baal and by defeating completely the famine.
