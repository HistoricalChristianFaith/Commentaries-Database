She was crying out [as] she was following after him, “Have mercy on me.” But he did not reply to her. The silence of our Lord elicited an even deeper cry by the Canaanite woman. He who was spurned by Israel spurned her by his silence, but she did not give up. Though neglected, she did not hold back. On the contrary, she again humbled herself and again magnified Israel, by [her words], “Even the dogs eat from their masters’ [crumbs],” as though the Jews were masters of the Gentiles. His disciples therefore drew near and begged him to send her away. … She was not ashamed, to her own benefit, of the name of dogs. Therefore [he said], “Great is your faith, O woman.”
