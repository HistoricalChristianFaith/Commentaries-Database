“As for the ram that you saw with the two horns, this is the king of the Medes and the Persians.” [Gabriel] alludes to Darius. “The two horns” signify the two kingdoms, the Persian and the Mede. “The male goat is the king of Greece”: Alexander. “And the great horn between his eyes” signifies his highest power and his exceedingly extended empire all over the world. “After the horn was broken, four kingdoms arose from it”: the monarchy of Alexander, after his death, will be diminished and divided into parts assigned to his friends Seleucus, Philip, Demetrius and Ptolemy.
