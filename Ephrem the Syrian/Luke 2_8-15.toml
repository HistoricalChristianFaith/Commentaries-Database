As peace began to be established, the angels proclaimed: “Glory in the highest and peace on earth.” When lower beings received peace from superior beings, “they cried, Glory on earth and peace in the heavens.” At that time when the divinity came down and was clothed in humanity, the angels cried, “Peace on earth.” And at the time when that humanity ascended in order to be absorbed into the divinity and sit on the right, “Peace in heaven,” the infants were crying forth before him, “Hosanna in the highest.” Hence the apostle also learned that one should say, “He made peace by the blood of his cross for that which is in heaven and on earth.” A further interpretation is that the angels cried forth: “Glory in the highest and peace on earth,” and that the children cried out, “Peace in heaven and glory on earth.” This is to show that just as the grace of his mercy gave joy to sinners on earth, so too their repentance gave joy to the angels in heaven. “Glory to God!” came from free will. Peace and reconciliation were for those against whom he was angry, and hope and remission were for the guilty.
