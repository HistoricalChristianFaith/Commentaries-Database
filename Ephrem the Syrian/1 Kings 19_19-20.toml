“So he set out from there and found Elisha son of Shaphat. He passed by him and threw his mantle over him.” With his mantle Elijah took Elisha from farming to prophesying. From the symbolic point of view, Elisha represents the type of the apostles to whom our Lord said in the Gospel, “So stay here in the city of Jerusalem until you have been clothed with power from high.” Therefore the mantle of Elijah signified the gifts of the Spirit which the apostles would receive.
