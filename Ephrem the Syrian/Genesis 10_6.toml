Concerning Nimrod, Moses said, “He was a mighty hunter before the Lord,” because, according to the will of the Lord, it was he who fought with each of these nations and chased them out from there, so that they would go out and settle in the regions that had been set apart for them by God. “Therefore it is said, like Nimrod a mighty hunter before the Lord.” One used to bless a chief or a ruler by saying, “May you be like Nimrod, a mighty hunter who was victorious in the battles of the Lord.” .
