Enoch begot Methuselah, and Methuselah begot Lamech, and Lamech begot Noah (whose name means “relief” in Hebrew and Syriac). Lamech prophesied about his son and said, “This one shall bring us relief from our work and from the toil of our hands and from the earth which the Lord cursed.” His offerings … will be pleasing to God who, because of the sin of the earth’s inhabitants, will destroy in the waters of wrath the buildings that we have made and the plants over which our hands have toiled.
