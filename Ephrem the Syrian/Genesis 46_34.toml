Joseph went out to meet his father with chariots and with many people. [Joseph] got down [from his horse] and bowed down to his father, and they wept on each other’s neck. Then Joseph commanded his brothers to say to Pharaoh, “We and our fathers are keepers of cattle,” so that they might dwell in Goshen and thus keep their distance from those who worship sheep and bulls.
