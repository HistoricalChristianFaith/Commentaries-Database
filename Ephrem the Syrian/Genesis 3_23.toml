God now sends him "to work the earth from which he had been taken, " [ Gen. 3:23 ] so that he who had been harmed by the ease in the Garden might be benefited by toil on the earth.

When Adam sinned
God cast him forth from paradise,
but in his grace he granted him
the low ground beyond it,
settling him in the valley
below the foothills of paradise;
but when mankind even there continued to sin
they were blotted out,
and because they were unworthy
to be neighbors of paradise,
God commanded the ark
to cast them out on Mount Qardu.
