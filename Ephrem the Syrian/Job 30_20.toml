“I have become like dust and ashes,” that is, I have been rendered contemptible to them as if I were dust, and I appear to be similar to vile mud. Emmanuel too, even though he was God, was thoughtlessly considered to be unworthy when he was clothed with flesh, so that the impure Jews said, “Even though you are a man, you make yourself God.” - "Commentary on Job 30.19"
