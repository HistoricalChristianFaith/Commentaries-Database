“When our Lord had arrived and had entered the boat with Simon, the wind abated.” The Arian, therefore, who contradicts the birth [of the Lord] is also rejected, through the word that those who were in the boat spoke, “They came and worshiped him, and they were saying to him, ‘You are indeed the Son of God.’ ” It is he of whom it is written, “The waters saw you and trembled, and the depths too were stirred up. Your pathways are on many waters, and your footsteps are not known.” So they confessed by their word that he, concerning whom these things were spoken, was indeed the Son of God.
