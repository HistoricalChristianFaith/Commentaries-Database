Since our Lord was the fulfillment of justice and the beginning of mercy, he put the sword in its sheath and put justice back in its place again. He then healed the ear through mercy. He put the ear back in its place and made good the imperfection of justice through fruitful mercy. He whose ear had been healed expressed his gratitude for this love with hatred. Those who had “fallen backwards to the ground” and had been raised up again through Christ, thanked him for his help with chains. “They bound him,” said the Evangelist, “and led him away.”

Not fearing the power that had flattened them, they stretched out their impure hands and seized him who was purifying them. “Simon cut off the ear of one of them.” The good Lord in his gentleness took it and put it back in its elevated place on the body, as a figure of him who had fallen into the lower abyss because of his sins. “Put your sword back again into its place.” He whose word was a sword did not need a sword. Just as he restored the ear that was cut off back to its place, he could have separated the members that were joined. Unsatisfied with showing the intensity of his power with a single example, he showed it to all those who “retreated and fell backwards to the ground.” The one whose ear had been healed would not be the only one to benefit from grace. He allowed all that were about to apprehend him to benefit from it, so that they would certainly know whom they were going to arrest. The grace of him who had restored the ear to its place made those who “fell backwards to the ground” able to get up again.
