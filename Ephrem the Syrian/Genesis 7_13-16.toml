“The Lord shut the door before Noah,” lest those left behind come at the time of the floods and break down the gate of the ark. The deluge came and “God blotted out all flesh. Only Noah was left and those that were with him in the ark.” The springs of the abyss and the floodgates of heaven were open forty days and forty nights, and the “ark was afloat for one hundred fifty days.”
