When the two of them had been questioned and found to be lacking in contrition or valid excuse, God descended to the serpent, not with a question, but with a punishment. For where there was a possibility of repentance He made use of questions, but with a creature that is alien to repentance He employed a sentence of judgment. And you should realize that the serpent cannot repent from the fact that, when God said to it, "Because you have done this you are more cursed than all cattle," [ Gen. 3:14 ] it did not say "I did not do it" because it was afraid to lie, nor did it say "I did it," because it was alien to repentance.

When [Adam and Eve] had been questioned and were both found to be wanting in remorse or true contrition, God went down to the serpent, not to make inquiry but to render punishment. For where there is opportunity for repentance, it would be right to inquire, but to one who is a stranger to repentance, judgment is fitting. It is so that you might know that the serpent is not capable of repentance, that when God said to it, “Because you have done this, cursed are you above every beast,” the serpent did not say, “I did not do it,” because it was afraid to lie, nor did it say, “I did it,” because it was a stranger to repentance.

“Cursed are you above every beast,” because you deceived those who rule over all the beasts. Instead of being more clever than all the beasts you will be more cursed than all the beasts and “on your belly shall you go,” because you brought birth pangs upon the race of women. And “dust you shall eat all days of your life,” because you deprived Adam and Eve from eating of the tree of life.
