“The ravens brought him bread in the morning and meat in the evening.” The bread represents perfection and justice accomplished together. This is the bread about which Isaiah says that it is given to those “who will live on the heights, and whose refuge will be the fortress of the rocks, and whose eyes will see the king in his beauty.” Indeed, bread, which is the principal nourishment of human beings, indicates quite appropriately their main good. With regard to meat, the fact that it was brought in the evening shows two things: the first is the mourning of penitence, as the psalmist says: “Weeping may linger for the night,” and the mortification of flesh and the hard toils, which the penitents marching toward perfection suffer. But their grief will become joy in the morning when the sun of justice, which dispels the darkness of sin, rises.And these words have an even higher meaning, because they are also referred to God the Word, who clothed himself with the flesh of our humanity and came to us in the evening, that is, at the consummation of times, and “filled with good things the hungry” through the Holy Spirit, which “God poured out on them richly through the Messiah, our Savior.”
