As they came down from the mountain, he commanded them, “You must not speak openly of what you have seen to anyone.” Why did he command this? He said this because he knew that others would not believe them but would take them for fools. They would say, “Do you know where Elijah came from?” and “See, Moses is buried, and no one has succeeded in finding his grave.” There would be blasphemy and scandal because of this. He said, “Wait until you have received the power,” because when you will speak and they will not believe, you will raise the dead for their confusion and your own glory.
