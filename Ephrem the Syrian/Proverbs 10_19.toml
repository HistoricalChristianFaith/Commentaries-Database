quote='''
Stir up your soul, so that, by his wisdom, you may know what is fitting, and that, by his will, what is in the commandment may come to pass. One who is pleasing to the wicked is more evil than they. Impure words are only verbiage and empty noise. “Abundance of words will not go blameless.” Abundance of words is the sign of no discipline.
