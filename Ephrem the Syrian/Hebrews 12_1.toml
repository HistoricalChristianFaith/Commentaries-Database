“Therefore, since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses” about the weight of our life, that is, about the fact that we have ahead of us a cloud of sad afflictions, which lead many who trust in Christ and die for him to honor, “let us lay aside everything” from us.… And “let us run with perseverance the race that is set for us” not only by our persecutors but by the devil himself.
