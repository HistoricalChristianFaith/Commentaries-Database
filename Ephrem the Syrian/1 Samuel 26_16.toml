Envy persecuted David, and jealousy the Son of David. David was blocked up in the depths of the cave, and the Son of David in the depths of the underworld. It was imagined that David was guilty and despised, and that death was conquered and laid low. David cried out, “Where is your spear, O King?” and the Son of David, “Where is your victory, O Death?” Saul hurled his spear against David, and, although it did not strike him, the wall was witness to its blow. The crucifiers struck the Son of David with a lance, and although his power was not injured, his body was a witness to their blow. David was not struck, nor was the Son of David injured.
