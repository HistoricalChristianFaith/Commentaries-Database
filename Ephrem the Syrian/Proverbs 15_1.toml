[[commentary]]
quote='''
Our Lord gave most of his assistance with persuasion rather than with admonition. Gentle showers soften the earth and thoroughly penetrate it, but a beating rain hardens and compresses the surface of the earth so that it will not be absorbed. “A harsh statement evokes anger,” and with it comes injury. Whenever a harsh word opens a door, anger enters in, and on the heels of anger, injury.
