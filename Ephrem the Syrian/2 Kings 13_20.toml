His disciples, the sons of the prophets, buried him. It seems that Joash accompanied him to his grave, because he had stayed beside him at the time of his illness and had showed a deep love for him, weeping before him and composing lamentations for his death. It also seems that the prophet Hosea took his place and ruled the sons of the prophets, because Hosea says at the beginning of his oracles that he prophesied at the time of Jeroboam, son of Joash.
