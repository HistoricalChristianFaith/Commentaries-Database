“But now once by coming at the end of times” he has suffered, so that through his sacrifice he might destroy sin, which killed the people and all nations together.In fact “as it is appointed for men to die once” because of their first sin, and “after” death their “judgment” comes, “so Christ too,” by coming, was revealed once and “offered” himself for the sins of everybody. Then “he will appear a second time,” not in order to die for the sins, for which he has already died once, but in order to appear in a new world, where there will be no sins on the part of those who in hope expect salvation through him.
