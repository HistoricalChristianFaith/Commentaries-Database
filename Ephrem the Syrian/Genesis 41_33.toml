When Joseph said, “Let Pharaoh select a man,” he spoke about himself. Joseph, out of modesty, did not say it openly in his own name, but he would not give it to another, for he knew that no one else would be able to make suitable provision for the great scourge that was coming upon them. Joseph became great in the eyes of Pharaoh through his interpretation of Pharaoh’s dreams but even more through the beneficial counsel that his mind had devised.
