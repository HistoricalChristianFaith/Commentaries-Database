“For it fell on the edge of the path.” This is an image of the ungrateful soul, like the one who received one talent despised the goodness of him who gave it. Because this ground was tardy in receiving its seed, it became a public highway for all evil. Consequently there was no place in its ground for the Teacher to penetrate into it like a laborer, break up its hardness and sow his seed there. The Lord described the evil one in the imagery of a bird who snatches it away. He made known that the evil one does not forcefully snatch away from the heart the teaching entrusted to it. In the parable’s imagery, he revealed the voice of the gospel standing at the door of the ears like the grain of wheat on the surface of the ground that has not hidden in its womb the seed which fell upon it. The birds were not permitted to penetrate the earth in search of the seed that the earth hid under its wings.

“That which fell on the rock …”  The good Lord revealed his mercy. Although the hardness of the ground was not cultivated, he did not withhold its seed from it. This ground represents those who turn away from his teaching like those who said, “This word is hard; who can listen to it?” It is like Judas, who heard his word and flourished through his signs but was without fruit in the moment of testing.
