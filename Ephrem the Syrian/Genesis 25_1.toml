Because no law concerning virginity or chastity had been set down, lest desire ever make a stain in the mind of that just man.â€¦ Abraham took for himself a concubine after the death of Sarah, so that through the uprightness of his many sons who were to be scattered throughout the entire earth, knowledge and worship of the one God would be spread.
