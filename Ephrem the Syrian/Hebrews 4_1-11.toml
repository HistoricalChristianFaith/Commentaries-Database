We also had the promise to enter into the kingdom through our faith and spiritual way of life, as well as those who accepted the command through the law so that … they might possess the land granted to them. “But the message” of the law “which they heard did not benefit them because it did not meet with faith” in the hearers. “We who have believed” in Christ and his gifts “enter” faithfully “that rest.” They, on the other hand, did not enter into that rest in consequence of the vow made through David, who said, “I swore in my anger that they should not enter my rest.”

In fact, if Joshua, the son of Nun, who allowed them to inherit the land, had settled them and given them rest, they still would not speak at all about the “other day of rest.” Indeed, Joshua made them rest, because he gave them the land as an inheritance, but they did not rest in it perfectly, as God perfectly rested from God’s works, for they lived in toils and wars. If that rest was not a true rest, since Joshua himself, the giver of their rest, was urged by the wars, if this is their condition, I say, there still remains the sabbath of God, who gives rest to those who enter there, as God rested from God’s works, that is, from all the works which God made.
