[[commentary]]
quote='''
Even when the army
surrounded Elisha
a voice proved the key
to the eyes of the shepherd.
When the disciplesâ€™ eyes
were held closed,
bread too was the key
whereby their eyes were opened
to recognize the omniscient:
saddened eyes beheld
a vision of joy
and were instantly filled with happiness.
