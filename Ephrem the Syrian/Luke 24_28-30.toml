[[commentary]]
quote='''
Even when the army
surrounded Elisha
a voice proved the key
to the eyes of the shepherd.
When the disciples’ eyes
were held closed,
bread too was the key
whereby their eyes were opened
to recognize the omniscient:
saddened eyes beheld
a vision of joy
and were instantly filled with happiness.
