“The blood of the eternal covenant,” not through that which passes away but through the one which remains forever, that is, Jesus Christ our Lord. “He will equip you with everything good,” and away from the covenant of the law, which you have now, “that you may do his will” in everything and not in accordance with the weak observations of the law. “I appeal to you, brethren, bear with my words of exhortation”—I wrote and proved that all those traditional customs on which you pride yourselves are only traces of this new gospel which was preached to you through Christ. “I have written to you briefly,” in accordance with your strength; if you are just adequate to your task, I will write to you more, but if you have reached perfection, you do not need any of these words.
