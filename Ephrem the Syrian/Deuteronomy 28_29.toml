quote='''
At times when we were in error, mired in the pride of our mind as if with our feet in the mud, we did not perceive our error because our soul was unable to see itself. Although we would look [into the mirror] each day, we would “grope around” in the dark “like blind men.” Our inner mind did not possess that which is necessary for discernment.
