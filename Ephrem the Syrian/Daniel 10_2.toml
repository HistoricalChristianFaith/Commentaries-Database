He says that the mourning had been protracted “for three weeks,” because he had fasted for all that space of time. He calls fasting “mourning” in the same sense used by our Lord, when he defended himself and his disciples from the detractions of the Pharisees. When the disciples were reproached by the Pharisees because they were not fasting, the Lord answered, “The wedding guests cannot mourn,” that is, fast, “as long as the bridegroom is with them, can they”?
