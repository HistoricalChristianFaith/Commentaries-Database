“Thus, I am against the prophets who steal my words, says the Lord.” The prophet includes this with reference to the false prophets who were stealing true prophecies from true prophets and then passing them on in secret to someone whom they forbade to speak about this. What they had in mind was the following: If the prophecy was fulfilled, they would say, “See, we have a witness that we were prophesying the same thing.” But if the prophecy was not fulfilled, they would blame Jeremiah and other true prophets, as if they deceived people.However, there is another kind of false prophet who would say anything to please listeners. They would reassure people, “No calamity will come on you,” and according to the custom of false prophets, they would support this claim in the name of the Lord. They are like those against whom Jeremiah spoke previously, those who mix their false dreams with pronouncements of the Spirit and deceive the people.
