He sent them two by two, in his likeness. He sent them preaching without a salary, as he had done.…“Behold, I am sending you forth like lambs among the wolves,” to show that as long as the Shepherd was with them they would not be harmed. To encourage them, he said, “He who receives you, receives me.” … He forbid them to take money for fear they would be considered businessmen and not announcers.

“Shake off the dust of your feet” shows that he will require vengeance on those who receive the disciples poorly. The disciples will throw back on these people that very dust which adhered to them from the path. They will return it back on them, so that these might learn that those who pass through their paths will return by them. Since these received the dust of the just, they will merit the vengeance of the just, unless they repent. Only their dust defiled them, not their mire. It will be easier for Sodom, because the angels who went there did not perform a sign in Sodom but made Sodom itself a sign for creation. …Move to another city away from whatever town that does not receive you. If they persecute you in that one, flee to another. The Lord did not extend this word to everyone, but only to his disciples because it was the beginning of the new preaching, and these people were few.
