“From the time this plague came to be” in all my people, “I have been there.” In order that the words he had spoken may not be despised by the sorcerers, the text shows that they do not belong to the prophet as such, but to the Lord and his Spirit, who sent the prophet to preach to them. Indeed, the prophet clearly said as if from the person of the Lord, “I am in all my people, and my right hand extends to the heavens.” - "Commentary on Isaiah 48.16"
