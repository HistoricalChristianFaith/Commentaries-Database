All these things, as I have said, were performed according to rules by infirm priests up to the time when God made a correction. From that time “Christ” came “as a high priest” not of sacrifices but of “good things.” And he entered “the tent”—not a small one “made with hands” but a huge and perfect one, which is not the product of human work—“that is, not of this creation,” because it was made out of nothing, unlike that tent which was erected with the spoils of the Egyptians.
