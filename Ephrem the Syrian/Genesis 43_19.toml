Then the [brothers] approached Joseph’s steward and said to him, “When we returned the first time we opened our sacks, and behold, there was each one’s money in the opening of his sack. We are now returning it to you because it is not right that we take the money for the grain together with the grain.” But when the steward saw how terrified they were, he consoled them and said, “Rest assured, do not be afraid. It is not because of the money, which I received, that we are bringing you into this house. We have eagerly awaited you because of the truth that is found among you. You are not going to be condemned for something that you did not take. You have been summoned to recline and be seated before our master, for he is just, and by the honor that he has reserved for you this second time, he wishes to make you forget the disgrace that you endured the first time.”
