After Ham had been cursed through his one son, [Noah] blessed Shem and Japheth and said, “May God increase Japheth and may he dwell in the tent of Shem, and let Canaan be their slave.” Japheth increased and became powerful in his inheritance in the north and in the west. And God dwelt in the tent of Abraham, the descendent of Shem, and Canaan became their slave when in the days of Joshua son of Nun, the Israelites destroyed the dwelling-places of [Canaan] and pressed their leaders into bondage.
