“Behold, I have created the blacksmith, who made the vases in his work,” that is, I elected the apostles and the disciples of the apostles, who perfectly instruct the peoples through the doctrine of truth. “I have also created the destroyer.” I did not prevent the liars and the persecutors from rising against the church at the time of the apostles.
