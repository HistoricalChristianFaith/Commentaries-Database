“By faith Noah was warned by God concerning events as yet unseen,” that is, about things which would have happened 120 years after he had received the warning, and [he] “took heed” of those distant threats of punishment [and] “constructed an ark” with great toil “for the saving of his household.” By that same faith the world which did not believe was condemned, and that same faith made Noah the heir of the promise.
