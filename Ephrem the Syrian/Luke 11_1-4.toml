“Give us our constant bread of the day.” Look, he has said, “Seek the kingdom of God, and these things over and above will be given to you as well.” He said “of the day” to teach us poverty in relation to the things of the world. It is sufficient for only our need, or else when we are anxious for a time, we might withdraw from intimacy with God. This bread of the day indicates necessity. He does not just give us only bread but also clothing and other things, as he said, “Your Father knows what your needs are before you ask him.”
