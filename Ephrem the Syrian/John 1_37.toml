Because the disciples of John heard him when he spoke about our Lord, they left their teacher and went after our Lord, because [John’s] voice was not able to keep the disciples with him [John], but it sent them to the Word. It was indeed right that when the light of the sun came into view, the light of the lamp should vanish. Truly for this reason John remained, that his baptism would be brought to an end by the baptism of our Lord. Soon he died, so that he might be foremost among the dead, just as he was a sign of Sheol in his mother’s womb.
