“From the first day,” that is, from that day when you began to fast, being inflamed by the desire to learn those things that you asked, so that you persevered in praying and supplicating before your God. “Your words have been heard, and I have come because of your words”: your prayers led me, as well, to prepare a plan for the salvation of your people according to your vows.
