“And he will come to Zion as Redeemer,” that is, Zerubbabel. Therefore the spiritual Zion and the hill of visions and revelations is the church. The Redeemer, who comes to it, is Christ, that great Zerubbabel. “This is my covenant with you,” which I made with your ancestors on the mountain, so that my words might never be lacking from the mouths of your descendants.
