The just one lives when endurance and faith are found in that one. But if somebody is oppressed by doubts and scruples, because the rewarder did not appear, “my soul has no pleasure in him” on that day.But we are not victims of scruples, which destroy our path to heaven and “bring us to perdition”; we have faith instead, through which we obtain “the salvation of our soul.”
