The Lord touched the leper in order to show that the law was not an obstacle to him who had constituted the law.… The leper was afraid to touch the Lord lest he defile him. But the Lord touched the leper to show him that he would not be defiled, he, at whose rebuke the defilement fled from the defiled one. … Samson ate honey from the dead body of an impure animal, and with the jawbone of a dead ass he was victorious and rescued Israel. God gave him water from the dead jawbone.
