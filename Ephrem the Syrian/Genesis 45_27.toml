When they told Jacob about the honor of Joseph, about the wisdom with which he administered his affairs and about how their last judgment was more bitter than the first, their father asked them and said, “Did you not ask Joseph how or why he went down to Egypt?” Then, when they all looked at each other and did not know what to say, Judah opened his mouth and said to his father, “We are recalling our crime today before our father.” Because of the dreams of Joseph, Joseph’s brothers thought, in their simplicity, that you and they would soon serve him as slaves. They also imagined, in their foolishness, that “it was better that he alone should be the servant than that we and our father should serve him as slaves.” They did this because they took pity on you and on Benjamin and not because you loved Joseph. “You also loved Benjamin, but because he did not say that we would become servants to him, all of us love him. Forgive us then for having humiliated Joseph, for it is on account of our humiliating him that he has come to this exalted state.” Their father then accepted their apology and said to them, “Because of the good news about Joseph by which you have brought me joy, this offense, which caused me great suffering when I heard it, is forgiven you.”
