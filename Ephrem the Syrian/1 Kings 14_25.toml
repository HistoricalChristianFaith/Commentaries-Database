Rehoboam spread and increased the idolatry introduced by Solomon after being instigated in this sin by his Gentile mother Naamah. And this seems to be hinted at in the Scripture which reports Rehoboamâ€™s apostasy just after mentioning his impious mother. Many examples that occur in this book, such as those of Maacah, Jezebel9 and Athaliah, amply demonstrate how the marriages made with foreign women had the power to corrupt the customs of the Israelites in this regard. Therefore, since God wanted to punish the offense caused by the violation of piety, he allowed Shishak, the king of Egypt, to enter Judea with a huge army, to conquer Jerusalem, to plunder the temple and the royal house and to destroy everything.
