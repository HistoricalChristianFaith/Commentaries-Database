“Therefore lift your drooping hands and strengthen your weak knees,” that is, “make straight paths for your feet” throughout the afflictions caused by your persecutors, so that they may not slip. [Do this] “so that what is lame,” that is, those who transgressed through the denial of faith, “may not be put out of joint” and increase the power of sin “but rather be healed,” so that, through his healing, sin may be affected by sickness.
