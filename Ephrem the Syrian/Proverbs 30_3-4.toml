Indeed, that Will
for whom everything is easy
constrains these abundant
fountains of paradise,
confining them with land,
like water channels;
he summoned them to issue forth
in our direction,
just as he bound up the waters
in the bosom of his clouds,
ready to be sent forth into the atmosphere
at the bidding of his Will.
