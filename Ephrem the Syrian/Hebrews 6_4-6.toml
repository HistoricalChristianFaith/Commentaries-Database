“It is impossible to restore again to repentance” through a second baptism “those who have once been baptized, who have tasted the heavenly gift” through the medicine which they received, “have become partakers of the Holy Spirit” through the gifts received from the Spirit, “have tasted the goodness of the Word of God” in the new gospel and were armed with the power of the age to come in the promises prepared for the pious ones, but now “have fallen away” again. Those who propose two baptisms ask for the crucifixion again of the Son of God and for his dishonor. But crucifixion was performed once and will not be performed once more, and baptism was conceded as an “absolver” and is not conceded a second time to the sinner.… After the apostle said these words and discouraged them from sinning and being in want of propitiation, he changed his tone and encouraged them, as if to say, “If there is no second baptism to purify you, your deeds and charity are to be an eternal baptism for you.” “Though,” he says, “we speak thus” and close the door of mercy before the just ones lest they may sin, nevertheless the door of mercy is open for penitents. “God is not so unjust as to overlook your work,” that is, your gift, “and the love” which you have for the saints and the poor who are in Jerusalem.
