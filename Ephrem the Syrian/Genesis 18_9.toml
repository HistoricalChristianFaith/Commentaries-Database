After they had eaten, “they inquired about Sarah.” She, who even in her old age had preserved her modesty, came out from inside the tent to the door of the tent. From Abraham’s haste and from the silence that Abraham imposed on everyone with his gestures, those of his household knew that these who, because of the man of God, allowed their feet to be washed like men were not men.

“Then [God] said of Sarah, ‘At this time I will return to you, and Sarah will have a son.’ ” But Sarah, even though Abraham was standing behind her to strengthen her, “laughed and said, ‘After I have grown old shall I [again] have youthfulness? My husband is also old.’ ” A sign would have been given her if she had asked to hear or to see and then believe: first, because she was a woman, old and barren; and second, because nothing like this had ever been done before. God then gave a sign specifically to her who had not asked for a sign, and said, “Why did you laugh, Sarah, and say, ‘Am I, who am old, to bear a child?’ ” But Sarah, instead of accepting the sign that was given to her, persisted, by this falsehood, in denying the true sign that had been given to her. Even though she had denied it because she was afraid, nevertheless in order to make her know that a false excuse did not convince him, God said to her, “But you did laugh in your heart; lo, even your heart is denying the foolishness of your tongue.”
