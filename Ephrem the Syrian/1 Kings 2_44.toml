You can see here four people who were condemned by Solomon because they were guilty of treason: they all foreshadowed the Jewish nation’s ruin, which would derive from Christ’s unjust killing. Adonijah, who was appointed as king and was killed shortly later, was the first to presage the fall of the Jewish kingdom; then, after the abrogation of the priesthood of Aaron, Abiathar was expelled from his office; and Joab, who had the dignity of captain of the army, was deprived of his life by the leaders of the people and all his military force was destroyed. Finally, Shimei expressed in an even more evident and definitive manner the sin and punishment of the Jews, especially of the inhabitants of Jerusalem who blasphemed Christ and demanded his crucifixion. And that last prayer of Christ, like a supreme commandment, was postponed for four more decades and was not inflicted until the Jews were caught in a new crime when they persecuted the apostles and the other disciples of Christ.
