“Behold, my servant shall be wise,” that is, shall be illustrious; these words certainly concern our Lord. Indeed, he was called a servant by his Father, because, in the first place, he was sent by his Father in order to fulfill his will in procuring salvation for all humankind, and in the second place, because he assumed the aspect of a servant. “He shall be exalted and lifted up, and he shall be very high” through his virtues and miracles.
