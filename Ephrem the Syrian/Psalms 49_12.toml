[[commentary]]
quote='''
David wept for Adam,
at how he fell
from that royal abode
to the abode of wild animals.
Because he went astray through a beast
he became like the beasts.
He ate, together with them
as a result of the curse,
grass and roots,
and he died, becoming their peer.
Blessed is he who set him apart
from the wild animals again.
