“Listen to me, my people, and give ear to me, my nation; for a law will go forth from me.” And how could it go forth now, if it were the same law that went forth in the days of Moses? But it is evident that here he mystically signifies the spiritual law, which is the New Testament. “And my justice is a light to the peoples,” that is, my sacrament. He also means that the conscience of the Gentiles, which is now clouded by idolatry, will be enlightened after all their gods are condemned by the divine sentence. - "Commentary on Isaiah 51.4"
