“Untie the donkey and bring it to me.”He began with a manger and finished with a donkey, in Bethlehem with a manger, in Jerusalem with a donkey. This is like, “Rejoice, daughter of Zion, for behold, your king is coming to you, just and lowly and seated on a donkey.”
But the daughter of Zion saw him and was troubled. She looked at him and became sad. He the merciful One, and the Son of the merciful One, had spread his benevolence over her like a father, but she conducted herself as perversely toward him as she had done toward the One who had sent him. Not being able to abuse the Father, she displayed her hatred against his Only Begotten. The daughter of Zion repaid him with evil for the immensity of his grace. The Father had washed her from her blood, but she defiled his Son with her spitting.
The Father had clothed her with fine linen and purple, but she clothed him with garments of mockery.
He had placed a crown of glory on her head, but she plaited a crown of thorns for him.
He had nourished her with choicest food and honey, but she gave him gall.
He had given her pure wine, but she offered him vinegar and soaked it with blood.
The One who had introduced her into cities, she drove out into the desert. The One who had put shoes on her feet, she made hasten barefoot toward Golgotha.
The One who had girded her loins with sapphire, she pierced in the side with a lance.
When she had outraged the servants of God and killed the prophets, she was led into captivity to Babylon, and when the time of her punishment was completed, her return from captivity took place.
