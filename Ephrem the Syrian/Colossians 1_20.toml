Thus, as peace began to be [established], the angels proclaimed, “Glory in the highest and peace on earth.” When lower beings received [peace] from superior beings, “they cried, Glory on earth and peace in the heavens.” At that time when the divinity came down [and] was clothed in humanity, the angels cried, “Peace on earth.” And at the time when that humanity ascended in order to be absorbed into the divinity and sit on the right—“Peace in heaven”—the infants were crying forth before him, “Hosanna in the highest.” Hence, the apostle also learned that one should say, “He made peace by the blood of his cross [for] that which is in heaven and on earth.”
