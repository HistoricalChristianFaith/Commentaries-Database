“It shall come to pass in later days that I will bring back the captives of Elam,” which refers to the time after seventy years of Jewish exile, when Cyrus, after destroying the Chaldean kingdom, would return all captured and enslaved people to their native lands. The divine Paul says, “Whatever was written of old was written for our instruction.” Thus, the Holy Spirit ordered Jeremiah and other prophets to record events of the captivity and of the return of magnificent and great nations in their own time, so that we would have a clear and vivid depiction of our slavery under the burden of Satan, as well as providing us with a picture of the divine household of our Lord who, through his death, bestowed on us life and redemption.Moreover, the Holy Spirit instructs us that a human being should not complain about the truth of God when wicked people experience great calamities. But we always must think about the severe judgment that happened to great nations and listen to the prophet who exhorts us, saying, “Serve the Lord with fear, and rejoice with trembling, so that he will not be angry and you will not perish from his way. For his wrath may soon be kindled.”
