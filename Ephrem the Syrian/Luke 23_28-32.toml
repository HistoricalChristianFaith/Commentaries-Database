The Lord said, “If they do that to the green wood.” He compared his divinity with the green wood and those who received his gifts to the dry wood. What is green bears fruit, as these words that he spoke testify: “For which of my works are you stoning me? If I suffer to this extent, although you have found no sin in me, which of you will convict me of sin?9 Since you have invented a pretext to dispose of me, how much more will you suffer?” Perhaps he was referring the green wood to himself, because of the miracles he had done. He called the righteous who were without virtue, the dry wood. They ate the fruit of this green wood, and they rejoiced beneath its foliage. Then they took it in hatred and destroyed it. What more will they do to the dry wood, which does not even have a sprout? What more will they do to the ordinary righteous people who do not work miracles?
