Just as Pharaoh was drowned in those very waters in which he had drowned the infants, so too David removed Goliath’s head with that very sword with which he had destroyed many. Moses divided the waters through the symbol of the cross, while David laid Goliath low through the symbol of the stone. Our Lord condemned Satan by the word of his mouth when the latter was tempting him. Pharaoh was drowned by the waters with which he had drowned [others].
