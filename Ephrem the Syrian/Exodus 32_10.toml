When he wished that [the fig tree] be uprooted, the event was similar to that earlier one, when the Father said to Moses, “Permit me to destroy the people.” He [thus] gave him a reason to intercede with him. Here too he showed the vinedresser that he wished to uproot it. The vinedresser made known his plea, and the merciful one showed his pity, that if, in a further year, [the fig tree] did not yield fruit, it would be uprooted. Commentary on Tatian’s Diatessaron
