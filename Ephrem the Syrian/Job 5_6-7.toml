“And the young birds will raise their feathers over him.” This text indicates that sin is the cause of the calamities humans suffer. In a different sense we may understand the text to speak of angels as “sons of the winged ones,” sent by God either for our correction and punishment when we transgress or for our protection and salvation after we have repented.
