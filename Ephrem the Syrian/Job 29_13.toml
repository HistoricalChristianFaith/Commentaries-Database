“The blessing of the one about to die will come upon me,” that is, the blessings of the poor, who, being without a coat, was about to die, will come upon me, as I provided him with a garment. In a different sense, you may suggest that the person about to die is he who is dead to the world and its wealth; when the world is dead together with the things that are in it, the one who said, “Whoever lost his soul for me will find it” will come to him. The blessing of this poor, Job says, will come upon me.
