Even though many others lived in Uz, no one was comparable to Job with regard to piety and innocence. He was of high reputation and was celebrated in everybody’s words. And so that no one might think these things had been granted to Job thanks to his human ability, God never allowed a single possession of Job’s to perish. [God] said, “My desire is that even a single hair, a loss that would be the very slightest, may be returned and increased for Job.”
