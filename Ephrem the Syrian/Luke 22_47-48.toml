The tribe of Judah marked the beginning of the kingdom, and the apostle Judas marked its extinction. In deceitfully handing him over to the Romans with a kiss, he handed over to them the responsibility of avenging Jesus so that they would one day exact it from Judah. The wicked one came to dig his deep abyss, and our God explained it gently to him. He showed that he was helpful, a fountain of mercy. He said, “Judas, would you betray the Son of man with a kiss?” He showed that Judas did not have the power to hand over the Son of God. “Well then, why have you come, my friend?” The Lord called animosity friendship, and he turned toward Judas. The deceitful disciple approached the true Master to kiss him. The Lord withdrew from him the Spirit that he had breathed into him. He removed it from him, not wanting the corrupting wolf to be among his sheep. He said, “That which he had has been taken away from him.”
