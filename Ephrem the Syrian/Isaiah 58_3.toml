“Fasting like yours this day will not make your voice heard on high. Is such the fast that I choose a day for a person to humble himself?” Do not fast as if with the aim to fulfill your evil intentions, as if you had made a certain vow in order to obtain one thing or another and so that misfortunes might befall your enemies. Through this kind of fasting and prayers, he says, you seek to delight your will and not mine, and, since you despise me, you say on high, “Why have we fasted, and you do not see it? Why have we humbled ourselves, and you do not notice?”
