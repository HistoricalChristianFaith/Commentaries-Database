The statement “We have found the Messiah” affirms that the report about him was circulating and came from the time of the Magi; it was renewed by John who had baptized him, and by the witness of the Spirit. Then he was again left alone in his fast of forty days. For that reason, the souls of the chosen ones were filled with a desire for a report concerning him. They were indeed his instruments, as he said, “You were chosen by me before the world.” He chose Galileans, a people without education, whom the prophets proclaimed as “dwellers in darkness,” for they had seen the light, so that he could bring reproach on those who were learned in the law. “For he chose the foolish of the world, so that through them he might put the wise to shame.”
