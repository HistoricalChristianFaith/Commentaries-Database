Mary said to him, “How can this be, since no man has known me?” He said to her, “The Holy Spirit will come, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you.” Why did he not mention the Father’s name but instead the name of his Power and the name of the Holy Spirit? Because it was fitting that the Architect of the works [of creation] should come and raise up the house that had fallen and that the hovering Spirit should sanctify the buildings that were unclean. Thus, if the Progenitor entrusted the judgment that is to come to his [Son], it is clear that he accomplished the creation of humanity and its restoration through him as well.
