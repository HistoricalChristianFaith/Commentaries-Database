Our Lord spoke humbly from above so that the leaders of his church would speak humbly. Now, if someone should ask, “How did our Lord speak humbly with Paul if Paul’s eyes were seriously injured?” they should realize that this impairment did not [result] from our compassionate Lord, who spoke humbly there. Rather, [it was the result] of the intense light that shone radiantly there. This light was not a punishment that befell Paul on account of the things he had done. It injured him with the intensity of its rays, as he himself said, “When I arose, I could see nothing because of the brilliance of the light.”
