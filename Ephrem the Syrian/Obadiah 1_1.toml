Obadiah of Sichem was born in the tribe of Ephraim and prophesied against the Edomites. He seems to be a contemporary of Hosea, Joel, Amos and Isaiah.

“We have heard a report from the Lord,” that is, the Lord of the world powers will do nothing if he has not first revealed his mystery to his servants, the prophets. “And a messenger has been sent among the nations.” A mystical meaning is probable here, and these words may be referred to Emmanuel, the angel of the testament, sent from heaven, who announced peace to the nations, and therefore was said to be the “expectation of the nations.”
