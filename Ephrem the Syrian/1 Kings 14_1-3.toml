“At that time Abijah son of Jeroboam fell sick,” and [the king], being worried for the health of his son, sent his wife to the prophet Ahijah because he was confident that through the prayers of that holy man he would obtain from God, whom he had repudiated, the healing of his son. And he did not want the queen to appear [before the prophet] without a present against the custom of the ancestors. Therefore “she took ten loaves of bread,” that is, ten soldiers’ biscuits, “a jar of honey and dry fruits”: the Greek text has staphylas, that is, grapes, instead of dry fruits. He did not want her to offer a regal present, lest she might appear in her real nature.
