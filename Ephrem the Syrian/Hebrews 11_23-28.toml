“By faith Moses, when he was grown up, refused to be called a son of Pharaoh’s daughter.” If he had not believed in the promise of Abraham, he would have not refused to be corrupted by sin, nor would he have chosen to share ill treatment with the people of God. He considered the emulation of Christ, about whom he indeed wrote, to be more important than the wealth of the Egyptians, which he would have received, because in his expectation “he was looking ahead to the reward.”
