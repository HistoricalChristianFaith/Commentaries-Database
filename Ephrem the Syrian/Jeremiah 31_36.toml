“If laws of day and night cease to speak before my face, says the Lord, then the descendants of Israel cease to be a nation forever.” It is impossible that the world order established from the beginning would change, that is, movement of stars, change of seasons. Therefore, without doubt, the promise given to David would not be left unfulfilled, and his kingdom and his seed would not cease before God’s face. Although this prophecy was fulfilled in its own time for Zerubbabel, who ruled over David’s kingdom, it was more completely fulfilled in our Lord, as even the angel said, “The Lord God will give him the throne of his father David. He will reign in the house of Jacob forever, and his kingdom will have no end.”
And the prophet repeats and confirms later on what is said here about the spread and eternity of Christ’s kingdom by saying, “Just as the heavenly stars could not be counted and the sands of the sea could not be measured, so I will increase the seed of David,” that is, the seed of his Word (Logos), son of David, priests and the Levites of the new covenant. According to their dignified status, the prophet depicts the gospel and the church of Christ in the image of the powers of heaven (stars) and their spread in the image of the sands of the sea, because thus it should be that the gospel and the church would become known to all the ends of the universe and that all nations would believe in them. - "Commentary on Jeremiah 31.36"
