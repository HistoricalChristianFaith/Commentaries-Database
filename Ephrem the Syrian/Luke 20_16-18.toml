He proposed another parable. “A certain man, a householder, planted his vineyard.” This is like what the psalmist said, “You brought a vine out of Egypt, you drove out the nations and planted it.” He protected it with a hedge, the law, and prepared a pit in it for the winepresses, the altar, and built a tower there, the temple, and sent his servants to bring him its fruit. The first, the next and the last were not received. Then he sent his Son. He was not the last, for although he appeared at the end, he already existed. John witnessed, “A man will come after me, who is before me.” He did not do this because he was unaware that the ancestors were incapable of receiving the produce but to remove the detractions of these stubborn ones from their midst. They were saying that he was not able to direct and prepare everything that he wanted to by the law, so therefore he sent his Son to impose silence on them. When they saw his Son coming, they said, “Here is the heir of the vineyard. Come! Let us kill him, and the inheritance of the vineyard will be ours.” They killed him, but their inheritance was taken away from them and given to the Gentiles. It happened just as he had said, “For to him who has will more be given, and he will have an abundance; but from him who has not, even what he has will be taken away.”

He led them to the point of judging themselves, saying, “What do the vinedressers deserve?” They made a pronouncement concerning themselves, saying, “Let him destroy the evil ones with evil.” He then explained this, saying, “Have you not read that the stone which the builders rejected has become the head of the corner?” What stone is this? It is the one known to be as hard as lead. See, he has said, “I am setting a plumb line in the midst of the sons of Israel.” To show that he himself was this stone, he said concerning it, “Whoever knocks against that stone will be broken to pieces, but it will crush and destroy whomsoever it falls upon.” The leaders of the people were gathered together against him and wanted his downfall because his teaching did not please them. He said, “It will crush and destroy whomsoever it falls upon,” because he got rid of idolatry along with other such things. “The stone that struck the image has become a great mountain, and the whole earth has been filled with it.”
