These words mean, “Even if he kills me, I will support myself with my hope and faith in him.” O admirable man, who, being destined to be killed, praises his killer and looks at him. Indeed Job knew that if he had taken away his life, the same one who is the Lord of Abraham, would have given it back to him. He believed that God was able to make alive those who had died. - "Commentary on Job 13.15"
