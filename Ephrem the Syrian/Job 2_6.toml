“Only spare his soul.” God does not say this as if he wanted to prevent the devil from snatching Job’s life away, but he says “spare him.” That is, be careful not to destroy the natural state of Job’s mind and reason. So God arranged things in order that the devil, being convinced by the evidence of the facts, might acknowledge that Job, even though he was pressed by so many afflictions, could never be brought to blasphemy.
