“I must speak so that I may find relief,” like a woman in labor, who, after bringing forth her offspring, is relieved from the pain of giving birth. And again, “my belly is in pain and does not open,” that is, I was in pain and could not find any respite, because I strongly desired to speak, but I abstained from it. Now I will break my voice and will make a revelation.
