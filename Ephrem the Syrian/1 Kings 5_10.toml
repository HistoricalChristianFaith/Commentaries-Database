Here we do not need to work around any concealed meaning; indeed, in this event there is a clear analogy with Christ and the actions he undertook for the building of the church. As Solomon ordered timbers to be cut from the mountains of Lebanon and stones to be shipped by sea, and employed them after they had been brought to the builder’s yard of the temple, so Christ, after receiving the Jews and the Gentiles from the timbers of infidelity, transported them to the builder’s yard of the temple which is not made by human hands.
