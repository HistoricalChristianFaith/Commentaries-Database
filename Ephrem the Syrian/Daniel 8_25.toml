[Gabriel] says this because [Antiochus] got into the city through fraudulence, polluted the precious vessels of the temple and committed pillages and demolished the walls. “Without warning he shall destroy many”: he killed forty thousand Jews and captured just as many. “And he shall even rise up against the Prince of princes”: either because Antiochus would have attacked God with curses and blasphemies or because he would have violated the temple of God and would have destroyed the holy vessels.
