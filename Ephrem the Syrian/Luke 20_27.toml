“The Sadducees came and were saying to him, ‘There is no resurrection of the dead.’ ” They are called Sadducees, that is “the just,” because they say, “We do not serve God for the sake of reward.” They do not await the resurrection, and for this reason they call themselves “the just,” since they say, “We should love God without a reward.”
