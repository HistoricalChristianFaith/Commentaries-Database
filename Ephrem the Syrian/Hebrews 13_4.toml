A further interpretation of “he knew her not until she had borne a son” is that this holiness was of necessity, even though they both willingly shared in it. But the holiness they observed after the birth of our Lord was of their own free will.The Evangelist defined the nature of this necessity and showed us concerning its limit, that it was “until.” … Should it be deduced from this therefore that he did not live with her chastely after she had given birth, since it is indicated “until”? But “until” is not the end limit. For he said, “The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at my right hand, until I put your enemies under your feet.” Therefore, when his enemies were put beneath his feet, did he stand up? Another interpretation of “he knew her not” follows. Is not marriage pure, according to the testimony of the apostle, “The fruit of their womb is pure”? But, if one were to say, “See, the brothers of our Lord are named in the Gospel,” I would reply, “Because our Lord entrusted his mother Mary to John, it is clear that these are not her sons, nor is Joseph her husband.” For how could he who said, “Honor your father and your mother,” have separated Mary from her sons and entrusted her to John instead?
