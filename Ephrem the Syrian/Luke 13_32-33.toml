It was prophetic that Moses had given [the Israelites] the order to offer their sacrifices in one single place—there to offer the lamb in sacrifice and [there] to accomplish an image of the redemption. Herod did not kill [the Lord] with the infants of Bethlehem, nor did the Nazarenes when they hurled him down from the mountain, since it was not possible for him to die outside of Jerusalem. For it cannot be that a prophet should perish outside of Jerusalem. Take note that although it was Jerusalem that killed him, nevertheless Herod and Nazareth were united with regard to his death, and vengeance will be required of both for his death. Learn also from this that not only will vengeance for his blood be required of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, but also everyone who saw and denied him will be convicted for having killed him. In saying “between the sanctuary and the altar,” he has indeed shown their perversity, in that they did not respect even the place of atonement. The words, “How often would I have gathered your children together,” are similar to these, “See, these three years I have come, seeking fruit on this fig tree, and I find none.”
