The sons of truth grow large on this Branch of
    Truth; they have been perfected and have become fruits fit for the kingdom.
But, although the Branch is living, on it are also dead fruits that only seem to blossom.
The wind tested them and shook down the
    wild grapes. Blessed is he who crowned by [the Spirit] those who held fast in him!…

Jesus, bend down to us your love that we may grasp
    this Branch that bent down her fruits for the ungrateful;
they ate and were satisfied, yet they demeaned
    her who had bent down as far as Adam in Sheol.
She ascended and lifted him up and with him returned to Eden.
Blessed is he who bent her down toward us that we might seize her and ascend on her.
Who indeed will not weep that although the
    Branch is great, the weakness of one unwill ing to seize her greatness maintains that
        she is a feeble branch—
she who has conquered all kings and cast a shadow upon the entire world! By suffering her power has increased.
Blessed is he who made her greater than that vine from Egypt!
Who will not hold fast to this Branch of Truth.
She bore the true ones; she shed the false.
Not because they were too heavy for her did she shed them.
For our sake she tested them in the breeze;
it shook down the shriveled; it ripened the firm.
