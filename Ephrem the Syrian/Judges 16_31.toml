Satan the tyrant outwitted Samson with a woman,
the same tyrant outwitted Adam with a woman:
Samson had to grind at the mill, Adam had to labor wearily on the soil;
Samson prayed to be released,
whereas we pray to grow old in our misery.
Blessed is he who delivered Samson, releasing him from the grinding.
Samson is a type of the death of Christ the high priest:
Samson’s death returns prisoners to their towns,
whereas the High Priest’s death has returned us to our heritage.
