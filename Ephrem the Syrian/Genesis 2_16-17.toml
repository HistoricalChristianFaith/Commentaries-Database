In the very midst he planted
the Tree of Knowledge,
endowing it with wonder,
hedging it in with dread,
so that it might straightway serve
as a boundary to the inner region of paradise.
Two things did Adam hear
in that single decree:
that they should not eat of it
and that, by shrinking from it,
they should perceive that it was not lawful
to penetrate further, beyond that tree.
