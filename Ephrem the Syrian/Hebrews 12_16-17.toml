Scripture thus shows that Esau did not sell his birthright because of hunger, since it says that after he ate, “Esau rose and went away and despised his birthright.” He did not sell it because of hunger, therefore, but because he indeed considered it to be worthless and sold it for nothing.

Even if the door is closed before him, it is not closed in the same manner before us. “Know that afterward, when he desired to inherit the blessing, he was rejected, for he found no chance to repent.” Moreover, Esau’s repentance and his tears did not mean that he wanted to be blessed more than his brother but that he wanted to gain control over his brother. “Even though he sought the blessing with tears,” it was not conceded to him. He did not demand blessing, as I said, but the right of the firstborn. In fact, if he had demanded to be superior to his brother in the kingdom of heaven, this would have not been denied to him. But, since he neglected what was useful to his soul and asked for an estate more fertile than that of his brother, he did not receive the blessing that he begged and was deprived of those things that Jacob, by prevailing on him, received through his faith.
