Simeon said likewise, “You will remove the sword.” Mary removed the sword that protected Paradise because of Eve. Alternatively, “you will remove the sword,” that is, a denial. For the Greek says clearly, the inner thoughts of a great number will be revealed, that is, the thoughts of those who had doubted. For he said, “You will remove the sword.” Indeed, you too will doubt, because she thought that he was the gardener. Mary wondered at his birth, it is said, and at his conception. She recounted to others how she had conceived, and indeed how she had given birth. Those who had doubted it were comforted by the wonderment of her word.
