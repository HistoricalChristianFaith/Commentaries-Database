The Scripture mentions a musical instrument that produces sounds, or a harp, as the Hebrew says, so that, thanks to the sound of its music, all the soldiers might be assembled around it and might understand when they were summoned to destroy their enemies, and there might be evident testimonies of [Elishaâ€™s] words. In this way, when the miracle occurred, they could not attribute it to Baal or the idols they worshiped. Indeed, there were numerous idolaters in the army.
