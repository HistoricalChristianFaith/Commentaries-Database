During the entire period that our Lord was in the midst of the world, he compared it with a bridal chamber and himself with the bridegroom. For the bridal guests cannot fast while the bridegroom is with them.… He called his disciples bridal guests because they are members of the church, and ministers of the feast, and heralds who invite those who sit at table. Commentary on Tatian’s Diatessarona–b.
