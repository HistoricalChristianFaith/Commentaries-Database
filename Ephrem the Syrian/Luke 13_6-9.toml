He told another parable, “A certain man had planted a fig tree in his vineyard and he said to the vinedresser.” This refers to the law, taking its point of view. “Behold, for three years I have come seeking fruit on this fig tree.” This refers to the three captivities in which the Israelites were taken away, so that they might be chastened, but they were not chastened.… The fig tree is a figure of the synagogue. He sought the fruits of faith in it, but it did not have that which it could offer.…During three years, he showed himself among them as Savior. When he wished that the fig tree be uprooted, the event was similar to that earlier one, when the Father said to Moses, “Permit me to destroy the people.” He gave Moses a reason to intercede with him. Here he also showed the vinedresser that he wished to uproot it. The vinedresser made known his plea, and the merciful One showed his pity, that if, in another year, the fig tree did not produce fruit, it would be uprooted. The vinedresser however did not condemn through vengeance like Moses, who, after having interceded and was heard, said, “For the day of their ruin is near and that which is about to happen to them is fast approaching.” … We are not saying that the Jews are tares, for they are capable of being chosen, but they are not pure wheat grains, for they can be rejected.
