God requires the blood now and in the future. He requires it now in the case of a death that he decreed for a murderer, and also a stoning with which a goring bull is to be stoned. At the end, at the time of the resurrection, God will require that animals return all they ate from the flesh of man. God said, “From the hand of a man and of his brother I will require the life of a man,” just as satisfaction for the blood of Abel was required from Cain, that is, “whoever sheds the blood of man, by man shall his blood be shed.” –.
