“Have all Israel assemble for me at Mount Carmel.” Now, it is amazing how the king obeyed Elijah, who asked him for a general gathering of the people; and how also the people obeyed him humbly, even though he bitterly reproached them for their evil actions. It is also amazing how his request was granted, when he asked to be allowed to fight against the prophets of Baal. It is certain that they could not find a way to avoid meeting him, and they even looked for him, if it is true what some of the doctors say. And we also know that in our days false and deceiving people do the same. Therefore they thought that the prophets of Baal would make an altar in which they would have someone, who, at their sign, would set the fire and destroy the wood and the bull that were on the altar. And since they were confident in this scheme, they came to the fight, confident of the expected victory and in order to provoke Elijah.
