“By faith Abel offered to God a more acceptable sacrifice than Cain,” who brought offerings selected without care. The faith of Abel and the infidelity of Cain were sealed up in their offerings. If Abel had not believed in the promise, he would not have chosen and brought the best offerings. He had actually seen his brother, who picked up everywhere the vile ears [vegetable offerings] with contempt and offered them by laying them on the altar. For that faith Abel “obtained testimony” about himself “that he was righteous” and certainly not from a human being but from God, “who testified of his gifts,” so that up to this time Abel talks through his faith, that is, is put to test through it.
