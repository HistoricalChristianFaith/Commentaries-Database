“Abraham was hoping to see my day.” He is the one about whom it was said, “The nations will be blessed by your seed.” “He indeed saw and rejoiced,” because he saw in the symbol of the lamb the salvation of all the nations. “You are not fifty years old, but Abraham saw you?” He said to them, “Before Abraham was, I am,” because he existed but he was concealed when Isaac was redeemed; his sign was seen in the lamb. When, moreover, there descended into Egypt the seed of the one who was saved by a lamb, and they were there for quite some time—this was shown beforehand in a type by Isaac—they were also delivered by a type, by a lamb. And from that time onwards they would sacrifice a lamb until the time that the true lamb came. When he drew near to John, he [John] announced him by saying, “See, the Lamb of God!” And when the true lamb had come, these others, which were types, ceased.
