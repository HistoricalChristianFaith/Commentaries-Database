“My reason returned to me,” that is, I was made again master of my own mind, and certainly returned to my senses. “I blessed the Most High, who does what he wills,” that is, who with his divinity and will rules and administrates not only the affairs of human beings, whom he fashioned from clay, but also those of the spiritual powers, whom he placed in heaven.
