But when Ahijah heard the sound of her feet as she came in at the door, he said, “Come in, wife of Jeroboam; why do you pretend to be another?” He heard her coming in, [the text] says, because he could not see anymore after his eyes had become dim from his old age. Yet through divine revelation he understood that she was Jeroboam’s wife, even though she wanted to hide this from the prophet, whom she knew to be justifiably enraged [with her husband]. Therefore the prophet, beginning his speech, harshly attacked Jeroboam and condemned with very severe words his violation of pacts and piety and his oblivion to all the benefits that he had received from the generous hand of God, so that [the prophet] finally predicted huge calamities, the destruction of the kingdom and the complete ruin of [Jeroboam’s] entire family.
