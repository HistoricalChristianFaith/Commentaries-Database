It is certain that when the Lord gave the bread to his disciples, he gave them the mystery of his body. One must also then believe that when he gave the bread to his murderer, he gave it to him as the mystery of his murdered body. He dipped it to reveal the total participation of Judas in his death, for his body was destined to be dipped in his blood. He may also have dipped it to give the testament with him. He moistened it and then gave it to him. He moistened it first because it had been prepared for the testament that was to follow.Judas’ greed judged and separated him from the perfect members of the Lord, as the Life-giver showed in his gentle teaching. Judas was not a member of the body of his church. He was only the dust that stuck to the feet of the disciples. On the night when the Lord judged and separated him from the others, he washed the mud from their feet to teach them. He taught them that he washed Judas from the feet of the disciples with water, like manure suitable for burning. Judas was considered as the feet of the body, since he was the last of the twelve apostles. Likewise, the Lord separated Judas from the apostles by means of the water when he dipped the bread in the water and gave it to him. Judas was not worthy of the bread which, together with the wine, was given to the Twelve. It would not have been permissible for the very one who was going to hand the Lord over to death to receive that which would save him from death.
