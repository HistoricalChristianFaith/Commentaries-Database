“By faith Abraham, when he was tested, offered up Isaac” as a victim, even though he had received this child with the promise that through him his descendants would have been named. And Abraham never doubted, not even when he was about to kill him, that through him his descendants would have been named.He decided in his mind and accepted the idea that “God is able to raise men even from the dead; hence, figuratively speaking, he did receive him back,” that is, so that in him he might come to know the resurrection of the dead, and in him might know the children of the spirit whom he would have had.
