[Satan] set [Jesus] up on the pinnacle of the temple. Satan wanted him to suppose that he who was a man could become God, by means of the godly house, just as Satan had once made Adam suppose that he could become God by means of that tree. He brought him up to the mountain, as though he were in need. “To you will I give the kingdoms, if you will adore me.” When he changed his mode of cunning, he did not change the true One with it. In the beginning God made him, and, when complete, he was in need and a worshiper. But Satan became blind in the arrogance of his worship, because of all that he had acquired, and for this reason he was punished even more. Because Satan did not recognize the One who knew him intimately, our Lord addressed him by his name, Satan. But he did not know how he should address our Lord.Therefore he said to him, “Fall down from here, for it is written, ‘They will guard you lest you stumble.’ ” Tempter, if it is concerning him that the psalm is fulfilled, is it not also written there, “With his wings, that he may deliver you”? It is not possible for a bird to fall, for the air beneath its wings is like the earth. Is it not also written, “You will tread on the serpent and the lion”?30 Satan studied only those passages from Scriptures that were convenient to him and omitted those which were harmful to him. The heretics are like this too. They appropriate from Scripture those passages that suit their erroneous teaching and omit those that refute their errors, thereby demonstrating that they are disciples of this master.
