These words concern the kingdom of the Persians. Indeed, what in the statue of Nebuchadnezzar had been indicated under the aspect of bronze, a very hard metal, here is seen under the image of the leopard, an extremely agile and harmful beast. [The beast] is also provided with four wings and four heads. This is because it brought its dominion to the four winds of heaven. “And dominion was given to it”: this is a reference to the multitude of peoples to be submitted. This passage must be compared with the prophecy of Isaiah: “He will strip kings of their robes, etc” In that same prophet we can read these words said about Cyrus to Cyrus by God.
