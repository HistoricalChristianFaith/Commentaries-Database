In the meantime, while the friends investigated Job’s case and made preparations for their journey, there is no doubt that many days passed. They were all lords and men of princely rank. Job’s three friends signified the class of the high priests, the priests and the prophets, who flourished among the Jews. And Job’s seven sons represented the priests of the church, the apostles, the prophets, and those people endowed with the gift of miracles and healing, the assistants of the moderators, the presbyters and the deacons. - "Commentary on Job 2:11"
