“A stone was placed at the entrance to the tomb.” Thus, one stone [was placed] against another stone, so that [this] stone might be keeping guard over “the stone that the builders rejected.” This [stone], lifted “up by” [human] hands, had to keep guard over that which was “detached, without [human] hands”; this [stone], on which “the angel was sitting,” [had to keep guard] over that which “Jacob had placed under his head”;25 this [stone] with its seal [had to keep guard] over that which, through its seal, watches over the faithful. Thus did the gate of life go forth from the gate of death. “For this is the gate of our Lord, through which the just enter.” When it was closed, it delivered those closed in. Through its death the dead lived. Through its voice the silent cried out. Through its resurrection, there was an earthquake. Its emergence forth from the tomb introduced the Gentiles into the church.
