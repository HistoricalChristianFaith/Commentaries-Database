Moses and Elijah appeared beside him so that they might know that he was Lord of the prophets. He transformed his face on the mountain before he died, so that they would not be in doubt concerning the transformation of his face after his death. He changed the garments which he was wearing so that they might know that it is also he who will raise to life the body with which he was clothed. He, who gave his body a glory that no one can reach, is able to raise it to life from the death that everyone tastes.
