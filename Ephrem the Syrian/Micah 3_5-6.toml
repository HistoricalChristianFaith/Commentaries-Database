“The sun will go down” upon those prophets who lead my people astray, dwelling in darkness. “It will be night for you, without vision, and it will be dark for you, without dawn.” “For, when [the spirit] goes out of a man, it goes about wandering.” It does this quite by nature. [The Lord] rendered this judgment with regard to [the people]: “Thus will it be for this generation.” That is, in the days of the prophets the evil spirit had gone out from them, [that spirit] that was sin itself.
