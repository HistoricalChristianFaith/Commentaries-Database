While he was teaching the crowds and evangelizing them, the chief priests and the scribes came and said to him, “By what power are you doing this?” If it were a question of his teaching, how could they have called it a work? It is clear that he referred to his works as testimony to the truth of his words, according to what he said: “If you do not believe in me, believe at least in the works.” “By what power are you doing this?” They interrogated him like inquisitors, but he did not reply to them, since they did not approach him as students out of love in order to be taught but as rebels. He asked them in turn, “From where did the baptism of John come?” His word pressured them in such a way that they were forced to confess that they had not believed in John. He asked, “Was it from heaven or from human beings?” They began to reflect on it in their minds and to say, “If we say that it was from heaven, he will say, ‘Why did you not believe in it?’ If we say, ‘From human beings,’ we are afraid of the crowd.” When they said, “If it is from heaven,” they did not also say, “We are afraid of God.” They were thus afraid of human beings but not of God.
