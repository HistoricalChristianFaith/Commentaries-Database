“And you, O tower, O cloudy shepherd of the daughter of Zion, your time shall come.” These words refer to the impious king Zedekiah, whom the prophet calls “tower” because the people of Judea stayed under his shadow, and “shepherd” because of his administration of the kingdom, and “cloudy” because of the error of idolatry to which he adhered. Again, in the symbolic meaning of his words he calls the devil a cloudy shepherd, because in an allegorical sense he always attacks the daughter of Zion under a cloudy sky. And, after catching her, he drags her away from the light—indeed the one who acts maliciously hates the light. But later, the supreme and legitimate prince of the mystical Jerusalem destroyed this tyranny with his advent and drove the obscure shepherd away.
