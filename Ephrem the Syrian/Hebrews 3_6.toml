But since he said, “as Moses,” do not think that he is as Moses; “the glory of this” high priest “is greater than that of Moses inasmuch as the maker of a house has greater honor than the house.” Similarly the honor of the Lord and the Son is greater than that of the servant Moses. “Every house was built by someone,” but “he who created Moses” and “built all things is God. And Moses was certainly faithful,” but as an assistant, “as a servant was faithful to testify to the things that were to be spoken later.” In truth Christ is not a faithful servant like Moses, but “as a son” he was faithful, and not over the shrine of the temple but over the souls of people. In fact, “we are his house if we stand firm in his confidence” and are not brought into disorder while “in the glory of his hope.” But if we transgress, we cause his suffering.
