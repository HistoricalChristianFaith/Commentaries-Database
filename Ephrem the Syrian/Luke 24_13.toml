quote='''
At his radiant birth therefore a radiant star appeared, and at his dark death there appeared a dark gloom. â€¦ The Lord of the star appeared in his own person to the two who were traveling with him along the road, but his identity was hidden from them. His star too was like this, for its light appeared to all humanity while its pathway was hidden from all humanity.
