After Gehazi had come back from his meeting with Naaman, he entered Elisha’s house, and [the prophet] asked him, according to custom, why he had moved away from him. “Where do you come from?” he said to Gehazi. He said this on purpose, so that the justice of the judgment passed on his sin might be evident. If Gehazi repented and swore, he would have been forgiven; but if he denied that he had secretly received money, the leprosy of Naaman would cover him conspicuously. - "On the Second Book of Kings 5.27"
