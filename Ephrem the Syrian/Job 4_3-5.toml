“See, you have reproached many.” Eliphaz shows Job that he has corrected many with his action and has brought them back to a fitting moderation with his advice and warnings. “And you have strengthened the weak hands,” that is, since you exhorted others to endure with a strong soul the calamities that befell them, now it is fair that you exercise patience in your own afflictions.
