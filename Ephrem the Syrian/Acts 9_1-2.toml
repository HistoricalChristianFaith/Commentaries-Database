This is why the humble voice accompanied the intense light, so that from the combination of the humble and the sublime, our Lord might produce help for the persecutor, just as all his assistance is produced from a combination of the small and great. For the humility of our Lord prevailed from the womb to the tomb.… His nature is not simply humble, nor is it simply sublime; rather they are two natures, lofty and humble, one mixed in the other.
