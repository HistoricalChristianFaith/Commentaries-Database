An abundance is oil with which sinners do business: the forgiveness of sins.
By oil the Anointed forgave the sins of the sinner who anointed [his] feet.24
With [oil] Mary poured out her sin upon the head of the Lord of her sins.
It wafted its scent; it tested the reclining as in a furnace:
It exposed the theft clothed in the care of the poor.
It became the bridge to the remembrance of Mary to pass on her glory from generation to generation.
In its flowings is hidden joy, for oil does indeed gladden the face.
It brings its shoulder to all burdens in rejoicing and grieving with everyone:
For it serves joy yet is obeyed by gloom,
For faces joyful of life by it are resplendent,
And with it, the gloomy face of death is prepared for burial and dies.
