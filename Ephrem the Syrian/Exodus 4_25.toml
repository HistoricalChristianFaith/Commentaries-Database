At the place where they were spending the night, the Lord came upon Moses and wanted to kill him, because he had discontinued circumcision in Midian for one of his sons who had not been circumcised. From the day [the Lord] spoke with him on Horeb, he had not been united to his wife, who was distressed; and she was under judgment because she had not put full faith in his word. [Moses] blamed her for keeping his son from being circumcised. They spent the night [preoccupied] with these thoughts. Suddenly an angel appeared for both of these reasons, while seeming to appear only because of circumcision.[The angel] appeared to Moses in anger so that his departure [from Midian] would not be ridiculed because he had discontinued circumcision without necessity, while the Hebrews had not interrupted it in spite of the death of their children. Now whom should he have feared, God, who prescribed circumcision, or his wife, who had stood in the way of circumcision?
When Moses’ wife saw that he was about to die because she had stood in the way of circumcision, about which and on account of which he had argued with her that evening, “she took a piece of flint” and, still trembling from the vision of the angel, “circumcised her son,” letting him be spattered with his [own] blood. Then she held the angel’s feet and said, “I have a husband of blood. Do not cause suffering on the day of the celebration of circumcision.” Because there was great joy on the day Abraham circumcised Isaac, she said, “I too have a husband of blood. If you do not [refrain from harm] on account of me, who circumcised my son with my own hands, or on account of Moses, refrain on account of the commandment of circumcision itself which has been observed.”
