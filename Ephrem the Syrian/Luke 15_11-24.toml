[[commentary]]
quote='''
Jacob led out his sheep
And brought them to his father’s home;
A symbol for those with discernment,
A parable for those with perception
Is to be found in this homecoming:
Let us too return to our Father’s house,
My brothers, and do not become
captivated with desire
For this transient earth
—for your true city is in Eden.
Blessed indeed is that person
Who has seen his dear ones in its midst.
