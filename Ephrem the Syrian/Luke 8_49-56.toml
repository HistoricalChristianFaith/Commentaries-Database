When the woman was healed, our Lord said, “Who touched me?” so that she could profess her healing before everyone. Also in the case of the little girl, he said, “She is sleeping” so that the spectators might testify that she was dead, and then seeing her restored to life, these who scorned would be converted into believers. The witness given by them concerning the death of the little girl and her restoration to life performed by the Lord was a witness in anticipation of his death. Those who would see that he was alive again would not deny it.
