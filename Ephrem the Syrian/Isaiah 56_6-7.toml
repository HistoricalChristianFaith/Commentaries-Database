“And the sons of the foreigners who join themselves to the Lord, … these I will bring to my holy mountain and make them joyful in my house of prayer.” These words refer to the church of the Gentiles, as the Lord himself explained to the Jews, and it is written in the Gospel, “My house shall be called the house of prayer for all nations.”
