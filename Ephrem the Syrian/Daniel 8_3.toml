He signifies Darius the Persian by saying “it had two horns,” as Darius ruled the Medes and the Persians. “Both horns were long, but one was longer than the other”: this is referred to the Persians, whose power was superior to that of the Medes and rose to a higher level. “And the longer one came up second”: this is said because the Persians, after the Medes, would have obtained the rule over the world.
