Why didn’t Satan tempt him before his thirtieth year? He tempted Jesus because a definite sign of Christ’s divinity had not yet been given from heaven. He appeared modest like others, and he had not received any obvious homage in the presence of his people. Satan refrained from tempting him until the beginning of this event. When he heard, “Now, behold the Lamb of God is coming,” and “This is he who takes away the sins of the world,” Satan was astonished. Yet he waited until Jesus was baptized to see if he would be baptized as if he needed to be baptized.Then he saw the splendor of the light that appeared on the water, the voice that came from heaven. Then Satan knew that he who fulfills every need had gone down into the water and that he had not come to baptism as if he needed to be baptized. Satan reflected and said to himself, “As long as I have not tested him by combat through temptation I will not be able to identify him.” But it was not fitting that the Benefactor should resist the will of him who had come to tempt him. For, not knowing how to tempt him, Satan did not dare approach him.
