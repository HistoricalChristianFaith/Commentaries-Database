That Cain remained alive until the seventh generation is clear. First, â€¦ it had been so decreed concerning him. Second, the length of the lives of those first generations also testifies to it. For if his father Adam remained alive until the ninth generation, that of Lamech, and was gathered from the world in the fiftysixth year of Lamech, it is no great thing that Cain should remain until the seventh generation. .
