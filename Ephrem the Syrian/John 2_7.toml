Let Cana thank you for gladdening her banquet!
The bridegroom’s crown exalted you for exalting it,
And the bride’s crown belonged to your victory.
In her mirror allegories are expounded and traced,
For you portrayed your church in the bride,
And in her guests, yours are traced,
And in her magnificence she portrays your advent.
Let the feast thank him, for in multiplying his wine
Six miracles were beheld there:
The six wine jugs set aside for water
Into which they invited the King to pour his wine.
