With the eye of my mind
I gazed upon paradise.
The summit of every mountain
is lower than its summit,
the crest of the flood
reached only its foothills,
these it kissed with reverence
before turning back
to rise above and subdue the peak
of every hill and mountain.
The foothills of paradise it kisses,
while every summit it buffets.
