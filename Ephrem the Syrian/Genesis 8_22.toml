And because there was neither planting nor harvest during that year and the seasonal cycles had been disturbed, God restored to the earth that which had been taken away in his anger. God then said, “All the days of the earth, planting and harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter, day and night shall not cease from the earth.” For throughout the entire year, until the earth dried up, winter, with no summer, had been upon them.
