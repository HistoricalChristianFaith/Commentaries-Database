“Rejoice, O heavens, from above,” that is, rejoice over the salvation of the nations. The angels are delighted at the repentance of a single sinner. “And the clouds will rain down righteousness.” The clouds, which rain down righteousness, are the apostles and the priests who justify through the absolution, which they give by means of baptism. “Let the earth open, that salvation may be multiplied.” Justice, symbolized through the earth, is poured on the mind of the nations, and salvation shall multiply in every region. “And let it cause righteousness to spring up also.” In the salvation of the nations also their justice is multiplied, and salvation and justice spring up and grow at the same time.
