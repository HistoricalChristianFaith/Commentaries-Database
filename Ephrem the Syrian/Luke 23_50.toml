quote='''
Mary stands for Eve, and Joseph stands for another Joseph. He who asked for his corpse was also named Joseph. The earlier Joseph was a righteous man who did not denounce Mary publicly. The other one was also a righteous man because he did not consent to the detractors. So that it might be clear that the Lord was entrusted at the beginning to one having this name when he was born, he further allowed one with this name to prepare him for burial when he was dead. This name receives the full reward for serving him at his birth in the cave and for having served his corpse at the tomb.
