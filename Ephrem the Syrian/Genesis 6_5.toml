After Moses spoke about the mighty men who were born into the tribe of Cain, whose women, even though beautiful, were nevertheless smaller than the sons of Seth, he then said, “The Lord saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth and that every inclination of the thoughts of his heart was always evil,” for in the years given to them for repentance2 they had increased their sins. “The wickedness of mankind was great in the earth,” that is, evil extended and spread throughout both those tribes. “The inclination of the thoughts of their hearts was always evil,” for their sins were not committed only occasionally, but their sins were incessant. Night and day they would not desist from their wicked thoughts.
