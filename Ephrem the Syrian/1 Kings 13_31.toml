While this old man insists in saying to his sons that he wants them to bury him, their father, in the grave of the prophet Shemaiah and hopes that his bones will find peace, he represents the allegorical type of an ancient Adam who exhorts and even urges his sons to lower him into baptism, which is the grave of the Emmanuel. Through him all those who have been buried with him through baptism certainly hope for peace and life. On the other hand, when this same old man lies and deceives the other prophet, he represents the Jewish people, about whom we read in the psalm: “But they flattered him with their mouths; they lied to him with their tongues.” - "On the First Book of Kings 13.20"
