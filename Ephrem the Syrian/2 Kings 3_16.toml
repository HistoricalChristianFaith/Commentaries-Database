“The harpist played, and the water flowed to the bed of the streams.” Through this figure the voice of Christ is conveniently foreshadowed, because he kept the harp of the spirit on the cross. Indeed, our Lord cried twice and gave up his spirit with a loud voice. And immediately the pagan centurion gave glory to the Lord, and in this manner the conversion of the Gentiles was clearly highlighted. After the Christ had brought to perfection on the wood of the cross the new glory of our Savior, the sources were immediately opened and rivers of living water flowed on the nations of the Gentiles, who are symbolized by the “wadi,” as Jesus had said before his passion: “Let the one who believes in me drink. As the Scripture has said, ‘Out of the believer’s heart shall flow rivers of living water.’ ” In this way the word of the prophet might be fulfilled: He who has played the harp will play for the Gentiles in the name of the Lord.
