Jacob saw that the right of the firstborn was despised by Esau, and he contrived to take it from him, trusting in God who had said, “The elder shall serve the younger.” Jacob boiled some lentils, and “Esau came home famished after hunting and said to Jacob, ‘Let me eat some of that red pottage,’ ” that is, “Let me eat some of your lentils.” “Jacob said to him, ‘Give me your birthright and you may take all of them.’ After Esau swore to him and sold him his birthright, Jacob then gave Esau [the lentils].” To show that it was not by reason of his hunger that Esau sold his birthright, Scripture says, “After he had eaten he arose and went away, and Esau despised his birthright.” Therefore Esau did not sell it because he was hungry, but rather, since it had no value to him, he sold it for nothing as if it were nothing.
