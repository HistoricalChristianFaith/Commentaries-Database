So he gave them supplies and sent them off with blessings and said, “Just as I was bereaved of Rachel, so am I now bereaved of Rachel’s children.” Judah comforted his father and said, “If I do not bring back Benjamin and set him before you, then let me bear the blame forever.” Then they took some of the choice fruits of the land: gum, pistachio nuts, which are berries, and so forth. They then went down and stood before Joseph. Joseph commanded his steward to give them lodging in his house.
