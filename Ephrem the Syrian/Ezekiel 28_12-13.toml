Blessed is the poor person
who gazes on that place;
riches are poured in profusion
outside and around it;
chalcedony and other gems
lie there cast out
to prevent their defiling
the glorious earth of paradise;
should someone place there
precious stones or beryls,
these would appear ugly and dull
compared with that dazzling land.
