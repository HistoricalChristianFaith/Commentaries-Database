“Two plagues shall come to you in one day,” because you were deceived by the art of the Chaldeans and ignored your doom. “The loss of children and widowhood shall come on you,” that is, sterility. The loss of children indicates the destruction of the city; the widowhood, the privation of the kingdom.
