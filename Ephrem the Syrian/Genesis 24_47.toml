The servant swore the oath to his master and went off with many choice gifts. He sat beside a well, prayed and asked for a sign. Even though he rejoiced in the sign that came to him, he still waited to see whether she was from [Abrahamâ€™s] tribe. When he learned that she was the daughter of Bethuel, the son of Nahor, he praised God and went and stayed in their house.
