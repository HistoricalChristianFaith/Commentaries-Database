[God spoke] of the branches (thickets), not the root. When the measure of the people’s sins was complete, John came and took up the roots of their trees. “For the ax is laid to the roots of the trees,” [the roots] which Isaiah had left [untouched]. When will this be, if not at the rising forth of the true One, who was designated by the [image of] the staff and the shoot, and upon whom rests the Spirit, who is referred to as being sevenfold.
