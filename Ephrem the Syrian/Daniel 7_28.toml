Daniel adds, “Here the account ends,” that is, the interpretation of the vision. “As for me, my thoughts greatly terrified me, and my face turned pale,” because of the sad news of the afflictions, which the little horn will impose on my people and priests. “But I kept the matter in my mind,” so that I might not sadden my listeners with such a bad omen.
