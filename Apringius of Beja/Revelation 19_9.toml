Who are those who have been invited to the feast of the Lamb, unless those to whom it is said: “I will not drink from this fruit of the vine until I will drink it new with you in the kingdom of my Father who is in heaven.” And again, “Many will come from east and west and will recline at table with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven.” This is to drink the new cup, to prepare the new bodies of those being raised, to keep a new joy, and to repay the sincere righteousness of a true faith. These are the blessed who are prepared for this feast and for this repast.
