Resting on three arms, a lampstand raises the body of a single shaft, and upon this shaft there is placed a lamp of light. “For no other foundation can any one lay than that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ,” says the apostle, “from which the whole body, joined and knit together by every joint with which it is supplied, makes bodily growth and upbuilds itself in love, according to the work and ability of each member.” This is that branch of which it is said: “There shall come forth a branch from the stump of Jesse.” Upon this branch a light is placed, that is, the light of the catholic church is made ready, so that seized by the truth of his light, she might herself bring forth perpetual light, and marked by the manifestation of one faith, she might be exalted by the light of the divine majesty.
