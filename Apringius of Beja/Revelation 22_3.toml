There will be [in that city] nothing accursed, that is, no temptation will approach, no profane sin shall be recorded through the rashness of the envious one. Rather, in its midst will be the rule of the divine power and of the Lamb. All will serve him with the exaltation of that cityâ€™s happiness. They shall rejoice in the vision of his face and in the sweetness of his presence, and they shall bear his name engraved in the sign of his cross on their foreheads.
