The sharp sword that issues from his mouth is the authority of the law and the severity of the judge. It remains sharp for justice, so that he might separate all things and reckon the deeds of every person. Then it says, “so that he might smite the nations with [the sword].” To smite means to strike, to determine, to free, to damn, to justify, to rescue, to save.… The rod of iron is the discipline of power by which he will make right all nations, equally changing them and judging them.… The wine press is hell, and the wine is the judgment by which those are restrained and subdued upon whom the righteous anger of God will have come.
