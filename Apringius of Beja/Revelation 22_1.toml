The living water is the Lord Jesus Christ. Of this water he spoke to the Samaritan woman: “If you knew the gift of God and who it was who says to you, ‘give me to drink,’ you would rather ask from him, and he would give to you the living water.” [He was speaking of] the knowledge of his deity and the fullness of a holy faith. For concerning him it is said, “For with you is the fountain of life.” For they are buried [with him] through baptism, as the apostle says: “For we have been buried with him by baptism into death.” Therefore, the living water which is like crystal and is perfectly clear is the washing of the holy font and the resulting brightness of most blessed faith. It is said to flow from the throne of God and the Lamb because the cleansing is from him, life is from him, and all righteousness and holiness of baptism flows from and proceeds from him.
