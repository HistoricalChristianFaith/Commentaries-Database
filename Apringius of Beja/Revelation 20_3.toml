“And sealed it over him,” that is, placed upon it the bolt of the cross so that he might never regain his strength, nor any more seduce the nations, whom the resurrection will restore and make better. Nonetheless, to this explanation the following seems in opposition. “Until the thousand years shall be ended. After that he must be loosed for a little while.” However, one can understand this to mean to the extent that the will of our Lord, Jesus Christ, and his command allow. “For a little while,” that is, in a moment of time and by the power of the one who commands, [Satan] is dissolved into nothing and at the same time disappears. For if he is loosed so that he might be free, how then does he say, “I saw thrones?” This is similar to the most holy Daniel who speaks in the same sense as follows: “In that day your people shall be saved, every one whose [name] shall be found written in the book. And many of those who sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to eternal life, and some to disgrace, that they might eternally see.” For, how is he released from chains, if the resurrection is already celebrated and if the seats of judgment are seen?
