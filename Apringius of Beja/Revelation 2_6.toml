Of the Nicolaitans, it is interpreted as “a pouring out” or “the folly of a fainting church.” And this is rightly said of heretics who have been poured out from the container of the truth and have tumbled headlong into the mud of deceit. And, concerning this pouring out, it is said in the Law: “You are poured out as water; you will not rise up.” Clearly, the foolishness of a fainting church is the perverse teaching of the heretics, for they do not bring healing to the wound of the people, but they afflict upon the people the greatest of weaknesses, thinking foolish thoughts about God and being themselves fully taken over by ridiculous ideas. Concerning such persons it is said: “They have restored the sorrow of my people to dishonor, saying, ‘Peace, peace,’ when there is no peace.”
