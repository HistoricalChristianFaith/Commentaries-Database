The angel does not desire that sinners perish. He rather warns those who do iniquity so that hearing the sound of a celestial threat, they might wish to abstain from evil works. Moreover, that the righteous might be made even better, he says, “Let the righteous still do right, and the holy still be holy.” [He says this] that they might realize the imminent coming of the Lord and that they might more easily keep themselves from sin and from that time forward always devote themselves to holiness and righteousness.
