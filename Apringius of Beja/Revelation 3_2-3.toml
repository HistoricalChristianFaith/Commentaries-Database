He rebukes those idle persons who do not trust in God with the whole mind and keep the right faith only hypocritically. They are Christians in name only. And so they are said to be living, but in fact they are dead. For that reason they are rebuked that they might be vigilant and strengthen what remains of that from which they had fallen. And so he urges them, “Remember what you received and heard, and repent.” He wishes that they remember the apostolic doctrine, and he warns them to preserve that which they received at the beginning of their faith and to repent of their past sins. And so he threatens whomever does not do this, “If you will not be vigilant, I will come like a thief, and you will not know at what hour I will come upon you.” The judgment of God will be sudden, and no one knows the secret hour when he intends to come.
