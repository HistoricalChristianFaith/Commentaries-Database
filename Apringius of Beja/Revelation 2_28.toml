“And I will give him the morning star,” that is, the Lord Jesus Christ, whom evening never overtakes, but who is eternal light, and who is himself always in light. Or, another interpretation: He promises the morning star, namely, the first resurrection; [the resurrection is] the morning star which causes night to flee and announces the light.
