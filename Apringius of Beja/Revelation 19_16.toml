Christ is the basis and the foundation on which Paul builds as an architect. Christ is the good Shepherd “who gives his life for the sheep.” Christ is the head of every dominion and power. He is himself the head of the church, wherefore it is said, “the head of man is Christ,” because he is the head of the church. He is the father, because by him through baptism all the nations of the earth are born again. His thigh, on which his name is written, are the believers whom the Son of God, that is, Christ, has willed to name “sons” through the adoption of faith. His robe is the assumed man, and because there is one person of two substances, we recognize his divinity in his robe, that is, in the sacrament of the Lord’s body. Upon the vestment of his body it is said that his name was written, “King of kings and Lord of lords.” Indeed, it is written on his thigh, because all who are called “sons” through faith witness with an unswerving confession that he is the King of kings and the Lord of lords.
