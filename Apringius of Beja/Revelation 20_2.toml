In Greek letters, one thousand is designated with an 'alpha.' In the name of Christ (Χριστος) we have the cross, which is our victory and the destruction of the evil enemy. Therefore, both by the cross he bound the enemy of the world who deceived those who dwell upon the earth. For to that eternity no time is added, and the eternity of his time will be enclosed by no end, nor will there ever be an end to the number of years. And so by the sovereinty of the Lord throgh the power of the cross he bound him in the abyss.
