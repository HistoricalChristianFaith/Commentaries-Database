“He who testifies to these things says,” that is, the very same Lord Jesus Christ who commanded me to write these things, “Surely, I am coming soon.” He makes known the certainty and the quickness of his coming. And already certain of his own blessedness, this saint fervently declares, “Come, Lord Jesus!” May the almighty Jesus Christ grant to us that as we earnestly await his coming we might, with his protection, keep ourselves from every grave sin, and that when our desire is fulfilled, he find nothing in us worthy of punishment. But should there be anything to pardon, may he nevertheless have mercy upon the accused and not condemn the sinner. May he with whom the blessed One lives and reigns forever grant this. Amen.
