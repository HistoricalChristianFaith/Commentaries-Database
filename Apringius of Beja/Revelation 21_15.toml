The wall of fire surrounding it is the Lord, as we have already said. The golden measuring rod is the faith concerning the Lord’s incarnation, for on account of its purity and sinlessness his body is revealed to be clearer and more brilliant than any metal. He alone is the one through whom the measure of the faith and the integrity of the holy city is established, and he only is recognized as the measure of its gates and the height of its wall.
