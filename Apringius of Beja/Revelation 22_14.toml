He calls those blessed who either wash their nuptial garment in the blood of the Lordâ€™s passion through the washing of regeneration which they receive or who through the sorrow of their heart and with tears accomplish the washing away of sins committed at the present time. He indicates that without doubt these will have the right to possess the tree of life. This is that right, that they see the face of our Lord, Jesus Christ, who is true life, and rejoice, and that they desire to be admitted to his presence through the gates, that is, through the doctrine of the apostles and the prophets, which they worked to fulfill.
