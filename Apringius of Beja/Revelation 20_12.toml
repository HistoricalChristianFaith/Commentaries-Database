Who is free before God if not those who are declared to be by the power of him who judges the works of each one? God is said to have a book, which is not a physical book but a spiritual book, that is, the eternal memory in which the names of the elect are kept. And so the psalm says, “The righteous shall be in everlasting remembrance.” “Also another book was opened, which is the Book of Life.” The Book of Life, and Life itself, is the Lord Jesus Christ. Then he shall be opened, that is, made manifest to every creature, when he will render to each according to his work. “And the dead were judged by what was written in the books, by what they had done.” “God has spoken once, and I have heard these two things,” it says. And what these two things are he makes clearer when he says, “The kingdom is the Lord’s, and he is the governor of the nations.” There he heard of the kingdom; here he has beheld the book. There he heard two things; here he has also seen another book. And what is contained in these two books he says there, “the power of God is also yours, O Lord, and mercy.” The power is in the judging and the mercy is in the giving of recompense. “And the dead were judged by what was written in the books, by what they had done.” And so he says there, “for you will recompense everyone according to his works.”
