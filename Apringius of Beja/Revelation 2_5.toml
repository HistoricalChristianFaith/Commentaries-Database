For although he wishes that we remember those instances in which we have badly fallen, he exhorts that we might not fall again. And that our faults which we have committed might be cleansed, he shows a way by which one might come to pardon when he says, “Repent.” That is, wash away your sins with tears, just as “that sinful woman,” as a type of the church, “washed the feet of Jesus with her tears and wiped them with her hair.” And he exhorts and commands what one should do after repentance: “Do your first works,” either by an extraordinary goodness or do those works which you had done in the earnestness of your first conversion.
