In Isaiah it is said to her, “Come down and sit in the dust, O virgin daughter of Babylon; sit on the ground, for there is no throne for the daughter of the Chaldeans, because you shall no longer be called tender and delicate.” And shortly thereafter: “Sit, be silent, go into the darkness, for you shall no more be called the mistress of kingdoms.” And again: “You said, ‘I shall be mistress forever,’ so that you did not lay these things to heart, nor did you remember your name. Now therefore, hear this, you delicate one who dwells in confidence, who says in your heart, ‘I am, and there is no one besides me; I shall not sit as a widow or know the loss of children.’ These two things shall come to you suddenly, in one day, sterility and widowhood.” Who would not understand these things together to be one prophecy and that they were said of one, universal event?
