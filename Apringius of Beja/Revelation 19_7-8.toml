The fine linen is the righteous deeds of the saints. After thanksgiving has been given and after the voice of exhortation has been heard, the praise to God, as though the sound of claps of thunder, is loudly proclaimed by those who rejoice that the marriage feast of the Lamb has come. This will occur when, after the consummation of the world, “every rule and authority will have been destroyed and he will have delivered the kingdom to God the Father, so that God will be all in all.” This will occur, that is, when his wife, namely the catholic church, will be joined to him in the purity of faith. Concerning this the holy apostle said: “For I betrothed you to Christ to present you as a pure virgin to one husband.” And so, the fine linen which she [the church] wears does not represent the beauty of a vestment, but the righteousness of the saints.
