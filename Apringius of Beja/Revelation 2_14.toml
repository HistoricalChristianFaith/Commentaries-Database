Nevertheless, the Lord has something against this church because there are some who “hold the teaching of Balaam,” which is interpreted “without people” or “without property.” For Balaam is a type of the adversary who does not gather a people for salvation, nor does he rejoice in the number of the multitude that is being saved. Rather, as long as he destroys all and remains without a people and without any property, then he rejoices. It is he himself who “taught Balak to put a stumbling block before the sons of Israel.” For Balak is interpreted to mean “throwing down” or “devouring.” He has thrown Israel down so that it might be consecrated to the idol, Phogor, and he has devoured them by the eating of pleasure and luxury.
