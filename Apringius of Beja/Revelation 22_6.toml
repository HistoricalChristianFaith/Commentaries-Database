What is so faithful and true as the promise of Christ and the future hope of the saints? He who spoke through his servants, the prophets, did so that he might be recognized as the Lord of the living and be called “the Spirit of the Lord.” For the Spirit is life, and all flesh is made alive by the Spirit.
