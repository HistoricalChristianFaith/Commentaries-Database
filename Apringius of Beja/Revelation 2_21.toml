The Lord promises that a sickness and a weariness will come to this doctrine, and a weakness of the sickbed, that is, the pleasure of this world. And to those who commit adultery through this teaching, he promises that a very great tribulation will come upon them on the Day of Judgment. For Jezebel herself is interpreted as “dung heap” or a “flowing of blood.” What else is thought to be in the filth of a dung heap or in blood, unless the evil deed and sin which is committed through fault? Therefore, rightly does he foretell a future condemnation for them, unless they strongly repent of their works. For he also mentions that he will damn her sons, that is, her disciples with the second death.
