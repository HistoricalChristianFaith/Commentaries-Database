“Until the thousand years were ended,” that is, until such time as the sacrament of the faith and the mystery of the cross is perfected in them and that those who are beginning to flourish might appear in their eternal blessedness. “The rest of the dead did not come to life.” He did not say, “they did not arise again,” but that they did not come to life, because without joy and happiness, and without the reward of eternity, in their torments they shall be regarded as though dead. “This is the first resurrection.” That is to say, the happiness of the saints and their reward; for it is said to be the “first” because of its splendor and its preeminence.

He indicates that those over whom the second death has power did not come to life. To be sure, they have been resurrected unto the second death, that is, they have been damned to the lake of fire, even as it is stated in the psalms: “As though living he swallows them as in anger.” Indeed, concerning those over whom the second death has no power, it says, “they shall be priests of God and they shall reign with him a thousand years.” All those who shall have been in the congregation of the saints, shall be called saints, and they shall be priests of Christ our God, and they shall reign with him in the strength of the cross and in the sovereignty of his might.
