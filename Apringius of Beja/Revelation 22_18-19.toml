It is not that he denies that the words that he had spoken were not to be explained. Rather, around that very time in which the saint had his vision, the error of various teachers and heretics began to emerge and to take their rise. Therefore, in order that no one promoting error might through the usual deceit of their error intend either to add or to subtract from his words and in that way seek to confirm their views by the witness of this most holy man, he determined to conclude his book with this warning. And that no one might think that what he said was merely a human opinion, he now mentions [the Lord Jesus Christ] who is the author of these things.
