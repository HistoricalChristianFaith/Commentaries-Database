[The city is foursquare], that is, it persists in the faith of the fourfold gospel. It is said that its length is the same as its breadth, so that one might see that in its faith there is nothing disproportionate, nothing that has been added, and nothing that has been taken away.… He measured the city with his rod, which we understand to be the body of Christ, and it was twelve stadia. For the faith in Christ and the integrity of the holy people is recognized by means of these twelve stadia, that is, by means of the teaching of the apostles and the faith of the ancient fathers. “For the length and the breadth were the same.” All things are equal, for nothing is found in the saints that is superfluous or that comes from the outside, nor is anything inferior found within them.
