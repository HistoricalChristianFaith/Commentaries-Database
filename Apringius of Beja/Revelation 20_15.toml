Whoever did not believe during life and did not open his mouth in confession of our Lord Jesus Christ shall be destroyed along with death and hell because he failed to receive life. Nevertheless, we do not confess that everyone will die or come to punishment. Rather, that will be fulfilled which we read in Daniel, “Some shall rise to everlasting life, and some to everlasting contempt, so that they might always behold.” And what shall they always behold, if not that they are tormented while others are glorified?
