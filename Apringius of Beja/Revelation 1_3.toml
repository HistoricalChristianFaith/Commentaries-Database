He wishes to make clear that the reading does not accomplish the obedience of the commandments, nor does the hearing display the completion of an accomplished deed. Rather, that alone is perfection, when you perform with understanding what you read and what you hear. “The time is short.” For those who accomplish these things, he does not prolong the time of recompense, but he says that the giving of the divine reward is near.
