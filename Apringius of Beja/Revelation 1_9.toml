The ecclesiastical writers have taught that at the time of Claudius Caesar, when that famine which the prophet Agabus had announced in the Acts of the Apostles would come in ten years time was at its height, that during that difficulty this same Caesar, impelled by his usual vanity, had instituted a persecution of the churches. It was during this time that he ordered John, the apostle of our Lord, Jesus Christ, to be transported into exile, and he was taken to the island of Patmos, and while there confirmed this writing. That he might present the trials of suffering which he was bearing at that time, he recalls that he was a participant in suffering, and then he adds the kingdom to the suffering of tribulation, and because of the kingdom to be received he further adds the patient endurance which he bore for the sake of Jesus.
