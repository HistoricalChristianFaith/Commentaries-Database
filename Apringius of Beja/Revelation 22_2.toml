Concerning wisdom it is said, “She proclaims outside; she raises her voice in the streets, and she cries out on the top of the walls.” And should anyone refuse to come to the marriage of the king, she commands her servants and says, “Go to the streets and byways and invite whomever you meet to the wedding, that my house might be filled.” This water of salvation and the cleansing of grace is described as flowing in the streets.… The two banks of the river are the two Testaments in which the fullness of our salvation is written down. There is the tree of life. There is told [the story] of our Lord Jesus Christ, who is the tree of life: “Through him we live, move, and have our being.” The leaves are his words; they are of use for the health of all nations. The twelve months are the apostles of the Lord, because the Lord himself is the “favorable year of forgiveness.” These are the twelve months, each bringing to the many the fruit of unending preaching out of an abundance of knowledge.
