If you compare the words of the blessed Daniel, you will find one and the same thing. “He will come with a great multitude so that he might exterminate and destroy many.” However, in the Revelation it is said that, when the kings of the earth and their armies are gathered together, they will war against him who sits on the horse, that is, against Jesus Christ, and against his army, that is, against all saints who follow him.
