He praises the works of his church, for through many tribulations she contends for the kingdom. He indicates expressly the grace of poverty, because [the church] despises very much the things of the present time, so that she might acquire future things. “But you are rich.” You are rich in faith and are filled with an abundance of blessings. “And you are slandered by those who say that they are Jews and are not, but are a synagogue of Satan.” For the church often sustains much insult from those who claim that they confess God, but do not confess him. Rather, their congregation is bound to the devil as its source. For that reason, he exhorts his church not to fear those who kill the body, but afterward have nothing which they can do.
