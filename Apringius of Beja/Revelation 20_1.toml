We must entreat the Lord more earnestly here, lest we consent in error concerning the number of the thousand years or through our own excess nurture error. Rather, [let us entreat the Lord] that he who is called “Faithful” and “True” might keep our faith safe. The Lord himself said at the beginning of this book, “I am the first and the last, and the living one although I was dead; and I have the keys of death and of hades.” By the key it speaks of him who bears the office of ministry, so that he might open the pit of the abyss. The great chain is the unbreakable bond of the divine commandment. It is in his hand, which means that he exercises it by work and deed.
