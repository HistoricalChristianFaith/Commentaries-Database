“And it had a great, high wall.” Zechariah said, “For I will be,” says the Lord, “a wall of fire round about.” What is so great and high as the Lord of majesty, who with the protection of his presence surrounds the holy city? “And it had twelve gates and at the gates twelve corners, and the names of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel were written [on the gates].” In the Gospel we read that the Lord spoke concerning himself: “I am the door; if any one enters by me, he will enter and will find pasture.” Therefore, Christ is the door. However, the ancient people of our faith are named together not as doors, but their names are written on the gates, that is, on the doors. Thus our Lord shows to all the saints that he is the door of truth and freedom. This shows that the whole band of the patriarchs belonged to the faith in our Lord Jesus Christ. The twelve corners of the gates, and the twelve gates and the twelve foundations on which the names of the apostles and of the Lamb are written yield the number of thirty-six. It is clear that this is the number of hours that our Lord Jesus Christ lay in the grave after his passion. This demonstrates that the host of leaders who came beforehand and the chorus of apostles who came afterwards had been redeemed by the one faith and passion of the Lord, and that they have come to the knowledge of the omnipotent God through the one entrance of faith in Christ, who is the door. For also the names of apostles themselves are said to be written upon the twelve foundations, because Christ is the foundation, as Paul says, “For no other foundation can anyone lay than that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ.” And he himself is in each, and each is in him. The Lord says, “You are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church.” And it is written in the words of the most blessed Paul that “the rock was Christ.” Therefore, it is Peter to whom the Lord spoke: “On this rock I will build my church.” That is, the church is built upon faith in the incarnation, passion and resurrection of the Lord.
