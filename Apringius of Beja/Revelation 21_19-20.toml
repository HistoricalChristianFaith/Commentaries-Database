These foundations of the city are understood to be the apostolic faith and the preaching of the apostles, upon which our Lord Jesus Christ constructs his city. For he who is the Foundation of foundations is himself the builder who upon the faith in his own most blessed name builds the holy church, which consists of those who were the very first and of those who follow after them until the end of the world, which is unknown to us. The various precious stones signify the apostles because in each of them shine the gifts and miracles that belong to the Holy Spirit. Moreover, that the brightness of the unified light is seen within them indicates that what shines outward from them never ceases to exist within.
