He says that he was taken up in the spirit, that is, that he was raised up to the secret things of God, in order that he might see those things which he was to speak. Moreover, he says that he did not enter into the heights of heaven in a bodily manner, but that he entered in the spirit, recalling this word, “No one has ascended into heaven except he who has descended, namely the Son of man, who is in heaven.” The holy apostle Paul also says that he was taken up, but in what way? He says, “Whether in the body or out of the body, I do not know, God knows.” He writes that he had been taken up into ecstasy, in the spirit. But since the day of the Lord is mentioned in this passage, when he says that he had been taken up in the spirit, he is indicating that he had been cleansed of any work of a profane kind. For, on the Lord’s day the apostle could only devote himself to divine things and holy duties.… Concerning the preachers of the gospel, it is written, “Cry aloud, do not cease, lift up your voice as a trumpet.” And concerning the words “behind me,” the prophet said, “And they shall hear a voice from behind of one teaching.” Let all humanity be exalted to whatever degree of sanctity, in comparison to the holy acts of God and to the divine words, it can by no means ever stand as an equal before his presence and face. But our flesh, weighed down by a certain weakness, is instructed, as it were, from behind by the words of God. Therefore, in saying “behind me” he indicates the weakness of his human nature.
