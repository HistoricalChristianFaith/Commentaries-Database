The Holy Spirit and the church call all to come to salvation.… And whoever keeps the words of this prophecy and hears him whom the Lord himself has commanded [to speak], he is worthy to be taught.

Salvation is given without any price and without any barter. Rather, he who desires to be saved, he will enter and will either receive free of charge the regeneration of baptism, or he will receive the remedy of repentance without cost or charge. The prophet spoke in a similar manner: “All who thirst, come to the waters; and you who have no money, hasten, come, buy and eat.”
