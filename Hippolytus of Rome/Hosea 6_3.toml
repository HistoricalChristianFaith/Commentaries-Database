Nor is this the only thing that proves the dignity of the water. But there is also that which is more honorable than allâ€”the fact that Christ, the maker of all, came down as the rain, and was known as a spring, and diffused himself as a river, and was baptized in the Jordan. For you have just heard how Jesus came to John and was baptized by him in the Jordan. Oh, things strange beyond compare! How should the boundless river that makes glad the city of God18 have been dipped in a little water!
