How clearly Jacob has shown here his piety!… In other respects it was also true what was said by Jacob, that is: “My brother Esau is a hairy man,” that is, a sinner, “but I am a man of smooth skin.” In fact, through these words the faultless and sinless character of the flesh of the Lord is revealed.
