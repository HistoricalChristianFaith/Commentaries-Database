And that the things spoken of old by the law and the prophets were all sealed, and that they were unknown to people, Isaiah declares when he says, “And they will deliver the book that is sealed to one that is learned, and will say to him, ‘Read this;’ and he will say, ‘I cannot read it, for it is sealed.’ ” It was right and necessary that the things spoken of old by the prophets should be sealed to the unbelieving Pharisees, who thought that they understood the letter of the law, and be opened to the believing. The things, therefore, which of old were sealed, are now by the grace of God the Lord all open to the saints. - "Fragments from Commentary on Daniel 2.19"
