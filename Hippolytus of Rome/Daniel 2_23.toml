Because You have given me wisdom and might. We ought therefore to mark the goodness of God, how He straightway reveals and shows (Himself) to the worthy, and to those that fear Him, fulfilling their prayers and supplications, as the prophet says: Who is wise, and he shall understand these things? And prudent, and he shall know them?
