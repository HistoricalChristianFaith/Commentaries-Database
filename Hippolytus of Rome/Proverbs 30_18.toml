There be three things which I cannot understand, and the fourth I know not: the tracks of an eagle flying,” i.e., Christ’s ascension; “and the ways of a serpent upon a rock,” i.e., that the devil did not find a trace of sin in the body of Christ; “and the ways of a ship crossing the sea,” i.e., the ways of the Church, which is in this life as in a sea, and which is directed by her hope in Christ through the cross; “and the ways of a man in youth,”([The Authorized Version reads very differently; but our author follows the Sept., with which agrees the Vulgate.])—the ways of Him, namely, who is born of the Holy Spirit and the Virgin.  For behold, says the Scripture, a man whose name is the Rising.(The reference probably is to Zech. vi. 12, where the word is rendered “Branch.” The word in the text is ἀνατολή)
