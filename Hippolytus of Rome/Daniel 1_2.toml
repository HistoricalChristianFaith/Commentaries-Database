These words, and the Lord gave, are written, that no one, in reading the introduction to the book, may attribute their capture to the strength of the captors and the slackness of their chief. And it is well said. with part, for the deportation was for the correction, not the ruin, of the whole nation, that there might be no misapplication of the cause.
