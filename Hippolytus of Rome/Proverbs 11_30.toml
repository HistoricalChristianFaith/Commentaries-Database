The fruit of righteousness and the tree of life is Christ. He alone, as man, fulfilled all righteousness. And with his own underived life he has brought forth the fruits of knowledge and virtue like a tree, whereof they that eat shall receive eternal life and shall enjoy the tree of life in paradise, with Adam and all the righteous. But the souls of the unrighteous meet an untimely expulsion from the presence of God, by whom they shall be left to remain in the flame of torment.
