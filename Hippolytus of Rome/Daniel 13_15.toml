Which is the favorable day if not that of Passover? This is the day in which the laver is prepared in the garden for those who burn with lust; and the church, washed like Susanna, is presented to God as a young and pure spouse. And, like the two attendants who accompanied Susanna, faith and charity prepare the oil and the ointments for those who come to be washed. What do the ointments signify? The commandments of the Word. The oil is nothing other than the gifts of the Spirit. With these the faithful come scented with the anointing that takes place after the laver of washing. These things were prefigured here in the blessed Susanna for our sake.
