“He troubled himself” not as we are troubled by fear or pain, but “he troubled himself.” “Where have you laid him?” Did he who had known when he had died not know where he was buried? But he mingles human words with divine miracles in order to show that he was also human, as also the prophet says, “And he is a human, and who will know him?” And he wanted it to be clear that he who is God is also something else.… But he showed himself actually as man also by the fact that he wept.
