The times are noted from the foundation of the world and are reckoned from Adam.… For the first appearance of our Lord in the flesh took place in Bethlehem, under Augustus, in the year 5500; and he suffered in the thirty-third year. And it is necessary that six thousand years be accomplished, in order that the sabbath may come, the rest, the holy day “on which God rested from all his works.” For the sabbath is the type and emblem of the future kingdom of the saints, when they “shall reign with Christ,” when he comes from heaven, as John says in the Apocalypse: “For a day with the Lord is as a thousand years.” Since, then, in six days God made all things, it follows that six thousand years must be fulfilled. And they are not yet fulfilled, as John says, “five are fallen; one is,” that is, the sixth; “the other is not yet come.” In mentioning the “other,” moreover, he specifies the seventh, in which there is rest.
