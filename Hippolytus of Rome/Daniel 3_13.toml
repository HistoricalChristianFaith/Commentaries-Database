Behold the Holy Spirit as it is manifest in the martyrs’ eloquent speech, comforting them and consoling them and encouraging them to disregard death.… A person deprived of the Holy Spirit would be frightened and hide in fear, taking precautions against this death.… He is terrified as he stands before the blade, panicked at the idea of torment and seeing only the world below. This man is consoled with the life below, as he prefers to have a wife and the love of his children and to see only wealth. This man, who does not possess the power of heaven, readily is lost. Thus, whoever is close to the Word hears the command of the King ng and Lord of the sky: “Whoever does not take up his cross and follow me is not worthy of me, and whoever does not give up all of his possessions will not become my disciple.”
