He comes to the heavenly gates: angels accompany him, and the gates of heaven were closed. For he has not yet ascended into heaven. Now first does he appear to the powers of heaven as flesh ascending. Therefore to these powers it is said by the angels, who are the couriers of the Savior and Lord, â€œLift up your gates, you princes; and be lifted up, you everlasting doors; and the King of glory shall come in.
