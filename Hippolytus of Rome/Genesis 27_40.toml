And the words: “You shall live by your sword” mean that the people never stop being in defensive or aggressive war with the nations living around them, as Scripture itself shows. And the sentence “You shall be the servant of your brother” indicates the age that still continues, the age in which the Savior was present and came to visit his own brothers according to the flesh, and the Savior the prophet here suggests to serve after humanity has become obedient. That is why he said: “There will come a time when you shall shake and break the yoke from your neck.” Which yoke, but the yoke that lies in the law? Provided that they do not live any more as slaves under the yoke of the law but believe in the gospel as free men, they can still be saved.
