Susanna had to endure this from of old, and we still must endure under the princes of Babylon. Susanna was a figure of the church; her husband Joakim, a figure of Christ. The garden that was found near the house represented the communion of saints, planted like fruitful trees in the middle of the church. Babylon is the world. The two elders are figures of the two peoples who conspire against the church, one of the circumcision and the other of the Gentiles.
