The Lord’s body furnished both sacred blood and holy water to the world.… This body, clinically dead, still has a great power of life in it. For what [normally] does not flow from dead bodies flowed from this one, that is, blood and water. This happened so that we might know the great power for life possessed by the power that inhabited this body that, even while dead, was able to pour forth to us the causes of life.
