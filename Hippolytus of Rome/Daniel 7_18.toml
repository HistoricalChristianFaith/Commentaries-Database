For when the three beasts have finished their course and been removed and the one still stands in vigor—if this one, too, is removed, then finally earthly things [shall] end and heavenly things begin. The indissoluble and everlasting kingdom of the saints may be brought to view and the heavenly King manifested to all, no longer in figure, like one seen in vision or revealed in a pillar of cloud on the top of a mountain but amid the powers and armies of angels, as God incarnate and man, Son of God and Son of man—coming from heaven as the world’s judge.
