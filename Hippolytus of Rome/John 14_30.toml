For as a serpent cannot mark its track upon a rock, so the devil could not find sin in the body of Christ. For the Lord says, "Behold, the prince of this world cometh, and will find nothing in me."

As a serpent cannot leave a trail on a rock, so the devil could not find sin in the body of Christ. For the Lord says, “Behold, the prince of this world comes and will find nothing in me.” For as a ship, sailing in the sea, leaves no traces of her way behind it, so neither does the church, which is situated in the world as in a sea, leave its hope on the earth, because it has its life reserved in heaven. And as [the church] holds its way here only for a short time, it is not possible to trace out its course.
