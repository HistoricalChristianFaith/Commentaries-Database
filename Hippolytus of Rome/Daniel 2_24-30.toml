For the king, on making himself master of the land of Egypt, and taking hold of Judea and carrying off the people, thought on his bed what should come after these things. He who knows the secrets of all and searches the thoughts of the hearts revealed to him by means of the image the things that were to be. But he hid from the king the vision, in order that the counsels of God might not be interpreted by the wise men of Babylon but that by the blessed Daniel, as a prophet of God, things kept secret from all might be made manifest.
