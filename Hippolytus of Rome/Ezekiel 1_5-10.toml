This is also how Ezekiel depicts those animals that praise God. In the four figures of the four Evangelists he demonstrates the glory of the Father and draws attention to his workings, in whom all four points of the compass are fulfilled. “The one animal,” he says, “had four figures”; because each figure is a Gospel, it appears in a fourfold fashion. The first figure, he says, which was like an ox, indicates the priestly glory of Jesus, which Luke depicts. The second, which was like a lion, indicates the leadership and regal nature of the lion “of the tribe of Judah”; this is what Matthew depicts. The third was like a human being and shows the Son’s capacity for suffering and the lowly nature of humanity; this is what Mark shows. However, the fourth, the eagle, teaches the spiritual secret of his power and might who flies up to the Father’s heaven; this is John’s message.
