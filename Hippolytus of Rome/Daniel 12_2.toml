These shall awake to everlasting life. That is, those who have believed in the true life, and who have their names written in the book of life. And these to shame. That is, those who are attached to Antichrist, and who are cast with him into everlasting punishment.

Who are the ones sleeping in “the tombs of the earth” but the bodies of those people who will receive their own souls back and rise from the dead? Some will rise “to the resurrection of life,” receiving pure, transparent and radiant bodies “like the brilliance of the firmament.” Others will arise “to the resurrection of judgment,” receiving bodies suitable to everlasting punishment.
