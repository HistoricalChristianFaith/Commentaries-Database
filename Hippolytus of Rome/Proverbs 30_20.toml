“Such is the way of an adulterous woman, who, when she has done the deed of sin, wipes herself and will say that no wickedness has been done.” Such is the conduct of the church that believes on Christ, when, after committing fornication with idols, she renounces these and the devil and is cleansed of her sins, and receives forgiveness, and then asserts that she has done no wickedness. .
