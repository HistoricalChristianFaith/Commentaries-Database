It must be noted, that he names the law a good gift, on account of the man who takes gifts into his bosom unrighteously. And he forsakes the law who transgresses it; the law, namely, of which he speaks, or which he has kept.

And what is meant by exalt (fortify) her? Surround her with holy thoughts; for you have need of large defence, since there are many things to imperil such a possession. But if it is in our power to fortify her, and if there are virtues in our power which exalt the knowledge of God, these will be her bulwarks—as, for example, practice, study, and the whole chain of other virtues; and the man who observes these, honours wisdom; and the reward is, to be exalted to be with her, and to be embraced by her in the chamber of heaven.

The heterodox are the wicked, and the transgressors of the law are evil men, whose ways— that is to say, their deeds— he bids us not enter.

He looks right on who has thoughts free of passion; and he has true judgments, who is not in a state of excitement about external appearances. When he says, Let your eyes look right on, he means the vision of the soul; and when he gives the exhortation, Eat honey, my son, that it may be sweet to your palate, he uses honey figuratively, meaning divine doctrine, which restores the spiritual knowledge of the soul. But wisdom embraces the soul also; for, says he, love her, that she may embrace you. And the soul, by her embrace being made one with wisdom, is filled with holiness and purity. Yea more, the fragrant ointments of Christ are laid hold of by the soul's sense of smell.

Virtue occupies the middle position; whence also he says, that manly courage is the mean between boldness and cowardice. And now he mentions the right, not meaning thereby things which are right by nature, such as the virtues, but things which seem to you to be right on account of their pleasures. Now pleasures are not simply sensual enjoyments, but also riches and luxury. And the left indicates envy, robberies, and the like. For Boreas, says he, is a bitter wind, and yet is called by name right. For, symbolically, under Boreas he designates the wicked devil by whom every flame of evil is kindled in the earth. And this has the name right, because an angel is called by a right (propitious) name. Turn aside, says he, from evil, and God will take care of your end; for He will go before you, scattering your enemies, that you may go in peace.
