For this reason did the Father send down the Holy Spirit from heaven upon the One who was baptized.… For what reason? That the faithfulness of the Father’s voice might be made known.… Listen to the Father’s voice: “This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.” This is he who is named the son of Joseph, who according to the divine essence is my only begotten. “This is my beloved Son,” yes, none other than the One who himself becomes hungry, yet feeds countless numbers. He is my Son who himself becomes weary, yet gives rest to the weary. He has no place to lay his head, yet bears up all things in his hand. He suffers, yet heals sufferings. He is beaten, yet confers liberty upon the world. He is pierced in his side, yet repairs the side of Adam.
