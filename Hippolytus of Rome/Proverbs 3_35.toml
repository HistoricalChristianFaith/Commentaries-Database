They will not simply obtain glory but inherit wisdom. The wicked, again, even though they are exalted, are exalted only so as to have greater dishonor. For as one does not honor someone who is ugly and misshapen, if he exalts him, but only dishonors him the more by making his shame manifest to a larger number; so also God exalts the wicked, in order that he may make their disgrace obvious. For pharaoh was exalted, but only to have the world as his accuser. .
