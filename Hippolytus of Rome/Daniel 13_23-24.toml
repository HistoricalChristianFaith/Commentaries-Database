And to whom did Susanna cry out? She cried out to God, as Isaiah says, “Then you will call, and the Lord will answer you; while you are still speaking, he will say, Here I am.” “And the two elders cried out against her.” The wicked never stop crying out against us and say, Away with such people from the earth, for it is not fitting that they should live.
