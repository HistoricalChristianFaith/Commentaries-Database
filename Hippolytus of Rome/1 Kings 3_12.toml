Proverbs are words of exhortation that serve the whole path of life. They serve as guides and signs for those who are seeking their way to God by reviving them when they become tired by the length of the road. These, moreover, are the proverbs of “Solomon,” that is to say, the “peacemaker,” who, in truth, is Christ the Savior. And since we understand the words of the Lord without offence as being the words of the Lord, that no one may mislead us by likeness of name, he tells us who wrote them and of what people he was king in order that the credit of the speaker may make the discourse acceptable and the hearers attentive. For these proverbs are the words of that Solomon to whom the Lord said, “I will give you a wise and understanding heart; so that there has been no one like you upon the earth, and after you there shall not arise any one like you.” … Now he was the wise son of a wise father. This is why David’s name, by whom Solomon was begotten, was added. From a child he was instructed in the sacred Scriptures and obtained his dominion not by lot, nor by force, but by the judgment of the Spirit and the decree of God.
