And He who is inseparable from the Father cries to the Father, and commends to Him His spirit; and bowing His head, He gives up the ghost, who said, "I have power to lay down my life, and I have power to take it again; ".
and because He was not overmastered by death, as being Himself Life, He said this: "I lay it down of myself."
