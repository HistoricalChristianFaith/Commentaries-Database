Till the wings thereof were plucked. For this happened in reality in the time of Nebuchadnezzar, as has been shown in the preceding book. And he bears witness directly that this very thing was fulfilled in himself; for he was driven out of the kingdom, and stripped of his glory, and of the greatness which he formerly possessed. And after a little: the words, It was made stand upon the feet as a man, and a man's heart was given to it, signify that Nebuchadnezzar, when he humbled himself, and acknowledged that he was but a man, in subjection under the power of God, and made supplication to the Lord, found mercy with Him, and was restored to his own kingdom and honour.

Now since these things, spoken as they are with a mystical meaning, may seem to some hard to understand, we shall keep back nothing fitted to impart an intelligent apprehension of them to those who are possessed of a sound mind. He said, then, that a “lioness came up from the sea,” and by that he meant the kingdom of the Babylonians in the world, which also was the head of gold on the image. In saying that it “had wings as of an eagle,” he meant that Nebuchadnezzar the king was lifted up and was exalted against God. Then he says “the wings were plucked,” that is to say, his glory was destroyed; for he was driven out of his kingdom. And the words “a man’s heart was given to it, and it was made to stand on the feet as a man,” refer to the fact that he repented and recognized himself to be only a man and gave the glory to God.
