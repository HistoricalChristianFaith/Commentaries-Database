“The horseleech had three dearly loved daughters.” Its daughters lead to sin: the daughters of fornication, murder and idolatry. These three did not satisfy her, for she is not to be satisfied. In destroying man by these actions, sin never varies but only grows continually. For the fourth, [Solomon] continues, is never content to say “enough,” meaning that it is universal lust.… For as the body is one and yet has many members, so also sin, being one, contains within it many various lusts by which it lays its snares for men.
