Because they considered it a blasphemy that he called God his Father, he used the tomb as a court of justice and set the truth as judge, while the surrounding unthankful multitude formed the witnesses, so that those who had said “You blaspheme by naming yourself in your own sense Son of God and him as your Father” were to see with their own eyes and hear with their own ears, while he as good as said to them, “I appeal to him here before you. If he is displeased because I call him Father, and it is a blasphemy as you think, he will not hear me. But if he hears me, it is certainly clear that he is actually my Father.… If I call the dead and he obeys my command and arises, it is not the work of a blasphemer but the command of God and of the Son of God.” That this is the meaning of the prayer and that it did not spring from any deficiency on his part is shown by his words.
