“And she brought forth,” he says, “a man child who is to rule all the nations.” By this is meant that the church, always bringing forth Christ, the perfect manchild of God, who is declared to be God and man, becomes the instructor of all the nations. And the words “her child was caught up unto God and to his throne” signify that he who is always born of her is a heavenly king and not an earthly; even as David also declared of old when he said, “The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool.”
