For as two advents of our Lord and Savior are indicated in the Scriptures, the one being his first advent in the flesh, which took place without honor by reason of his being made nothing, as Isaiah spoke of him previously, saying, “We saw him, and he had no form or beauty.” … But his second advent is announced as glorious, when he shall come from heaven with the host of angels and the glory of his Father, as the prophet said, “You shall see the King in glory,” and, “I saw one like the Son of man coming with the clouds of heaven; and he came to the Ancient of Days” … and he was brought to him. And there were given him dominion and honor and glory.
