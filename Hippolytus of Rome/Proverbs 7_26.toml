You have seen her mischief. Wait not to admit the rising of lust; for her death is everlasting. And for the rest, by her words, her arguments in truth, she wounds, and by her sins she kills those who yield to her. For many are the forms of wickedness that lead the foolish down to hell. And the chambers of death mean either its depths or its treasure. How, then, is escape possible?

He intends the new Jerusalem, or the sanctified flesh. By the seven pillars he means the sevenfold unity of the Holy Spirit resting upon it; as Isaiah testifies, saying, She has slain her victims.

Observe that the wise man must be useful to many; so that he who is useful only to himself cannot be wise. For great is the condemnation of wisdom if she reserves her power simply for the one possessing her. But as poison is not injurious to another body, but only to that one which takes it, so also the man who turns out wicked will injure himself, and not another. For no man of real virtue is injured by a wicked man.

The fruit of righteousness and the tree of life is Christ. He alone, as man, fulfilled all righteousness. And with His own underived life He has brought forth the fruits of knowledge and virtue like a tree, whereof they that eat shall receive eternal life, and shall enjoy the tree of life in paradise, with Adam and all the righteous. But the souls of the unrighteous meet an untimely expulsion from the presence of God, by whom they shall be left to remain in the flame of torment.

Not from men, but with the Lord, will he obtain favour.

He asks of wisdom, who seeks to know what is the will of God. And he will show himself prudent who is sparing of his words on that which he has come to learn. If one inquires about wisdom, desiring to learn something about wisdom, while another asks nothing of wisdom, as not only wishing to learn nothing about wisdom himself, but even keeping back his neighbours from so doing, the former certainly is deemed to be more prudent than the latter.

As to the horse-leech. There were three daughters fondly loved by sin— fornication, murder, and idolatry. These three did not satisfy her, for she is not to be satisfied. In destroying man by these actions, sin never varies, but only grows continually. For the fourth, he continues, is never content to say enough, meaning that it is universal lust. In naming the fourth, he intends lust in the universal. For as the body is one, and yet has many members; so also sin, being one, contains within it many various lusts by which it lays its snares for men. Wherefore, in order to teach us this, he uses the examples of Sheol (Hades), and the love of women, and hell (Tartarus), and the earth that is not filled with water. And water and fire, indeed, will never say, It is enough. And the grave (Hades) in no wise ceases to receive the souls of unrighteous men; nor does the love of sin, in the instance of the love of women, cease to be given to fornication, and it becomes the betrayer of the soul. And as Tartarus, which is situated in a doleful and dark locality, is not touched by a ray of light, so is every one who is the slave of sin in all the passions of the flesh Like the earth not filled with water he is never able to come to confession, and to the laver of regeneration, and like water and fire, never says, It is enough.

For as a serpent cannot mark its track upon a rock, so the devil could not find sin in the body of Christ. For the Lord says, Behold, the prince of this world comes, and will find nothing in me. — For as a ship, sailing in the sea, leaves no traces of her way behind her, so neither does the Church, which is situate in the world as in a sea, leave her hope upon the earth, because she has her life reserved in heaven; and as she holds her way here only for a short time, it is not possible to trace out her course.— As the Church does not leave her hope behind in the world, her hope in the incarnation of Christ which bears us all good, she did not leave the track of death in Hades.— Of whom but of Him who is born of the Holy Spirit and the Virgin?— who, in renewing the perfect man in the world, works miracles, beginning from the baptism of John, as the Evangelist also testifies: And Jesus was then beginning to be about thirty years of age. This, then, was the youthful and blooming period of the age of Him who, in journeying among the cities and districts, healed the diseases and infirmities of men.

The eye that mocks at his father, and dishonours the old age of his mother. That is to say, one that blasphemes God and despises the mother of Christ, the wisdom of God—his eyes may ravens from the caves tear out, i.e., him may unclean and wicked spirits deprive of the clear eye of gladness; and may the young eagles devour him: and such shall be trodden under the feet of the saints.

There be three things which I cannot understand, and the fourth I know not: the tracks of an eagle flying, i.e., Christ's ascension; and the ways of a serpent upon a rock, i.e., that the devil did not find a trace of sin in the body of Christ; and the ways of a ship crossing the sea, i.e., the ways of the Church, which is in this life as in a sea, and which is directed by her hope in Christ through the cross; and the ways of a man in youth, — the ways of Him, namely, who is born of the Holy Spirit and the Virgin. For behold, says the Scripture, a man whose name is the Rising.

Such is the way of an adulterous woman, who, when she has done the deed of sin, wipes herself, and will say that no wickedness has been done. Such is the conduct of the Church that believes on Christ, when, after committing fornication with idols, she renounces these and the devil, and is cleansed of her sins and receives forgiveness, and then asserts that she has done no wickedness.

By three things the earth is moved, viz., by the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost. And the fourth it cannot bear, viz., the last appearing of Christ. When a servant reigns: Israel was a slave in Egypt, and in the land of promise became a ruler. And a fool when he is filled with meat: i.e., getting the land in possession readily, and eating its fruit, and being filled, it (the people) kicked. And a handmaid when she casts out her mistress: i.e., the synagogue which took the life of the Lord, and crucified the flesh of Christ.

There be four things which are least upon the earth, and these are wiser than the wise: The ants have no strength, yet they prepare their meat in the summer. And in like manner, the Gentiles by faith in Christ prepare for themselves eternal life through good works. And the conies, a feeble folk, have made their houses in the rocks. The Gentiles, that is to say, are built upon Christ, the spiritual rock, which has become the head of the corner. The spider, that supports itself upon its hands, and is easily caught, dwells in the strongholds of kings. That is, the thief with his hands extended (on the cross), rests on the cross of Christ and dwells n Paradise, the stronghold of the three Kings— Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.

The locust has no king, and yet marches out in array as by one command. The Gentiles had no king, for they were ruled by sin; but now, believing God, they engage in the heavenly warfare.

There be three things which go well, and the fourth which is comely in going; that is, the angels in heaven, the saints upon earth, and the souls of the righteous under the earth. And the fourth, viz. God, the Word Incarnate, passed in honour through the Virgin's womb; and creating our Adam anew, he passed through the gates of heaven, and became the first-fruits of the resurrection and of the ascension for all.

The cub of the lion is stronger than the beasts: i.e., Christ as prophesied of by Jacob in the person of Judah. A cock walking with high spirit among his dames: such was Paul, when preaching boldly among the churches the word of the Christ of God. A goat heading the herd: such is He who was offered for the sins of the world. And a king speaking among the people: so Christ reigns over the nations, and speaks by prophets and apostles the word of truth.

That is one confirmed in wickedness. The apostle, too, says, Them that sin, rebuke before all; that is to say, all but reprobate. Who are meant by the conies, but we ourselves, who once were like hogs, walking in all the filthiness of the world; but now, believing in Christ, we build our houses upon the holy flesh of Christ as upon a rock?

The shaking (of the earth) signifies the change of things upon earth.— Sin, then, which in its own nature is a slave, has reigned in the mortal body of men: once, indeed, at the time of the flood; and again in the time of the Sodomites, who, not satisfied with what the land yielded, offered violence to strangers; and a third time in the case of hateful Egypt, which, though it obtained in Joseph a man who distributed food to all, that they might not perish of famine, yet did not take well with his prosperity, but persecuted the children of Israel. The handmaid casting out her mistress: i.e., the Church of the Gentiles, which, though itself a slave and a stranger to the promises, cast out the free-born and lordly synagogue, and became the wife and bride of Christ. By Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, the whole earth is moved. The fourth it cannot bear: for He came first by lawgivers, and secondly by prophets, and thirdly by the Gospel, manifesting Himself openly; and in the fourth instance He shall come as the Judge of the living and the dead, whose glory the whole creation will not be able to endure.
