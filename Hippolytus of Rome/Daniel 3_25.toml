Tell me, Nebuchadnezzar, when did you see the Son of God, that you should confess that this is the Son of God? And who stirred your heart, that you should utter such a phrase? And with what eyes were you able to look into this light? And why was this manifest to you alone and to none of the satraps around you? Thus it is written, “The heart of a king is in the hand of God,” and of God is here, whereby the Word stirred his heart, so that he might recognize him in the furnace and glorify him. And this idea of ours is not without good ground … the Scripture showed beforehand that the Gentiles would recognize him incarnate, whom, while not incarnate, Nebuchadnezzar saw and recognized of old in the furnace and acknowledged to be the Son of God.
