O power of the voice, arousing the four days’ dead as from sleep and bringing forth from the grave as well loosed and swiftly running the one who was bound with grave bands. Give your attention, beloved, to the voice, and you will find him to be the Word that spoke at the creation.… “Lazarus, come forth,” and the dead arose, and he who had reached the fourth day was equal to one who had not died at all. “Lazarus, come forth,” and the soul was drawn up from the realms below … and joyfully recognized its own dwelling.
