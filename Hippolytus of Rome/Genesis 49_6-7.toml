Read the gospel and you will find it written down; the scribes were from the tribe of Simeon, and the high priests from that of Levi. Since the decision to arrest the Christ and to execute him was taken in their council, the prophet foreknowing that said, “O my soul, come not into their council!” In this passage he talks about the council where they took their decisions by searching for a reason through which they might accuse Christ, so that “they took counsel together in order to arrest Jesus by stealth and kill him.” And Isaiah says the same: “Woe to their soul, for they have devised an evil counsel against themselves, saying, ‘Let us bind the just one, for he is burdensome to us.’ ”
