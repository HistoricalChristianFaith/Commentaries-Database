He who loves truth, and never utters a false word with his mouth, may say, “I have chosen the way of truth.”  Moreover, he who always sets the judgments of God before his eyes, and remembers them in every action, will say, “Thy judgments have I not forgotten.” And how is our heart enlarged by trials and afflictions! For these pluck out the thorns of anxious thoughts within us, and enlarge the heart for the reception of the divine laws. For, says he, “in affliction Thou hast enlarged me.” Then do we walk in the way of God’s commandments, well prepared for it by the endurance of trials.
