For He, having risen, and being desirous to show that that same (body) had been raised which had also died, when His disciples were in doubt, called Thomas to Him, and said, "Reach hither; handle me, and see: for a spirit hath not bone and flesh, as ye see me have."

He calls him, then, “the firstfruits of them that sleep,” as the “first-begotten of the dead.” For he, having risen and wanting to show that that same [body] had been raised that had also died, when his disciples were in doubt, called Thomas to him and said, “Reach here. Handle me, and see. For a spirit does not have bone and flesh, as you see me have.” In calling him the firstfruits, he testified to that which we have said, that is, that the Savior, taking to himself the flesh out of the same lump, raised this same flesh and made it the firstfruits of the flesh of the righteous, in order that all we who have believed in the hope of the risen one may have the resurrection in expectation.
