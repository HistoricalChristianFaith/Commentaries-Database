Beloved, see how the prophet predicted the washing of baptism. For the person who comes to the washing of regeneration with faith, renounces the devil, joins himself to Christ, denies the enemy, confesses that Christ is God, puts off the bondage and puts on the adoption is the one who emerges from the baptism “as bright as the sun,” shining with beams of righteousness and, most importantly, returns a child of God and a joint heir with Christ.
