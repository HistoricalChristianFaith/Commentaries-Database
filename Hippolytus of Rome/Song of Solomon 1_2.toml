When it says “your breasts are better than wine,” it signifies that the commandments of Christ delight the heart like wine. For, as infants suck upon breasts in order to extract some milk, so also all who suck on the law and the gospel obtain the commandments as eternal food. - "Treatise on the Song of Songs 2.3"
