This Joakim who lived in Babylon took Susanna as his wife. She was the daughter of Hilkiah, the priest who had found the Book of the Law in the house of the Lord when King Josiah had ordered him to purify the holy of holies. His brother is Jeremiah the prophet, who, like those who remained after the deportation of the people to Babylon, went to Egypt and lived in Taphne, where he was stoned to death by them while he was prophesying. Susanna, being of the priestly line, of the tribe of Levi, intermarried with the tribe of Judah, thus in herself joining these two righteous tribes from whom the righteous seed of Christ would appear, and thus he who was born from them in Bethlehem was manifested as a priest of God. Matthew, in fact, wanting to follow the pure and untainted genealogy along the line of Joseph, when he reached Josiah, omitted his five sons and mentioned Jeconiah, who was born in Babylon from Susanna, passing over one righteous seed in favor of another righteous seed. It says, in fact, “Josiah begat Jeconiah and his siblings at the time of the deportation of Babylon.”

It is opportune to ask how those who were captives and had been enslaved by the Babylonian could gather together in the same place as if they were free. It must be known that after he deported them, Nebuchadnezzar dealt with them in a humane way and permitted them to meet together and to do all things according to the law.
