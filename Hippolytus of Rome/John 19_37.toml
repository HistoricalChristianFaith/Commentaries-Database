“In their anger they killed men, in their passion they hamstrung a bull.” This he says regarding the conspiracy into which they were to enter against the Lord.… By the “strong bull” he means Christ whom “they hamstrung,” since, when he was suspended on the tree, they pierced through his sinews. Again, “in their anger they hamstrung a bull.” And mark the appropriateness of the expression when it says, “They killed men, and hamstrung a bull.” For they killed the saints, and they remain dead, awaiting the time of the resurrection. But as a young bull, so to speak, when hamstrung, sinks down to the ground, such was Christ in submitting voluntarily to the death of the flesh. But he was not overcome by death. But though as man he became one of the dead, he remained alive in the nature of divinity. For Christ is the bull—an animal, above all, strong and sleek and devoted to sacred use. And the Son is Lord of all power, who did not sin but rather offered himself for us, a savor of a sweet smell to his God and Father.
