In the eighteenth year, etc. (These words are wanting in the Vulgate, etc.) A considerable space of time having elapsed, therefore, and the eighteenth year being now in its course, the king, calling to mind his vision, made an image of gold, whose height was threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof six cubits. For as the blessed Daniel, in interpreting the vision, had answered the king, saying, You are this head of gold in the image, the king, being puffed up with this address, and elated in heart, made a copy of this image, in order that he might be worshipped by all as God.
