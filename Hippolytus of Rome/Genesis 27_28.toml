If one believes that this blessing was accomplished in Jacob, he is mistaken. Nothing of this ever happened to Jacob. First we find him in Mesopotamia at the service of Laban for twenty years; then he prostrates himself before his brother Esau and tries to make himself pleasing to him by offering presents; after this he goes down to Egypt to avoid starvation with his children. In whom then have the words “Ah, the smell of the clothes of my son is like the smell of a fruitful field that the Lord has blessed” been accomplished? In nobody else but Christ, Son of God. In fact, the field is the world, and the smell of his clothes are all those who believe in him, according to what the apostle says: “We are the aroma of Christ to God among those who are being saved and among those who are perishing; to the one a fragrance from death to death, to the other a fragrance from life to life.” The words “May God give you of the dew of heaven, and of the fatness of the earth, and plenty of grain and wine” signify clearly the Word, who came down from heaven like dew. The earth is the flesh that he has assumed from the Virgin. Through the words “plenty of grain and wine,” the prophet signifies the saints, who are gathered together like the grain in a barn and are justified by the Spirit as by wine.
