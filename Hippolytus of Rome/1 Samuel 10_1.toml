And of all people, we Christians alone are those who â€¦ celebrate the mystery and are anointed there with the unspeakable chrism from a horn, as David (was anointed), not from an earthen vessel, he says, as (was) Saul, who held converse with the evil demon of carnal concupiscence. - "The Refutation of All Heresies 5.4"
