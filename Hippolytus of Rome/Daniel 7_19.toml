It is to the fourth kingdom, of which we have already spoken, that he here refers: that kingdom, than which no greater kingdom of like nature has arisen on the earth, from which also ten horns are to spring and to be apportioned among ten crowns. And amid these another little horn shall rise, which is that of the antichrist. And it shall pluck by the roots the three others before it; that it is to say, he shall subvert the three kings of Egypt, Libya and Ethiopia, with the view of acquiring for himself universal dominion. And after conquering the remaining seven horns, he will at last begin, inflated by a strange and wicked spirit, to stir up war against the saints and to persecute all everywhere, with the aim of being glorified by all and being worshiped as God.
