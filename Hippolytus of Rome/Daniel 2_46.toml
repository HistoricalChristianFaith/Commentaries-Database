Then king Nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face. Nebuchadnezzar hearing these things, and being put in remembrance of his vision, knew that what was spoken by Daniel was true. How great is the power of the grace of God, beloved, that one who a little before was doomed to death with the other wise men of Babylon, should now be worshipped by the king, not as man, but as God! He commanded that they should offer manaa (i.e., in Chaldee, oblation) and sweet odours unto him. Of old, too, the Lord made a similar announcement to Moses, saying, See, I have made you a god to Pharaoh;  in order that, on account of the signs wrought by him in the land of Egypt, Moses might no longer be reckoned a man, but be worshipped as a god by the Egyptians.
