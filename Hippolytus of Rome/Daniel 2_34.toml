You saw till that a stone was cut. You saw, as it were, a stone cut without hands, and smiting the image upon its feet. For the human kingdom was decisively separated from the divine; with reference to which it is written, as it were cut. The stroke, however, smites the extremities, and in these it broke all dominion that is upon earth.
