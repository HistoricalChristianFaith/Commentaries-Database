Aliens properly so called are those who have been despoiled by some enemies or adversaries, and have then become wanderers; a thing which we indeed also endured formerly at the hand of the demons. But from the time that Christ took us up by faith in Him, we are no longer alleges from the true country-the Jerusalem which is above-nor have we to bear alienation in error from the truth.
