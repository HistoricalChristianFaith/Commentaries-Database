“There are four things which are least upon the earth, and these are wiser than the wise: The ants have no strength, yet they prepare their meat in the summer.” And in like manner, the Gentiles by faith in Christ prepare for themselves eternal life through good works. “And the conies [badgers], a feeble folk, have made their houses in the rocks.” The Gentiles, that is to say, are built upon Christ, the spiritual rock, who is become the head of the corner. “The spider [lizard], that supports itself upon its hands, and is easily caught, dwells in the strongholds of kings.” That is, the thief with his hands extended [on the cross], rests on the cross of Christ and dwells in paradise, the stronghold of the three kings—Father, Son and Holy Ghost. “The locust has no king and yet marches out in array as by one command.” The Gentiles had no king, for they were ruled by sin; but now, believing God, they engage in the heavenly warfare. .
