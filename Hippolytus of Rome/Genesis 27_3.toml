The fact that the prophet asks Esau for food by giving him an order signifies the call that the Word addresses to the first people when he asks them for the fruit of the works of justice, that justice which was considered to be a nourishment for the Father. In fact, the words “go out to the field, and hunt game for me” signify worldly life. On the other hand, the fact that he says, “Take your quiver and your bow” shows that the people, inflated with their personal glory, would not be justified by their faith but by being proud of their wars would ask for a tyrant as their king, just as Moses had said to them: “And the sword is your boast.”
