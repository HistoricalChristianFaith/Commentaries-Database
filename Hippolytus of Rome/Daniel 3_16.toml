These three youths are an example to all faithful men, inasmuch as they did not fear the crowd of satraps, neither did they tremble when they heard the kingâ€™s words, nor did they shrink when they saw the flame of the blazing furnace, but deemed all men and the whole world as nothing, and kept the fear of God alone before their eyes.

These three youths have become an example to all faithful men, inasmuch as they did not fear the crowd of satraps, neither did they tremble when they heard the king's words, nor did they shrink when they saw the flame of the blazing furnace, but deemed all men and the whole world as nought, and kept the fear of God alone before their eyes. Daniel, though he stood at a distance and kept silence, encouraged them to be of good cheer as he smiled to them. And be rejoiced also himself at the witness they bore, understanding, as he did, that the three youths would receive a crown in triumph over the devil.
