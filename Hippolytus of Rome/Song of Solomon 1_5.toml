“I am black and beautiful, daughters of Jerusalem.” I am a sinner, but even more, I am beautiful, because Christ loved me. “I am black and beautiful, daughters of Jerusalem.” All nations, come and gather and look at me, the beloved. “Do not marvel at my countenance because I am darkened or because the sun’s glance has made me swarthy.” … Nor is it because Christ has despised me, since [Scripture] calls him the true sun, for it says, “And the sun of righteousness will appear to you who fear my name.”
