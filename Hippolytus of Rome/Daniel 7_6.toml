And, lo, another beast like a leopard. In mentioning a leopard, he means the kingdom of the Greeks, over whom Alexander of Macedon was king. And he likened them to a leopard, because they were quick and inventive in thought, and bitter in heart, just as that animal is many-coloured in appearance, and quick in wounding and in drinking man's blood.

The beast had also four heads. When the kingdom of Alexander was exalted, and grew, and acquired a name over the whole world, his kingdom was divided into four principalities. For Alexander, when near his end, partitioned his kingdom among his four comrades of the same race, viz., Seleucus, Demetrius, Ptolemy, and Philip; and all these assumed crowns, as Daniel prophesies, and as it is written in the first book of Maccabees.
