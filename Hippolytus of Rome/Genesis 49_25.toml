By adding and saying “Because of the blessing of the womb of your father and your mother” the prophet proclaims in advance a spiritual mystery. He could have said, “Because of the blessing of the womb of your mother,” in order to indicate with this expression Mary, in whose womb the Word was borne for nine months. Well, this is not what he said; on the contrary he said, “Because of the blessing of the womb of your father and your mother.” By uniting these two things, he made them one, in order that it might be clearly understood that to this person belongs what is according to spirit and what is according to flesh. The Word took his origin from a father’s heart; … rightly the Father said through the prophet, “My heart has uttered a good Word.” On the other hand, according to flesh he took his origin in the latter times from a virginal womb after he was borne in it for nine months, so that he might appear to be visible as he was born a second time from a mother’s womb. And therefore he himself said through the prophet, “And thus said the Lord that formed me from the womb to be his own servant.” And through Jeremiah [the Father] said, “Before I formed you in the womb [of your mother], I knew you, and before you came forth from the womb, I sanctified you.” Since the Word was begotten both according to spirit and flesh and was actually both God and man, with good reason the prophet [Jacob] has used the word womb for a father and a mother; and this might seem to be ridiculous to somebody, if it were not understood this way. In fact, the term womb can be suitably referred only to the female nature. But here he has said, “Because of the blessing of the womb of your father and mother,” so that you might correctly understand that the Word is begotten from two substances, that of God and that of the Virgin.
