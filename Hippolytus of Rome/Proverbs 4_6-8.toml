What is meant by “exalt her”? Surround her with holy thoughts, for you have need of larger defense, since there are many things to imperil such a possession. But if it is in our power to fortify her, and if there are virtues in our power which exalt the knowledge of God, these will be her bulwarks, as, for example: practice, study, and the whole chain of other virtues. The one who observes these honors wisdom, and the reward is to be exalted with her and to be embraced by her in the chamber of heaven.
