He who knows the wisdom of God, receives from Him also instruction, and learns by it the mysteries of the Word; and they who know the true heavenly wisdom will easily understand the words of these mysteries. Wherefore he says: “To understand the difficulties of words;” for things spoken in strange language by the Holy Spirit become intelligible to those who have their hearts right with God.
