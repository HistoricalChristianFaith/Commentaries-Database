My inwards are turned (A. V., my sorrows are turned upon me). For it was meet that, at the appearing of the Lord, what was above should be turned beneath, in order that also what was beneath might come above.— I require time, he says, to recover myself, and to be able to endure the words and to make reply to what is said.— But while I was in this position, he continues, I was strengthened beyond my hope. For one unseen touched me, and straightway my weakness was removed, and I was restored to my former strength. For whenever all the strength of our life and its glory pass from us, then are we strengthened by Christ, who stretches forth His hand and raises the living from among the dead, and as it were from Hades itself, to the resurrection of life.
