Prove now your servants. They teach that it is not earthly meats that give to men their beauty and strength, but the grace of God bestowed by the Word. And after a little. You have seen the incorruptible faith of the youths, and the unalterable fear of God. They asked an interval of ten days, to prove therein that man cannot otherwise find grace with God than by believing the word preached by the Lord.
