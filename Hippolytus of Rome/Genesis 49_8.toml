Who are the brothers who praised and adored him but the apostles, to whom the Lord said, “Are you my brothers and coheirs?” And then to say, “Your hands are on the back of your enemies” can mean either of two things: by simply stretching his hands [on the cross] Christ was able, in the course of the fight against his enemies, to triumph over [invisible] powers. Or he has become the Lord and Master and Judge of all those who were his enemies according to the flesh, after being set in this role by the Father.

But, one may say, why did it seem right to the prophet to impose on Judah such a blessing, when he had done nothing like that for the first ones? Now learn the reason …. In fact David had to be born from the tribe of Judah and Christ from David with regard to the flesh. [Therefore] the prophet foreknowing the future events in their spiritual sense has blessed there David, who descended from Judah, and the Christ who, according to the flesh, had to be born from David, so that he might receive from God not only the blessing according to the spirit but also the blessing according to the flesh.
