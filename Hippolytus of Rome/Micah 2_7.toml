“He was clothed in a vesture dipped in blood. And his name is called the Word of God.” See then, my brothers, how the vesture sprinkled with blood denoted in symbol the flesh, through which the impassible Word of God underwent suffering, as the prophets testify. For thus speaks the blessed Micah: “Should this be said, O house of Jacob? Is the Spirit of the Lord impatient? Are these his doings? Do not my words do well to him who walks uprightly? But you rise against my people as an enemy; you strip the robe from the peaceful.” This refers to Christ’s suffering in the flesh.
