And who is the one standing “above the water” other than this very one, concerning whom these very prophets had proclaimed long ago, who at the end of time was about to be attested to by the Father at the Jordan river and to be shown boldly to the people by John, who wore the band of a scribe around his loins and the linen and was clad in an intricate long robe? The two men saw him and asked him because “all rule and authority was given” to him. Hence they asked from him more precisely when he would bring the world to judgment and when the things he had spoken would be fulfilled. But he wished to persuade these men in every manner and lifted up “his right hand and his left hand to heaven and swore by the living One forever.” Who swore, and by whom did he swear? The Son swore by the Father, when he said that the Father lives “forever.” Most surely, “they will know all these things when the scattering will be accomplished in a time, times and half a time.”
