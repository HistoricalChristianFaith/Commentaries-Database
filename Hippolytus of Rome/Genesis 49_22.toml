The prophet has blessed Joseph more than all his brothers, because he contemplated the mysteries which, having been prefigured in him, would be fulfilled in Christ. Therefore Jacob did not praise Joseph but the one who was symbolized by Joseph. In fact, he says to him, “My son is increased, Joseph,” because thanks to his kingly and perfect name the grace of Christ has increased and has become abundant in the world.
