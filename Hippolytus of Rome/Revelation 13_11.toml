Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast; for if is the number of a man, and his number is six hundred threescore and six."

By the beast coming up out of the earth, he means the kingdom of antichrist; and by the two horns he means him and the false prophet after him. And in speaking of “the horns being like a lamb,” he means that he will make himself like the Son of God and set himself forward as king. The term “he spoke like a dragon” means that he is a deceiver and not truthful.
