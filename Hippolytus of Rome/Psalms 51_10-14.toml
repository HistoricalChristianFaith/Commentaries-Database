This is the Spirit who at the beginning “moved on the face of the waters”; by whom the world moves; by whom creation consists and all things have life; who also worked mightily in the prophets2 and descended in flight on Christ. This is the Spirit who was given to the apostles in the form of fiery tongues. This is the Spirit who David sought when he said, “Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within me.” Of this Spirit Gabriel also spoke to the Virgin, “The Holy Spirit shall come upon you, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow you.” By this Spirit Peter spoke that blessed word, “You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.” By this Spirit the rock of the church was established. This is the Spirit, the Comforter, who is sent because of you, that he may show you8 to be the Son of God.
