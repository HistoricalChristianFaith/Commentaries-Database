Are the words spoken there by the blessed Isaac meant either as a blessing or as a prophecy? It is necessary to understand the previous statement. This is what he says: “By the fatness of the earth shall your dwelling be, and by the dew of heaven above.” In fact, it happens that the people settled down in the land of the Canaanites, which they shared with Joshua, son of Nun. And the words of Isaac “and by the dew of heaven above” signify that the prophets, like a cloud, left them soaked in dew after revealing to them the oracles of God.
