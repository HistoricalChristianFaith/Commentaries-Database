Listening to these words, the blessed Susanna was troubled in her heart and set a watch on her mouth since she did not want to be contaminated by the impious elders. It is possible to truly understand what happened to Susanna, you see, since you find the same thing fulfilled now also with the church. When, in fact, the two peoples come to an agreement in order to corrupt some of the saints, they wait for the appropriate moment and then penetrate into the house of God, while all are praying and singing hymns to God, and they drag outside some of those they seize, saying, “Come, consent with us and worship our gods; otherwise we will denounce you.” If they do not consent, they drag them before the court and accuse them of acting contrary to the law of Caesar and condemn them to death.
