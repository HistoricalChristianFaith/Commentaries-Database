We read in Isaiah that the Spirit of the Lord descended upon the Lord Jesus, “the Spirit of wisdom and understanding, the Spirit of counsel and strength, the Spirit of knowledge and piety.” It is in reference to this same Spirit of the Lord who descended upon the Savior in a holy outpouring that the Son said through Isaiah, “The Spirit of the Lord is upon me,” and that Matthew the Evangelist said, “Behold, the heavens opened, and he saw the Spirit of God descending upon him like a dove.” Luke the Evangelist, moreover, clearly teaches that the Spirit of God whom the Savior received in baptism is the Holy Spirit: “Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan.”
