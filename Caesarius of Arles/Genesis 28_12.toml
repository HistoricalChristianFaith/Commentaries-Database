Now if Jacob sleeping on the ground prefigured the Lord, why is it that the Lord in heaven rested and leaned upon the ladder? How was Christ the Lord seen on top of the ladder in heaven and in blessed Jacob on the ground? Listen to Christ himself say that he is in heaven and on earth: “No one has ascended into heaven except him who has descended from heaven: the Son of Man who is in heaven.” Notice that the Lord himself said he is both in heaven and on earth. We confess, dearly beloved, that Christ the Lord is head of the church; if this is true, he is in heaven with regard to the head but on earth as far as the body is concerned. Moreover, when the blessed apostle Paul was persecuting the church, Christ exclaimed from heaven: “Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me?” He did not say, “Why do you persecute my servants?” Nor did he say, “Why do you persecute my members?” But he said, “Why do you persecute me?” Now the tongue cries out if the foot is stepped on, You stepped on me, even though the tongue cannot be stepped on at all; through the harmony of charity the head cries out for all the members. Therefore Jacob was sleeping and saw the Lord leaning on the top of the ladder. What does it mean to lean on the ladder, except to hang on the cross? Consider, brothers, that while hanging upon the wood of the cross he prayed for the Jews, and you will realize who shouted from heaven while leaning on the ladder of Jacob. But why did this happen on the road, before Jacob obtained a wife? Because our Lord, the true Jacob, first leaned on the ladder, that is, the cross, and afterward formed a church for himself. At the time he gave it the wages of his blood, intending to give it later the dowry of his kingdom.

Listen and see the sublimity of the fact that Jacob asleep and the Lord leaning on the ladder prefigured Christ. Indeed, when our Savior in speaking of Nathanael had named blessed Jacob, he said, “Behold, an Israelite in whom there is no guile.” Continuing, he said, “Presently you shall see heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man.” In the Gospels our Lord preached concerning himself what Jacob had seen prefigured in his sleep: “You shall see heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man.” If the angels of God were descending to the Son because he was on earth, how is it that those same angels were ascending to the Son of man except because he is in heaven? Therefore he himself was sleeping in Jacob, and from heaven he likewise called to Jacob.

“All these things,” as the apostle proclaims, brothers, “happened to them as a type, and they were written for us upon whom the final age of the world has come.” Carefully notice, brothers, how the angels of God ascend to the Son of man in heaven and descend to the same Son on earth. When God’s preachers announce deep and profound truths from sacred Scripture, which are understood only by devout men, they ascend to the Son of man; when they preach matters pertaining to the correction of morals, which all the people can understand, they descend to the son of man. Thus the apostle says, “Wisdom we speak among those who are mature, yet not a wisdom of this world nor of the rulers of this world, but a secret, hidden wisdom which God foreordained before the world to our glory.” When the apostle said these words doubtless he was ascending to the Son of man. However, when he said, “Flee immorality”; when he said, “do not be drunk with wine, for in that is debauchery”;38 when he declared, “covetousness is the root of all evils,” in these words he descended like the angel of God to the Son of man. When he further said, “Mind the things that are above, not the things that are on earth,” he was ascending. However, when he taught, “Be sober, and do not sin,” and preached the other truths that pertain to the correction of morals, he was descending; ministering the milk of doctrine like a nurse to children, he spoke words that even the ignorant could grasp. In this manner, then, there is ascending and descending to the Son of man, since solid food is offered to the perfect while the milk of doctrine is not denied even to the young. Blessed John also was ascending when he said, “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God; and the Word was God;” by these words he ascended on high sufficiently. However, since God’s angels not only ascend but also descend, bending down he says to the little ones, “The Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us.”
