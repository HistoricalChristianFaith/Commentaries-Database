There is only one true high priest, as Scripture says, of whom the high priest Aaron presented a figure. For this reason his rod blossomed. Just as Aaron’s rod sprouted among the Jewish people, so the cross of Christ flowered among the Gentiles. However, since Christ is the true high priest, as we have often said, he is the only one whose rod of the cross not only sprouted but also blossomed and produced the fruit of all believers.What is the fruit which it bore? “Ripe almonds.” Almonds are nuts, brethren. This fruit is bitter indeed in its first covering, is protected and defended by the second, but in the third part [it] feeds and nourishes whoever eats it. Such then is knowledge of the law and the prophets in Christ’s church. The first appearance of the letter is quite bitter, because it commands circumcision of the flesh, enjoins sacrifices and ordains other things which are designated as the killing letter. Throw away all these things as the bitter shell of the nut. In the second place, you will come to the protective covering, in which is indicated moral doctrine or the idea of self-restraint. This is necessary for the protection of what is kept inside but doubtless must sometimes be broken and destroyed. For example, fasting and chastisement of the body are no doubt necessary as long as we are in this corruptible body which is subject to suffering. However, when it has been destroyed and dissolved at the approach of death, it will become incorruptible at the time of the resurrection when it has been restored from corruption, spiritual after being natural, and without any flattery to the body will dominate, with no difficult suffering or propitiatory fasting but by its own nature. Thus then that rather hard covering of the nut seems to be a means of self-control at present that will not be sought later. Third, you will find hidden as in the nut the secret meaning of the mysteries of God’s wisdom and knowledge. With these, holy souls are nourished and fed not only in the present life but also in the future one. This is that priestly fruit concerning which it is promised to those “who hunger and thirst for justice, for they shall be satisfied.”
