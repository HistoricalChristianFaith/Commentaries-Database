Isaiah, too, includes one Holy Spirit in the glory of the Trinity when he says, “I saw the Lord seated on a high throne; seraphim were stationed above and cried one to the other, “Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts!” And in a following passage he says, “I heard the voice of the Lord saying, ‘Go and say to this people: Listen carefully, but you shall not understand! Look intently, but you shall see nothing!’ ”
