The servant brought gold earrings and gold bracelets and gave them to Rebekah. Those gold earrings signify the divine words; the gold bracelets signify good works, because works are designated by the hands. Let us observe, brothers, how Christ also gave these gifts to the church. For this reason the servant brought gold earrings for adorning Rebekah’s face, while Christ put into the church’s ears divine words that are of greater value than all pearls. The servant put bracelets on Rebekah’s wrists, while Christ put good works into the church’s hands. Consider, dearly beloved, and rejoice, giving thanks to God because what was prefigured in them has been fulfilled in us by Christ’s gift. Moreover, just as Rebekah could not have had the earrings or bracelets if Isaac had not sent them through his servant, so also the church could not have had divine words in her ears or good works in her hands if Christ by his grace and through his apostles had not conferred them. Furthermore, the fact that the girl, when asked by her parents whether she wished to go with the servant, replied, “I am going”— this we see clearly fulfilled in the church. There Rebekah’s will is asked; here the church’s will is sought. To Rebekah it is said, “Are you willing to go with this man?” And she replied, “I am going.” To the church it is said, “Do you believe in Christ?” And it replies, “I do believe.” Rebekah would not be led to Isaac if she did not say, “I am going”; neither would the church be joined to Christ if it did not say, “I believe.”
