For our part, beloved brothers, when we recognize our kind Redeemer and reflect on our price, let us not love “the world or the things that are in the world”; but according to the apostle, “having food and sufficient clothing, with these let us be content.” Let us seek the use of what is necessary but not have greedy desires. If we lack riches, let us not seek them in the world by evil deeds or unjust gains. However, if we have them, let us transmit them to heaven by good works, so that there may be fulfilled in us what is written: “Lavishly he gives to the poor; his generosity shall endure forever”; with the help of our Lord Jesus Christ, who lives and reigns forever and ever. Amen.
