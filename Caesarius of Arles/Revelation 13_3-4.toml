That which “seemed wounded” are the heretics who hypocritically seem to confess Christ and blaspheme since they do not believe as the catholic faith has it. They prophesy that he who was wounded is also raised again, for even Satan himself transfigures himself into an angel of light. Another interpretation might be that heresies are wounded by the catholics, for they are suppressed by the testimonies of the Scriptures. Yet, as though a wound of Satan they are revived and accomplish the works of Satan and do not cease from blaspheming and attracting whomever they can to his teachings.… [The dragon gave his power to the beast], for indeed the heretics possess power, especially the Arians. … “And they adored the beast, saying, ‘Who is like the beast, and who can fight against it?’ ” To be sure, the heretics flatter themselves that no one believes better than they and that no one can conquer their people who are marked by the name of the beast. And it will be given to him by the devil himself, although with God’s permission, that he should speak haughty things and blasphemies, as the apostle says, “There must be heresies in order that those who are genuine among you may be manifested.”
