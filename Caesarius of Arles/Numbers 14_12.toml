Now the Lord said to Moses, “I will strike them with death and wipe them out. Then I will make the house of your father a nation, greater and mightier than they.” This threat is not a sign of wrath but a prophecy. Another nation was to be taken over, that is, the people of the Gentiles, but not through Moses. Moses excused himself, for he knew that the great nation which was promised was not to be called through him but through Jesus Christ. Those people would not be called Mosaic but Christian.
