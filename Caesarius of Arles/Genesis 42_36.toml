Now notice a still greater wonder and see how blessed Joseph, who knew that his father suffered intolerable sorrow on his account, as if what he had endured before were not enough, now causes Benjamin to be taken from him. Surely by this act he knew that his father would suffer increased grief. I do not believe that all these things happened without the dispensation of the Holy Spirit. God, whose judgments are often hidden but never unjust and who refused to notify blessed Jacob that his son was living, likewise did not allow holy Joseph to declare his glory to his father. Rather, as was said, by keeping Simeon in bonds and taking away Benjamin, he increased the distress of his father. If we heed these facts devoutly and carefully, dearly beloved, we realize that God acted with great mercy. Since the beginning of the world he has done to his saints what he fulfilled in blessed Jacob with great kindness. However, notice carefully why this happened.Although servants and friends of God have avoided capital sins and perform many good works, still we do not believe that they have been without slight offenses, because God does not lie when he says, “Not even an infant one day old upon the earth is without sin.” Moreover, blessed John the Evangelist, who surely was not inferior to holy Jacob in merits, proclaims, “If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.” Furthermore, we read elsewhere: “The just man falls seven times and rises again.” Therefore, since blessed Jacob could not be without those slight sins, as was already said, God wanted to consume those small offenses in this world by the fire of tribulation. Thus was fulfilled in him what God said through the Holy Spirit: “As the test of what the potter molds is in the furnace, so in his conversation is the test of a man.” Moreover, “God scourges every son whom he received,” and “through many tribulations we must enter the kingdom of God.” Therefore, in order that our God might present holy Jacob as purified gold at the future judgment, he first removed all the stains of sin from him, so that the other fiery witness might be able to find in him nothing to burn.
