The office of a bishop is a good work, dearest brethren, as the blessed apostle says, “Whoever wants to be a bishop aspires to a noble task.” Now when “task” is heard, labor is understood. Therefore whoever desires the office of bishop with this understanding wants it without the arrogance of ambition. To express this more clearly, if a man wants not so much to be in authority over the people of God as to help them, he aspires to be a bishop in the true spirit.
