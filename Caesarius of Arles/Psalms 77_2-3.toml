Notice, too, what the psalmist said. When he told them, “On the day of my distress I sought God,” he also added, “My hands were stretched out”; further, “by night” and also “before him.” What is distress? What does it mean to stretch out one’s hands, and what does it mean to do so before God? There is distress when we suffer annoyances and stretching out of hands [when we engage] in good deeds. Searching by night occurs in this world when the truth has not yet shed light. This world will certainly come to an end and will meet Christ [in judgment]. And when Christ comes, he will be like the sun shining in the hearts of all people. Why did he add “before him”? The person who stretches out his hands performs good deeds. However, the person who thus performs good deeds in order to please people does not do so before God; that is, in order to please him rather than human beings. Quite rightly, then, “I was not deceived” follows; a person who has sought God in this way [may say,] “I have not been deceived.” He has found what he was seeking, and therefore he has told us, “Ask, seek, knock.”
