Therefore Isaac took Rebekah “and led her into the tent of his mother.” Christ also took the church and established it in place of the synagogue.… As the apostle says, by pride “the branches” of the olive tree “have been broken off,” in order that the lowly wild olive may be engrafted. For this reason Isaac took Rebekah, “and because he loved her he was consoled for the loss of his mother.” Christ took the church and loved it so much that by this very love he tempered the grief that was occasioned by the death of his mother, the synagogue. Indeed, just as the synagogue’s lack of faith caused Christ sorrow, so the church’s faith produced joy in him.… Moreover, dearly beloved, because from us Christ the Lord prepared for himself a spiritual spouse that, as I said, he even redeemed with his precious blood. Therefore, with his help, each one of us should not only guard the benefits conferred … by divine gift but also should strive to increase them. Thus there will appear to [that one] nothing sordid because of luxury, nothing puffed up with pride or consumed with anger, nothing blind with avarice or struck with the snakelike poison of envy. Truly it is right that our spouse, “fairer in beauty than the sons of men,” should find in us none of the above-mentioned sins to offend the eyes of his majesty. To him, together with the Father and the Holy Spirit, is honor and might forever. Amen.
