quote='''
If you acknowledge your sins, God will forgive you. So, let no one despair, but, likewise, let no one entertain presumptuous hope. The one who believes that even if he does penance for his sins the divine mercy will not forgive him wrongly despairs, while one who defers the remedy of repentance to a much later day is presumptuous.
