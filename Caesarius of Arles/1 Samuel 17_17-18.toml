Just as this happened, then, in the blessed patriarchs, Isaac and Jacob, dearest brothers, so we know it was prefigured in Jesse the father of David; for when he sent his son David to look for his brothers, he seems to have typified God the Father. Jesse sent David to search for his brother, and God sent his only-begotten Son of whom it is written: “I will proclaim your name to my brothers.” Truly, Christ had come to seek his brothers, for he said, “I was not sent except to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.”4“And Jesse said to David his son, ‘Take an ephah of flour, and ten little cheeses, and go see your brothers.’ ” An ephah, brothers, is a quantity of three measures, and in three measures is understood the mystery of the Trinity. Blessed Abraham knew this mystery well; for when he merited to perceive the mystery of the Trinity in the three persons under the holm-oak of Mamre, he ordered three measures of flour to be mixed. It is three measures, and for this reason Jesse gave this amount to his son. In the ten little cheeses we recognize the decalogue of the Old Testament. Thus, David came with the three measures and ten cheeses, in order to visit his brothers who were in battle, because Christ was to come with the decalogue of the law and the mystery of the Trinity to free the human race from the power of the devil.
