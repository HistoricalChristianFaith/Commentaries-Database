Our Savior, dearly beloved, has ascended into heaven; therefore let us not be disturbed on earth. Let our spirit be in heaven, and peace will be here. Meanwhile let us ascend with Christ in heart, and when his promised day comes, we shall also follow in body. Nevertheless, we ought to know that pride or avarice or dissipation did not ascend with Christ. No vice of ours ascended with our physician. And for this reason, if we desire to ascend and follow the physician, let us strive here to lay aside our vices and sins. For all of our iniquities surround us as if with chains, and they strive to bind us in the network of our sins. Therefore with God’s help, according to what the psalmist says, “Let us break their chains.” Then we will be able to say to the Lord with assurance, “You have loosed my bonds, to you will I offer sacrifice of thanksgiving.” The resurrection of the Lord is our hope; his ascension is our glory.
