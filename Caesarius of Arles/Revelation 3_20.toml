If an earthly king or the head of a family invited you to his birthday celebration, with what kind of garments would you endeavor to adorn yourself when you approached? Surely with new and shining ones, costly ones, whose age or cheapness or ugliness could not offend the eyes of the one who invited you. Therefore, with Christ’s help, strive as much as you can with a like zeal, so that your soul may with an easy conscience approach the solemn feast of the eternal king, that is, the birthday of our Lord and Savior, if it is adorned with the decoration of various virtues. Let it be adorned with the jewels of simplicity and the flowers of temperance, gleaming chastity, shining charity and joyful almsgiving. For if Christ the Lord recognizes that you are celebrating his birthday with such dispositions, he himself will deign to come and not only visit your soul but also rest and continually dwell in it. As it is written, “I will dwell with them and walk among them”; and again, “Here I stand, knocking at the door; if anyone rises up and opens the door, I will enter his house and have supper with him, and he with me.” How happy is the soul which, with God’s help, has striven to direct his life in such a way that he may merit receiving Christ as his guest and indwelling person.
