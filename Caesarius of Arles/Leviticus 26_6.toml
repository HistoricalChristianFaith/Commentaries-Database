“I will rid your country of ravenous beasts and keep war from sweeping across your land.” There are many fights which pass over our land, if we do not observe the law of God and keep his commands. Let each one return to his own soul or conscience and examine himself with interior recollection. Let him see how our land, that is, our body, is oppressed at one time by the spirit of fornication, at another by anger or fury. Again it is disturbed by the darts of avarice or struck by the javelins of envy; then it is darkened by the vice of pride. In whatever way the flesh lusts against the spirit or the spirit against the flesh, our land is agitated by exceedingly dangerous battles. Therefore, if a man observes the divine commands, by the Holy Ghost brings his body into subjection, keeps God’s precepts and fulfills them, he suffers this fight and war less or endures them in such a way that he is victorious. Indeed, God takes them away from his land and does not allow them to pass over the land, that is, the soul of the just.

After this we read, “I will rid your country of ravenous beasts.” These material beasts are not entirely evil or wholly good but rather in between, for they are mute animals. However, those other beasts are spiritual evils, and the apostle calls them “spiritual forces of wickedness on high.” That is the evil beast of which Scripture says, “The serpent was more cunning than all the beasts on earth.” This is the evil beast which God promises to drive out of our land if we keep his commandments. Do you also wish to see another evil beast? Listen to the apostle Peter: “Your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, goes about seeking someone to devour. Resist him, steadfast in the faith.” Under a vision in the desert which he entitled that of the quadrupeds, the prophet Isaiah spoke in a prophetic spirit concerning beasts: “The lion and the young of the lion are in tribulation. Here spring up the flying basilisks which carry their riches upon asses and camels to a people whose help is futile and vain.” Can these words in any way seem to have been said with regard to corporeal beasts, in the minds of those who are very fond of the letter? How can the lion, the young of the lion or the flying basilisk carry the riches upon asses and camels? However, the prophet enumerates the opposing powers of the most wicked demons, by the Holy Ghost seeing them put the riches of their deceits upon asses and camels, that is, upon souls that are stupid and mindful of nothing else except bodily pleasure. Thus he designates them figuratively, comparing them with camels and asses. Lest he be delivered to these beasts, the Godfearing soul prays to the Lord: “Give not to the vulture the life of your dove.”

Then follow the words “and I will establish peace in your lands.” What peace does God give? The peace which the world possesses? Christ says he does not give that kind of peace, for he declares, “Peace I leave with you, my peace I give to you; not as this world gives peace do I give to you.” Therefore he denies that he will give the peace of the world to his disciples. Do you want to see then what peace God gives in our land? If the land is good so that it produces fruit a hundredfold, sixtyfold or thirtyfold, it will receive from God that peace which the apostle describes: “May the peace of God which surpasses all understanding guard your hearts.”

“You may lie down to rest without anxiety.” Moreover, Solomon says in the book of Proverbs, “When you sit down, you need not be afraid. When you lie down, your sleep will be sweet and you will not be afraid of sudden terror or of the attack of the wicked when it comes.” These words he spoke concerning the just and wise man. Furthermore it is said in blessing, “You may lie down to rest without anxiety.” If you are just, no one can frighten you. If you fear God, you will fear nothing else. “The just man, like a lion, feels sure of himself”; and in the words of David, “I shall not fear the terror of the night,” and so forth. He adds still further: “The Lord is my light and my salvation; whom should I fear? The Lord is my life’s refuge; of whom should I be afraid?” and again, “Though an army encamp against me, my heart will not fear.” Do you see the courage and constancy of the soul that observes the commandments of God?
