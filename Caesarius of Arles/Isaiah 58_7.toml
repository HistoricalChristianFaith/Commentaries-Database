If we carefully heed the fact that Christ hungers in the person of the poor, beloved, it will be profitable for us.â€¦ Listen and see, a coin and a kingdom. What comparison is there, beloved? You give the poor a coin and receive a kingdom from Christ; you bestow a mouthful and are given eternal life; you offer clothes, and Christ grants the forgiveness of your sins.
