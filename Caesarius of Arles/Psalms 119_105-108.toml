If we notice carefully, we will realize that what our Lord said to the blessed apostles also refers to us: “You are the light of the world,” he says, “and no one lights a lamp and puts it under a bushel but on the lampstand, so as to give light to all in the house.” Now, if the head’s bodily eyes refuse to show the way to the rest of the members, the whole body walks in darkness. Similarly, if priests, who seem to have the function of eyes in the body of Christ the head, have been put on a lampstand in the church but are unwilling to shine in God’s house and have ceased to show the light of doctrine to the whole church, it is to be feared that some of the people may become involved in the darkness of error and fall into some abyss of sin. The fact that the Lord said his word is a lamp is not a trite utterance, for we read, “Your word is a lamp to my feet, O Lord.” Now, profits of the present world are understood in the nature of a bushel. Who, indeed, puts a lamp under a bushel, except the person who darkens the light of doctrine with the profits of material advantages and fears to preach the truth lest he have less of the temporal possessions he desires? Thus, a person puts a lamp under a bushel if he prefers material to spiritual gains.
