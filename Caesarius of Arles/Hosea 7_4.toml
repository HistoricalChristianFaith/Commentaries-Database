Although you might marry and in the face of the authority of all the Scriptures never commit adultery, why do you not with God’s grace accept what is lawful? Instead you dare to offend God and commit what is unlawful. I would like to know whether those who have no wives, and neither fear nor blush to commit adultery before they are joined in wedlock, would want their spouses to be violated by adulterers before they come to marriage. Since there is no one who would patiently accept this, why does not each one observe toward his spouse the fidelity he wants observed by her? Why does one desire to take a virgin as his wife, when he himself is corrupted? Why does he wish to be united to a wife who is alive, when he is dead in soul because of adultery, according to what is written: “The soul that sins shall die”? Moreover, the apostle exclaims in terrible words, “God will judge the immoral and adulterers,” and “Adulterers will not possess the kingdom of God.” Furthermore, “They are all adulterers, their hearts like an oven.”
