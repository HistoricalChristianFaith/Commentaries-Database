For this reason, as I have already said, you ought to read and listen to the sacred lessons with such eagerness that you may be able to speak about them and teach them to others in your own homes and elsewhere, wherever you are. As you, like clean animals, ruminate the Word of God by continuous reflection, you may be able to procure useful favor for yourselves, that is, their spiritual meaning, and with God’s help give it to others. Then will be fulfilled in you what is written: “Your cup overflows!” Moreover, you will fulfill what the blessed apostle encourages and advises when he says, “The fact is that whether you eat or drink—whatever you do—you should do all for the glory of God.” If infirmity does not prevent it, fast daily. Hasten to the vigils with cheerful and fervent devotion because of what is written: “O God, my soul yearns for you in the night”; and again: “To you I pray, O Lord; at dawn you hear my voice”; and still further: “At midnight I rise to give thanks to your name, O Lord.” To this our Lord and Savior also exhorts and encourages us when he says in the Gospel: “Be on guard, and pray that you may not undergo the test.” May he himself deign to grant this, to whom are honor and might together with the Father and the Holy Spirit, world without end.
