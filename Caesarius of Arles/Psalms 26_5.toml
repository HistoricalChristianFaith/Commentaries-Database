Do not be malicious toward one another, for the Lord detests this vice, as he says: “I hate the assembly of evildoers.” Let us, then, amend vices of the flesh, dearly beloved, for the sake of beauty of soul, in which there is the image of Christ. I speak the truth, brothers, that if we want to observe all these things, we will also say to the one who is tempting us: Do not persuade me, devil, to defile the image of my God by listening to you. He suffered for me, he was covered with spittle for me, he was struck with blows on the cheek for me, he was scourged for me, he was hung on a cross for me. This the servant of God should say to his tempter: Truly you will not persuade me to do what you are urging.
