[The moon under her feet] refers to the hypocrites and evil Christians which the church has under her feet.… The twelve stars are to be interpreted as the twelve apostles. That the woman is clothed in the sun signifies her hope in the resurrection. For this reason it is written, “then the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father.”
