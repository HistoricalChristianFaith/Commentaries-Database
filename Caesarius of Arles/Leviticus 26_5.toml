I do not consider this as a material blessing, as though the man who observes God’s law will obtain that common bread in abundance. Why not? Do not wicked sinners also eat bread, not only in abundance but even in luxury? Therefore let us look rather to him who says, “I am the living bread that has come down from heaven.” And “he who eats this bread shall live forever.” As we notice that he who said this is the word with which our soul is fed, we realize of what bread it was said by God in blessing that: “You will have food to eat in abundance.” Solomon proclaims something similar concerning the just man, when he says in the book of Proverbs, “When the just man eats, his hunger is appeased, but the souls of the wicked suffer want.” If this is understood only according to the letter, it seems utterly false, for the souls of the wicked eat more greedily and strive for satiety, while the just sometimes even suffer hunger. Finally, Paul was a just man, and he said, “To this very hour we hunger and thirst, and we are naked and buffeted”;8 and again he says, “In hunger and thirst, in fastings often.” How then does Solomon say that the just man eats and satisfies his soul? What we understood before concerning the rain we ought to consider at this point also with regard to the bread. That heavenly bread, that is, the Word of God who said, “I am the living bread,” none but the just eat, to whom it is said, “Taste, and see how good the Lord is.” With what kind of a conscience then do sinners who are defiled by many sins dare to eat?

The wicked man is never secure but is always disturbed and wavering. He is tossed about by every wind of doctrine to deceitful error, by the craft of men. However, the just man who observes God’s law dwells in security on his land, because he governs his body in fear of God and brings it into subjection. His understanding is firm when he says to God, “Strengthen me according to your words, O Lord.” Strengthened, secure and well rooted, he dwells on the earth, founded in faith. His house is not built upon sand but is established on solid ground.
