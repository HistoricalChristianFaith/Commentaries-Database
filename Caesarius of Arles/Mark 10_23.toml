The rich man “went away sad,” as you have heard, and the Lord says: “With what difficulty will they who have riches enter the kingdom of God!” At length the disciples became very sad when they heard this and they said: “If this is so, who then can be saved?” Rich and poor, listen to Christ: I am speaking to God’s people. Most of you are poor, but you too must listen carefully to understand. And you had best listen even more intently if you glory in your poverty. Beware of pride, lest the humble rich surpass you. Beware of wickedness, lest the pious rich confound you. Beware of drunkenness, lest the sober excel you.
