“And I shall give to him a white stone,” that is, the body made white by baptism. “And on the stone is written a new name,” that is, the knowledge of the Son of man. “Which no one knows except him who receives it.” That is, no one knows it except through revelation, and for that reason it is said of the Jews, “For had they known, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.”
