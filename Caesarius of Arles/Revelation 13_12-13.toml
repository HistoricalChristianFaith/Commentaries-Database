Since the church is “heaven,” what is this fire that falls from heaven other than heresies that fall from the church? As it is written, “They went out from us, but they were not of us.” For fire falls from the church whenever heretics leave the church as though fire and persecute the church. Therefore, the beast with the two horns causes the people to worship the image of the beast, that is, the devices of the devil.
