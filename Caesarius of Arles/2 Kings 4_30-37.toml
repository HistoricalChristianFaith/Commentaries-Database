Thus, blessed Elisha came and went up to the chamber, because Christ was to come and ascend the gibbet of the cross. Elisha bent down to revive the child; Christ humbled himself to lift up the world that lay in sin. Elisha further put his eyes on [the child’s] eyes, his mouth on his mouth and his hands on his hands. Consider, brothers, how much that man of full age drew himself together, so that he might fit the little child who lay dead; for what Elisha prefigured in the case of the boy, Christ fulfilled in the entire human race. Listen to the apostle say, “He humbled himself, becoming obedient to death.” Because we were little children, he made himself small; since we lay dead, the kind physician bent down, for, truly, brothers, no one can lift up one who is lying down if he refuses to bend. In the fact that the boy gasped seven times is shown the sevenfold grace of the Holy Spirit that was bestowed on the human race at Christ’s advent in order to restore it to life. Concerning the Spirit the apostle says, “If anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he does not belong to Christ.” Our Lord gave the same Spirit to his disciples when he breathed on them and said, “Receive the Holy Spirit.” Truly, in a way he put his mouth on their mouths when he breathed on them and gave them the Spirit.
