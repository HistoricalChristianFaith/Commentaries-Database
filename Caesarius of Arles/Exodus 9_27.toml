Moreover, as we are wont to sing in the hymn, “God is faithful, without deceit.” For this reason, as I mentioned above, we should believe without any doubt concerning Pharaoh that he became hardened because of God’s patience rather than his power. This fact we know clearly from his own admission, for when he was being punished he confessed in this way as justice compelled him: “The Lord is just; it is I and my subjects who are at fault.” With what feelings then does a Christian complain that God is unjust, when even a wicked king admits that he is just?”
