Perhaps someone may say, Why did God cause Pharaoh to be hardened by sparing him, and why did he remove his scourges? At this point I reply with assurance: God removed his scourges so often because by the immense number of his sins Pharaoh did not merit to be rebuked as a son for the amendment of his life, but like an enemy he was allowed to become hardened. Such great sins of his had preceded, and he had despised God so often with wicked boldness, that in him was fulfilled what the Holy Spirit said concerning such people: “They are free from the burdens of mortals and are not afflicted like the rest of humanity. So pride adorns them as a necklace; as a robe violence clothes them. Out of their crassness comes iniquity.” Behold how a person is hardened if he does not deserve to be chastised by our Lord for his correction. Moreover, what is written concerning those whom God’s mercy does not allow to become hardened? “God scourges every son whom he receives”;28 furthermore, “Those whom I love I rebuke and chastise”; and again, “For whom God loves he reproves.” Concerning this hardening the prophet also exclaims to the Lord in the person of the people: “Why do you harden our hearts so that we do not fear you?” Surely, this is nothing else than: You have abandoned our heart, that we should not be converted to you.
