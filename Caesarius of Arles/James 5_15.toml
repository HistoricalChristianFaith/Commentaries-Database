Whenever some illness comes upon a man, he should hurry back to the church. Let him receive the body and blood of Christ, be anointed by the presbyters with consecrated oil and ask them and the deacons to pray over him in Christâ€™s name. If he does this, he will receive not only bodily health but also the forgiveness of his sins.
