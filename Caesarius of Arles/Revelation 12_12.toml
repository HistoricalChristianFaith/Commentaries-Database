It says “come down” to preserve the allegory. As all are in “heaven,” that is, in the church, which is rightly called heaven, when the devil is thrown out of the saints, he “comes down” to his followers who are the “earth” because of their earthly affection. He is said to be thrown out of heaven, not so that he might come to those who have already been made heaven but because of those who have not become what they might be. For the saints cannot become heaven, unless the devil has been expelled.
