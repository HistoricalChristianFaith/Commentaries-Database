When Samson went in to the harlot, he was impure if he did so without reason, but if he did so as a prophet it is a mystery. If he did not enter in order to lie with the woman, perhaps he did so because of a mystery. We do not read that he was intimate with her.… See how it is not recorded in Scripture that he was united to the harlot whom he had visited, but it is written that he slept.… He took away the city gates through which he had gone in to the harlot and carried them to a mountain. What does this mean? Hell and love for a woman Scripture joins together; the house of the harlot was an image of hell. It is rightly considered as hell, for it rejects no one but draws to itself all who enter. At this point we recognize the actions of our Redeemer. After the synagogue to which he had come was separated from him through the devil, they shaved his head, that is, they crucified him on the site of Calvary, and he descended into hell. Then, his enemies guarded the place where he slept, that is, the sepulcher, and wanted to seize him although they could not see him.… The words “he arose and left at midnight” signify that he arose in secret. He had suffered openly, but his resurrection was revealed only to his disciples and certain other people. Thus, all saw the fact that he went in, but the fact that he arose just a few knew, remembered and felt. Moreover, he removed the city gates. That is, he took away the gates of hell. What does it mean to remove the gates of hell, except to take away the power of death? He took it away and did not return it. Furthermore, what did our Lord Jesus Christ do after he had taken away the gates of death? He went up to the top of a mountain. Truly, we know that he both arose and ascended into heaven.
