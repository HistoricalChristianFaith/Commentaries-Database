O blessed cross, which makes people blessed! O cross, from which such great and wonderful fruits are gathered! The fruit of the cross is a glorious resurrection. This fruit of the wood is truly planted “near running water,” for baptism is always joined to the cross. However, this wood produced “its fruit in due season,” at the Lord’s resurrection. It will do so again when he appears from heaven, “is seen on earth,” and with dazzling sign of the cross preceding him, comes from above.
