I implore, you, dearly beloved, always to call to mind and remember what we have mentioned for the salvation of your soul. Do not accept it only in passing; our sermon ought to fasten its roots in your heart, so that on judgment day it may happily bear the fruits of eternal life. If a person can retain all that we say, he should thank God and always teach others what he remembers. If he cannot remember the whole, let him remember a part of it. If one cannot retain the whole, then let each one remember three or four thoughts. If one then tells another what he heard, by informing each other you can not only remember it all but even with Christ’s help fulfill it in deed. One may say to another, “I heard my bishop talking about chastity.” Another may say, “I remember that he preached on almsgiving.” Still another says, “There has remained in my mind what he said about cultivating our soul like we till our land.” Another may report, “I recall that my bishop said that a person who knows letters should be eager to read sacred Scripture, and one who does not should look for someone and ask him to read God’s precepts to him so that with God’s help he may fulfill what was read.” Again, another may say, “I heard my bishop say that just as merchants who are illiterate hire learned mercenaries so that they may acquire wealth, so Christians should seek, ask and, if necessary, pay for someone to read the sacred Scriptures to them; that just as a trader gets money by having someone else read, so Christians should obtain eternal life in this way.” If you do this and admonish each other, you can both live devoutly in this world and afterwards attain to the bliss of eternal life. If you immediately forget all that you heard from the bishop as soon as you leave church, you have come to church without profit and return to your home empty and without fruit. Far be this from you, brothers; may there rather be fulfilled in you what is written: “Blessed are they who keep judgment and do justice at all times.” Moreover, “The mercy of the Lord is from eternity and to eternity on them that fear him, and his justice to children’s children to such as keep his covenant and are mindful of his commandments, to do them.” May the Lord in his goodness bring you to this mercy.
