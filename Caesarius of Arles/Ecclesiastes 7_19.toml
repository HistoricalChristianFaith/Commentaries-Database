Perhaps a person possesses no bread to extend as an alms to the needy, but still greater is what a person who has a tongue is able to give. It is more important to refresh a mind that will live forever with the food of the word than to satisfy with earthly food the stomach of a body that is going to die. Therefore, brethren, do not take from your neighbors the alms of the word. Paul says, “If we have sown for you spiritual things, is it a great matter if we reap from you carnal things?” “Do good to the just, and you shall find great recompense: and if not of him, assuredly of God.” “It is good that you should hold up the just, and from him withdraw not your hand, for he that fears God neglects nothing.”
