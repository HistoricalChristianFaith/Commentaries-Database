If you watch and seek, the Lord says, “Here I am,” and “If you pass through fire,” I am with you “and the flames shall not consume you.” If you ask through prayer, you will find, and if you knock through giving to the poor, Christ opens the doors to you in order that you may enter and possess paradise. Now if you still think that anything will remain at the end of the world, consider your own end. - "Sermon 158a.i"
