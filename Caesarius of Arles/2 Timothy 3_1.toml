We see his prediction verified to such an extent, dearly beloved, that there is no more fidelity in the fear of God, in laws of justice, in charity or in good works. Blessed Paul foretold this.… Therefore, let us consider, dearly beloved, whether almost the whole world is not filled with these vices. Why?
