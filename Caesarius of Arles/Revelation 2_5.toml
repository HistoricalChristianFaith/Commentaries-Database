Note that he did not say that he “takes away” [the lampstand] but that he “moves.” For the lampstand signifies the one Christian people. Therefore, he says that this lampstand is to be moved, not taken away, so that we might understand that in the very same church the evil are moved and the good confirmed. Moreover, he means that by the hidden but nonetheless just judgment of God, that which is taken from the evil is given as increase to the good. This fulfills that which is written, “He who has, it will be added to him; but to him who has not, even that which he has shall be taken from him.”
