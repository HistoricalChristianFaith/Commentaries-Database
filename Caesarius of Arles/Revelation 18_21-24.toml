Babylon is likened to a great millstone which is thrown down, for the revolving of times, as though it were a millstone, grinds down those who love the world, and it sends them in circles. Of these the Scriptures say, “The wicked walk in a circle.” … “The sound of harpers and musicians and flute players and trumpeters is no longer heard in her.” That is, the joy and happiness of the wicked passes away and is no longer to be found. And it adds the reason for this, “for your merchants were the great men of the earth,” that is, they had received good things in their lives. “The blood of the prophets and the saints was found in her and of all who have been slain by [her] upon the earth.” Did the same city kill the apostles that also killed the prophets and all of the rest of the martyrs? Rather, this is the city of all the proud and arrogant, which Cain established by the blood of his brother and which he named after the name of his son, Enoch, that is, after his posterity. For all the wicked in whom Babylon resides succeed one another and persecute the church of God until the end of the world. In the city of Cain “all the righteous blood” is poured out “from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah,” that is, of the people and of the priests, “between the sanctuary and the altar,” that is, between the people and the priests. This was said because not only the people but also the priests conspired in the death of Zechariah.… This is the city which killed the prophets and stoned those who were sent to it. This is that city that is built upon blood, as the Scriptures say, “Woe to him who builds a city with blood and founds a city on iniquity.”
