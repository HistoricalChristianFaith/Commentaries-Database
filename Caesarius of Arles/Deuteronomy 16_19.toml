Those who hear cases should decide them justly and not accept bribes at the expense of the innocent, “for gifts blind the hearts of the wise and change the words of the just.” Otherwise, while they are acquiring money, they may lose their soul. No one obtains unjust profit without a just loss. Where the gain is, there is the loss: a gain in the money coffer but a loss in the conscience.
