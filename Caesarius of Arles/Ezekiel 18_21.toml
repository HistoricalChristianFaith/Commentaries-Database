Since no one makes a fool of the Lord, he deceives himself if having led a wicked life for a long time he arises to seek life when he is already half-dead. He should listen to the prophet say, “If the sinner turns away from his sins”—if he turns away, he says, not if he only talks about it—“he shall live because of the virtue he has practiced.” Surely you have noticed that healing medicine of this kind must be asked with the lips, but it must be brought to completion by deeds. That gift of repentance that is received at the end of one’s life should be believed to be profitable if it is accepted with a sublime intention, much crying and groaning, and is further enhanced by more abundant almsgiving. However, there must be as much piety on the part of sinners in healing the wounds as the intention of the mind was quick and active in doing evil.

A person who is always uncertain of his life is also swift to apply the remedy of his salvation. The same one who gave us assurance by the words, “On whatever day the sinner is converted, all his iniquities will be forgiven,” also wanted to make us careful when he said, “Delay not to be converted to the Lord, and defer it not from day to day.”

The person who believes that even if he does penance for his sins the divine mercy will not forgive him wrongly despairs, while one who defers the remedy of repentance to a much later day is presumptuous. Just as it is said to those who despair, “On whatever day the sinner is converted, all his iniquities will be forgotten,” so it is said to the presumptuous, “Delay not to be converted to the Lord.”
