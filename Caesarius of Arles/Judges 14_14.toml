Since sacred Scripture can be understood and interpreted in many ways as a pearl, Christ himself is not unfittingly regarded as the lion.… But he was victorious in his triumph over the devil through his death on the cross. Indeed, he is both the lion and the lion’s cub: a lion because equal to the Father; the lion’s cub because the Son of the Father who was killed by his own will and rose again by his own power. Of him it is written: “Who will disturb him?” Voluntarily offering his father the sacrifice of his body for us, he who is most high forever takes up the life which he himself had laid down, as he testifies. That Samson says, “Out of the eater came forth food, and out of the strong came forth sweetness,” is fittingly applied to Christ. By his teaching he both chews over the spiritual food of his honey and in his promises gives it to us. In still another way this can be understood concerning Christ. This lion, that is, Christ from the tribe of Judah, victoriously descended into hell to snatch us from the mouth of the hostile lion. For this reason he hunts in order to protect, seizes in order to free, leads people captive in order to restore them when freed to their eternal country.
