You do nothing with regard to the reward; you do not act alone in the deed. Your crown comes from him, but the work is yours, although it does not happen without his help. When the apostle Paul, who was first Saul, was an exceedingly cruel and fierce persecutor, he merited nothing good at all but rather a great deal of evil; he deserved to be damned, and not chosen among the elect. Then suddenly, while he was doing evil and meriting evil, he was thrown to the ground by a voice from heaven. The persecutor was cast to the ground, and the preacher was lifted up. Listen to him admitting his own condition: “I was once a blasphemer, a persecutor, a man filled with arrogance, but I have been treated mercifully.” Did he say there: “The just judge will give an award to me”? “I have been treated mercifully,” he said; I deserved evil but received good. “Not according to our sins does he deal with us.” I obtained mercy; what was due to me was not given to me, for if what was due had been rendered, punishment would have been given. I did not receive what was due to me, he says; I have been treated mercifully. “Not according to our sins does he deal with us.”
