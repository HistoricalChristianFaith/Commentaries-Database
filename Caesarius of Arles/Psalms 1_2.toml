When we sing, “Blessed is the one who shall meditate on the law of the Lord day and night,” let us reject useless occupations, stinging jests, idle and wicked conversations, as the poison of the devil. Let us frequently read over and over again the divine lessons, or, if we cannot read them ourselves, let us often and eagerly listen to others read them.
