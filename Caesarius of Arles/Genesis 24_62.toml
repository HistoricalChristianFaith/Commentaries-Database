Therefore the servant took Rebekah and showed her to Isaac. However, let us see where she found him. “She found him at the well of the oath.” Look, brothers: Isaac’s servant found Rebekah at the well, and Rebekah in turn found Isaac at the well. It is true: Christ does not find the church, or the church Christ, except at the sacrament of baptism.
