The prophet speaks thus concerning the people of Israel and ours: “The Lord showed me two baskets of figs. One had very good ones, the other had very bad ones.” This fact, as has often been said, presents an image of the two people, for those two baskets prefigured the synagogue and the church. The basket of very bad fruit mystically designated the people of the synagogue, while the one with very good fruit pointed out the church of the Christians.
