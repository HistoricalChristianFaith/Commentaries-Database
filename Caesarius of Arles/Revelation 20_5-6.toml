[The first resurrection] is that by which we rise through baptism. As the apostle says, “If you have been raised with Christ, seek the things which are above.” And again he says, “living as [those who have been brought to life] from the dead.” For sin is death, as the apostle says, “when you were dead through trespasses and sins.” Therefore, just as the first death is in this life because of sin, so also the first resurrection is in this life through the remission of sins.
