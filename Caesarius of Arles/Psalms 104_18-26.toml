As you know, that psalm [104 (103 LXX)] contains the words “The sun knows the hour of its setting. You bring darkness, and it is night.” What person, though unlettered, does not understand and know that when the sun reaches its setting, immediately night and darkness appear? Why, then, was it necessary for the prophet to say what is evidently understood by everyone? Likewise what follows: “Then all the beasts of the forest roam about. Young lions roar for the prey and seek their food from God.” Can there be found anyone who does not know this? Truly, it is known to everyone that when night comes all the beasts roam about everywhere. Since, as you see, we ought not receive this according to the letter, listen attentively, as is your custom, to their spiritual significance.Now what the psalmist said, “The sun knows the hour of its setting,” is not to be taken concerning the sun but with regard to him of whom the prophet says, “For those who fear your name there will arise the sun of justice with its healing rays.” Of him we read in Solomon that the wicked will say, “The sun did not rise for us.” Therefore, Christ is the true sun of justice. He knew his setting when he yielded to his passion for our salvation; for when he was crucified, night and darkness took hold of the souls of his disciples. Truly, brothers, how was there not darkness in those who did not believe Christ was risen from the dead? Finally, when the women reported that they had seen the Lord, “this talk seemed to the apostles to be nonsense, and they did not believe the women.” Moreover, on another occasion the two disciples spoke thus to the Lord who was talking to them: “But we were hoping that it was he who should redeem Israel.” When the apostles spoke these words, then was fulfilled those others: “The sun knows the hour of its setting. You bring darkness, and it is night.”

After this the prophet added the words “The sea also, great and wide, in which are schools without number of living things.” The sea is understood as the world, which is full of storms and dangerous waves, even full of bitterness and saltiness. It also has quite large fish that do not cease to devour the smaller ones. There are numberless creeping things, so-called because they creep over the earth. For this reason carnal people and those who are too fond of the world, because they think only of the present life and continuously apply themselves to its pursuits out of love for it, are not unfittingly called creeping things. Furthermore, the words “The sea also, great and wide, where ships move about” are not to be understood relative to the ships of wood that are carried over the sea by the force of the wind but to the catholic church. While the latter desires to reach the port of paradise by holy, just works, it is beaten by many waves of tribulation and the winds of various storms. Moreover, although it is tossed by the violent beating of the winds, it is so well directed by the oars of holy discipline, so well driven by the breath of the Holy Spirit, that it is carried to eternal life by the Festal very adversities that oppose it. In this sea there is also that dragon of which it is written: “This sea dragon that you formed to make sport of it.” That dragon is understood as the devil. He is apt to play in the wicked in such a way that not only does he persuade them to sin but, using them as his ministers, he does not cease to persecute even those who are holy and just. This dragon was made a good angel by God, but since he exalted himself against God by pride and fell from that happy angelic state, deceiving himself by pride, through God’s hidden but just judgment he is permitted to deceive with his cunning careless people.
