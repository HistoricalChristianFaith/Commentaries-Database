This is not said of his Godhead, in which are all the treasuries of wisdom, so that he should receive [wisdom]. Rather, this is said of his assumed manhood, that is, concerning his body, which is the church. Or, it might be said of his martyrs who were slain for his name. For the church receives all things in her Head, as the Scriptures say, “He has given us all things with him.” The Lamb himself receives, as he said in the Gospel, “All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.” However, he receives [this authority] according to his humanity, not according to his divinity.
