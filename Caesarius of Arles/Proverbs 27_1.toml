Let us turn to him, dearly beloved, and not wish to defer our amendment until the end of our life. Let us listen to the prophet when he says, “Delay not your conversion to the Lord, put it not off from day to day,” “for you know not what any day may bring forth.” O man, why do you delay from day to day, when perhaps today you are going to have your last day?

“You know not what any day may bring forth.” “Between morning and evening the weather changes.” Elsewhere we are also advised with a salutary precept: “Let us walk while we still have the light, before darkness comes over us.” Now some careless person may say, When I reach old age, then I shall have recourse to the healing of repentance. The wretched person does not know that if one has been accustomed to commit sins with a promise of repentance, never or only with difficulty will he merit to obtain the fruit of repentance.

With what boldness does he put off his salvation to old age, when he cannot be certain of the space of one day? Therefore, if we do not want to fear death, we should always be ready. Then, when the Lord bids us come from this world, we may come before the sight of the eternal judge with a clear and free conscience; not with despair but with joy.

Therefore let us love our enemies. Perhaps the person who is your friend today will commit such sins that he cannot be with you in eternal life, “for you know not what tomorrow may bring.” On the contrary, your enemy may be converted to repentance in such a way that he merits to be your fellow citizen in that heavenly Jerusalem; in fact, he might even become greater than you.
