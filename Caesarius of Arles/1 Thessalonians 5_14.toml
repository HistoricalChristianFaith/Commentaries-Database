It was to the laity and to women and not only the clergy that the apostle said, “Reprove the irregular, comfort the fainthearted, support the weak.” Provided that you are willing to rebuke one another in case of sin, the Enemy will be able to take you by surprise only with difficulty or not at all. If he does take you by surprise, the evil which was done is easily amended and corrected. Then is fulfilled in you what was written, “A brother who helps his brother will be exalted,” and again, “he who helps a sinner to be brought back from the misguided way will save his soul from death, and will cover a multitude of sins.”
