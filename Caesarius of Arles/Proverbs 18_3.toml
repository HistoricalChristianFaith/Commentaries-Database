Not only slight sins but even greater offenses try to overtake us day and night. So let us not hold back repentance until the end of life, but while we are living let us endeavor to do penance daily. This practice should be observed continuously, not only by the laity and clerics, but even by priests and monks.… Since we cannot spend a day without sin, what is the sense of gradually piling up slight offenses and thus making endless streams of tiny drops? Despair arises from a multitude of sins heaped up over time, according to the words: “The wicked man, when he has come into the depth of sins, despises [them].” Of course, you are all well aware that we can more easily uproot them when they are still young than cut them off when they are firm.

Believe this devoutly and firmly: God never abandons a person unless he himself has already deserted God. Although a person may have committed serious sins once, twice and a third time, God still looks for him, as he says through the prophet, “that by his conversion he may live.” However, when he begins to continue in his sins, despair arises from the multitude of them, and hardening is caused by the despair. While careless people at first despise their own sins because they are small, if these slight offenses increase, crimes are even added; they heap up to finally overwhelm them, and when this happens there is fulfilled what is written: “With wickedness comes contempt.”
