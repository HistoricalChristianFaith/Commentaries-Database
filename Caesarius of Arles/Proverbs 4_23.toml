Let us listen to the prophet when he says, “With all watchfulness keep your heart,” and “Turn away my eyes that they may not behold vanity.” When someone lays hold of coals of fire but immediately throws them away they do not hurt him. But if he wants to hold on to them longer, he cannot get rid of them without injury. Similarly, if a man gazes lustfully and by lingering over it allows the evil of lust in his heart to get a hold on his thoughts, he cannot shake them off without injury to his soul.
