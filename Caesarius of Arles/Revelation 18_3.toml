[The kings of the earth fornicated] with each other. For it would be impossible for all kings to commit fornication with a single harlot. Rather, since the evil and profligate, who are members of the harlot, corrupt each other, they are said to commit fornication with the harlot, that is, by a sinful manner of life. Then it says that “all the merchants of the earth were made rich by the wealth of her wantonness.” Here it speaks of those who were wealthy in their sins. For excess in luxury makes for poverty rather than for wealth.
