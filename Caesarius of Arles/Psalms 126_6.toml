I beseech you with fatherly solicitude, equally admonishing and exhorting you, as was already said, to endeavor continually to read the sacred lessons yourselves or willingly to listen to others read them. By thus always thinking over in the treasury of your heart what is just and holy, you may prepare for your souls an eternal spiritual food that will bring you endless bliss. Christ does not lie when he says in the person of his apostle, “What a person sows, that he will also reap.” With God’s help let us endeavor to continually plant in the field of our heart by reading, praying and performing good works those deeds whereof we may reap a harvest of justice and mercy on the future day of retribution. Then will be fulfilled in us what is written: “Going, they went and wept, casting their seeds. But coming, they shall come with joyfulness, carrying their sheaves.” To this happiness may the good Lord lead you, who, together with the Father and the Holy Spirit, lives and reigns world without end.
