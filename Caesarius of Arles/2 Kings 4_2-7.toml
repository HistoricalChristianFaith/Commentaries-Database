Let us now consider what blessed Elisha said to her: “Borrow many vessels of your neighbors and your friends, shut your door, and pour out of that oil into the vessels of your neighbors.” Who were those neighbors, except the Gentiles? Although that widow typified the church, she was still a widow, and so those neighbors from whom she borrowed vessels prefigured the Gentiles. They offered empty vessels in order that they might merit to receive the oil of mercy, because before obtaining the gift of grace all the Gentiles are known to have been without faith, charity and all good works. Finally, all who are offered to the church to receive salutary baptism receive the chrism and oil of benediction, so that they may no longer merit to be empty vessels but full of God as his temples.

Notice, dearly beloved: as long as that widow had oil in her own vessel, it was not enough for her, and she could not pay her debt. It is true, brothers. If a person loves only himself, he does not suffice for himself, and he does not pay the debt of his sins; but when he begins to pour out the oil of charity on all his friends and neighbors and in fact on all people, then he is able to suffice for himself and can free himself from all debts. Truly brothers, such is the nature of holy love and true charity that it increases by being spent, and the more it is paid out to others, the more abundantly it is accumulated in oneself. If you want to give bodily food to the needy, at present you cannot keep what you have given him; but if you offer the bread of charity to one hundred people, it still remains whole. Even if you give it to a thousand, it stays undiminished for you. In fact, if you want to lavish it on the whole world, you will still lose nothing of it; or rather, not only does it not increase, but also the gain of all those on whom you bestowed it increases manifold for you. For example, you had a single loaf of charity; if you had given it to no one you would have it alone, but if you gave it to a thousand you would have acquired a thousand loaves. So great is the possession of charity that it remains entire for each individual and still can be undiminished for them all. Therefore, if you have given to others, you have lost nothing at all; or rather, not only did you not lose anything but also, as I already said, whatever you have conferred on others you have acquired a hundredfold. For this reason, beloved brothers, realize that the widow was freed from her creditors by nothing else than oil; know also that the Catholic church has been freed from its offenses by no other means than the oil of God’s mercy.
