Avoid pride, into which it is natural for anyone to fall. Pursue humility, in which everyone ought to grow. Let your beloved self not be ignorant of the laws of the church, in order that you may keep the rights of your authority within the rules and regulations of the Fathers. To be sure, it is said “that the law is not aimed at the good man,” because he fulfills the norm of the precept already by the free judgment of his will. True love holds within itself both the authority of the apostles and the moral requirements.
