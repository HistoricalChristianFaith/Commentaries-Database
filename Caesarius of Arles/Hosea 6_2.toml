The prince of this world did not want the Lord’s army to recognize the engagement of those three days, as that engagement of which the prophet said, “He will revive us after two days; on the third day he will raise us up.” The first day for us is the passion of the Savior; the second day on which he descended into hell; but the third day is the day of the resurrection. So then on the third day God went before them in a pillar of cloud by day and by night in a pillar of fire, and the people were led through the Red Sea. The three days we can fittingly call the Father, Son and Holy Spirit, for the Father is a day, the Son is one, and the Holy Spirit is one, and these three are one.
