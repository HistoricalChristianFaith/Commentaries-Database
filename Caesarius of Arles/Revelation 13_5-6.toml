The forty-two months are to be interpreted as the time of the last persecution. “It opened its mouth to blaspheme against God.” It is clear that this refers to those who have left the catholic church, for while earlier they seemed to be within the church as though they held the right faith, in time of persecution they openly blaspheme God with the mouth. [The dwelling of God] is the saints who are contained within the church, which is called “heaven,” for they are the habitation of God.
