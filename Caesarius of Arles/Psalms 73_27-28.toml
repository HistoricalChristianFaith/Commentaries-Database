What is so finite and limited as a fulfilling [of the law]? Therefore, whatever you do, do it for the love of Christ, and let the intention or end of all your actions look to him. Do nothing for the sake of human praise, but everything for love of God and the desire for eternal life. Then you will see the end of all perfection, and when you have reached it you will wish for nothing more. When the psalm is read and you hear, “Unto the end, a psalm of David,” do not understand it except as Christ, for the apostle says, “Christ is the consummation of the law for the achievement of justice.” If you come to anything else, pass beyond it until you reach the end. What is the end? “But for me, to be near God is my good.” Have you adhered to God? You have finished your journey and will remain in your true country.
