When a person lays aside his past sinfulness, he is suddenly endowed with new dignity, with that cup of divine love of which it is said, “And your cup which inebriated me, how it overflows!” Inebriated with that cup, I repeat, hearts taste the sweetness of heavenly things through the strength of spiritual wisdom. Then they may merit to hear, “Taste and see how good the Lord is.” Now he said “taste,” because love of God can refresh the soul but cannot satisfy the desire, regardless of the amount of faith or longing with which it is sought. More and more, it arouses thirst when it is, as it were, tasted beforehand with the edge of the lips, and for this reason he says of himself, “He who eats of me will hunger still, he who drinks of me will thirst for more.” Because of its sweetness, it arouses an appetite for itself, but it does not cause disgust from satiety. Just as people who are experienced in drinking wine are likely to thirst all the more when they have become drunk, so it is with the devout and chaste soul that is prudent and contrite and that can, therefore, say with the psalmist, “You have given us stupefying wine,” when it has begun to think about hope in a future life and to imbibe a thirst for heavenly goods. It knows how to be filled but not how to be satisfied, so that the more it consumes according to its capacity, the more it lacks in its eagerness, and it can join with the prophet in that word of longing: “My soul pines for your salvation”;4 and again: “My flesh and my heart waste away, O God of my heart”; moreover, “My soul yearns and pines for the courts of the Lord.”
