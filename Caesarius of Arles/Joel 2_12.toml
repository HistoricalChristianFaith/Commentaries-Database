Our Lord and Savior exhorts us through the prophet and advises us how we ought to come to him after much negligence, saying, “Come, let us bow down in worship, let us kneel before the Lord who made us”; and again, “Return to me with your whole heart, with fasting and weeping and mourning.” If we notice carefully, dearest brethren, the holy days of Lent signify the life of the present world, just as Easter prefigures eternal bliss. Now just as we have a kind of sadness in Lent in order that we may rightly rejoice at Easter, so as long as we live in this world we ought to do penance in order that we may be able to receive pardon for our sins in the future and arrive at eternal joy. Each one ought to sigh over his or her own sins, shed tears and give alms in such a way that with God’s help he may always try to avoid the same faults as long as he lives. Just as there never has been, is not now and never will be a soul without slight sins, so with the help and assistance of God we ought to be altogether without serious sins.
