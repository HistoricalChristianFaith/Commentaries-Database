“All who want to live piously in Christ suffer persecution,” says the apostle. They are under attack from the enemy. For this reason, with Christ’s help, everyone who travels the journey of this life should be armed unceasingly and always stand in camp. So if you want to be constantly vigilant so that you may know you serve in the Lord’s camp, observe what the same apostle says, “No one serving as God’s soldier entangles himself in worldly affairs, that he may please him whose approval he has secured.”

Do not seek on the journey what is being kept for you in your fatherland. Because it is necessary for you to fight against the devil every day under the leadership of Christ, do not seek in the midst of battle the reward which is being saved for you in the kingdom. During the fight you ought not to look for what is being kept for you when victory has been attained. Rather pay attention to what the apostle says, “Anyone who wants to live a godly life in Christ can expect to be persecuted,” and again, “We must undergo many trials if we are to enter the reign of God.”
