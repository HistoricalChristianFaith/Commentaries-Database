When the sacred lesson was read a little while ago, we heard that blessed Abraham called his servant and said to him, “Put your hand under my thigh that I may adjure you by the God of heaven and of earth, not to obtain a wife for my son from the daughters of this region.” And [the servant] obediently placed his hand under his thigh and swore to him. Indeed, brothers, all these things that are read in the Old Testament, if we are willing to accept them only according to the letter, will bring us little or no profit of soul. For of what benefit is it to us who assemble in church with devotion to hear the Word of God, if it is mentioned that Abraham sent his servant to bring his son a wife from a distant country, when we see this happen frequently also in this land? However, brothers, following the blessed apostle Paul, we should believe that all things which were written for the Jews “happened to them as a type” but in reality were fulfilled for us. Therefore Abraham said to his servant, “Put your hand under my thigh and swear by the God of heaven and of earth.” Thus blessed Abraham said, “Put your hand under my thigh,” as if he were saying, put your hand upon the altar, or put your hand upon the ark of the testament, or stretch forth your hand to God’s temple, and swear to me. He touched his thigh and swore by the God of heaven and earth. For blessed Abraham did not err when he commanded that this be done but because he was filled with the spirit of prophecy and knew that from his own seed Christ the Lord of heaven and earth would be born. Therefore, when his servant touched his thigh, he did not utter an oath by any carnal member but by the living and true God, because “Abraham begot Isaac, Isaac begot Jacob, and Jacob begot Judah,” of whose seed Christ the Lord was born.
