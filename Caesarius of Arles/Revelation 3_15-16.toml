Let us not only beware of serious sins, as I suggested above, but let us also spurn small daily acts of negligence as the poison of the devil. There are some people who are weakened by excessive unconcern after their religious profession, because they seem to have left the world. In such people is fulfilled that sentence of our Lord in which it is said, “How I wish you were one or the other—hot or cold! But because you are lukewarm, I will spew you out of my mouth!” What does it mean that he said, How I wish you were one or the other—hot or cold? This means that it would have been better for you to have remained cold in the world or to be fervent in the monastery. Now because you have withdrawn from the world and still have refused to acquire spiritual warmth because of your carelessness, you have become lukewarm and will be vomited from the Lord’s mouth, scarcely ever to be recovered again. For this reason, dearest brothers, with God’s help carefully listen to the sentence of sacred Scripture, in which it is said, “With closest custody guard your heart.” There should be rejoicing over the monk who has come to the monastery and, in a meek and humble spirit, wills to practice meekness, obedience and patience.
