Joseph is put in prison. Our Joseph, the Christ, as Isaiah says, “was numbered among the wicked.” The innocent man is led among the guilty by the wisdom of God, which “descended with him,” as it was written, “into the pit and did not abandon him in chains.” Our Joseph, Christ, exclaims, “I have become like a man without strength, free among the dead.” What follows—that is, that the chief jailer saw how full of grace Joseph was and gave all of the keys and all oversight into his hands13—had to happen in the sense that, to him before whom the heavens bowed down in the figures of the sun, the stars and the moon, and the earth in the figure of the sheaves, would also submit the subterranean creatures of the prison, so that before our Joseph, Christ, “every knee would bow, of heavenly beings, of earthly beings and of those under the earth.” Nor do I find it incompatible with the mystery of our Lord’s passion that two of Pharaoh’s eunuchs were thrown into prison with him, so that in a certain sense the number of the three crucified would be fulfilled. Our Joseph, Christ, revealing the mysteries, had to punish the one with a merited punishment and save the other by a gratuitous grace. These sacred acts were done then under the veil of allegory, so that the full revelation would be reserved to us.
