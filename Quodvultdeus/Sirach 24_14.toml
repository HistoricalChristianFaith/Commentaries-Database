The place that offered rest to this people, with its twelve springs and seventy palm trees, has had a sacred meaning in our mysteries. In fact, after the baptism of the twelve apostles, who are our springs, spouts of pure doctrine overflow to fill hearts. The sacred psalm thus resounds, “In the churches, bless the Lord God from the springs of Israel.” By the seventy palm trees is symbolized the whole number of the thousands of martyrs who, fighting for the truth to death, receive the palm of the heavenly calling. In the Apocalypse the apostle John speaks of them thusly: “I saw an enormous throng whom no one could count, from every tribe, people and tongue. They were clothed in white garments and had palms in their hands,” palms that Wisdom, that palm that rises at Kadesh, gave to the victors.
