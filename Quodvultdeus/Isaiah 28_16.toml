Isaiah wrote, “Behold, I lay a cornerstone in Zion as its foundation, elect and precious; he who believes in it will not be ashamed.” The cornerstone is Christ, who, when Nathaniel came to him, explained what Jacob had seen in his dream: “You will see the heavens opened and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man.” For the Christ who descended “is the same one who ascends above all the heavens that he might fill everything.” But he lays a narrow path that leads to life.
