Hearing people talk about his brother, Joseph longed for him and said, “I will prove in this manner that you are not spies, if your younger brother comes along with you.” And taking Simeon from them he had him bound before him and sent him to prison. If you want to know who is Benjamin, our younger brother, desired by our Joseph, that is, Christ, he is Paul, formerly Saul, from the tribe of Benjamin according to his testimony, who asserts to be the least among the apostles. In Simeon we can recognize Peter bound by the threefold chain of denial, that Peter whom fear has bound and love has untied.
