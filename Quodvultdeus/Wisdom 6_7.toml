The prophet Isaiah says, “Then the wolf and the lamb will pasture together. The leopard will lie down with the kid. The ox, the lion and the lamb will eat hay together. And a little child will guide them.” And David says, “See, the kings of the earth have assembled and joined together. They saw and were amazed.” And again he says, “Who is like the Lord our God, who lives on high and looks down on earthly things? Who raises the indigent from the earth and lifts the poor from the dust, to make them sit with princes, with the princes of his people?” And also Solomon says, “He has made the small and the great, and he cares for all alike.” And he says further, “Wisdom has built her house, with seven pillars as its foundation. She has sacrificed her victims, prepared her wine in its cup and spread her table. She has sent out her servants, calling out and saying, ‘Come, eat my bread and drink the wine that I have prepared for you.’ ” The Lord confirms this in the Gospel, with the parable of the banquet prepared by the powerful rich man for his son. “He sent his servants to tell those who had been invited to come, and they excused themselves. One said, ‘I have bought a field and I am going to see it, please excuse me.’ Another said, ‘I have bought five pairs of oxen.’ And another, ‘I have just taken a wife.’ ” In these three excuses we have “the concupiscence of the flesh, the concupiscence of the eyes and worldly show,” which detained the Jews and kept them from coming to Christ’s table, to which they had been invited. “Go,” says the father, “into the plazas and the streets and bring to me those whom you find.” The pagans were thus brought in. “There is still room,” says the servant. The father responds, “Go along the hedgerows and the byways, and force those you find to come in.” Among these are the rich, kings and certain heretics who have left the Lord’s flock, who are constrained to come by him who says, “No one can come to me if the Father who sent me does not draw him.” And to those who come he says, “Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him on the last day.” The apostle Paul shows who these are when he says, “There is neither Jew nor Greek, nor slave nor free person, nor man nor woman. All of you, in fact, are one person in Christ Jesus.” The verses of the Sibyl, which we cited above, confirm this: “I will lower the hills and raise the valleys from their depths. There will no longer be anything sublime or exalted among what is human.” Maro, in agreement with the Sibyl, says, “Nor will the herds fear the great lions.”
