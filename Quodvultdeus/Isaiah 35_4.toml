“This is the will of my Father,” he said, “that all who see the Son and believe in him should have eternal life.” But notice that he who was sent also came by his own will, as the prophet Isaiah said: “Be encouraged, you who are lowly of soul, and do not fear. Behold, our God will bring judgment. God himself will come and save us.”

Christ said, “I am in the Father, and the Father is in me,” and “Whoever sees me, sees the Father.” The inclusion of just one syllable, “and,” distinguishes the Father from the Son. It also demonstrates that you possess neither the Father nor the Son. Tell me, Arian, do you refer to the Father as God? And how! But what about the Son? Him too I profess to be God. You will do well to acknowledge this also, for when his coming in the flesh was announced beforehand, the prophet said about him, “Be encouraged, you who are lowly of soul, and do not fear. Behold, your God will bring the vengeance of retribution. God himself will come and save us.”
