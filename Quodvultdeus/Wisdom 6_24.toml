Having arrived at Jerusalem, Ezra, inflamed with zeal for the Law, decided first of all to purify the people of their vices, since, as the prophet said, “A wise king is the salvation of his people.” Having found the book of Moses, he showed, among other things, that the wrath of God was kindled against the people because they had married foreign wives against God’s commandment. With severity, which was his strength, he convinced them to send back their wives and their children. No longer held back by carnal delights and wanting to propitiate God, they did what was commanded of them without hesitation. In this way they symbolized the Christian people, whom the first among all priests admonishes, “If anyone leaves house, fields, wife or children because of my name, he will be repaid many times over here and will gain eternal life.”
