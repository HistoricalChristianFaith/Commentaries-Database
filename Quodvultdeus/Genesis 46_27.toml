Therefore Jacob went down to Egypt together with seventy-five people, and his son Joseph came to meet him. After seeing him Jacob said, “I see you, son, now I can die willingly.” When Simeon, that venerable old man, called a father because of his age and not because he could father children, saw Christ because of whom he was still kept in this world as in Egypt, even though he was extremely old, said, “Master, now you are dismissing your servant in peace, according to your word; for my eyes have seen your salvation.” David’s Psalm 75, which coincides with the number of the people, proclaims, “God is known in Judea, and his name is great in Israel.” Since Israel means “he who sees God,” it is necessary that every person enlightened by grace, Jew or Greek, is freed from the slavery of Egypt, even though Pharaoh, that is, the devil, oppresses him with a heavy yoke.
