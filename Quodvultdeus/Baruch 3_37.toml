The prophet David says, “He sent his word and healed them.” And Jeremiah, “He is our God, and there is no other but him, who has searched all the ways of wisdom and given it to Jacob, his beloved. After that he appeared on earth and dwelled among human beings.” And the prophet Habakkuk says, “The word will depart and go out into the fields.” And the prophet Isaiah, “Their heart is completely weighed down. He is a man, and who will know him?” John the Evangelist confirms this, saying, “The Word became flesh and dwelled among us.” Paul also attests this: “He, being by nature equal to God, did not consider it a good to be equal to God but made himself nothing, taking the nature of a servant, becoming like human beings and being as a man.” And the Sibyl confesses, “Certainly to judge the flesh and the world with his presence.”
