A brother asked an old man, “What shall a man do in every temptation that comes on him and in every thought sent by the enemy?” He replied, “He must weep in the sight of the goodness of God, that he may aid and assist him. For it is written, ‘The Lord is with me to help me, and I shall avenge myself upon my foes.’ ”
