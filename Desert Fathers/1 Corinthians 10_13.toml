A hermit used to say, ‘A lustful thought is brittle like papyrus. When it is thrust at us, if we do not accept it but throw it away it breaks easily. If it allures us and we keep playing with it, it becomes as difficult to break as iron. We need discernment to know that those who consent lose hope of salvation and for those who do not consent, a crown is made ready.’

Orsisius said, ‘If you put a piece of unbaked tiling in a building with a river nearby, it does not last a day. If it is baked, it is as good as stone. So it is with those of worldly wisdom, who are not proved by the word of God, as Joseph was proved at his beginning. To live among men is to be tempted often. It is good that a man should know his weakness, and not pick up too heavy a burden at first. But those of strong faith cannot be moved. Take the life of the patriarch Joseph and see what grievous temptations he suffered in a country where there was no trace of the true worship of God. But the God of his fathers was with him, and kept him safe in every trial, and he is now with his fathers in the kingdom of heaven. So let us own our weakness, and struggle onward. It is hard for us to escape the judgement of God.’
