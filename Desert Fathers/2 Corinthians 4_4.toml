A hermit said, ‘When the donkey’s eyes are covered it walks round the mill-wheel. If you uncover its eyes, it will not go on walking in the circle. So if the devil succeeds in covering a man’s eyes, he leads him into every kind of sin. But if the man’s eyes are uncovered, he can more easily escape.’
