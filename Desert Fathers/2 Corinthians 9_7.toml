One of the fathers said, ‘If anyone asks you for something, and you give it to him, even if you are forced to give it, let your heart go with the gift, as it is written, “If a man forces you to go with him one mile, go with him two” (Matt. 5:41). This means that if you are asked for anything, give it with a willing heart.’
