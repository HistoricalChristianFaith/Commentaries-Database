A hermit said to a brother, ‘Do not measure yourself against your brother, saying that you are more serious or more chaste or more understanding than he is. But be obedient to the grace of God, in the spirit of poverty, and in love unfeigned. The efforts of a man swollen with vanity are futile. It is written, “Let him that thinks he stands take heed lest he fall” (1 Cor. 10:12); “let your speech be seasoned with salt” (Col. 4:6) and so you will be dependent upon Christ.’
