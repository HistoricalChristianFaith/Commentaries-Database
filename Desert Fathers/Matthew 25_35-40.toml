Cassian said, ‘We came from Palestine to Egypt, and visited one of the hermits. After he had welcomed us, we asked him, “When you receive guests, why don’t you fast? In Palestine they do.” He answered, “Fasting is always possible but I cannot keep you here for ever. Fasting is useful and necessary, but we can choose to fast or not fast. God’s law demands from us perfect love. I receive Christ when I receive you, so I must do all I can to show you love. When I have said goodbye to you, I can take up my rule of fasting again. ‘The sons of the bridegroom cannot fast while the bridegroom is with them; when he is taken from them, then they can fast’ (Matt. 9:15).” ’

In Scetis there once went out an order that they should fast for a week, and then celebrate Easter. During the week some brothers happened to come into Egypt to visit Moses, and he cooked a little vegetable stew for them. The nearby hermits saw the smoke, and said to the clergy of the church, ‘What is that smoke? Moses must be disobeying the order, and cooking in his cell.’ The clergy said, ‘We will talk to him when he comes.’ On Saturday the clergy, who knew the greatness of his way of life, said to Moses in front of the whole congregation, ‘Moses, you have broken a commandment of men: but you have kept the commandments of God valiantly.’
