This same Macarius once went down from Scetis to a place named Terenuthis, and he climbed into an old pagan burial place to sleep. He put one of the bodies under his head as a pillow. The demons hated him when they saw his assurance and tried to frighten him by calling out, ‘Lady, come with us to bathe.’ Another demon answered from underneath Macarius, as though he were the dead woman, ‘I have a pilgrim on top of me, and can’t move.’ Macarius was not frightened, but confidently thumped the body, saying, ‘Get up and go if you can.’ When the demons heard it, they cried out and said, ‘You have defeated us,’ and they fled in confusion.

A brother asked Pambo, ‘Why does the enemy prevent me doing good to my neighbour?’ He said, ‘Do not talk like that, or you will make God a liar. Say, “It is I myself do not want to be kind to others.” For God came down to us and said, “I have given you the power of treading upon scorpions and snakes” (Luke 10:19), and so you are beyond the power of the enemy. Why then do you not tread down these evil spirits?’
