A brother asked a hermit, ‘If I live with other monks, and see something wrong, do you want me to say something about it?’ The hermit replied, ‘If some are older than you, or your contemporaries, you will have more peace of mind in keeping silent for you will find peace in putting yourself below the others.’ The brother said to him, ‘How can I do that, abba? For my thoughts would trouble me.’ The hermit said to him, ‘If you are worrying about the matter, offer a piece of advice, once, with humility. If they do not listen to you, leave what you have done in God’s sight, and He will help you. In this way the worshipper of God lays himself before God, and does not follow his self-will. But take care that your anxiety be of God. In any case, as far as I can see, it is good to be silent, for silence is humility.’
