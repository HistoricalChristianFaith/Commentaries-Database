Poemen said, ‘If a man sins and denies it, saying, “I have not sinned,” do not correct him, or you will destroy any intention he might have of changing. If you say, “Do not be cast down, my brother, but be careful about that in future,” you will move his heart to repent.’

Hyperichius said, ‘Snatch your neighbour from his sins, so far as you can, and refrain from condemning him, for God does not reject those who turn to him. Let no evil word about your brother stay in your mind, so that you can say, “Forgive us our debts, as we also forgive our debtors” (Mt. 7:12).’
