A brother asked John, ‘What shall I do? A brother keeps coming and taking me away to help with the work which he is doing: but I am poor and ill, and too weak to do it. How can I obey God’s commandment?’ He answered him, ‘Caleb the son of Jephunneh said to Joshua the son of Nun, “I was forty years old when Moses the servant of the Lord sent me with you to that country and now I am eighty-five. Then I was strong: and I am still just as capable of beginning and ending a battle” (cf. Josh. 14:6, 10–11). So go with him and see if you finish the work as well as you begin it. If you can’t, sit in your cell and lament your sins. If they find you weeping when they come, they will not force you to go with them.’
