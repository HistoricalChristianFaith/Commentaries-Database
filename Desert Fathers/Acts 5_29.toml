A hermit said, ‘If anyone, in humility and the fear of God, orders a monk to do something, the very word, spoken for God’s sake, makes the monk ready, and obedient to the command. But if he gives the command because he wants to give orders, if he sets himself up as an authority and seeks power over the monk, and does not give a command in the fear of God, God sees the secrets of the heart and does not let the monk obey him. Everyone knows whether his orders are from God or from self-will and desire for power. An order from God is given with humility and gentleness; an order given out of a desire for power is done with anger and anxiety, for it is of the devil.’
