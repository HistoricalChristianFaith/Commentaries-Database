Some monks called Euchites, or “men of prayer,” once came to Abba Lucius in the ninth region of Alexandria. And the old man asked them, “What work do you do with your hands?” And they said, “We do not work with our hands. We obey St. Paul’s command and pray without ceasing.” The old man said to them, “Do you not eat?” They said, “Yes, we eat.” And the old man said to them, “When you are eating, who prays for you?” Again, he asked them, “Do you not sleep?” They said, “We sleep.” And the old man said, “Who prays for you while you are asleep?” They would not answer him. And he said to them, “Forgive me, brothers, but you do not practice what you say. I will show you how I pray without ceasing though I work with my hands. With God’s help, I sit and collect a few palm leaves, and interweave them and say, ‘Have mercy on me, O God, according to your great mercy: and according to the multitude of your mercies do away with my iniquity.’ ” And he said to them, “Is that prayer, or is it not?” They said, “It is prayer.”
