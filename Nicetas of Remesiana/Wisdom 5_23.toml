That there will be only one divine judgment through Christ, the apostle Paul explicitly states when he says, “God will judge people’s secrets through our Lord Jesus Christ.” Moreover, the same apostle tells us that the Spirit will also judge the antichrist, saying specifically of this figure, “The Lord Jesus will destroy him with the Spirit of his mouth.” If the antichrist will be destroyed by the Spirit of the mouth of the Lord, then every created being will also be judged by the Spirit, something of which Solomon also speaks, saying, “The Spirit of power will break out against them, and a mighty wind will scatter them.”
