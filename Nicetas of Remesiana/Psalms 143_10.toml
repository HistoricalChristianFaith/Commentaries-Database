It can be proved, too, that just as the Father is good and the Son is good, so the Holy Spirit is good. Of the Father, the Only-Begotten speaks in the Gospel: “One there is who is good, that is God.” Of himself he says, “I am the good Shepherd.” So, too, of the Holy Spirit, David in his psalms says to the Lord, “Your good spirit shall lead me into the right land.” Just as it is said of the Son, “The word of the Lord is right,” so of the Holy Spirit it is said, “Renew a right spirit within [me].”
