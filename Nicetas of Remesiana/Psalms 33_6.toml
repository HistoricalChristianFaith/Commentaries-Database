By the “word” we must here understand the Son, through whom, as St. John declares, “all things were made.” And what is “the spirit of his mouth” if not the Spirit whom we believe to be holy? Thus, in one text, you have the Lord, the Word of the Lord and the Holy Spirit making the full mystery of the Trinity.
