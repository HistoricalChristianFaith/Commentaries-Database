“He ascended into heaven,” from where he had descended. “No man has ascended into heaven, but he who descended from heaven, the Son of man who is in heaven.” “He sits at the right hand of the Father,” according to what was said to David, typifying God the Father speaking to his Son: “Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies your footstool.” “Thence he shall come to judge both the living and the dead.” Believe that Christ himself, our God, will come with the angels and powers of heaven to judge both the living and the dead, to give to each according to his works, that is, to award eternal life to the just and to subject the wicked to eternal punishment.
