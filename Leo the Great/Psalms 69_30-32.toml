Always indeed, dearly beloved, “the earth is full of the Lord’s kindness,” and the nature of things itself is the teacher to each one of the faithful in the worship of God, while “heaven and earth, the sea and all things that are in them” proclaim the goodness and power of their Creator. The wonderful beauty of the elements that serve him demands a due thanksgiving from the understanding creature.
