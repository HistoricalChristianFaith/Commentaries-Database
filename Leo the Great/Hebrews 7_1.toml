We therefore confess, dearly beloved, not rashly but with faith, that the Lord Jesus Christ is present in the midst of believers. Although he “sits at the right hand” of God the Father “until he makes of his enemies a footstool,” the high priest has not left the assembly of his priests.Fittingly does this chant rise up to him from the mouth of the whole church and from that of all priests, “The Lord has sworn, and he will not change his mind, ‘You are a priest forever after the order of Melchizedek.’ ” He himself is the true and eternal bishop whose ministry can neither change nor end. He is the one prefigured by the high priest Melchizedek.
Attached to oaths among human beings are certain conditions that have been made irrevocable by permanent guarantees. Surety for the divine oath can therefore be found in promises that have been fixed by immutable decrees. Since regret implies a change of will, God does not regret what, according to his eternal good pleasure, he cannot want to be otherwise than how he has wanted it.
