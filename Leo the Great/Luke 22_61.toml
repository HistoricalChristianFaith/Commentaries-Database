Then “the Lord looked at Peter.” Christ stood in the middle of the priests’ insults, the witnesses’ lies, and the injuries of those that struck him and spat on him. He met the troubled disciple with his eyes, the same eyes that had foreseen that Peter would undergo a struggle. In so doing, the gaze of truth entered Peter, directed toward the place where the amendment of his heart would be grounded. It was as if the Lord’s voice were echoing within Peter, saying, “What are you thinking, Peter? Why do you withdraw into yourself? Turn to me, trust in me”, and “follow me.” This is the time for my passion. The hour of your suffering has not yet come. Why do you fear what you yourself will also overcome? Do not let the weakness that I have accepted disturb you. I was anxious for you, but you should not worry about me.”
