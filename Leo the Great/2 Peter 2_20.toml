We cannot fathom the depths of God’s mercy toward us. Yet we must take care not to be ensnared again by the devil’s traps and become entangled once more in the very errors which we have renounced. For the ancient enemy does not stop laying down traps everywhere and doing whatever it takes to corrupt the faith of believers.
