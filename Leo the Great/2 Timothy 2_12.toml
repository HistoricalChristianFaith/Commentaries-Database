In him therefore is our hope of eternal life, and in him also is the pattern of our patience. “If we suffer with him, we shall also reign with him,” since, as the apostle says, “those who claim that they remain in Christ ought themselves to walk just as Christ walked.” Otherwise we are appearing under the likeness of a false profession if we do not follow the commands of him in whose name we glory. And these would indeed not be burdensome to us and would free us from all dangers, if we would only love what he commands us to love.
