The very appearance of the gallows showed the criterion that he would apply when he comes to judge everyone. The believing thief’s faith prefigured those who would be saved, while the blasphemer’s wickedness foreshadowed those who would be condemned. Christ’s passion, therefore, contains the mystery of our salvation.
