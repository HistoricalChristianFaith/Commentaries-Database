Whoever finds the healing of correction to be difficult should flee to the mercy of God for help and beg that the chains of evil habit be broken away from them, for “the Lord lifts up all who collapse and raises up all who have been broken down.” No, the prayer of a believer will not be empty, since our merciful God “will accomplish the intentions of those who fear him.” He will give what has been asked for, since he provided the inspiration to ask it. Through our Lord Jesus Christ, living and reigning with the Father and the Holy Spirit forever and ever. Amen.
