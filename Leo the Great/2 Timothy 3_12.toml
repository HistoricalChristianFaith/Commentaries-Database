I am amazed that your charity is so overcome with tribulation from scandals, no matter from what occasion they arise, that you say you desire to be freed from the labors of your bishopric and prefer to live in silence and leisure rather than continue handling those problems which were entrusted to you. But, as the Lord said, “Blessed is he that perseveres to the end.” From what will this blessed perseverance come if not from the virtue of patience? For, according to the teaching of the apostle, “All who want to live piously in Christ will suffer persecution.” Persecution is to be reckoned not only as that which is done against Christian piety by the sword or fire or by any torments whatever, for the ravages of persecution are also inflicted by differences of character, the perversity of the disobedient and the barbs of slanderous tongues.
