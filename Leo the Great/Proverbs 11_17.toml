Prayer rises up quickly to the ears of God when lifted up by the recommendation of [alms and fasting]. Since, as it has been written, “the merciful man benefits his own soul,” nothing belongs to each individual more than what has been spent on one’s neighbor. Part of those physical resources which are used to help the poor become transformed into eternal riches. Born from this generosity are funds which will not be able to be diminished through use nor damaged through decay. “Blessed are the merciful, for God will have mercy on them.” He who constitutes the very exemplar of this precept will also be the sum of their reward.
