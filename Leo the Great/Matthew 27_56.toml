In Serm. de Pass., non occ.: The sudden commotion in the elements is asufficient sign in witness of His venerable Passion, “The earth quaked, and the rocks rent, and the graves were opened.”.
Serm. 66, 3: From this example then of the Centurion let the substance of the earth tremble in the punishment of it Redeemer, let the rocks of unbelieving minds be rent, and those who were pent up in these sepulchres of mortality leap forth, bursting the bonds that would detain them; and let them show themselves in the Holy City, i.e. the Church of God, as signs of the Resurrection to come; and thus let that take place in the heart, which we must believe takes place in the body.
