[Eutyches] might have read the words of the same prophet: “A child is born to us, and a son is given to us, and the government is upon his shoulders: and they shall call his name, angel of the Great Counsel, God the Mighty, the Prince of peace, Father of the world to come.” And he would not speak nonsense, saying that the Word was made flesh in such a way that Christ, born from the Virgin’s womb, had a man’s form yet did not have the reality of his mother’s body.
