Each one is a partaker of this spiritual origin in regeneration. To every one, when he is reborn, the water of baptism is like the Virginâ€™s womb, for the same Holy Spirit fills the font, who filled the Virgin, that the sin, which that sacred conception overthrew, may be taken away by this mystical washing.
