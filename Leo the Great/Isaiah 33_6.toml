But, since there are many kinds of treasures and different grounds for joy, each one’s treasure corresponds to the movement of their desire. If it is an appetite for earthly things, it makes those who share in it not happy but wretched. Those who “savor the things above, not what is on earth,” and are not eager for what perishes but for what is eternal, have hidden, incorruptible resources, in that about which the prophet says, “In your treasure is our salvation. There wisdom and knowledge and holiness are from the Lord. These are the treasures of his justice.”Through them, with God’s grace helping us, even earthly goods are transformed into heavenly, as long as many use their wealth, either left them by law or otherwise acquired, as instruments of goodness. When they distribute, from what they can count as overabundance, to the support of the poor, they collect for themselves riches that cannot be lost, so that what they have withdrawn for alms cannot be credited to expense, and they properly keep their heart where they have “their treasure.” It is most blessed to use wealth of this kind that it may grow, and not fear lest it be destroyed.
