When, from the teaching of ancient doctrine, dearly beloved, we undertake the fast of September to purify our souls and bodies, we are not subjecting ourselves to legal burdens. We are embracing the good use of self-restraint that serves the gospel of Christ. In this too, Christian virtue can “exceed that of the scribes and Pharisees,” not by making void the law but by rejecting worldly wisdom. - "Sermon 92.2"
