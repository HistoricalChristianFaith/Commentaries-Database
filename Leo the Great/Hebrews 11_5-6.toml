A sound faith is a mighty bulwark, a true faith to which nothing has to be added or taken away. Unless it is one, it is no faith, as the apostle says, “one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in us all.” Cling to this unity, dearly beloved, with minds unshaken, and “follow after” all “holiness” in faith. Carry out the Lord’s commands in faith because “without faith it is impossible to please God.” Without faith nothing is holy, nothing is pure, nothing alive: “for the just lives by faith.” The one who, by the devil’s deception, loses it is dead even though he is living because, as righteousness is gained by faith, so too by a true faith eternal life is gained. This is exactly what our Lord and Savior says, “And this is life eternal, that they may know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent.” May he make you to advance and persevere to the end, who lives and reigns with the Father and the Holy Spirit, forever and ever. Amen.
