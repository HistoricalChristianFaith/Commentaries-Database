The beam that emanates from light does not come after the light. True light never lacks a beam, having it as part of its substance to shine, just as it always has it as part of its substance to exist. But the manifestation of this beam has been called a “sending,” by which Christ appeared to the world. Although he filled all things with his invisible majesty, he came, nevertheless, to those who had not known him, as if from a very remote and deep seclusion. At that time, he took away the blindness of ignorance, as it has been written: “For those sitting in darkness and in the shadow of death, a light has risen.” Of course the light of truth has been sent out in prior ages to enlighten the holy fathers and prophets, as when David said, “Send out your light and your truth.” Of course the divinity of the Son has made clear the works of his presence “in various ways and by many signs.” Yet all these prefigurations and all these miracles bore testimony about that “sending” of which the apostle speaks: “When the fullness of time came, God sent his Son, made from a woman, made under the Law.”
