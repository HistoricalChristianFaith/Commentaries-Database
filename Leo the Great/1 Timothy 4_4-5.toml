The first cause of sin crept in from the enjoyment of food. What more salutary gift of God does our redeemed liberty use than that the will, which once did not know how to restrain itself from forbidden things, now knows how to restrain itself from lawful things? “Every creature of God is good, and nothing ought to be rejected, which is received with the giving of thanks.” We were not created to seek out all the riches of the world with a foul and shameless greed. We can restrain voluntarily from what is lawful.
