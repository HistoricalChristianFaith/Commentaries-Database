By the delay of his saving work, he has made us better disposed to accept his calling. In this is shown the “goodness and kindness of God.” By this means, what had been foretold through so many ages by numerous signs, numerous words and numerous mysteries would no longer be open to doubt in these days of the gospel. That way, the birth of the Savior—which was to exceed all wonders and the whole measure of human intelligence—would engender in us a faith all the more steadfast, the more often and the earlier it had been proclaimed beforehand.
