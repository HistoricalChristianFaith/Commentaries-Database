It was the Holy Ghost that gave fecundity to the Virgin, but it was from a body that a real body was derived. And when “Wisdom was building herself a house,” “the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us,” that is, in that flesh which he assumed from a human being and which he animated with the spirit of rational life.

We are his flesh, the flesh that had been taken up from the Virgin’s womb. If this flesh had not been from ours, that is, had it not been truly human, the Word made flesh would not have dwelt among us. “He did” in fact “dwell among us,” however, for he made the nature of our body his own. “Wisdom built itself a house,” not from just any material but from the substance that is properly ours. The fact that he had taken it on has been made clear from when it was said, “the Word became flesh and dwelt among us.”
