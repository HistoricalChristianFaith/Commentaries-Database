Through the Holy Spirit we are reborn the children of promise, not in the mother’s womb but in the power of baptism. For this reason David, who certainly was a son of promise, says to God, “Your hands have made and fashioned me.” And to Jeremiah the Lord says, “Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, and before you were born I consecrated you.”
