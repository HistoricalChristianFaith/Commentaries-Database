In hell there is no amendment. No means of satisfaction can be given where no act of the will remains any longer, as David says in prophecy: “Since in death there is no one who remembers you, who will give you thanks in hell?” Let us flee harmful pleasures, dangerous joys and desires that perish right away. What fruit is there, what use is there, in wanting these things incessantly, things that we must abandon even if they do not abandon us? Let the love of ephemeral things be transferred to incorruptible ones. Let hearts called to lofty things find their enjoyment in heavenly delights.
