Although in any time there are many who lead an innocent life, and very many commend themselves to God by their habitual performance of good deeds, we should not however trust in the integrity of our conscience to such a point that we think that human weakness, living among scandals and temptations, can meet nothing that will harm it. The chief of prophets says, “Who will boast that they have pure hearts or that they are cleansed from sin?” [Here in this psalm] he says, “From my hidden faults cleanse me, O Lord, and from dangerous ones spare your servant.”
