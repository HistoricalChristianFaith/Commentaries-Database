The psalmist is a witness of this matter when he says, “All have gone astray together; they have become worthless.” And Christ’s prophets, praying for help, said, “Lord, bow down your heavens and descend”; not that he might change the places in which all things are now located but that he might take on the flesh of human weakness for our salvation. Paul says the same thing: “How, being rich, he became poor for our sakes, that by his poverty we might become rich.” And he came to the earth and proceeded as a man from the virgin’s womb, which he sanctified. Confirming by this process the interpretation of his name, Emmanuel, that is, “God with us,” he began in a marvelous way to be what we are and did not cease to be what he was. He assumed our nature in such a way as not to lose what he himself was.
