Whoever of you, therefore, takes pride (with devotion and faith) in the name of Christian, ponder, by an accurate judgment, the grace of this reconciliation. To you once “cast aside,” to you driven out from the thrones of “paradise,” to you dying from long exiles, to you scattered into “dust” and ashes, who had no longer any hope of living—to you has “power” been given through the incarnation of the Word. With it, you can “return from far away” to your Maker, can recognize your Father, can become free from slavery and can be made again a child rather than an outsider. With this power, you who were born of flesh that is subject to decay can be “born again from the Spirit” of God and can obtain through grace what you do not have through nature.
