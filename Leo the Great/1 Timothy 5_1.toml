Among our negligent and sluggish brothers there is generally something requiring correction by a sterner show of authority. But the correction should be applied so as not to destroy charity. Hence, also, the blessed apostle Paul, instructing Timothy in the government of the church, says, “Do not rebuke an elderly man, but exhort him as you would a father, and young men as brothers, elderly women as mothers, younger women as sisters in all chastity.” If, by the apostle’s direction, this moderation is to be shown to any members of lesser rank, how much more should it be displayed without offense toward our brothers and fellow bishops?
