I beg you, therefore, “by the mercy of the Lord,” help with your prayers the one for whom you have voted with your desires. Pray that the “Spirit” of grace “might remain in me” and that you might not begin to reconsider your decision. May the one who has instilled in you an eager longing for agreement provide for us all the shared benefit of peace. I could then be made fit for serving almighty God and for surrendering myself to you for the rest of my life, entreating the Lord with confidence, “Holy Father, keep in your name the ones you have given me.” While you continually make progress toward salvation, “my soul could” then “proclaim the greatness of the Lord.” In the compensation of the judgment that is to come, the reckoning of my priesthood could take its stand before the just Judge in such a way that, through your good works, “you” might be “a joy” to me, and “you a crown.” You have already given sincere testimony about the present life by your good will.
