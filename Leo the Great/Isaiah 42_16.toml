The apostle John teaches how this is fulfilled: “We know that the Son of God came and gave understanding to us, that we might know the truth and be in his true Son.” And again, “Let us love, therefore, since God first loved us.” By loving us, God restores us to be his image, so that he might find the form of his own goodness in us. He grants that we ourselves might work what he works, indeed setting light to our minds and causing us to burn with the fire of his love, in order that we love not only him but also the things that he loves.
