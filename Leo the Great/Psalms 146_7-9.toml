We not only do not hold back, but even encourage, compassion, wisely and divinely set up by the church, that even for such people you should pray to the Lord with us. We also, with tears of sorrow, have pity on the downfall of misled souls. Following the example of the apostle’s compassion, “we are made weak with the weak,” and “we weep with those who weep.” We hope that the mercy of God may be gained with many tears and requisite satisfaction on the part of those who have lapsed. While we live in this body, no one’s rehabilitation is to be despaired of. We should desire the amendment of all, with the Lord helping us, who “raises up those who have been broken down, sets captives free, gives sight to the blind,” to whom is honor and glory “with the Father and with the Holy Spirit” forever and ever. Amen.
