And hence Tobias also, while instructing his son in the precepts of godliness, says, “Give alms of your substance, and turn not your face from any poor man. So shall it come to pass that the face of God shall not be turned from you.” This virtue makes all virtues profitable, for by its precepts it gives life to that very faith by which “the just lives” and which is said to be “dead without works.” As the reason for works consists in faith, so the strength of faith consists in works.
