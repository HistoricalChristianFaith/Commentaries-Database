Therefore, let us rejoice in the day of our salvation, dearly beloved. We have been taken up through the new covenant into participation with him who was told by the Father through a prophet, “You are my Son; this day I have begotten you. Ask it of me, and I will give you the of the earth for your possession.” Let us glory, therefore, in the mercy of the one adopting us.
