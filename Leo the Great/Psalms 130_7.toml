But satisfaction must not be ruled out or absolution denied to those who in time of necessity or in the moment of pressing danger beg for the protection of penance followed by absolution. For we cannot put limitations on the mercy of God or fix limits to times. With him there is no delaying of pardon when the conversion is genuine, as the Spirit of God says through the prophet: “If being converted you lament, you will be saved”; and elsewhere: “Tell me your sins first in order that you may be justified”;7 and again: “Because with the Lord there is mercy; and with him plentiful redemption.” Consequently, we must not be stingy in dispensing the gifts of God or disregard the tears and groans of those accusing themselves, since, in our opinion, the very desire for penance was conceived through the inspiration of God, as the apostle says: “Lest by chance God give them repentance … so that they may recover themselves from the snare of the devil, at whose pleasure they are held captive.”
