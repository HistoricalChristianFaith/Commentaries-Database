The Spirit of truth would by no means have permitted this hesitation, wavering in human weakness, to enter the hearts of his preachers, if their trembling anxiety and questioning delay were not to have established the foundations of our faith. Consequently it was our doubts and our danger that was being considered in the apostles. We, in the guise of the apostles, were being instructed against the slanders of the wicked and the proofs of earthly wisdom. Their “seeing” instructed us, their “hearing” informed us, their “touching” strengthened us. Let us give thanks for the divine plan and the necessary “slowness” of the holy fathers. They “doubted” so that we need not doubt.
