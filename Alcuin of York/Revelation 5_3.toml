And no man was able, neither in heaven, that is no angel was able to, nor on earth, that is no human being, nor under the earth, that is no soul, to open the book, nor to look on it: for none of these was able to achieve the plan for the salvation of man. But, blessed John, how could no one look on the book, while you yourself say, “I saw a book in the right hand of God?” Perhaps you were neither in heaven, nor on earth, nor under the earth? Then, in order for it not to be contradictory, we should take look on to mean “comprehend.” Indeed, who is able to comprehend how God can become incarnate without seed, how a man God can come out of the closed womb of a virgin, and how the Lord of glory can be crucified, when only the flesh dies?

QUESTION: And no man was able, neither in heaven, nor on earth, nor under the earth, to open the book. ANSWER: No angel nor any of the just, even freed from the bond of the flesh, was able to reveal or discover the mysteries of the divine law. — Nor to look on it. —That is, to contemplate the splendor of the grace of the New Testament, just like the children of Israel were unable to look at the face of the one who brought the Old Testament which contained the New. (5:4) THERE FOLLOWS: And I wept much. ANSWER: It means that he realized the common misery of mankind and felt sad. (5:5) THERE FOLLOWS: And one of the ancients said to me: Weep not; behold the lion of the tribe of Juda, the root of David, hath prevailed. ANSWER: He is forbidden to weep because the mystery that had long lain hidden had then already been fulfilled in Christ's Passion.
