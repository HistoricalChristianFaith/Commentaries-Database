And I heard a loud voice in heaven, saying: Now is there made salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the power of his Christ: because the accuser of our brethren is cast forth, who accused them before our God day and night. Since the dragon falls from heaven to the earth every day, it is certain that this voice, which is a desire of the mind for praising, starts from the Lord's coming, and does not stop clamoring in heaven, that is in the Church, until the end of the world. Therefore it is all time that is included in the adverb now. They say that salvation is made because we have been saved by the free goodness of God; strength because we have been strengthened by it; and power because we have been raised to a high glory. Indeed all these things have been made among men, although not by man, but by Jesus Christ. The Devil accuses people day and night when he takes care that some be lifted up in success, and others broken in adversity. The Devil accuses the saints not by speaking on the outside, but by listening on the inside; for his evilness is his accusation of the saints.
