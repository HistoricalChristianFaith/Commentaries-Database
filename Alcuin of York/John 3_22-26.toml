By Jud√¶a are meant those who confess, whom Christ visits; for wherever there is confession of sins, or the praise of God, thither cometh Christ and His disciples, i. e. His doctrine and enlightenment; and there He is known by His cleansing men from sin: And there He tarried with them, and baptized.

Meaning, Passing by thee, all men run to the baptism of Him Whom thou baptizedst.
