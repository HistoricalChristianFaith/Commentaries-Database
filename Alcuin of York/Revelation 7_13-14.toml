And one of the ancients answered, saying to me: These that are clothed in white robes, who are they? and whence came they? As no question preceded, what does it mean that one of the ancients is said to have answered? It is a habit of the sacred Scripture to use this verb like that, but it does not seem to have any meaning, so neither is ignorance of it harmful nor is knowledge of it praiseworthy. So, by this one ancient we understand the unity of the preachers of both Testaments, or him who is more ancient than ancients, that is the Lord Jesus Christ, who interrogates John in order that the latter may himself ask, and, after asking, hear, understand, and rouse himself up to imitate. By the white robes we understand both purity of mind and the glory they will be granted in the future. When John responds to this, in the person of good listeners, My Lord, thou knowest, the ancient replies, in the person of the Lord or of his good preachers, These are they who are come out of great tribulation, etc. In are come, three tenses are contained: it is here used for “are come, are coming, and are to come.” Therefore, since the whole number of the elect is defined by this sentence, it is greatly to be feared that if someone comes from somewhere else, they should not belong to the fellowship of the elect. The tribulations of the just, as the Psalmist says, are many; [Ps. 33:20] and among these tribulations there is that general one which consists of the fact that none of us knows whether they belong to the fellowship of the elect, as Solomon attests, who says, Man knoweth not whether he be worthy of love, or hatred: but all things are kept uncertain for the time to come. [Eccles. 9:1-2] And have washed their robes, and have made them white in the blood of the Lamb. All the elect make their robes white in the blood of the Lamb, that is to say they beautify their disposition of mind in the sufferings of Christ and prepare it to receive the future joys.
