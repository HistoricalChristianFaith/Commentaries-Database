These had now begun to drink in that spiritual thirst, and had laid aside the unbelieving thirst. But others still remained driedup in their unbelief: But some said, Shall Christ come out of Galilee? Has not the Scripture said, That Christ comes of the seed of David, and out of the town of Bethlehem, where David was? They knew what were the predictions of the Prophets respecting Christ, but knew not that they all were fulfilled in Him. They knew that He had been brought up at Nazareth, butthe place of His birth they did not know; and did not believe that it answered to the prophecies.
That is, because He Who had the power to control their designs, did not permit it.
They who wished to take and stone Him, reprove the officers for not bringing Him.
And so they were led away; and laudably too, for they had left the evil of unbelief, and were gone over to the faith.
They knew the place where He had resided, but never thought of inquiring where He was born; and therefore they not only denied that He was the Messiah, but even that He was aprophet.
