Behold, I stand at the gate, and knock. If any man shall hear my voice, and open to me the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me. This is not to be taken as a physical act of standing, but as a placeless one, because when the Lord dwells in someone, he does not leave him to pass to someone else. The gate signifies the mind's entrance, which the Lord knocks at on his own, with no companion, by inspiring: his voice is heard by whoever keeps the advice of his commandments out of love, and this person opens the door when he broadens his heart to see the highest good of eternity. Finally, when the door has been opened, the Lord comes in to him, because he illuminates through inner sweetness the soul burning with desire. So the Head sups..... because by doing the Father's will every day..... the limbs..... 5 with the Head, the limbs which die with him every day in order to do the Father's will, as in for you are dead, etc. [Col. 3:3]

QUESTION: What is meant by Behold, I stand at the gate, and knock? ANSWER: I am in any case knocking at your heart's door with the hand of exhortation, and if you receive it willingly, you shall be considered worthy to have me as an inhabitant and coheir.
