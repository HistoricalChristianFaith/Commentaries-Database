And round about the throne were four and twenty seats; and upon the seats, four and twenty ancients sitting. As in the Gospel the Lord mentions twelve thrones, [Matt. 19:28] what does it mean that John says there are twenty-four, if not that, because of the two testaments, the number of the twelve tribes is also doubled? Therefore, regarding the distinction between both testaments, there are twenty-four thrones, and as many ancients; but regarding the unity and harmony between those same testaments, there are only twelve. We should not however understand things only carnally and think that the one throne is one thing and the twenty-four seats another; for because it is specifically and chiefly the Lord who will judge the whole Church, the ancients and the seats are for this reason said to be one throne; but because the holy preachers of both testaments will examine with him the people below them, consequently twenty-four ancients sit on twenty-four seats round about the throne. As for what is said after that concerning the ancients, clothed in white garments, and on their heads were crowns of gold, it refers to the whole Church, which clothes in white garments, that is in the inviolate sacraments of baptism. It has crowns of gold on its head because it truly triumphs over the author of death. Alternatively, this number may symbolize the holy Church because of the perfection of the number six, completed by the four books of the Gospel; or if not, then surely because the Church uses the twenty-four books of the Old Testament.
