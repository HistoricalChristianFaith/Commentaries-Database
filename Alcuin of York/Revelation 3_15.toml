QUESTION: What is meant by what he says to the angel of Laodicea, I know thy works, that thou art neither cold, nor hot? ANSWER: You are neither ardent in faith nor completely unfaithful. If you were still unfaithful, there would be some hope left for you to convert; but now, since you know the Lord's will and do not do it, you are thrown out of the inside of my Church. (3:19) THERE FOLLOWS: Such as I love, I rebuke and chastise. ANSWER: Do not shrink from suffering adversity, since it is a specific sign of being loved by the Lord.
