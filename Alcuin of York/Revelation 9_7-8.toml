And the shapes of the locusts were like unto horses prepared unto battle: and on their heads were, as it were, crowns like gold. It is right for the heretics to be represented by horses because of their rapidity in running about. They are prepared unto battle against those about whom it is said in Habakkuk, Thou sentest into the sea thy horses, stirring many waters. [Hab. 3:15. acc. to LXX] However, since, by God's favor, they do not win, they are not said to have crowns, but as it were crowns, as if it were said, “They were neither crowns nor of gold, but some kind of invention of falsehood.” And their faces were as the faces of men. And they had women's hair. The faces of the locusts being like human faces mean pretense of reason. As for women's hair, it is the effeminate manners of the heretics. Alternatively, by faces of men, we may understand males; and by women's hair, the sex itself; for heretics have also had women's support. And their teeth were as of lions. The teeth of lions usually bring a natural shame; by them is indicated the stench of the heretics.
