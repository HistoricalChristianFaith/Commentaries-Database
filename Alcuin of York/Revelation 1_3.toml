Blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of the prophecy of this book, and keep those things which are written in it; for the time is at hand. Here it is made clear how great this book's authority is, since it is the only one among all prophecies to promise blessedness in return with a promise that is in some way specific. In saying he that readeth and they that hear, he indicated the persons of the teachers and of the listeners. What is said after that, and keep those things, pertains to both, because not the hearers of the law are just before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified. [Rom. 2:13] Then, in order to stimulate the minds of both to observe those things, he added, for the time is at hand; namely the time either for the just to be rewarded after their observance of the commandments or for the unjust to be punished after their negligence of them.

QUESTION: What is meant by Blessed is he that reads and they that hear the words of this prophecy, etc.? ANSWER: The teacher and his listeners are blessed because, for those who keep the words of God, the short time of hardship is followed by eternal joys. As the Truth replied to the woman who said to him that the womb of the mother of such great son was blessed as well as her paps, even more blessed are they who hear the word of God, and keep it. [Luke 11:27-28] For he may doubtless call singularly blessed whoever is quick to understand it correctly and to put it into practice once they understand it, and, finally, as he stipulates in this same book: And he that heareth, let him say: Come, [Rev. 22:17] that is, let whoever perceives the inner light of faith and glory in their mind, also call others to it; or, as it is said concerning the same Truth, the things which Jesus began to do and to teach. [Acts 1:1]
