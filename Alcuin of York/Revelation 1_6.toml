And hath made our kingdom priests to God and his Father. Because our Head is a king and priest, all the limbs are kings and priests, as the apostle Peter says in You are a chosen generation, a kingly priesthood. [1 Pet. 2:9] They are kings by governing themselves, and priests by offering themselves to God, according to this: I beseech you therefore by the mercy of God, that you present your bodies a living sacrifice. [Rom. 12:1] So, in saying to God and his Father, he indicates one person (although, according to the rule mentioned earlier, the Holy Spirit is there understood) in the same way as the apostle also says, Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, [2 Cor. 1:3] with the intention that one person should be understood by God and Father; hence it needs to be said, to him be glory forever and ever: to him, that is to him who has made us kings and priests, namely the Father and the Son, in which we understand the love of both, which is the Holy Spirit: for the love of God is poured forth in our hearts by the Holy Ghost. [Rom. 5:5] Moreover, the Church is right to attribute glory for these things not to itself, but to the one it received them from, according to this: Not to us, O Lord, not to us; but to thy name give glory. [Ps. 113:9]

QUESTION: What is meant by And hath made us a kingdom, and priests to God and his Father? ANSWER: Seeing that the King of kings and heavenly Priest united us to his body by sacrificing himself for us, there is no one among the saints who does not spiritually have the office of a priest, since each of them is a member of the highest and eternal Priest. (1:8) THERE FOLLOWS: I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, saith the Lord God. ANSWER: The beginning means the one whom no one precedes; the end, the one whom no one succeeds. — He also repeats the same words again: who is, and who was, and who is to come. ANSWER: He had said the same about the Father, for God the Father both came and is to come in the Son.
