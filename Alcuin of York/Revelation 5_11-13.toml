And I saw, and I heard the voice of many angels round about the throne, and the living creatures, and the ancients. By saying that he heard the voice, he shows what kind of seeing this was; for he sees sounds and hears visions. Now if, as already said, the living creatures and the ancients are round about the throne, how can there be any angel round about the same throne, if not because those same living creatures and ancients are angels? About whom it is said, The angels of peace shall weep bitterly. [Is. 33:7] Though the heavenly military may also be understood by the name of angels; but whether it is about the latter or about the former, their countless multitude is shown when it is said after that, and the number of them was thousands of thousands, saying with a loud voice: The Lamb that was slain is worthy to receive power, and divinity, and wisdom, and strength, and honour, and glory, and benediction, and every creature, which is in heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and under the sea, and the things that are in it. The sea and the things that are in it represent this world. I heard all saying: To him that sitteth on the throne, and to the Lamb, benediction, and honour, and glory, and power, for ever and ever. Saying all, he means again those whom he said above the whole Church was made up of, that is the living creatures, the ancients, and the angels. In the one who sits and the Lamb, that is in the Father and the Son, according to the rule mentioned earlier, the Holy Spirit is also understood.
