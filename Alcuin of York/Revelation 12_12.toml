Therefore rejoice, O heavens, and you that dwell therein. He invites the heavens in the plural to rejoice, because he is here indicating the numerousness of the churches, which all make up one. By those who dwell in heaven he means angels or holy men, for whom it is right to rejoice together in harmony in the Lord when, the enemy vanquished, men come back to the fellowship of angels. There is nothing more here that needs explaining, except that, with this joy remaining, this book should come to its due end. The exposition of the remaining chapters is missing from the manuscript, whether Alcuin wrote it or not — though in verse 3 of this last chapter he does promise that he will write more.
