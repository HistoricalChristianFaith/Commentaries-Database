And the third angel sounded the trumpet, and a great star fell from heaven, as it were a burning torch. The Devil is called a star, whether because of the rank he first had or because he transformeth himself into an angel of light; [2 Cor. 11:14] a great star because he was given precedence over all other angels, and a burning torch because of the fervor of his evilness. We should not understand this fall to be the one when he was first ejected from the heavenly abodes, but the one when he was excluded from among the elect by the angel sounding the trumpet, that is by the Church preaching; for heaven is the Church, which the Lord inhabits by presiding over it. And it fell on the third part of the rivers, and upon the fountains of waters, that is upon human nature, which flows by from its birth with the currents of carnal pleasures and thus runs down to death.
