And the angel took the censer, and filled it with the fire of the altar, and cast it on the earth. The angel took the censer when the Lord joined human nature to himself within the Virgin's womb; or we may take it as referring to the body, when he first chose his disciples in Judea. Since the angel, the censer, and the altar are one body, we should understand the censer being said to have been filled with the fire of the altar as if he were saying, “Both the Head and the body have been kindled with no other fire but their own, that is the Holy Spirit.” Then he cast it on the earth, that is, he brought it into this pagan people; whence it is fittingly said after that, And there were thunders and voices, that is terrors caused by preachings, and lightnings, that is miraculous signs, and an earthquake, that is persecutions.
