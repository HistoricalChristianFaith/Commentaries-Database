I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, saith the Lord God, who is, and who was, and who is to come. By saying I am, he lets us know clearly that God was speaking through him. Whence the Apostle: Do you seek a proof of Christ that speaketh in me? [2 Cor. 13:3], and David: Attend, O my people, to my law, [Ps. 77:1] while neither the people nor the law was David's. Alpha and Omega means the same as the beginning and the end, for alpha for the Greeks is the beginning of the alphabet, and omega its end. Christ is called the beginning because all the creation has got its beginning from him, and he is called the end because he encloses everything like a boundary. Alternatively, he is called the beginning and the end because he is God before the ages and a man in the end of the ages; whence John: In the beginning was the Word, [John 1:1] as well as: The Word was made flesh. [Ibid. 14]
