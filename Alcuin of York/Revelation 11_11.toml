And after three days and a half, the spirit of life from God entered into them. And they stood upon their feet. In this place is declared the general resurrection of all the saints after that last persecution. The spirit of life from God entering into them does not mean that they will receive another spirit, but that they will get back the same that they had. Standing upon one's feet means not staggering with any changeableness of spiritual things any more. So, let us hear what happens to the reprobates when the saints awaken: and great fear fell upon them that saw them. It is not surprising if fear seizes the reprobates, since even the elect themselves will be scared, albeit with a serene fear.
