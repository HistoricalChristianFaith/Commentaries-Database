QUESTION: And the city hath no need of the sun, nor of the moon, to shine in it. ANSWER: Because the Church is not guided by the light or elements of the world, but it is led through the darkness of the world by Christ, the eternal Sun. THERE FOLLOWS: For the glory of God will enlighten it. ANSWER: The light we shall enjoy in our fatherland is the same one by which we are now guided as we walk on the way. It is by the same light by which we have been taught to distinguish between good and evil that we shall then be made blessed and see only what is good.
