And from the throne proceeded lightnings, and voices, and thunders. Here it is clearly shown that the throne symbolizes the Church, which all these things tally with. For by lightnings we understand miraculous signs; whence the Psalmist: Thy lightnings enlightened the world, [Ps. 76:19] and by voices and thunders is represented the preaching of the truth, as the same Psalmist said: The voice of thy thunder in a wheel. [Ibid.] Note also that, passing obliquely, as it were, from one symbol to another, he says that these things proceed from the throne while they do not correspond to a throne but to a cloud. Therefore by the throne he wants us to understand the cloud. It is fitting for the Church of the just to be symbolized by a cloud, because its preachers rain words, thunder with threats, and flash with miracles. And there were seven lamps burning before the throne, which are the seven spirits of God. And in the sight of the throne was, as it were, a sea of glass like to crystal. It is fitting for the Holy Spirit to be compared to lamps, because he kindles the hearts of the elect to the love of God and neighbor. As for the sea of glass, what is symbolized by it but baptism? And why is it of glass, if not because the faith of those who go through it is being indicated with a figurative expression, in which what is caused is being represented by what causes it? Indeed, just as in glass you can see nothing from the outside but that which is carried inside of it, so is the Church's faith sincere in its belief on the inside, and so does it appear truthful in confession on the outside. Yet, so that it should not be thought to be fragile like glass, it was added like to crystal. Indeed, just as ice compressed by the winter's cold, after many years, hardens in such a way that it resembles a stone and becomes crystal, so is the faith of the saints solidified with time among oppressions. And in the midst of the throne, and round about the throne, were four living creatures, full of eyes before and behind. No one doubts that by these four living creatures are represented the four evangelists. But if they are in the midst of the throne, how can they be said to be round about the throne? Especially since it has already been said that the Lord was sitting in the midst of the throne, and the twenty-four ancients round about the throne. One should know then that the living creatures are found in the Lord, and the Lord in the living creatures; and again the living creatures in the ancients, and the ancients in the living creatures. The species of the four creatures may also indicate the Church in general. So the living creatures are full of eyes because as many words of the sacred Scriptures as there are, there are so many spiritual lights for the elect, by which they are illuminated to faith. Their eyes are before and behind because they contain in themselves the mysteries of the Old and of the New Testament. For before is used in this passage to mean the past. Alternatively, they have eyes before and behind because they announce some things that have been fulfilled and some that are to be fulfilled, or because they lament past sins and guard against future ones.
