And he cried with a loud voice as when a lion roareth. Just as the lion's cry inspires beasts with fear, so does Christ inspire beastlike men with fear by threatening through the holy preachers, according to this: The lion roareth, who will not fear? [Variant of Amos 3:8] And when he had cried, the seven thunders spoke their voices. The seven thunders signify the same thing as the lion's voice, namely the preaching of the Word, as in The voice of thy thunder in a wheel. [Ps. 76:19] Note also that the seven thunders are said to have spoken after the lion's voice because the sevenfold Spirit also taught the apostles to preach what the Lord taught, whence they are called the sons of thunder. [Mark 3:17] They spoke their voices because the holy doctrine does not receive the fables of the Jews or the rubbish of philosophers into its dogmas. However, a very complicated question arises for us in what is said after that: And I was about to write the things which the seven thunders spoke: and I heard a voice from heaven, saying: Seal up the things which the seven thunders have spoken; and write them not. If the holy preaching had not been written, how would it have come to us? It seems therefore that we should understand in this place only a specific kind of writing; for one should know that the reason why we shut something under seal is in order that it should not be open to all, but that it may be loosed in due time for those we trust; whereas what we write openly, we bring to the knowledge of all. Therefore we are ordered not to divulge the mysteries of God's words to everyone indiscriminately, but to supply them with measure and as though from under a seal, according to how able we see people are to receive them; and we are ordered to give milk to drink to some people, and solid food to others. [Ref. to 1 Cor. 3:1-2] The divine mysteries are also shut under a protective seal in order that they should not be disclosed to people who were not going to believe in them at all, because when they do not accept them, they start laughing at them.
