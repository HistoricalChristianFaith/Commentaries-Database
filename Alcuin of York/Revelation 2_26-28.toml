And he that shall overcome, and keep my works unto the end, I will give him power over the nations. And he shall rule them with a rod of iron, and as the vessel of a potter they shall be broken, as I also have received of my Father. The Son did not receive this power from the Father in his divinity, but in his humanity, in which he is inferior to the Father; whence this: All power is given to me in heaven and in earth; [Matt. 28:18] and since the elect are his limbs, they also receive this power in their Head, according to this: Whatsoever you shall bind upon earth, shall be bound also in heaven, etc. [Matt. 18:18] By the rod of iron is represented the authority of preachers; for a rod of iron has straightness without weakness: so are the holy preachers capable neither of sparing themselves nor others when it comes to fighting vices, but they only strive to build the path of justice in themselves and others; whence it is said to Christ: The rod of thy kingdom is a straight rod. [Variant of Ps. 44:7] It is appropriate for believers to be compared to earthen vessels, for they are vessels in that they bear the treasure hidden from eternity, and they are earthen because they are burdened by the decay of the flesh; whence the apostle: We have this treasure in earthen vessels. [2 Cor. 4:7] As for the fact that these vessels are said to be broken when touched by the rod, we should understand here a part of the vessels that is still being destroyed in order to be remoulded for the better. Hence it is said to the potter of mankind: Turn the wicked, and they shall not be, [Prov. 12:7] implying “they shall not be wicked, but good.” Now what is meant by the first words, he that shall overcome, and keep my works unto the end? Is no one ruling believers until he triumphs over the Devil by reaching the end? Or maybe he will rule afterwards? Therefore one should know that the Lord, using the future instead of the past, is indicating that those to whom he proclaims he will give power over the nations, have already overcome by the grace of predestination, and have already kept his works unto the end; as if he were saying, “I will rightly give the duty of ruling to the one who I find out for certain is victorious and will continue my works unto the end.” This is because for him the future is the present. And I will give him the morning star. In the sacred Scripture, the morning star in the singular signifies Christ (whence he says later, I am the morning star) [Rev. 22:16] and in the plural it signifies angels. So the Lord will give the morning star to those who overcome, when he remoulds the body of our humility, that is, when all those who are in the graves hear the voice of the Lord and come forth: [John 5:28-29] he will bring them to the perfect day [Prov. 4:18] when he shows them the brightness of his divinity.
