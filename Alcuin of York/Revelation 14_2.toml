QUESTION: And the voice which I heard, was as the voice of harpers, harping on their harps. ANSWER: While God's harpers are all the saints, who crucify their flesh with the vices and concupiscences [Gal. 5:24] and praise him with psaltery and harp, [Ps. 150:3] how much more those who by the privilege of evangelical chastity make all of themselves a holocaust to the Lord, deny themselves singularly, and, taking up their cross, will follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth! [Matt. 16:24, Luke 9:23, Rev. 14:4] (14:3) THERE FOLLOWS: And they sang as it were a new canticle before the throne. ANSWER: The old canticle was, Blessed is he that hath seed in Sion and household in Jerusalem, [Is. 31:9 acc. to LXX] but the new one is, Rejoice, thou barren, that bearest not, [Gal. 4:27, Is. 54:1 (the latter acc. to LXX)] and also, I will give to the eunuchs in my house, says the Lord, and within my walls, a place, and a name better than sons and daughters. [Is. 56:4-5] QUESTION: And no man could say the canticle, but those hundred forty-four thousand, who were purchased from the earth. ANSWER: To have the singular privilege to sing the canticle with the Lamb means to rejoice with him forever more than all the other faithful because even one's flesh is uncorrupted. The rest of the elect can nonetheless hear this canticle, although they cannot say it; out of love, they are naturally happy to see them in that high status, even though they themselves cannot rise to the level of their rewards. (14:4) THERE FOLLOWS: These were purchased from among men, the first fruits to God and to the Lamb. ANSWER: Out of the holy and immaculate flock of the Church, they are chosen by the Holy Spirit, for the merits of their will, as yet holier and purer sacrifices. The apostle, having no commandment of the Lord concerning them, [1 Cor. 7:25] beseeches them to present their bodies as a living sacrifice, holy, pleasing unto God. [Rom. 12:1]
