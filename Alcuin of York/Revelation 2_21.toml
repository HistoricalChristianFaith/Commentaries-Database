And I gave her a time that she might do penance, and she will not repent of her fornication. Hence it is said by blessed Job concerning any reprobate, The Lord hath given him place for penance, and he abuseth it unto pride. [Variant of Job 24:23] Now, since in the previous verse he blamed the sluggish preacher for Jezabel's fornication, why is it not said, “I gave you and her,” but only her? Especially since the apostle affirms that not only those who do evil, but also those who consent to those who do it, must be punished with eternal death. [Rom. 1:32] One should know therefore that God's speech is passing from species to genus, and it is as if in it he covertly blamed as unrepentant the reprobate part of the species that he had overtly reproved above, so that one and the same species appears now guilty, now worthy, when it is blamed both overtly as negligent and non-overtly as unrepentant. He did this in order that the part of the species that consists of holy preachers should not seem to be joined to the one that is part of the reprobates.
