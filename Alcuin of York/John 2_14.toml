Zeal, taken in a good sense, is acertain fervor of the Spirit, by which the mind, all human fears forgotten, is stirred up to thedefense of the truth.
To take the passage mystically, God enters His Church spiritually every day, and marks each one’s behavior there. Let us be careful then, when we are in God’s Church, that we indulge not in stories, or jokes, or hatreds, or lusts, leston a sudden He come and scourge us, and drive us out of His Church.
