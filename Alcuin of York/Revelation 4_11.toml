Thou art worthy, O Lord our God, to receive glory, and honour, and power, as if they were saying, “These things principally fit thee, from whom, by whom, and in whom is the glory, honor, and power of the saints.” Yet, what is meant by what follows, because thou hast created all things; and for thy will they were, and have been created? If they have been created, how can they have been before they were created? One should know then that they were in the predestination before they came into being in deed.
