As for what follows, And they had breastplates as breastplates of iron, it indicates their hearts, which are hard and obdurate against the truth so that they may not be penetrated by the arrow of truth. And the noise of their wings was as the noise of chariots, the noise of many horses running to battle. By the wings of the locusts we understand the proud science of the heretics. It is fitting to say that the noise of these wings is like that of the chariots of horses that are many and run together to battle: the heretics both divide themselves with their doctrines and fight together against the Church.
