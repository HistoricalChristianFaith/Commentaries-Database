The Father glorified the Son, at His baptism, on the mount, at the time of His passion, when a voice came to Him, in the midst of the crowd, when Heraised Him up again after His passion, and placed Him at the right hand of His Majesty.
As if to say, you call Him your God, after a carnal manner, serving Him for temporal rewards. You have not known Him, as He should be known; you are notable to serve Him spiritually.
