Who hath given testimony to the word of God, and the testimony of Jesus Christ, what things soever he hath seen. John gave testimony then, and now the Church does, whose symbol he was bearing when he saw this Apocalypse. He makes a distinction between the Word and Jesus Christ because of the two substances of Christ — he who gave testimony to both, saying, in the beginning was the Word, [John 1:1] as well as the Word was made flesh. [Ibid. 14] Saw refers to both: for he saw the Word with his spiritual eyes, and with his physical eyes he saw everything that is told about his humanity.
