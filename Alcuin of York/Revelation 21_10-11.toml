QUESTION: And he took me up in spirit to a great mountain: and he shewed me the holy city Jerusalem. ANSWER: After the fall of Babylon, the holy city, which is the bride of the Lamb, is seen on the mountain, for the stone cut out of a mountain without hands has broken in pieces the effigy of worldly glory, and has grown into a great mountain, and filled the whole world. [Dan. 2:34-35] THERE FOLLOWS: Coming down out of heaven from God, having the glory of God. ANSWER: It will indeed appear more beautiful when, by the Spirit by which its bridegroom is believed to have been conceived and engendered, it has gained fully to have a heavenly appearance.
