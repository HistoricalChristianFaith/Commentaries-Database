I counsel thee to buy gold fire-tried, that thou mayest be made rich. Gold in this passage is taken to mean God's wisdom incarnate, concerning which it is said elsewhere, Take wisdom as gold. [Variant of Prov. 16:16] It is right for this gold to be called fire-tried, because our Redeemer was tested by the fire of the Passion. The meaning is: If you want to be rich in virtues, take me as an example, so that you too may become gold melted by fire. Now what price shall a poor person give for this gold but a pious state of mind in his prayer? To him it is said in addition: and mayest be clothed in white garments, that the shame of thy nakedness may not appear. Someone is clothed in white garments to cover the shame of their nakedness when they buy gold fire-tried, convert to a new life to avoid the shame of lukewarmness, and deserve, thanks to their imitation of him, to be connected with the new and heavenly man. And anoint thy eyes with eye salve, that thou mayest see. As if it were saying: Apply the divine commandments to your blind mind, so that you may see the nakedness in virtues you are suffering from and hurry to cover it. Indeed, if the divine commandments were not eye salve, the Psalmist would not say, The commandment of the Lord is lightsome, enlightening the eyes. [Ps. 18:9] Eye salve, which is made from earth and removes the dust of the earth from the eyes, may represent the temporal poverty our Redeemer assumed for us. Therefore let him who has his eyes blinded with dust put eye salve on them to recover sight, that is, let him who gets lost due to earthly pleasures bring back to his mind his Redeemer's temporal poverty, so that he may contemplate with his inward eyes the future rewards of the saints.
