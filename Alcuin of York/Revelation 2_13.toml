I know where thou dwellest, where the seat of Satan is. This is said to the Church generally, which dwells throughout the whole world, in which the Devil reigns. And thou holdest fast my name, and hast not denied my faith. Even in those days Antipas my faithful witness, who was slain among you, where Satan dwelleth. This sentence either was corrupted by scribes' fault, or it must be explained by some words being left implied, so that the order of words should be the following: “In those days, Antipas my faithful witness, who was slain among you, did not deny my faith;” or if not, then certainly “In those days there was Antipas my witness, who was slain among you.” In this martyr, it is all witnesses that are praised by the proclamation of their merits. He says among you not because he was slain by them, but among them by those in whom Satan dwells. Note also that first comes thou holdest in the singular, and then comes you in the plural, because he is addressing several in one person.
