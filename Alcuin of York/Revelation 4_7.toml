And the first living creature was like a lion: and the second living creature like a calf: and the third living creature, having the face, as it were, of a man: and the fourth living creature was like an eagle flying. We should ask the question of why John said that the first living creature was like a lion while Ezekiel says that the appearance of man was in the first animal. So, either the historical order (which the mystical words of the Scriptures do not always keep) has been changed, or he put the symbol of the lion first because it is not on account of the Nativity or of the Passion that people have believed in Christ, but on account of the Resurrection, which is symbolized by the lion. Finally, since he began with the human generation, [Sc. of Jesus. Matt. 1:1 et seq.] Matthew is appropriately represented by the man; since he began with the cry in the desert, [Mark 1:3] Mark is appropriately represented by the lion; since he started with a sacrifice, [Luke 1:8] Luke is well represented by the calf; and John, who began with the divinity, [John 1:1 et seq.] is fittingly represented by the eagle. All this can also refer to Christ and all his limbs. However, for brevity's sake, let us content ourselves with what we have said here.
