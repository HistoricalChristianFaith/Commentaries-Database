And all the angels stood round about the throne, and the ancients, and the four living creatures; and they fell down before the throne upon their faces. The angels as well as the throne and the ancients, and also the living creatures, symbolize the Church. Therefore he symbolizes one and the same thing in various ways: for since Christ alone reigns and judges in the Church, it is right for all the saints to be symbolized by one throne; since the Church itself also examines the acts of others, it is appropriate for it to be symbolized by ancients; and since it is sticking to the green pastures of the paradise, still only by faith in some of its members, and already enjoys them by sight in some other members, it is right for it to be symbolized by animals. Then, since it announces all things to come in its preaching, it is fitting for it to be symbolized by angels; and since it is brought together from various nations, it is right for it to be symbolized by a multitude. So they fell down upon their faces before the throne, that is, in the secret of their minds, where the inner judge sits. And adored, saying: Amen. Benediction, and glory, and wisdom, and thanksgiving, and honour, and power, and strength to our God for ever and ever. All these things correspond well to the Trinity.
