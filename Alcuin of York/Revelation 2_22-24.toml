Behold, I put her into a bed: and they that commit adultery with her shall be in very great tribulation, except they do penance from their deeds. And I will kill her children unto death. Jezabel, those who fornicate in her, and her children are one body, that of Satan, which is put in a bed not in order that it may rest, but that it may run into madness: for by the name of bed are meant the audacity and feeling of security to commit wrongs. She is said to be put in it by God not because he himself impels her, but because he does not snatch her away from this illusion of security by punishing her; and since increases of vices are like some kinds of torments, it is right for the bed to be called a great tribulation. The bed may also indicate eternal torment; it seems to me this is why another translator put “mourning” instead of bed. And the churches shall know that I am he that searcheth the reins and hearts. By the reins he wants us to understand the very perpetrated wickedness of physical lust, because the seed of human conception comes from the loins of men. By the word hearts he wants us to understand incitements to spiritual adultery. Whence the Psalmist: Burn my reins and my heart. [Ps. 25:2] But can it be that before the Lord publicly unmasks idolaters and fornicators and massacres them, the Church does not know that he is the Knower of secrets? Or how can it be called Church, if it gets to know it by this outcome of events rather than by faith? We should therefore hold the firm belief that, as far as the present state of things is concerned, they are punished with a hidden death, so that the meaning should be the following: When I condemn the reprobates hiddenly and secretly, even then the faithful do not doubt that I know the actions of everyone. And I will give to every one of you according to his works. He comes back from species to genus. There is nothing more to be explained here, but there is more to be feared. To you I say, to the rest who are at Thyatira: Whosoever have not this doctrine, and who have not known the depth of Satan. In this passage the discourse returns to the elect. By the depth of Satan we should understand his ruinous pride, because of which he was the first to carry himself high and swell with vanity against God. The elect are said not to know this pride, that is, not to agree to take it as an example to imitate; in the same way as the sacred Scripture says that unmarried women have not known men, which means that they have no experience whatsoever of the actions of men in sexual acts, and in the same way as we say that a truthful person knows nothing about lying. As they say, I will not put upon you any other burthen. Who are those who say this but the peoples of the Jews, who say that the observances of the old law are being put on the shoulders of believers? Whence Luke the evangelist: Some coming down from Judea, taught the brethren: That except you be circumcised after the manner of Moses, you cannot be saved. [Acts 15:1]
