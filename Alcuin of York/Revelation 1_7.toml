Behold, he cometh with the clouds. If we are to take this literally, when the Lord comes for the judgment, there will be a white cloud overshadowing the saints to protect them from the fire burning the world. This cloud will be frightening, and the reprobates will be terrified by its din. However, hardly anything in this Apocalypse is to be taken literally. So, in the sacred Scripture, when clouds are mentioned in the plural, they represent the holy preachers, who are light by the cleanness of their minds, and keep watering the hearts of their listeners with drops of preaching. Therefore it is with these clouds that the Lord will come for the judgment, according to this saying of the prophet: Behold, the Lord comes for the judgment with the ancients of his people. [Variant of Is. 3:14] And every eye shall see him, and they also that pierced him. Every eye shall see him, that is, every man shall (the whole is meant by a part) who shall then have been resurrected, either to life or to death — but not the eyes of animals, to which it is not given to rise again after death. Every man shall see him in the form of a servant in which he was judged by the wicked, not in the form of the divinity, which cannot be seen by the wicked. Note also that another translator says, “all the earth shall see him such,” as if he were saying, “such as the wicked did not believe he would be when he was here.” And all the tribes of the earth shall bewail themselves because of him. In this place it is to be noted that he says with an addition, the tribes of the earth, as if he were saying “those who long for earthly things and devote themselves to greed,” to whom it is said, Woe to you that are rich, [Luke 6:24] as well as, Woe to you that laugh. [Ibid. 25] As for what the cause of their pain is, it is disclosed with the words because of him: for even though there will then be mourning due to many afflictions, it will be nothing compared to the lamentation caused by the sight of Christ's glory; for the unfortunate will then feel more pained by the fact that they have lost such a Lord than by the fact that they have fallen into the most atrocious torment. Now, look: he confirms the things that have been said with the insertion of an oath, when he adds, Even so. Amen. Amen is for the Hebrews what even so is for us. Both are adverbs of affirmation: therefore he says Even so. Amen as if he were saying with duplication, “It is true. It is true.”
