And to the angel of the church of Laodicea, write: These things saith the Amen, the faithful and true witness, who is the beginning of the creation of God. Amen translates to “true,” which we should take as referring to that Truth which said about itself, I am the truth. [John 14:6] Although the Lord has many faithful and true witnesses, it is appropriate for him to be called the faithful and true one as if he were the only one, because compared to him no one is faithful and truthful: for he is faithful, truthful, and good by nature, whereas we are so because he shares those qualities with us. As for how it is that the Son alone is called the witness when there are three that give testimony, [1 John 5:7] it has already been explained in the first book. Finally, the Son is called the beginning of the creation of God because it is from him that all things have got the beginning of existence; for, as it is written, All things were made by him. [John 1:3]
