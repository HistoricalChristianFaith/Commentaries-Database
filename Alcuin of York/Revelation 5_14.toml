And the four living creatures said: Amen. And the four and twenty ancients fell down on their faces, and adored him that liveth for ever and ever. Since the living creatures and the ancients are one, that is one Church, the living creatures fall down and adore him with the ancients, and the ancients confirm with the living creatures that the praises are true, replying Amen in an affirmative expression. Their fall and adoration, as already said, must be taken as spiritual. Now, so that we should not get tired beyond measure by going on too long, let us put an end to this book here.
