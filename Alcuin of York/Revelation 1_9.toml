I John, your brother and your partner in tribulation, and in the kingdom, and patience in Christ Jesus, was in the island, which is called Patmos, for the word of God, and for the testimony of Jesus. In this place John represents both his own person specifically and that of the Church generally. It is also to be noted that the kingdom pertains to the Head, tribulation to the limbs, and patience to both, and all this can be found in Jesus alone. Indeed, the Head was suffering tribulation with the limbs when he said, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? [Acts 9:4]. The kingdom is in the Head, as in Come, ye blessed of my Father, possess you the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world, [Matt. 25:34] which is like saying clearly, “Come, ye limbs, reign with the Head, because I am the kingdom.” For he will grant himself to his people, as it is written: The oath, which he swore to Abraham our father, that he would grant (himself) to us [Luke 1:73]. Patience awaits us, according to this: Knowest thou not, that the benignity of God leadeth thee to patience? [Variant of Rom. 2:4], and we, in our patience, shall possess our souls. [Cf. Luke 21:19] By the island of Patmos, which translates to “strait,” in which John was in exile, are represented the persecutions and hardships suffered by John and the Church (that is, a species and a genus) but for the Word of God, not for their own bad actions, according to this saying of the apostle Peter: Let none of you suffer as a thief, [1 Pet. 4:15] but as a disciple of Christ.
