But I have against thee a few things: thou hast there them that hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balac to cast a stumbling block before the children of Israel, to eat, and to commit fornication. These things do not at all correspond to the one to whom he had previously said, “Thou holdest fast my name”, etc.; but the speech turns towards another species. What he calls the doctrine of Balaam is the advice he gave Balac to put very beautiful women before the children of Israel so that, delighted by their looks, they might rush into forbidden embraces; enticed by their flatteries, they might eat of Beelphegor's sacrifices; and because of this be forsaken by God and fall before their enemies. [Num. 31:16] Now if we turn from the literal meaning to the symbol, we find how things happened afterwards or are still to happen. Balaam indeed translates to “varying people;” whence it suitably indicates the heretics, who are weakened by their divergent errors. As for Balac, it translates to “knocking out”, and by him are represented the powers of this world, which (most of the time on the advice of heretics) bring the dignity of the Church down for a time. By Israel, “man seeing the Lord God,” are symbolized the elect. So, on Balaam's advice, Balac casts before the children of Israel the stumbling block (that is the deception) of women so that they should eat of things sacrificed to idols and fornicate with them, because, on the heretics' advice, the princes of this world present in their discourses on the outside the sects of the heretics as if they were beautiful, while we know that they are full of all filth inside. Alternatively, Balaam, that is the Devil, teaches Balac, that is the flesh, to cast women, that is pleasures of the world, for souls to perish from.
