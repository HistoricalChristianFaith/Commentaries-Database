And they cried with a loud voice, saying. We understand here not a cry of the body, but of the heart: this great voice is a great feeling of devotion, because one cries with their voice more the more they love God. Salvation to our God, who sitteth upon the throne, and to the Lamb. The order can also be, “To our God, and to the Lamb who sitteth upon the throne, salvation.” The person of the Holy Spirit is also understood in them, according to the rule already mentioned. Note also that they show with a wonderful way of speaking that there is one substance and two persons in the Father and the Son. Moreover, one should know that, as they ascribe all their salvation to God, the doctrine of Pelagius and Caelestius is gotten rid of, who uphold free will to such an extent that they say people can be saved without the grace of God.
