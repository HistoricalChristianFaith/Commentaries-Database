QUESTION: What is meant by what he says to the angel of the church of Sardis, I know thy works, that thou hast the name of being alive: and thou art dead? ANSWER: To yourself you do look alive, but if you are not watchful in the correction of the wicked, you shall soon be counted among the dead, because it is no use for leaders to live a good life themselves if they fail to correct others; which is also why Solomon says, Thou shalt not give sleep to thy eyes, neither slumber to thy eyelids. [Variant of Prov. 6:4]
