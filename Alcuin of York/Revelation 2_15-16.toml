So hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the Nicolaites. Enough has already been said concerning the deeds of the Nicolaites. When he says not “thou hast there” but so hast thou also, he shows that the speech is turning from one species to another. Now since it makes no difference whether one is convicted of tolerating in silence the doctrine of Balaam or that of the Nicolaites, it is suitably said after that, In like manner do penance. With these words are also secretly invited to penance those whom the same sluggish preachers are reprimanded for having completely failed to correct; whence it is also said after that, If not, I come to thee, and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth. Why indeed does he not say “I will fight against thee” but I will fight against them, if not because, as already said, he is exhorting to come to lamentation of their faults also those who he knew had perished because of the sluggishness of the preachers? Which is the same as if he said, “I come to thee, and will fight against thee,” as another translation shows, or “I come to you all, and will fight against you.” Now what does it mean to say I come to thee, if not “I make thee feel consideration for my wrath?” Or what does it mean to say I will fight against them with the sword of my mouth, if not “I will damn them with the sharp sentences of my words?”
