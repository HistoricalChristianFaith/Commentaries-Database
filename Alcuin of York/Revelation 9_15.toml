And the four angels were loosed, who were prepared for an hour, and a day, and a month, and a year: for to kill the third part of men. The loosing of these angels represents the beginning of the last persecution. He says prepared, because the Devil is always waiting for the good's failure. By an hour, a day, a month, and a year we understand by metalepsis four times, namely three years and six months, during which that persecution will rage. The third part of men of which it is said that it will be killed consists of superiors and inferiors, that is of persuaders and persuaded, because the dead will kill the dead.
