And I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne, a book written within and without. By the one sitting on the throne is indicated the person of the Father, and by the right hand of the one sitting, the same Father's Son through whom all things were made, and concerning whom it is said by the voice of the Father, I will lift up my hand to heaven, and I will swear by my right hand. [Deut. 32:40 acc. to LXX.] As for the book written within and without, it seems to contain both Testaments, namely the Old and the New; and while the Old was open without with regards to its literal meaning, with regards to its mystical meaning, it was hiding the New within. Alternatively, written within, the book represents the allegory, and written without it represents the history. The reason why the Old and the New Testament are said to be one book is that neither can the New be separated from the Old nor the Old from the New. It is right for the book to be said to be in his right hand, because the principal focus of the divine Scriptures is on the plan of our Redeemer. Sealed with seven seals. The number seven often indicates totality. The book is said to be sealed with seven seals because the plan of the Savior Lord, before it had been revealed in the fullness of the time, [Cf. Gal. 4:4] lay concealed in the divine volumes by a fullness of all sorts of hidden mysteries. If there is someone for whom this interpretation is not enough, let them know that in the seven seals are encompassed the seven moods of verbs: the indicative, as in this answer given to the prophet: I am the Lord that speak justice; [Is. 45:19] the enunciative, as in Hearken to me, O Jacob, and thou Israel whom I call, etc.; [Is. 48:12] the imperative, as in Cry, cease not; [Is. 58:1] the optative, like in O that thou hadst hearkened to my commandments!; [Is. 48:18] the conjunctive, as in If you will keep my covenant, you shall be my peculiar possession; [Ex. 19:5] the infinitive, as in To abstain from evil, is understanding; [Job 28:28 acc. to LXX.] and impersonal, such as in Who shall declare the powers of the Lord? [Ps. 105:2]

QUESTION: What is meant by And I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne, a book written within and without? ANSWER: This vision represents the mysteries of the holy Scripture disclosed to us by the incarnation of the Lord. It is as if the Scripture's concordant unity contained the Old Testament outside and the New inside. THERE FOLLOWS: Sealed with seven seals. ANSWER: It means either covered with all the fullness of its hidden mysteries or written by the disposition of the sevenfold Spirit. Indeed the entire series of the Old and of the New Testament warns us that we should do penance for our sins, seek the kingdom of heaven, and flee the tears of hell.
