Therefore they are before the throne, and they serve him day and night in his temple: and he, that sitteth on the throne, dwelleth over them. As if he were saying, “The same people are the throne of God and his temple because we see they are clothed in this kind of garments and have been cleansed by the blood of the Lamb.” Note also that he does not say “dwelleth in them” but over them in order to show that they are the throne and the temple at the same time. By day and night he means in success and in adversity.
