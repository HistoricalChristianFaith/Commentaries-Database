And they prevailed not, neither was their place found any more in heaven. How can it be said that evil spirits prevail not, while they deceive many people, and people who used to be the Redeemer’s dwelling become the deceiver's place? Therefore by the whole we should understand a part, over which the multitude of evil spirits cannot prevail to cause their eternal death; for one gives a place to the old enemy when one commits a deadly fault. Or if it is not this, then surely this prophecy refers to the time of the Antichrist, when they have been driven away from among the elect and have no time to deceive any more.
