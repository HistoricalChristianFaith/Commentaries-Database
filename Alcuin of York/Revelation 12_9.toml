And that great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, who is called the devil and Satan, who seduceth the whole world; he was cast unto the earth, and his angels were thrown down with him. Our enemy is called a dragon because of his evilness, great because of the hugeness of his wickedness, a serpent because of his snares, old because of the long duration of his deception, and devil because of his fall from heaven and his accusation of the faithful and elect: indeed, devil means both “flowing downwards” and “slanderer;” as for Satan, it means “adversary.” In saying who seduceth the whole world, he mentioned the whole to mean a part. So, where was the dragon cast from, and where to, if not from heaven to the earth, that is from the minds of the elect into the hearts of the reprobates? Not that he was not already in them before, but once he has been driven out of the elect, he rules over the reprobates all the more.
