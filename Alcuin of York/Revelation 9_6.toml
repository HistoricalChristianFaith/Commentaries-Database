And in those days men shall seek death, and shall not find it: they shall desire to die, and death shall fly from them. The days in question run all the way from the Lord's coming to the end of the world. Indeed the elect seek death when they want to stick to God through a retired way of life; but death flies from them because they are bound either by the indissoluble chain of a responsibility of government or by that of an inferior status.
