He, that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches: He that shall overcome, shall not be hurt by the second death. When the sacred Scripture usually mentions three deaths, namely one of sin, one of the flesh, and one of damnation, why is the last damnation in this passage not called the third, but the second death, if not because it seems that here are mentioned only the deaths that are demonstrated to harm? Namely the death of sin and the death of eternal punishment, compared to which that of the flesh is not worthy to be called death. By the word hurting, we should understand decay in afflictions.
