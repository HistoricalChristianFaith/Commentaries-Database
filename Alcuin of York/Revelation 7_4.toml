And I heard the number of them that were signed, an hundred forty-four thousand were signed, of every tribe of the children of Israel. It is a definite number put for an indefinite one, and it does not refer only to the twelve tribes of Israel, but all the Church, in the elect, is represented by it. Indeed the number three is a perfect number in the sacred Scripture, especially because it represents the Trinity; same for the number four because of the four parts of the world, the four Gospels, or the four cardinal virtues: if we multiply these by each other, we reach the number twelve, which also is hallowed because of the twelve tribes or the twelve apostles. As for the number thousand, it represents totality, according to this: unto a thousand generations. [Deut. 7:9, 1 Chron. 16:15, Ps. 104:8] Therefore, since the Church is brought together from all nations by knowledge of the Trinity and nourished by the four books of the Gospels, it is appropriate for it to be symbolized by twelve thousand; but in order for it to be perfected in what it has believed in, the number twelve thousand needs to be joined together by the solidity of the cube: therefore, let twelve thousand be multiplied by four, and it makes forty-eight thousand; then, in order for it to reach what it has believed in, that is the contemplation of the Trinity, let forty-eight thousand be multiplied by three, and it gives a hundred forty-four thousand.

QUESTION: What is meant by And I heard the number of them that were signed, an hundred forty-four thousand were signed, of every tribe of the children of Israel? ANSWER: By this finite number is signified the innumerable multitude of the whole Church, which was born of the patriarchs through imitation, whether by lineage of the flesh or by lineage of faith — for, he says, If you be Christ's, then are you the seed of Abraham. [Gal. 3:29] It conduces to an increase in perfection that the number twelve itself is multiplied by twelve, and completed, to form the entire sum, by the number thousand, which is the cube number of ten, signifying the stable life of the Church. The reason why the Church is often symbolized by the number twelve is that it is present throughout the world, which is divided into four parts, and it is based on faith in the holy Trinity; for three times four make twelve. Finally, the apostles chosen to preach the same faith to the world were also twelve in number, symbolizing by their number the mystery of their work. So, of the tribe of Juda were twelve thousand signed. It is fitting for him to start with Juda, which is the tribe that our Lord was born of, and to omit Dan, which it is said that the Antichrist will be born of (as it is written: Let Dan be a snake in the way, a serpent in the path, that biteth the horse's heels that his rider may fall); [Gen. 49:17] for it is not the order of earthly generation that he decided to present here, but the virtues of the Church, according to the interpretations of the names — the Church, which, with its present confession and praise, hastens to the right hand which is eternal life: this is indeed what the names Juda, who is put first, and Benjamin, who is put last, mean. So Juda, which translates to “confession” or “laudation,” is put first because no one lays hold of the summit of goods before the beginning of confession, and if we do not renounce bad actions through confession, we cannot be instructed for right actions. Second comes Ruben, which translates to “he who sees the child.” The Psalmist testifies that what is indicated by children is works, as he says in the blessings of the blessed man, Thy children as young plants of olive-trees, [Ps. 127:3] and also, And mayest thou see thy children's children; [Ibid. 6] for it is not because someone who fears the Lord has not begotten children and had grandchildren that he cannot be blessed, since a greater reward awaits the virgin faithful; but by children, the Psalmist means works, and by one's children's children, the fruits of one's works, that is the eternal reward. Therefore after Juda comes Ruben, that is, after the beginnings of divine confession and praise comes perfection of action. Yet, since through many tribulations we must enter into the kingdom of God, [Acts 14:21] after Ruben follows Gad, which translates to “temptation” or “girded.” After the beginning of good work, a person must be tested with greater temptations and gird themselves for harder battles, so that the strength of their faith may be tested. As Solomon says, Son, when thou comest to the service of God, stand in justice and in fear; prepare thy soul for temptation. [Sir. 2:1] Then, since we consider blessed those who have endured suffering, after Gad comes Aser, which means “blessed.” This order is fitting enough, for blessed is the man that endureth temptation; for when he hath been proved, he shall receive a crown of life. [James 1:12] Now, since, feeling secure because of the faithful promise of this blessedness, they do not feel afflicted, but, rejoicing in hope and patient in tribulation, they sing together with the Psalmist, I have run the way of thy commandments, when thou didst enlarge my heart, [Ps. 118:32] and say, rejoicing with the mother of blessed Samuel, My mouth is enlarged over my enemies: because I have joyed in thy salvation, [1 Sam. 2:1] for this reason, next comes Nephthali, which means “wideness.” Nephthali himself is followed by Manasses, which translates to “having forgotten” or “necessity.” By the mystery of this name, we are told, taught by the torments of present temptations, to forget the things that are behind and to stretch forth, like the Apostle, to those that are before, [Phil. 3:13] without making provision for the flesh in its concupiscences, [Rom. 13:14] but only when we are forced to by the necessity of human condition, which the Psalmist was talking about when he prayed, sighing for better things, Deliver me from my necessities. [Ps. 24:17] After this one comes Simeon, which means “He has heard sorrow” or “the name of the dwelling,” so that by the nature of this word too he may inculcate in us the more evidently both what we must get here and what we must expect to good effect; for the joy of the heavenly dwelling will be given to those whose minds are here saddened with a fruitful penitence. It is also said to these people, Your sorrow shall be turned into joy. [John 16:20] Then follows Levi, which means “added,” in whom we understand either those who buy eternal things at the cost of temporal ones (as Solomon says, The ransom of a man's life are his riches) [Prov. 13:8] or those who, because they follow God's counsel, receive a hundredfold in this world with tribulations, and in the world to come life everlasting. [Mark 10:30] These people are also being referred to in what is written: He that addeth knowledge, addeth labour. [Eccles. 1:18] Indeed the reason why tribulations were heaped on saint Job was in order for a bigger reward to be rendered to him once he had been successfully tested. Whence it is not without reason that Issachar, which translates to “reward,” comes directly after this one; because, as the apostle teaches us, The sufferings of this time are not worthy to be compared with the glory to come, that shall be revealed in us. [Rom. 8:18] Indeed battle is fought more effectively when a sure reward is expected. God works and completes all this in the dwelling of strength, which is what Zabulon means, when power is made perfect in infirmity [2 Cor. 12:9] so that a body that is thought weak by one's enemies, and through whose matter they try to inflict death on the soul as well, turns out to be invincible when God strengthens it. There follows a happy increase, which is what the name Joseph means, denoting more gifts of graces to be given, whether you understand by this the spiritual interests gained from the twofold return of the talents, [Ref. to Matt. 25:14-30] or whether you take it to mean those rendered to God the Redeemer by the faithful's votive piety. Then, so that you may understand that all these people, whose order and names' interpretations both show that they have been placed here in a way that signifies something, will be on the right hand of Christ the eternal King in the future judgment, in last position, as we said earlier, comes Benjamin, which means “son of the right hand,” as if he were the end of the sequence, when the last enemy, death, has been destroyed, [Cf. 1 Cor. 15:26] and the elect are given the eternal happiness of their inheritance — whether it is every one of the faithful that is entitled to be called “son of the right hand,” or the whole assembly of the Church, about which we sing, The queen stood on thy right hand, in gilded clothing; surrounded with variety. [Ps. 44:10] So, there are twelve thousand signed out of each tribe because whatever virtues every one of the faithful has succeeded in, they must necessarily always be strengthened by the faith of the ancient fathers and instructed by their examples. It is indeed absolutely certain that the number twelve often represents either the teachers or the whole Church, because of the total number of the apostles or of the patriarchs; for whether the individual faithful are praiseworthy in confession, like in Juda; outstanding in offspring of works in Ruben; strong in the trial of temptations in Gad; successful by their victory in battles in Aser; enlarged by bountiful works of compassion in Nephthali; forgetting the things that are behind in Manasses; or as though sad thus far in the valley of tears, but always rejoicing in the name of the dwelling, and sighing for the heavenly Jerusalem in Simeon; whether those in Levi, who rejoice in the promises both of the present life and of the future one, as they receive temporal goods in addition, while having the eternal good as their foundation; those in Issachar, who are strengthened by the contemplation of the future reward; those in Zabulon, who lay down their lives for Christ; those in Joseph, who also strive after an increase in spiritual substance, and offer something more in addition to God's commandments, whether in virginity or from their resources; or those in Benjamin, who seek with tireless wishes after the right hand which is eternal happiness, it is fitting that each of these, in their own calling, be marked by the rule of the preceding fathers as though by the number twelve, and that from the merits of all individuals there be reckoned the most perfect beauty of the Church, as the sum of a hundred forty-four thousand.
