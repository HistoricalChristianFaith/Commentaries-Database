He, that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches: To him that overcometh, I will give the hidden manna. By the hidden manna he means the invisible bread that came down from heaven and was made man so that man might eat the bread of angels. [Cf. John 6:51; Ps. 77:24-25] This manna is now consumed in the sacrament by faith, and will someday be consumed in reality by sight, according to this saying of the Psalmist: I shall be filled when thy glory shall appear to me. [Variant of Ps. 16:15] Indeed if we translate manna, it means “What is this?”, which we say only of a thing we have not seen before. Therefore it is appropriate for that satiety of heavenly glory to be called manna, because, according to Paul's words, neither hath eye seen, nor hath it entered into the heart of man, what things God hath prepared for them that love him. [Part of 1 Cor. 2:9] And will give him a white counter, and in the counter, a new name, which no man knoweth, but he that receiveth it. The counter is a precious stone which is also called carbuncle, because this stone is said to do the same as a kindled piece of coal, which shines in the darkness with the size in which it stopped. Therefore, what is indicated by the white counter but Jesus Christ, who appeared clean among men without any dark stain of sin, and illuminated the darkness of our mortality with the light of his divinity? The meaning is: I will make the one who triumphs over the author of death my coheir in the Father's kingdom. Another translation has “pearl” instead of counter. The new name he is talking about is “Christian,” which was previously unheard of, concerning which the Lord says through Isaiah to the Church, Thou shalt be called by a new name, which the mouth of the Lord hath spoken. [Variant of Is. 62:2] Yet, since many who have been overcome by the Devil are called by this name, how is it that he promises to give it only to those who overcome, if not because the gift we must understand here is the one by which we know those who are predestined to life in the heavenly city have been chosen? Here it is suitably said after that, which no man knoweth, but he that receiveth it, as if he were saying, “No one defends the dignity of the Christian name by their life and manners but the one who has gained it through divine predestination to eternal life.” For knowing the name of Christ is about keeping the commandments, while receiving it is traced back to the grace of divine predestination.
