And he had in his hand a little book open. The angel's hand is the working of our salvation, that is Christ's incarnation. The little book open is the declared grace of the New Testament. Note also that if the angel's face had not shone first, he would not be holding the little book open in his hand, because it is in his plan that the whole sum of the Scriptures was revealed. And he set his right foot upon the sea, and his left foot upon the earth. In this sentence, a distinction is shown between preachers and between times: those who are, as it were, the right foot, are the stronger ones who are neither lifted up by success nor thrown down by adversity, and say, The darkness thereof, and the light thereof are alike. [Ps. 138:12] These are set upon the sea, that is, to endure the persecutions of the wicked. As for the left foot, it is those of lesser strength: as they are sent in time of peace, it is as if they were set upon the solidity of the earth. For just as a king sends his stronger men to face the enemy, so does Christ.
