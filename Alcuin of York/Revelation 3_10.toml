Because thou hast kept the word of my patience, etc. The word of patience is what the Lord showed in example when he prayed on the cross for his persecutors, [Luke 23:34] and taught in words, saying, In your patience you shall possess your souls. [Luke 21:19] As for what follows, I will also keep thee from the hour of the temptation, which shall come upon the whole world to try them that dwell upon the earth, it should be taken as referring to the times of the Antichrist, under whom there will be so great a tribulation as has never been from the beginning of the world. [Matt. 24:21] For bodily wounds will be hard, but more grievous will be the miracles of the enemies. But the saints will be preserved from the trial of deception, because they will not be provoked to the negation of Christ.
