John having borne witness that Jesus was the Lamb of God, the disciples who had been hitherto with him, in obedience to his command, followed Jesus: And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus.
The disciples followed behind His back, in order to see Him, and did not see His face. So He turns round, and, as it were, lowers His majesty, that they might be enabled to behold His face.
They do not wish to be under His teaching for a time only, but inquire where He abides; wishing an immediate initiation in the secrets of His word, and afterwards meaning often to visit Him, and obtain fuller instruction. And, in a mystical sense too, they wish to know in whom Christ dwells, that profiting by their example they may themselves become fitto be His dwelling. Or, their seeing Jesus walking, and straightway inquiring where Heresides, is an intimation to us, that we should, remembering His Incarnation, earnestly entreat Him to show us our eternal habitation. The request being so good a one, Christ promises afree and full disclosure. He said to them, Come and see: that is to say, My dwelling is not tobe understood by words, but by works; come, therefore, by believing and working, and thensee by understanding.
Or it would seem that the two disciples who followed Jesus were Andrew and Philip.
