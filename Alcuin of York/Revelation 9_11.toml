And they had over them a king, the angel of the abyss; whose name in Hebrew is Abaddon, and in Greek Apollyon; in Latin Exterminans. The old enemy is not called the king of the wicked because he created them or leads them, but because he exercises the tyranny of his domination over them with God's just permission. Note also that, as already said, they are the abyss. So since he tries deceitfully to usurp the name of Christ for himself through the damned man, he is consequently mentioned by names in the three languages in which the authority of the Gospels attests that the Redeemer's name was written by Pilate on the title. [Luke 23:38 and John 19:19-20] However, since blessed Jerome, in his interpretation of Hebrew names, does not say Abaddon but “Labaddon,” it is certain that it lost its first letter by the fault of scribes. It is also fitting for the Devil to be called Exterminans, because many people are banished from the boundaries of the elect and brought to the exile of eternal death because of him.
