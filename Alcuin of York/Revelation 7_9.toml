After this I saw a great multitude, which no man could number, of all nations, and tribes, and peoples, and tongues. Here it is clearly revealed that the aforementioned number does not only consist of Jews, but of all the elect; for it is the same people that are indicated by the countless multitude and by the hundred forty-four thousand signed. This multitude is not countless for God, but for us; for he himself said, I will number them, and they shall be multiplied above the sand. [Ps. 138:18] Standing before the throne. Although the countless multitude is itself the throne of God, it is nonetheless said to be standing before the throne, because the vision changes as it is obscured by symbols, although the thing represented by the symbols does not change at all. But does it mean something that this multitude is said to be standing whereas the same was described above as sitting with the ancients round about the throne? It clearly does: it is sitting when it examines the acts of others through some of its members, and it is standing when it strengthens its heart in the solidity of faith and love in all its elect. And in sight of the Lamb, clothed with white robes. What is represented by the white robes but their disposition of mind? These robes were not however white before the Lord's coming, because the hearts of mankind were besprinkled with the stains of original sins. And palms in their hands. By the palms is represented victory, and by the hands, work. Therefore to have palms in one's hands means to triumph over the old enemy and the pleasures of the world.
