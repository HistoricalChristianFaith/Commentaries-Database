And they had tails like to scorpions, and there were stings in their tails. Their power was to hurt men five months. We have already spoken about scorpions' tails. Note also that the apostle calls sin a sting. [1 Cor. 15:56] We have already spoken about the five months in the above; but there he is talking about the good, and here about the wicked, because the locusts torment the people mentioned in the previous passage, but do not kill them, whereas they do not torment the people mentioned here, but kill them when they hurt them, either with wrong doctrine or with temporal power.
