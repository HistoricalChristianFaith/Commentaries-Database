And their bodies shall lie in the street of the great city, which is called spiritually, Sodom and Egypt, where their Lord also was crucified. By the fact that the Church of the saints is described as lying dead in the street of the great city, it is shown that it has been strongly afflicted and spiritually laid under its enemies by God's judgment. Note also that we should understand here not only the bodies of those who are killed by the sword but also of those who are still alive, the kind of people about whom the apostle says, for you are dead, etc. [Col. 3:3] Since the persecution will be more cruel in Jerusalem, consequently the martyrdoms of the saints are said to take place there; and here it is shown that it is principally the Jews who will stick to the Antichrist, until those who must be saved are converted when Elijah and Enoch are preaching. That city is called spiritually Egypt and Sodom because of its imitation of them. Also, since that persecution will take place throughout the world, we may understand by this city the whole globe raging against the Church; for the Lord did not suffer his Passion inside that city, but outside its gates, so that he might be believed to have been crucified in the whole world, and to have taken possession of the whole world. By Egypt and Sodom is represented the iniquity of persecutors.
