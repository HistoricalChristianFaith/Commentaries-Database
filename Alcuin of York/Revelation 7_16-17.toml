They shall no more hunger nor thirst, neither shall the sun fall on them, nor any heat. For the Lamb, which is in the midst of the throne, shall rule them, and shall lead them to the fountains of the waters of life. They suffer no trouble, because the Lamb rules them. Now where is he leading them to, but to the fountain of waters, that is to the Trinity, which is signified by a fountain? And by what way, but himself? For he himself said, I am the way. [John 14:6] It should also be noted that it is one and the same fountain that takes away hunger because it is the living bread, and thirst because it is the drink of life; for, as the apostle says, God will be all in all. [1 Cor. 15:28] So the fountain is said to be one because of the unity of nature of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit; and it is presented as a fountain of waters so that the multiplicity of God's gifts in the saints may be expressed by this phrase. So the person who is led to this satiety of water by the Lamb as the latter rules them, suffers neither sun nor any heat, because they are not burned by the heat of vices. And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes. What a wonderful tenderness! He shows himself a father, as well as a mother, as he wipes away the tears of his bewailing children; whence Isaiah justly says, For thou art our father, and Abraham hath not known us: thou, O Lord, art our father. [Is. 63:16] Now what are these tears? The fact that one person bewails the evil they have done, another the fact that they have not done good, and many other similar things. These tears of his children are to be wiped away when they are back from exile to their fatherland.
