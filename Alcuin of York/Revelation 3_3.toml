Have in mind therefore in what manner thou hast received and heard: and observe, and do penance. This sentence can be ascribed to both senses. Indeed he had heard, Whosoever shall keep the whole law, but offend in one point, is become guilty of all, [James 2:10] as well as If thy eye be evil thy whole body shall be darksome. [Matt. 6:23] If then thou shalt not watch, I will come to thee as a thief, and thou shalt not know when I will come. To watch is to rise from the sleep of sin to justice through the tears of repentance. The comparison with a thief that is introduced here is a fit one, since when a thief arrives unexpectedly, he massacres everyone he finds asleep and plunders their possessions: so does the heavenly judge kill the unrepentant with a sentence of punishment when he comes to them unexpectedly, and destroy their actions like a very strong robber.
