To him that shall overcome, I will give to sit with me in my throne: as I also have overcome, and am set down with my Father in his throne. The Lord victorious sits in the Father's throne because, after the Passion and Resurrection, he showed that he was equal to the Father. He says that we also sit in it, because we receive power of judgment in the Son's power, according to this: You, who have followed me, you shall sit on twelve seats, etc. [Matt. 19:28] It is not inconsistent with the truth that he says elsewhere we will sit on twelve thrones and here on his throne; for by the twelve thrones is indicated universal judgment, and by the throne of the Son a unique summit of judicial power. Therefore the same thing is indicated by the twelve thrones and by the one throne of the Son. We should however ask the question of how it is that he says all victors will judge, whereas not all will, but some of those who overcome will judge, and others will be judged. One should know then that they will have in others the power they do not have in themselves, in the same way as the whole body of a man has the power to speak through the mouth and to see through the eyes. Now if we look more subtly at the phrase in which it is said as I also have overcome, we find that it indicates those who are more brilliant and outstanding in their victory.
