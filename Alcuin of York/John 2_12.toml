Our Lord's brethren are the relations of Mary and Joseph, not the sons of Mary and Joseph. For not only the blessed Virgin, but Joseph also, the witness of her chastity, abstained from all conjugal intercourse.

Or Capernaum, we may interpret "a most beautiful village," and so it signifies the world, to which the Word of the Father came down.
