Healing of the sick, teaching, miracles. He showed them of the Father, because He sought His Fatherâ€™s glory in all of them. For which of these works do you stone Me? They confess, though reluctantly, the benefit they have received from Him, but charge Him at the same time with blasphemy, for asserting His equality with the Father; For agood work we stone you not, but for blasphemy; and because that You, being a man, make Yourself God.
