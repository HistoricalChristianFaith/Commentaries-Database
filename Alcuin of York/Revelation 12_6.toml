And the woman shall flee into the wilderness, where she hath a place prepared by God, that there they should feed her a thousand two hundred sixty days. The woman's fleeing into the wilderness means the same as her son's being taken up to God; for the Church flees, not in a physical ascent, but in a spiritual one. The wilderness is the secret of the mind; for, in order to escape the serpent's venom, holy men make themselves a desert by contemning all transitory and fleshly desires. Note also that it is the duty of preachers to feed this woman. As for the place where she is fed, it is he to whom it is said, Be thou unto me a protective God, and a place of refuge. [Variant of Ps. 30:3] He is also the food she is fed with, he who says, I am the living bread. [John 6:51] The number of days mentioned here signifies the times of the Antichrist, but while still also including the whole time of this life from the preaching and Passion of Christ. Indeed evangelical preaching was performed by the Lord during the same number of days as it will be finished in the end by the last preachers.
