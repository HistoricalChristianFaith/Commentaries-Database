And I saw: and behold in the midst of the throne and of the four living creatures, and in the midst of the ancients, a Lamb standing as it were slain, having seven horns and seven eyes: which are the seven Spirits of God, sent forth into all the earth. As already said, the throne, the living creatures, and the ancients signify the Church, in the middle of which stands the Lamb, according to this: I will declare thy name to my brethren: in the midst of the church will I praise thee. [Ps. 21:23] As for what we read elsewhere, The Lord is round about his people, [Ps. 124:2] it is not incompatible, because he both presides in the middle where he rules and judges it, and goes round about it to protect and defend it. Now why do we read here that he is standing while we read above that he is sitting, if not because there were shown examination and kingdom, while here is shown assistance? Indeed sitting is the attitude of one reigning and judging, while standing is the attitude of one giving assistance. Note also that he is seen not slain, but as it were slain; for even though he was crucified due to weakness, he lives by the power of God. Alternatively, Christ is, not slain, but as it were slain, every time his limbs either mortify themselves voluntarily or endure persecutions so as to fill up in themselves those things that are wanting of the sufferings of Christ. [Cf. Col. 1:24] By the seven horns, as John himself has explained, is represented the Holy Spirit's sevenfold operation, which is demonstrated not only to have rested in the Head, but also to have illuminated the entire body, which is why in this passage the seven spirits of God are said to have been sent forth into all the earth. This sevenfold operation, which is symbolized by the horns because of its kingdom and strength, is also fittingly represented by the eyes because it illuminates the Church. Alternatively, by the horns, which rise above the flesh, we may also understand the more outstanding people in the Church, to whom it is said, You are not in the flesh, but in the spirit. [Rom. 8:9]
