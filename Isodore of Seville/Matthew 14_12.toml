Lib. Syn., ii, 10: In evil promises then break faith. That promise is impious which must be kept by crime; that oath is not to be observed by which we have unwittingly pledged ourselves to evil. It follows, “And she being before instructed of her mother said, Give me here John Baptist’s head in a charger.”
