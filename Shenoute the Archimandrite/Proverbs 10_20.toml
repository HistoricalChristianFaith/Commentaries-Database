When I read the Proverbs today, I began with this sentence: “The tongue of the righteous is tried silver.” I said, If the tongue of the righteous is choice silver, the tongue of the wicked is most polluted. What is more choice or what is holier than the tongue of a man who uses it to confess and preach God and his Christ and to give him praise, but then also to read his laws and to meditate on them day and night, and also to speak every good word?
