Christ, â€¦ the source of the breath of life for all, when He was
Weary from a journey, sat down near a spring of Samaria.
And it was the season of burning heat. It was the sixth hour, as the Scripture says,
It was the middle of the day when the Messiah came to illumine those in darkness.
The Spring came upon the spring, not to drink but to cleanse.
The fountain of immortality was near the stream of the wretched woman as though it were in need.
He is tired from walking, He who tirelessly walked on the sea,
He who furnishes
Exceeding great joy and redemption.
