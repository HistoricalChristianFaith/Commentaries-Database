The lamb, Mary, beholding her lamb advancing to the slaughter,
Followed him wearily with the other women, saying, “Where are you going, O my son?…
Is there another wedding again in Cana,
And are you hurrying there now
In order that you may make wine from water for them?
Shall I go with you, my child, or should I wait for you instead?
Give me some word, O Word,
And do not pass me by in silence,
You who have kept me pure,
My son and my God.…

“You go on, O child, to an unjust death,
And no one shares in your suffering with you.
Peter does not accompany you—
He who said to you, ‘I shall never deny you, even if I die.’
Thomas has left you—the one who cried out,
‘Let us all die with him.’
And again the others, family and sons [of God],
Destined to judge the twelve tribes, where are they now?
Not one of all of them is here. But the one above all,
You, alone, O Son, saved all who were opposed [to you].
You reconciled all who were against [you],
My son and my God.” …

[Jesus replies] “O Mother, hold on for a little longer, and you will see how, like a healer,
I strip down and come where they lie dead
And heal their wounds,
Cutting their callousness and hardness with the point of the spear.
And when I receive the vinegar,
I use it as an astringent on the wound;
And when I have opened up the cut with the scalpel of the nails,
I will use my tunic as a dressing,
Having my cross as the remedy,
I use it, O Mother, so that you may sing with understanding:
‘By suffering he has redeemed suffering,
My son and my God.’

“Therefore leave behind your grief, O Mother
And set out on your journey with joy.
For I am already hurrying towards that for which I came,
To fulfill the plan of him who sent me;
For, this was from the beginning what was ordained for me
Even by my Father, and it did not displease my spirit then that I should become incarnate
And suffer on behalf of the fallen.
Hurry then, O Mother, announce to all,
‘By suffering he strikes down the one who hates Adam
And, having conquered, he comes,
My son and my God.’ ”
