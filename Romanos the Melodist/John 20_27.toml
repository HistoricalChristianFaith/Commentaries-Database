Who protected the hand of the disciple, then,
That was not melted when he approached
The fiery side of the Lord?
Who gave it daring and strength to probe
The flaming bone?
Certainly the side was examined.
For unless the side had supplied abundant power,
How could a right hand of clay have touched
The sufferings which had shaken
What is above and what is below?
It was grace itself that was given to Thomas
By Christ to touch his side and to cry out,
“You are our Lord and God.”

Truly the bramble bush which endured fire
Was burned but not consumed.
Because of the hand of Thomas
I believe the story of Moses.
For, though his hand was perishable and thorny,
It was not burned
When it touched the side that was like burning flame.
Then fire came upon the bramble bush,
But now, the thorny one raced to the fire;
And God himself looked on,
Guarding both. And so I believe.
And so I will praise the one who is both God and man, as I cry,
“You are our Lord and God.”

For truly the boundary line of faith
Was circumscribed for me
By the hand of Thomas.
For when he touched Christ
He became like the pen
Of a rapid-writing scribe
That writes for the faithful.
Faith gushes forth from it.
The robber drank and became sober again from it.
The disciples watered their hearts from it.
Thomas drained the knowledge that he sought from it,
For he drank first and then offered a draught
To many who have a little doubt. He persuades them to say,
“You are our Lord and God.”
