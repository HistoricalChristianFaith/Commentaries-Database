Let us all, with longing, run to Bethany to see Christ there, weeping for his friend.
For desiring all things to be ordained by law,
He accomplishes all things in the duality of his nature. He suffers as son of David.
As Son of God, he redeems the whole world
From all the evil of the serpent,
And on the fourth day, he raises up Lazarus,
Taking pity as the one who has compassion on
The tears of Mary and Martha.

Together sustained by faith,
These women announced to Christ and to God the death of their sibling, saying,
“Hurry, come, you who are always present in all places,
For Lazarus whom you love is sick.
Therefore if you come near,
Death will run away, and your friend will be delivered from corruption,
And the Jews will see that you, the Merciful One, have had compassion on
The tears of Mary and Martha.”
