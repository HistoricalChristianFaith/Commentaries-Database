“In you, Abraham, I foreshadow my plans,
For indeed, O righteous one,
You are clearly my figure in relief.
Do you want to know what is to come after you as a result of your [actions]? For this is why I had you ascend here, to show you.
For just as you did not spare
Your son on account of me,
So also I on account of all
Will not spare my son;
Instead I will give him to be slain for the sake of the world.” …
“In the same way that your Isaac carried
The wood on his shoulders,
My son will bear the cross upon his shoulders.
Your great love has revealed
Also what is about to happen.
See now the ram [caught up] in the wood;
When you see where its superior strength comes from, you will understand the mystery: It is by the horns that these bonds are overcome;
The horns signify the hands of my son.
Not only did they slaughter [my son] for me,
But I also continue to protect your son for you.”
