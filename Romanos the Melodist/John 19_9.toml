The Thunderer stood voiceless
The Word, without a word;
For if he had raised his voice
He would not have been overcome,
And, victorious, he would not have been crucified, and Adam would not have been saved:
Therefore, in order that he might suffer
He who captures the wise
Conquered by keeping silent.
But when the judge saw that he did not speak out, overcome with desperation,
He said: “What am I to do with one who does not speak?”
But they answered: “He is guilty of those things about which we ask:
Thus, he keeps silent.…”
“Death now is a debt I owe,” said my Savior
“To the lawless people”—as for Pilate,
Jesus did not consider the unspeakable brute
Worthy of a word
