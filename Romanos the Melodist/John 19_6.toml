The martyr Abel was envied by Cain and later murdered.
This is what Christ also endured:
Though he desired this envious people,
He incited them to anger, while showing affection;
He healed those who were sick, and instead of gratitude, he suffers and is crucified,
In order that Adam might dance in celebration.
The crowd of the lawless, feeling an antipathy towards the plethora of miracles
Cried out: “Kill! Crucify him!”
The One who sustains all things was delivered over to Pilate;
They handed over to the court of justice
Him who will judge both kings and paupers;
The condemned judges the just Judge;
The one who lives in obscurity
Threatened to murder the Redeemer as a thief!
Meanwhile he, in order to suffer, endures so long, in silence, standing speechless,
In order that Adam might dance in celebration
