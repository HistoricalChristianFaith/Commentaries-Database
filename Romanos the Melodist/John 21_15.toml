quote='''
Look to me, Peter, on how you offer instruction.
Remembering your own fall, sympathize with all.
Mindful of that maiden who caused your own downfall, do not be harsh.
If conceit attacks you, listen again to the sound of the rooster’s crow,
And remember the tears with whose streams I washed you,
I who alone know what is in your heart.
Peter, do you love me? Do what I say, feed my flock, and love those whom I love,
Sympathizing with sinners and remembering the compassion I had for you, since I received you after you denied me three times.
You have a thief as gatekeeper of paradise to give you courage.
Send him those whom you wish.
Because of you, Adam turned to me,
Crying, “O Creator offer me
The robber as gatekeeper, and Cephas as keeper of the keys.
You who alone know what is in the heart.”
