[[commentary]]

When in Babylon an image had been made,
And everyone against his will worshiped the lifeless things as though it were alive,
Then, as Scripture tells, three youths,
Having received in their hearts divine guidance, did not leave the straight path,
For they considered the madness of many as a path that leads astray.
And so the steadfast young men did not follow it.
But, advancing on the straight road, always toward the truth,
They mocked the trickery of the Persians,
Or rather, the sainted boys mourned and lamented,
For a righteous person does not rejoice over the destruction of another but with groans prays:
“Hasten, Merciful One; and in compassion come quickly
To our aid, since you are able to do what you will.”
