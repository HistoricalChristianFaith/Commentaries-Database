He who searches the hearts
And grabs them by the reins,
Knowing that Mary would recognize his voice,
Like a shepherd, called his crying lamb,
Saying, “Mary.”
She at once recognized him and spoke:
“Surely my good shepherd calls me
In order that from this time forward he may number me among the ninety nine lambs;
For I see behind the one who is calling me
The bodies of the saints, the ranks of the just,
Therefore, then, I do not say,
‘Who are you who calls me?’
For I clearly know who it is who is calling me;
It is he, as he said ahead of time, My Lord, he
Who offers resurrection to the fallen.”
