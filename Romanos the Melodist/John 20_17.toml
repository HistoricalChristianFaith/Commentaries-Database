Carried away by the warmth of her affection and by her fervent love,
The maiden hurried, wanting to take hold of him,
Who is not containable, who fills all creation.
But the Creator did not fault her eagerness;
Instead, he elevated her to the divine, saying,
“Do not touch me; or do you consider me merely mortal?
I am God, do not touch me.
O holy woman, lift up your eyes and consider the heavens;
Seek me there,
For I am ascending to my Father,
Whom I have not left.
For I exist simultaneously with him
And share the same throne and honor with him, I
Who offer resurrection to the fallen.”
