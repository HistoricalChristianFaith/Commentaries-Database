O Good Shepherd, you who have placed his Spirit among the flocks,
Hurry, save your sheep, O Holy One.
Forgetful of the fearful waves
And transformed by the remark of the maiden,
Peter said, “Christ, God, when I was sinking into the depths of the surging wave,
I was deservedly frightened.
And yet, when asked a simple question,
In my denial, I begin to sink.
But in my tears, I cry to you:
‘Hurry, save your Sheep, O Holy One.’ ”
There is another kind of deep here on land
—the maidservant;
But at last, finding my captain,
I flee for refuge to your safe harbor.
O Lord, my tears I will pour out to you for your advocacy,
And I will cry out to you because of this:
“Hurry, save your sheep, O Holy One.”
