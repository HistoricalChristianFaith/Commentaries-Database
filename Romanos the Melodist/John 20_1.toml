To the Sun, before sun, once he had set in the tomb
The young women bearing incense hastened at dawn,
As though seeking the day and saying to one another,
“O friends, come
Let us anoint with spices
The body, life-bearing and buried,
The flesh which resurrects the fallen Adam
That lies here in this tomb.
Let us go, let us hurry like the magi,
And let us kneel down and bring with us
The myrrh as gifts—
Not to him in swaddling clothes
But to him wrapped in burial cloths.
And let us weep and cry out:
‘O Master! Arise!
You who offer resurrection to the fallen.’ ”
While these godly women were discussing
These things among themselves,
They considered another idea, which is full of wisdom,
And they said to one another: “Women, why are we fooling ourselves?
For surely the Lord is not in the tomb!
Could it have held in subjection this long
One who controls the breath of living beings?
Would he still be lying there as a putrid corpse?…
Let Mary go and see the tomb,
And let us follow whatever she tells us,
For most certainly, as he foretold,
The immortal one has arisen,
He who offers resurrection to the fallen.”
The wise women, giving due consideration to this idea,
As planned, sent forward Mary Magdalene
To the tomb, as the Theologian says.
It was dark, but love lighted the way for her;
And so she saw the great stone rolled away
From the entrance to the tomb.
