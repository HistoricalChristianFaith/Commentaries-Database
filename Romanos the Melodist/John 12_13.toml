[[commentary]]

With palms everyone came
On the occasion of your arrival, Savior,
Crying to you, “Hosanna!”
Now all of us sing praises to you
From our pitiful mouths,
As we wave to you the branches of our souls and cry out:
“O you, who are in the highest, save the world
That you brought into being, Lord,
And blot out our sins,
Just as you previously dried
The tears of Mary and Martha.”
The holy church holds a high festival,
Faithfully calling together her children, O Lover of humanity;
With palms she meets you and strews garments of joy
So that you, along with your disciples and your friends,
May establish your feet and grant deep peace for your servants,
And release them from oppression, as previously you checked
The tears of Mary and Martha.
Incline your ear, O God of the universe,
And hear our prayers,
And snatch us from the bonds of death.…
Let those of us who have died because of our sins, and who dwell in the tomb
Because of our knowledge of evils,
Imitate the sisters of faithful Lazarus as we cry to Christ with tears, and in faith and in love:
“Save us, you who willed to become man.
And raise us up from the tomb of our sins,
You, alone who are immortal.”
