When Christ was present at the marriage feast, and the crowd of guests were faring sumptuously,
The supply of wine failed them, and their joy was turned into distress;
The bridegroom was upset; the cupbearers muttered unceasingly;
There was this one sad display of penury,
And there was no small clamor in the room.
Recognizing it, the all-holy Mary
Came at once and said to her son: “They have no wine,
But I beg you, my son, show that you can do all things,
Thou who has in wisdom created all things.”

We beg of you, holy Virgin, from what sort of miracles did you know
How your son would be able to offer wine when He had not harvested the grapes
And had never before worked wonders, as John, inspired of God wrote?
Teach us, how, when you had never gazed upon
And never made trial of His miracles,

How did you summon Him to this miracle?
For the question now posed to us in this matter is not simple,
As to how you said to your son: “Give them wine,”
He who has in wisdom created all things.

Let us learn the word which the mother of the God of all said to us:
“Listen,” she said, “my friends, instruct yourselves and know the mystery;
I have seen my son working miracles even before this miracle. …

“For I know that I did not know a husband,
And I bore a son—beyond natural law and reason,
And I know that I remained a virgin as I had been.
Do you, O man, ask for a miracle greater than this birth?
Gabriel came to me saying how this one would be born,
He who has in wisdom created all things.

“After my conception, I myself saw Elizabeth call me Mother of God before the actual birth; after the birth, Simeon praised me in song;22
Anna greeted me with joy; the Magi from Persia hastened to the manger,
For a heavenly star proclaimed the birth in advance;
Shepherds with angels heralded joy,
And creation rejoiced with them.
What would I be able to ask for greater than these miracles?
Indeed from them I have faith that it is my son Who has in wisdom created all things.”
