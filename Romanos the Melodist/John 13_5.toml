[[commentary]]
quote='''
The sea washes the brick,
The Abyss washes the clay
And it does not destroy its composition,
But keeps its substance intact
And wipes clean its character.
Notice the immensity of the maker,
And yet see what sort of disposition he has for his creatures;
They have reclined and he has stood,
They are fed and he serves,
They are washed and he wipes them clean;
And the feet molded of clay are not cast by his hands into the fire.
Have mercy, have mercy, have mercy on us,
You who bear with all and receive all.â€¦
May sleep take me to death,
If I allow you, the Immortal,
To bend down before me, a mortal.
The enemy would laugh at me,
If you deal in this way with me.
Is it not enough that I am considered as yours?
Is it not more than enough that I am considered by you
And called the first of your friends?
But are you to wash my feet, vessels of clay,
You, the Potter of the universe?
And my perishable legs and feet
You, O Redeemer, desire to wash them?
Have mercy, have mercy, have mercy on us,
You who bear with all and receive all.
