When they heard these words, the young people Laughed at the great vanity of the king.
However, lest he consider himself to be very wise, The wise youths raised their eyes and said:
“O Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon,
We have no need to talk this over with them,
For no one answers you if you say foolish things, For thus it is written in the Scripture:
‘Do not give reply to a fool that is of similar kind.’
Therefore, we have chosen to keep silent, and we pray in silence:
‘Hasten, Merciful One, and in compassion come quickly
To our aid, since you are able to do what you will.’ ”
