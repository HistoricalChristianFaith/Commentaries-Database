The Creator of all prophesied to the disciples, saying: “Friends and companions, our friend has fallen asleep.”
He was teaching them in advance, mystically,
Because he knows all things as the creator of all things.
“Let us go, then, let us advance and see the strange tomb,
And let us cause the mourning of Mary and Martha to cease
As I raise up Lazarus from the dead,
And, as the Merciful One, have compassion on
The tears of Mary and Martha.”

When they heard these words, all of the apostles as with one voice cried out to the Lord,
“Sleep for human beings is always for their deliverance, not for their destruction.”
And so he spoke to them openly: “He is dead.
As mortal I am away from him. But as God, I know all things.
If we truly arrive at the opportune time,
I will raise the dead, and stop now
The tears of Mary and Martha.”
