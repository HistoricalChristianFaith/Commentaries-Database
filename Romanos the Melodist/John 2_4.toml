But Christ seeing His mother saying, “Grant me this request,”
At once said to her: “What do you wish, woman, my hour has not come.”
Certain men made use of this saying as a pretext for impiety;
They said that Christ, submitted to necessity,
They said that He was a slave to periods of time. …

“Now answer, my child,” said the all-holy mother of Christ,
“Thou who dost control with measurement the periods of time, how, my son and Lord, dost Thou await a time?
Thou who hast regulated the division of the seasons, how dost thou await a season?
Thou who art the creator of the visible and the invisible,
Thou who, as master, dost day and night regulate
The ceaseless revolutions, as Thou dost will them—
Thou who hast defined the years in beautifully ordered cycles—
How, then, dost Thou await a time for the miracle which I ask of Thee
Who hast in wisdom created all things?”

“I knew before you told me, revered Virgin, that the wine was just beginning to give out for them,”
The Ineffable and Merciful straightway answered His holy mother.
“I know all the concerns of your heart which you set in motion in this matter;
For within yourself you reasoned as follows:
‘Necessity now summons my son to a miracle,
And He puts it off under the pretext of “the time.” ’
Holy mother, learn now the meaning of the delay,
For when you know it, I shall grant you this favor,
I, who in wisdom have created all things.

“At the time when I brought forward Heavens and the Earth and all things from a state of nonexistence,
I would have been quite able at that time to arrange in order at once all that I had produced;
But I introduced a certain well-regulated order.
Creation was accomplished in six days—
Not that I did not have the power,
But in order that the chorus of angels, seeing what I did, each deed in turn,
Would deify me, singing a hymn: ‘Glory to Thee, Powerful One,
Who hast in wisdom created all things.’ …
“Mark what I say, holy one; for at this time I was willing first
To announce to the Israelites and to teach them the hope of faith,
In order that in the presence of miracles they might learn thoroughly who has sent me,
And that they might know with certainty the glory of my Father,
And his will, for He desires that in every way
I be glorified along with Him by all.
For what He who engendered me has done, these things I also do,
Since I am consubstantial with Him and His Spirit,
I, who have in wisdom created all things.
“For if they had understood all these things at the time when they saw the awesome miracles,
They would understand that I am God before time, even though I have become man.
But now, contrary to order, before the teaching, you have asked for miracles;
And it is for this reason that I delayed a short time in answer to you:
If I was waiting for the time to perform miracles,
It was for this reason alone.
But, since it is necessary that parents be honored by their children,
I shall pay observance to you, Mother, for I am able to do all things,
I, who have in wisdom created all things.”
