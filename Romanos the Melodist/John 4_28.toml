But when the Merciful One was near the spring, â€¦
Then the woman of Samaria, coming from her native village, Sichar, arrived, and she had her urn on her shoulders;
And who would not call blessed the arrival and departure of this woman?
For she departed in filth; she entered into the figure of the church as blameless;
She departed, and she drew out life like a sponge.
She departed bearing water; she became a bearer of God;
And who does not bless
This woman; or rather who does not revere her, the type of the nations
As she brings
Exceeding great joy and redemption?
