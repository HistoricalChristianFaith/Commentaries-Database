Christ had brought to Him the five loaves of bread,
And straightway, lifting His eyes to the Father, He said:
“I am doing Thy deeds; for I am Thy Son;
For in the beginning, I created the whole world
Together with Thee and the Holy Spirit; for I am
The heavenly bread of immortality.”
Behold how the masters, the servants of Christ, were arranged and attended
The Servant, Jesus; and they found Him at once.
For the Lord blessed the five loaves of bread,
Speaking to them as follows in spiritual fashion:
“Grow and multiply perceptibly,
And nourish now all who are assembled here.”
And immediately the loaves obeyed the Lord;
They multiplied invisibly
As Christ spoke to them, for He is
The heavenly bread of immortality.
