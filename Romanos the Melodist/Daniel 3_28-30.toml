“In spite of myself, then, I revere the God of the Hebrews,
And I command all the people in my land to join in praising him.
‘Come, then, holy children, come forth from the furnace,
For I am convinced that your God is in truth God.’ ” (Nebuchadnezzar)
These things happened in Babylon as the Scriptures says,
At a time when those who had provoked God’s anger were in captivity.
Therefore, my brothers, see to it that you do not grieve
The Master and be given over to the enemy,
For we make him sad if we deny him,
And if we do not hasten to his temples,
and if we do not sing to him everywhere,
“Hasten, Merciful One, and in compassion come quickly
To our aid, since you are able to do what you will.”
