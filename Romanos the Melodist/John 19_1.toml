[[commentary]]

Like a lion they roared to seize
The life of the lamb, Christ.
Pilate, fulfilling their plan,
Flogged you, the meek One.
So he set to work on your back.…
The Redeemer endured the whip.
The Deliverer was in chains,
Stripped and stretched out on a pillar,
He who in a pillar of cloud
Previously spoke to Moses and Aaron.
He who laid the pillars of the earth, as David said, is bound to a pillar.
He who made known to the people the way in the desert—for the pillar of fire showed [the way] before them— is fastened to a pillar.
The rock is on a pillar, and hewn for me is
The church.
