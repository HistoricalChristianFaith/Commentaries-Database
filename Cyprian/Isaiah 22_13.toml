That too great lust of food is not to be desired. In Isaiah: “Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we shall die. This sin shall not be atoned for to you, even until you die.” Also in Exodus: “And the people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play.” Paul, in the first [letter] to the Corinthians: “Food does not commend us to God; neither if we eat shall we abound, nor if we do not eat shall we lack.” And again: “When you come together to eat, wait one for another. If any is hungry, let him eat at home, that you may not come together for judgment.” Also to the Romans: “The kingdom of God is not food and drink but righteousness and peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit.” In the Gospel according to John: “I have food of which you don’t know. My food is that I should do his will who sent me and should finish his work.”
