Finally, he also calls sons of Abraham those whom he perceives are active in helping and nourishing the poor. Zacchaeus said, “Behold, I give one half of my possessions to the poor, and if I have defrauded anyone of anything, I restore it fourfold.” Jesus responded, “Today salvation has come to this house, since he too is a son of Abraham.” If Abraham believed in God and it was accounted to him as righteousness, then he who gives alms according to the command of God certainly believes in God. He that possesses the true faith keeps the fear of God. Moreover, he keeps the fear of God by showing mercy to the poor.
