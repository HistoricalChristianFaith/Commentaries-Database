The remedies for propitiating God have been given in the words of God; divine instructions have taught that God is satisfied by just works, that sins are cleansed by the merits of mercy.… The Holy Spirit declares in the Psalms, saying, “Blessed is the one who thinks of the needy and the poor; the Lord will save him in the evil day.” Mindful of these teachings, Daniel, when king Nebuchadnezzar, being frightened by an unfavorable dream, was worried, gave a remedy for averting evils by obtaining divine help.… When the king did not obey him, he suffered the misfortunes and trouble that he had seen, which he might have escaped and avoided, if he had redeemed his sins by almsgiving. The angel Raphael also testifies likewise and urges that almsgiving be practiced freely and generously, saying, “Prayer is good with fasting and alms, for alms delivers from death, and it purges away sin.” He shows that our prayers and fasting are of less avail, unless they are aided by almsgiving. The angel reveals and manifests and certifies that our petitions become effective by almsgiving, that life is redeemed from dangers by almsgiving, that souls are delivered from death by almsgiving.
