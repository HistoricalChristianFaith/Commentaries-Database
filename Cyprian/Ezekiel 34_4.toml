If we scorn the repentance of those who have in some degree the assurance of a bearable conscience, immediately they are drawn by the devilâ€™s invitation into heresy or schism with their wife and children, whom they had kept unharmed. And it will be charged against us on judgment day that we have not cared for the wounded sheep and have lost many innocent ones because of one wounded.
