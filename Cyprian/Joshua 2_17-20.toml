Rahab, who also was a type of the church, expresses the same truth. The command given to her ran: “You shall gather to yourself into your house, your father, and your mother, and your brothers, and all your father’s household; and whosoever shall go out of the doors of your house into the street, his blood shall be upon his head.” This figure declares that all who are to live and escape the destruction of the world must be gathered into one house alone, the church, while if any of the gathered goes outside, that is, if anyone who once obtained grace in the church nevertheless abandons the church, his blood will be upon his head, that is, he will have himself to blame for his damnation.
