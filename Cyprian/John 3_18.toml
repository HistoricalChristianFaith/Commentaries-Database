In His Gospel also, according to John: "That was the true light which lighteth every man that cometh into this world. He was in this world, and the world was made by Him, and the world knew Him not.".
And this is the judgment, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light.".
And this is the judgment, that light has come into the world, and men have loved darkness rather than light."
