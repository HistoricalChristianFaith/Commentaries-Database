But it happens by the practice of presumption and of insolence that each one defends more his own depraved and false views than he consents to the rights and truths of another. Foreseeing this matter, the blessed apostle Paul writes to Timothy and warns that the bishop ought not to be quarrelsome or contentious but gentle and teachable. One who is meek and mild in the patience of learning is teachable. For bishops ought not only to teach but also to learn because he who grows daily and profits by learning better things teaches better.
