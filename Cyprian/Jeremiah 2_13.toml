We read the letter you wrote concerning those who seem baptized among heretics and schismatics, as to whether they ought to be baptized when they come to the church catholic, which is one. On this matter, although you yourselves hold the truth and certainty of the catholic rule, yet since you have thought that of our mutual love we ought to be consulted, we put forward our opinion, not as a new one though. Rather, we join with you in equal agreement, in an opinion long since decreed by our predecessors and observed by us—judging and holding it for certain that no one can be baptized outside the church, since there is one baptism appointed in the holy church. And it is written in the words of the Lord, “They have forsaken me, the fountain of living waters, and hewed out cisterns for themselves, broken cisterns that can hold no water.” - "Letter 69.1"
