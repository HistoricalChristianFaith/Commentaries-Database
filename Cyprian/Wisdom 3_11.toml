Discipline is the guardian of hope, the bond of faith, the guide on the way of salvation, the stimulus and nourishment of a good nature, the teacher of virtue. It makes one remain always in Christ and live unceasingly in God, allowing one to attain the heavenly promises and the divine rewards. - "The Dress of Virgins 1.1"
