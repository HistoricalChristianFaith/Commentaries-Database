This one church is also intended in the Song of Songs, when the Holy Spirit says, in the person of the Lord: “My dove, my perfect one, is but one; she is the only one of her mother, the choice one of her that bare her.” Can one who does not keep this unity of the church believe that he keeps the faith? Can one who resists and struggles against the church be sure that he is in the church? For the blessed apostle Paul gives the same teaching and declares the same mystery of unity when he says, “There is one body and one Spirit, one hope of your calling, one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God.”
