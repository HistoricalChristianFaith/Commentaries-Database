An enemy of the altar, a rebel against Christ’s sacrifice, a traitor to his faith, a blasphemous renegade, a disobedient servant, an undutiful son, a hostile brother, he scorns the bishops, turns his back on God’s priests and dares to set up another altar, to offer another prayer in unlawful words, to profane the true offering of the Lord with false sacrifices. Does he not know that the presumption which strives against the ordinance of God is punished by the chastisement of God? The Unity of the Church

The Lord teaches and admonishes that we must withdraw from such. “They are blinded guides of the blind. But if the blind man guide a blind man, both shall fall into a pit.” Such a one is to be turned away from, and whoever has separated himself from the church is to be shunned. Such a man is perverted and is condemned by his very self. Does he seem to himself to be with Christ, who acts contrary to the elders of Christ, who separates himself from association with his clergy and his people? That man bears his arms against the church; he fights against God’s plan.

But for the rest, let our most beloved brethren firmly decline, and avoid the words and conversations of those whose word creeps onwards like a cancer; as the apostle says, "Evil communications corrupt good manners.".
And again, "Evil communications corrupt good manners.".
Also in the first Epistle of Paul to the Corinthians: "Evil communications corrupt good dispositions."
