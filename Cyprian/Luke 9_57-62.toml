The Lord warns us of this in his gospel lest we return to the devil again and to the world, which we have renounced and from which we have escaped. He says, “No one, having put his hand to the plow and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God.” Again he says, “And let him who is in the field not turn back. Remember Lot’s wife.” Lest anyone, either because of some desire for wealth or by his own charm be persuaded from following Christ, he added, “He that does not renounce all that he possesses, cannot be my disciple.”
