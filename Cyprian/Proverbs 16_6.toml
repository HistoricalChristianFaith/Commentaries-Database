The Holy Spirit speaks in the Scriptures, saying, “By alms and by faith sins are cleansed.” Surely not those sins which had been contracted before, for they are purged by the blood and sanctification of Christ. Likewise again he says, “As water quenches fire, so do alms quench sin.” Here also it is shown and proved that just as with laver of the waters of salvation the fire of Gehenna8 is extinguished, so by almsgiving and good works the flame of sin is quenched. And because the remission of sins is once granted in baptism, constant and continuous labor acting in the manner of baptism again bestows the mercies of God. This the Lord also teaches in the Gospel. For when it was noted that his disciples were eating without first having washed their hands, he replied and said, “He who made the inside made also the outside. Truly give alms, and behold all things are clean to you.”
