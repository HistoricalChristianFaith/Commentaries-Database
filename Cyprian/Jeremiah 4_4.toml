The first circumcision of the flesh is made void, and the second circumcision of the spirit is promised instead. In Jeremiah, “Thus says the Lord to the men of Judah, and to them who inhabit Jerusalem, ‘Renew newness among you, and do not sow among thorns. Circumcise the foreskin of your heart lest my anger go forth like fire, and burn you up, and there be none to extinguish it.’ ”
