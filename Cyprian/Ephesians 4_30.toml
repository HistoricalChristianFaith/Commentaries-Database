Finally, the apostle warns us, and teaches, saying: "Grieve not the Holy Spirit of God, in whom ye are sealed unto the day of redemption. Let all bitterness, and anger, and wrath, and clamour, and blasphemy, be put away from you.".
Let all bitterness, and wrath, and indignation, and clamour, and blasphemy, be taken away from you."
