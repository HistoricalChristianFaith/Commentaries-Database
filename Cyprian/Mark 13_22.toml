The more the Adversary rages, the more error deceives. Senselessness makes its pretenses, envy inflames, covetousness makes blind, impiety depraves, pride puffs up, discord exasperates, anger hurries headlong.… Let the brethren beware of these things, for “I have told you all things beforehand.” Avoid such people. Drive them away from your side and your ears, as if their mischievous conversation were the contagion of death.… It is an enemy of the altar, a rebel against Christ’s sacrifice, who offers the faithful faithlessness, who is a disobedient servant, an impious son, a hostile brother, who despises bishops, who forsakes the elders, who dares to set up another altar to make another prayer with prohibited words, to profane the truth of the Lord’s offering.
