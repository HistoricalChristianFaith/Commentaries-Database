God says, “In one house shall it be eaten; you shall not cast the flesh abroad out of the house.” The flesh of Christ and the holy thing of the Lord cannot be cast out. The faithful have no home but the one church. This home, this house of unanimity, the Holy Spirit announces unmistakably in the Psalms: “God who makes men to dwell together of one mind as in a house.”

The faith of the divine Scripture manifests that the church is not outside and that it cannot be rent in two or divided against itself, but that it holds the unity of an inseparable and invisible house. It is written concerning the rite of the Passover and of the lamb, which lamb signifies Christ: “It shall be eaten in one house; you shall not take any of its flesh outside the house.”
