That we must not use detraction. In Solomon, in the Proverbs: "Love not to detract, lest thou be taken away." Also in the forty-ninth Psalm: "Thou sattest, and spakest against thy brother; and against the son of thy mother thou placedst a stumbling-block." Also in the Epistle of Paul to the Colossians: "To speak ill of no man, nor to be litigious."
