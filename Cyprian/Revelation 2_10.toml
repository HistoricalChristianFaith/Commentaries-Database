They have endured and have carried the uncorrupted and unstained merits of their virtues through, even unto the end. And, again, it is written, "Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life.".
And in the Apocalypse, divine protection is promised to our sufferings. "Fear nothing of these things "it says, "which thou shalt suffer.".
Also in the same place: "Be thou faithful even unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life."

Let very willing vigilance and care be bestowed, moreover, upon the bodies of all who, although they have not been tortured, yet depart from the prison by the glorious exit of death. Neither their valor nor their honor is less that they themselves should not be among the blessed martyrs. They have endured, as far as it is in their power, whatever they were prepared and ready to endure. In the eyes of God, the one who offered himself to torments and to death suffered whatever he was willing to suffer. For he himself did not fail the torments, but the torments failed him. “He who has acknowledged me before men, I also will acknowledge him before my Father,” says the Lord. They have acknowledged him. “He who has persevered even to the end, he will be saved,” says the Lord. They have their virtues incorrupt and immaculate. And again it is written: “Be faithful unto death, and I will give you the crown of life.” They endured even unto death, faithful and steadfast and invincible. When to our wish and to our confession in prison and in chains is added also the end of dying, the glory of martyrdom is consummated.
