Nor will heretics refuse to be baptized among us with the lawful and true baptism of the Church, when they shall have learnt from us that they also were baptized by Paul, who already had been baptized with the baptism of John.
Let all bitterness, and wrath, and indignation, and clamour, and blasphemy, be taken away from you."
