The injuries and punishments of persecutions are not to be feared, because the Lord is greater in protecting than the devil in assaulting. John in his epistle approves, saying, “Greater is he who is in you than he who is in the world.” Likewise in Psalm 117 [LXX]: “I shall not fear what people do to me; the Lord is my helper.” And again: “Those are strong in chariots, these in horses, but we, in the name of our God. They with their feet bound have fallen, but we are risen up and stand erect.”
