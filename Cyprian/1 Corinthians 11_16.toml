Nor is it now but lately that this counsel has been considered by us, nor have these sudden appliances against the wicked but recently occurred to us; but this is read of among us as the ancient severity, the ancient faith, the ancient discipline.
Hence it is in vain that some who are overcome by reason oppose to us custom, as if custom were greater than truth;.
especially since the apostle says, "If any man, however, is thought to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither the Church of God."
