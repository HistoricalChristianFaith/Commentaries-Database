Necessarily, too, the Lord gives us this admonition, to say in our prayer, “And lead us not into temptation.” In this part it is shown that the adversary has no power against us, unless God has previously permitted it, in order that all our fear and devotion and obedience may be turned to God, since in temptations nothing evil is permitted, unless the power is granted by him. Scripture proves this when it says, “Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, came against Jerusalem and assaulted it, and the Lord gave it into his hand.” Moreover, power is given to evil against us according to our sins; as it is written, “Who has given Jacob for a spoil and Israel to those who despoiled him? Has not God, against whom they have sinned and were unwilling to walk in his ways and to hear his law, even poured out on them the indignation of his fury?”
