The Scriptures prophesied that at noon in Christ’s passion there should be darkness. In Amos it says, “And it shall come to pass in that day, says the Lord, the sun shall set at noon, and the day of light shall be darkened. I will turn your feast days into grief and all your songs into lamentation.” Also in Jeremiah: “She is frightened that has borne children, and her soul has grown weary. Her sun has gone down while as yet it was noon. She has been confounded and accursed. I will give the rest of them to the sword in the sight of their enemies.” Also in the Gospel: “Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the earth even to the ninth hour.”
