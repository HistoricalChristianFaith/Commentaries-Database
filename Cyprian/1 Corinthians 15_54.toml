That one ought to make confession while he is in the flesh. In the fifth Psalm: "But in the grave who will confess unto Thee? " Also in the twenty-ninth Psalm: "Shall the dust make confession to Thee? " Also elsewhere that confession is to be made: "I would rather have the repentance of the sinner than his death." Also in Jeremiah: "Thus saith the Lord, Shall not he that falleth arise? or shall not he that is turned away be converted? "
