Therefore eternal and divine things are to be followed, and all things must be done after the will of God, that we may follow the divine footsteps and teachings of our Lord, who warned us, and said, "I came down from heaven, not to do my own will, but the will of Him that sent me.".
And in another place He says, "I came down from heaven not to do my own will, but the will of Him that sent me.".
In the Gospel according to John: "I came not down from heaven to do mine own will, but the will of Him that sent me."
