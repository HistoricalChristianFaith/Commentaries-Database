For they who know God the Father the Creator, ought also to know Christ the Son, lest they should flatter and applaud themselves about the Father alone, without the acknowledgment of His Son, who also said, "No man cometh to the Father but by me.".
This truth Christ showed to us in His Gospel, and said, "I am the truth.".
How much more effectually do we obtain what we ask in Christ's name, if we ask for it in His own prayer!.
In the Gospel: "I am the way, and the truth, and the life: no one cometh to the Father but by me.".
In the Gospel according to John: "I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.".
Said: In the Gospel the Lord says, "I am the truth."
