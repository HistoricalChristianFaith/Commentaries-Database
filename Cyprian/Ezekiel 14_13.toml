It is not easy for God to pardon idolaters.… Ezekiel also denounces this wrath of God on those who sin against God. He says, “And the word of the Lord came to me saying, ‘son of man, when a land shall sin against me so as to transgress grievously, I will stretch forth my hand on it, and I will break the staff of the bread thereof; and I will send famine on it and destroy man and beast out of it. And if these three men, Noah, Daniel and Job, shall be in it, they will not deliver sons or daughters; themselves alone shall be saved.’ ”
