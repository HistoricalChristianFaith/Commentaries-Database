Re already crowned, while some are even now within reach of the crown of victory; but all whom the danger has shut up in a glorious company are animated to carry on the struggle with an equal and common warmth of virtue, as it behoves the soldiers of Christ in the divine camp: that no allurements may deceive the incorruptible stedfastness of your faith, no threats terrify you, no sufferings or tortures overcome you, because "greater is He that is in us, than he that is in the world; ".
John, in his epistle, proves this, saying: "Greater is He who is in you than he that is in the world.".
Of this thing also in John: "Greater is He who is in you than he who is in this world."
