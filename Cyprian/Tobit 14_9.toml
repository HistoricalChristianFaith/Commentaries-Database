Be to your children such a father as was Tobias. Give useful and salutary precepts to your pledges such as he gave to his son; command your children as he too commanded saying, “And now, sons, I command you, serve God in truth, and do before God what pleases him; and command your children that they do justice and almsdeeds and that they be mindful of God and bless God’s name on every occasion.”
