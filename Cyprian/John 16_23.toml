And since we have Him as an Advocate with the Father for our sins, let us, when as sinners we petition on behalf of our sins, put forward the words of our Advocate. For since He says, that "whatsoever we shall ask of the Father in His name, He will give us"

Let Christ, who dwells within our heart, also dwell in our voice. And since we have him as an advocate with the Father for our sins, let us, when as sinners we petition on behalf of our sins, put forward the words of our advocate. For since he says that “whatever we shall ask of the Father in his name, he will give us,” how much more effectually shall we obtain what we ask in Christ’s name, if we ask for it in his own prayer!
