He has been more obedient to human authority than to God. It matters not whether he has published what he has done with less either of disgrace or of guilt among people. Be that as it may, he will not be able to escape and avoid God his judge, seeing that the Holy Spirit says in the Psalms, “Your eyes did see my substance, that it was imperfect, and in your book shall all people be written.” And again, “People see the outward appearance, but God sees the heart.” The Lord also forewarns and prepares us, saying, “And all churches shall know that I am he who searches the reins and heart.” He looks into the hidden and secret things and considers those things that are concealed; nor can anyone evade the eyes of the Lord, who says, “I am a God near at hand and not a God afar off. If a person shall be hidden in secret places, shall I not see him? Do I not fill heaven and earth?” He sees the heart and mind of every person, and he will not judge our deeds alone, but even our words and thoughts. He looks into the minds and the wills and conceptions of all people, in the very lurking places of the heart that are still closed up.
