To declare the justices and the covenant of the Lord and not to do the same thing that the Lord did, what else is that but to cast aside his words and to despise the discipline of the Lord and to commit not earthly but spiritual robberies and adulteries? For one who steals from evangelical truth the words and deeds of our Lord both corrupts and adulterates the divine teaching.
