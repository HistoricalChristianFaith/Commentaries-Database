For when Zacchaeus said, "Behold, the half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have done any wrong to any man, I restore fourfold "Jesus answered and said, "That salvation has this day come to this house, for that he also is a son of Abraham.".
And Jesus said unto him, that salvation has this day been wrought for this house, since he also is a son of Abraham."
