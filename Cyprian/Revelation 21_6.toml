In the Apocalypse too: "I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end. I will give unto Him that is thirsting from the fountain of the water of life freely.".
He that overcometh shall possess these things, and their inheritance; and I will be his God, and he shall be my son.".
He who shall overcome shall possess these things, and their inheritance; and I will be his God, and he shall be my son."
