God says that only those can escape who have been reborn and signed with the sign of Christ; when sending his angels to lay waste the world and to destroy the human race he threatens more seriously than the last time.â€¦ This sign pertains to the passion and blood of Christ and that he is kept safe and unharmed whoever is found in this sign.
