Oh, what was that spectacle of the Lord, how sublime, how exalted, how acceptable to the eyes of God in the solemn pledge and devotion of his army, as it is written in the Psalms when the Holy Spirit speaks to us likewise and warns, “Precious in the sight of God is the death of his faithful ones”! This death that has bought immortality at the price of its blood, that has received the crown from the consummation of its valor, is precious.

There they stood, victims of torture yet stronger than their tormentors. Their battered and lacerated limbs overcome the “claws” that tore and ripped at them. The savage, oft-repeated lashes could not defeat the martyrs’ inextinguishable faith, though once their entrails were prized apart it was not the limbs of God’s servants but their open wounds that were racked. It was as though their blood flowed to extinguish the fires of the persecution, to damp down the flames and burning coals of hell with its glorious streams. O what a marvelous sight it was before the Lord, how sublime, how precious! How welcome a sight to God’s eyes is the allegiance and self-offering of his legionaries! So it is written in the Psalms, when the Holy Spirit speaks likewise reminding us, “How precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his just.”
