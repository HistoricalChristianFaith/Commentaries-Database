Oh, what a spectacle was that to the Lord,-how sublime, how great, how acceptable to the eyes of God in the allegiance and devotion of His soldiers! As it is written in the Psalms, when the Holy Spirit at once speaks to us and warns us: "Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of His saints." Precious is the death which has bought immortality at the cost of its blood, which has received the crown from the consummation of its virtues.

There they stood, victims of torture yet stronger than their tormentors. Their battered and lacerated limbs overcome the “claws” that tore and ripped at them. The savage, oft-repeated lashes could not defeat the martyrs’ inextinguishable faith, though once their entrails were prized apart it was not the limbs of God’s servants but their open wounds that were racked. It was as though their blood flowed to extinguish the fires of the persecution, to damp down the flames and burning coals of hell with its glorious streams. O what a marvelous sight it was before the Lord, how sublime, how precious! How welcome a sight to God’s eyes is the allegiance and self-offering of his legionaries! So it is written in the Psalms, when the Holy Spirit speaks likewise reminding us, “How precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his just.”
