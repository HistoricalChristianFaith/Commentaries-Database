Christ the Lord also promises that we shall be such, when, that we may be with Him, and that we may live with Him in eternal mansions, and may rejoice in heavenly kingdoms, He prays the Father for us, saying, "Father, I will that they also whom Thou hast given me be with me where I am, and may see the glory which Thou hast given me before the world was made.".
Also in the Gospel according to John: "Father, I will that those whom Thou hast given me be with me where I shall be, and may see my glory which Thou hast given me before the foundation of the world."

When we die, we are passing over to immortality by death; nor can eternal life follow, unless we depart from this life. It is not an ending but a transit, and this journey of time that we are traveling on is a passage to eternity. Who would not want to hurry on to something better? Who would not crave being changed and renewed into the likeness of Christ and to arrive more quickly to the dignity of heavenly glory, since Paul the apostle announces and says, “For our [citizenship] is in heaven, from where also we look for the Lord Jesus Christ who shall change the body of our humiliation, and conform it to the body of his glory”? Christ the Lord also promises that this is how we shall be when—in order that we may be with him and that we may live with him in eternal mansions and rejoice in heavenly kingdoms—he prays to the Father for us, saying, “Father, I will that they also whom you have given me may be with me where I am and may see the glory that you have given me before the world was made.” The person who is allowed to go up to the throne of Christ, to the glory of the heavenly kingdoms, should not mourn or lament, but rather, in keeping with the Lord’s promise and his faith in the truth, he should rejoice in this his departure and translation.
