They who contend that persons baptized among the heretics ought to be received as if they had obtained the grace of lawful baptism, say that baptism is one and the same to them and to us, and differs in no respect. But what says the Apostle Paul? "One Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God.".
This one will be here, where there is the true hope and the certain faith. For thus it is written: "One faith, one hope, one baptism; ".
said: It is written, that "God is one, and Christ is one, and the Church is one, and baptism is one."
