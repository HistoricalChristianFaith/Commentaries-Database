Not to recognize sins lest penance follow is the wrath of God, as it is written: “And the Lord gave to them the spirit of a deep sleep,” lest they actually return and be cured and be healed by their lamentations and just satisfactions after their sins.…
The first degree of felicity is not to sin; the second, to recognize the sins committed. In the former, innocence runs upright and unimpaired to save; in the latter, there follows the remedy to cure. They have lost both of these by offending God.… Or do you think, brother, that crimes against God are light matters, small and of little moment, because through them the majesty of an offended God is not sought, because the wrath and fire and day of the Lord are not feared, because, with Antichrist at hand, the faith of a militant people is disarmed while vigor and the fear of Christ are taken away? - "Letter 59.13"
