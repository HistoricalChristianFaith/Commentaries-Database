Also in Zechariah: “And the Lord showed me Jesus, that great priest, standing before the face of the angel of the Lord, and the devil was standing at his right hand to oppose him. And Jesus was clothed in filthy garments, and he stood before the face of the angel himself; and he answered them and said to them who were standing before his face, saying, ‘Take away his filthy garments from him.’ And he said to him, ‘Behold, I have taken away your iniquities.’ And put upon him a priestly garment, and set a fair miter upon his head.” Also Paul to the Philippians: “Who being established in the form of God, thought it not robbery that he was equal with God, but emptied himself, taking the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men; and being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, becoming obedient even unto death, even the death of the cross. Wherefore also God exalted him and gave him a name which is above every name, that in the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, of things in earth, and of infernal things, and every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord in the glory of God the Father.” To Quirinus, Testimonies Against the Jews.
