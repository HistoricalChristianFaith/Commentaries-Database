Christ reminds of what was previously foretold by the prophet and says, “If anyone thirst, let him come and drink. He who believes in me, as the Scripture says, rivers from his belly shall flow of living water.” And that it might be the more clear that the Lord is there speaking not of the cup40 but of baptism, Scripture has added, “But this he said of the Spirit that those who believed in him were to receive.” But by baptism the Holy Spirit is received, and so those who are baptized and have secured the Holy Spirit go on to drink the cup of the Lord. Let no one be troubled because when divine Scripture speaks of baptism it says that we thirst and drink, since the Lord also says this in the Gospel. This is because what is received with keen and thirsty desire is more fully and completely42 drained.
