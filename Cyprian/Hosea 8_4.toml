When Peter is speaking to the people concerning the bishop to be ordained in the place of Judas, it says, “Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples, for the multitude was together.” But we notice that the apostles observed this, not only in the ordination of bishops and of priests but also in the ordinations of deacons. Concerning this very thing, in their Acts, it is also written, “The Twelve called together the multitude of the disciples,” it says, “and spoke to them.”6This matter was carried on diligently and cautiously, with the whole people assembled so that no unworthy man should attain to the ministry of the altar or to the priestly rank. For the fact is that sometimes unworthy men are ordained, not according to the will of God but according to human presumption. These things that do not come from a legitimate and just ordination are displeasing to God. God himself makes this known through the prophet Hosea, saying, “They made themselves a king, but not by me.”
