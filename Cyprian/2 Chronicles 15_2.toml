We must press on and persevere in faith and virtue and in completion of heavenly and spiritual grace, that we may attain to the palm and the crown. In the book of Chronicles [we read], “The Lord is with you so long as you also are with him; but if you forsake him, he will forsake you.” - "Exhortation to Martyrdom 8"
