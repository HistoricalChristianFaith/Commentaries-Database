The foundation and strength of hope and faith is fear. In Psalm 111: “The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.” Of the same thing in the Wisdom of Solomon, … in the Proverbs, … in Isaiah, … in Genesis, … and in Psalm 2, … Then Darius the king wrote, “To all peoples, tribes and languages that are in my kingdom, peace be to you from my face. I decree and ordain that all those who are in my kingdom shall fear and tremble before the Most High God whom Daniel serves.”
