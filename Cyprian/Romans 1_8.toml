Since the apostle would not have published such praise concerning us, when he said "that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world"

This counsel was not recently planned by us, nor have these unexpected protections against the wicked lately surprised us. But this is read of among us as the ancient severity, the ancient faith, the ancient discipline, since the apostle would not have revealed so great praise of us when he said: “because your faith is proclaimed all over the world,” if already this vigor had not borrowed the roots of faith from those times; it is a very great crime to have been unworthy of these praises and of glory.
