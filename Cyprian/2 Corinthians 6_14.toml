How is such a word as that able to give remission of sins, which creeps like a canker to the ears of the hearers? And when they say that there can be no fellowship between righteousness and un-righteousness, no communion between light and darkness.
For what participation is there between righteousness and unrighteousness? or what communication hath light with darkness? "

But if we consider what the apostles thought about heretics, we shall find that in all of their epistles they execrate and abominate the sacrilegious depravity of the heretics.â€¦ And since they say that there is nothing in common between justice and iniquity, no communion between light and darkness, how can the darkness illuminate or iniquity justify? And since they are not from God but from the spirit of antichrist, how do they who are enemies of God and whose breasts the spirit of antichrist fills carry on both spiritual and divine affairs?
