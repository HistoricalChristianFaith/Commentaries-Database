The adversary has no power against us unless God has previously permitted it, in order that all our fear and devotion and obedience may be turned to God, since in temptations nothing is permitted evil, unless the power is granted by God.… Moreover, power is given to evil against us according to our sins, as it is written: “Who has given Jacob for spoil and Israel to those who despoiled him? Has not God, against whom they have sinned and were unwilling to walk in his ways and to hear his law, even poured out upon them the indignation of his fury?” And again when Solomon sinned and departed from the precepts and the ways of the Lord, it is set down: “And the Lord stirred up the adversary2 against Solomon himself.”
