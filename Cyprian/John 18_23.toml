The Lord said nothing reproachfully against the high priest, nor detracted anything from the priest's honour; but rather asserting His own innocence, and showing it, He says, "If I have spoken evil, bear witness of the evil; but if well, why smitest thou me? ".
With that humility which taught us also to he humble, He still called him a priest whom He knew to be sacrilegious; also under the very sting of His passion, when He had received a blow, and it was said to Him, "Answerest thou the high priest so? "He said nothing reproachfully against the person of the high priest, but rather maintained His own innocence saying, "If I have spoken evil, bear witness of the evil; but if well, why smitest thou me? ".
And moreover the Lord, in the Gospel, when it was said to Him, "Answerest thou the high priest so? "guarding the priestly dignity, and teaching that it ought to be maintained, would say nothing against the high priest, but only clearing His own innocence, answered, saying, "If I have spoken evil, bear witness of the evil; but if well, why smitest thou me? "

With that humility that taught us also to he humble, he still called him a priest whom he knew to be sacrilegious. Also under the very sting of his passion, when he had received a blow and it was said to him, “Do you answer the high priest in this way?” he said nothing reproachfully against the person of the high priest. Rather, he maintained his own innocence saying, “If I have spoken evil, bear witness of the evil. But if well, why do you hit me?” All of the things, therefore, were done by him humbly and patiently so that we might have an example of humility and patience. For he taught that true priests were lawfully and fully to be honored, in showing himself such as he was in respect of false priests.
