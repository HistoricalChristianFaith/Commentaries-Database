And therefore the Lord, suggesting to us a unity that comes from divine authority, lays it down, saying, "I and my Father are one.".
He who breaks the peace and the concord of Christ, does so in opposition to Christ; he who gathereth elsewhere than in the Church, scatters the Church of Christ. The Lord says, "I and the Father are one; "

The Lord says, “I and the Father are one.” And again of the Father and Son and the Holy Spirit it is written, “And these three are one.” Does anyone believe that this unity that comes from divine strength, which is closely connected with the divine sacraments, can be broken asunder in the church and be separated by the division of colliding wills?
