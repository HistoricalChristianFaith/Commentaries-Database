No one should wonder that we are harassed with constant persecutions and continually tried with increasing afflictions when the Lord before predicted that these things would happen in the last times. He has instructed us for the warfare through his teaching and exhortation. Peter also, his apostle, has taught that persecutions occur to test us. We are to look to the example of the righteous who have gone before us and are to be joined to the love of God by death and sufferings. For he wrote in his epistle, “Beloved, do not be surprised at the fiery ordeal that comes on you to prove you, as though something strange were happening to you. But rejoice in so far as you share Christ’s sufferings, that you may also rejoice and be glad when his glory is revealed. If you are reproached for the name of Christ, you are blessed, because the spirit of glory and of God rests on you.” The name of Christ is indeed blasphemed by them but is glorified by us.
