This sacrament of unity, this bond of a unity inseparably cohering, is set forth where in the Gospel the coat of the Lord Jesus Christ is not at all divided or cut. Rather, it is received as an entire garment, and it is possessed as an uninjured and undivided robe by those who cast lots for Christ’s garment who should instead put on Christ. Holy Scripture says, “But of the coat, because it was not sewn but woven from the top throughout, they said one to another, Let us not tear it but cast lots whose it shall be.” That coat bore with it a unity that came down from the top, that is, that came from heaven and the Father, which was not to be at all torn by the receiver and the possessor, but without separation we obtain a whole and substantial completeness. He cannot possess the garment of Christ who parts and divides the church of Christ.… His robe, woven and united throughout, is not divided by those who possess it. Undivided, united and connected, it shows the coherent harmony of our people who put on Christ. By the sacrament and sign of his garment, he has declared the unity of the church.
