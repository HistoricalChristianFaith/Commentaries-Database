And we read in the Acts of the Apostles, "And the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul.".
Divine Scripture proves this, when it says, "But the multitude of them which believed were of one heart and of one soul.".
Such, then, was the abundance in labours, as was the agreement in love, as we read in the Acts of the Apostles: "And the multitude of them that believed acted with one heart and one soul; neither was there any distinction among them, nor did they esteem anything their own of the goods which belonged to them, but they had all things common.".
Of this same thing in the Acts of the Apostles: "But the multitude of them that had believed acted with one soul and mind: nor was there among them any distinction, neither did they esteem as their own anything of the possessions that they had; but all things were common to them."
