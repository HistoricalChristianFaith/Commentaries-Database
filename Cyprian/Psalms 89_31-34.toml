We suffer these things because of our fault and of our deserving, as the divine judgment has forewarned us, saying, “If they have forsaken my law and have walked not in my judgments, if they have profaned my ordinances and have kept not my commands, I will visit their crime with a rod and their guilt with stripes.” We, therefore, who neither please God with our good deeds nor satisfy him for our sins, feel the rods and the lashes. Let us ask from the depth of our heart and with our whole mind the mercy of God because he himself adds this, saying, “Yet my kindness I will not take from them.” Let us ask and we receive; and, if there is delay and tardiness in our receiving because we have offended gravely, let us knock because to him who also knocks it is opened, provided only our prayers and groans and tears knock at the door, in which we ought to persist and to employ much time, provided our prayer is also of one mind.

The Lord certainly would not exhort to repentance unless he promised pardon to the penitent. In the Gospel the Lord says, “Just so, I tell you, there will be joy in heaven over one sinner who repents, more than over ninety-nine just who have no need of repentance.” Since it is written, “God is not the author of death, nor does he rejoice in the destruction of the living,” certainly he, who wishes no one to perish, desires sinners to do penance and to return to life again through penance. And there, through Joel the prophet, he cries out and says, “And now says the Lord, your God, return to me with your whole heart, at the same time with fasting, and weeping and mourning; and rend your hearts and not your garments, and return to the Lord, your God. For gracious and merciful is he, slow to anger, rich in kindness, and he softens the sentence inflicted against malice.” In the Psalms we read also of the censure and of the clemency of God, at the same time, threatening and sparing, punishing that he may correct and saving when he has corrected. “I will visit,” he says, “their crime with a rod and their guilt with stripes. Yet my kindness I will not take from them.”
