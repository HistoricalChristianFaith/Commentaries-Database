Who then is so profane and lacking in faith, who so insane by the fury of discord as either to believe that the unity of God, the garment of the Lord, the church of Christ can be torn asunder or to dare to do so? He warns us in the Gospel, and teaches, saying, “And there shall be one flock and one shepherd.” And does anyone think that there can be either many shepherds or many flocks in one place? Likewise the apostle Paul introducing this same unity to us beseeches and urges us in these words: “I beseech you, brothers,” he says, “by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you all say the same thing, and that there be no dissensions among you but that you be perfectly united in the same mind and in the same judgment.” And again he says, “Bearing with one another in love, careful to preserve the unity of the Spirit, in the bond of peace.” Do you think that you can stand and live, withdrawing from the church and building for yourself other abodes and different dwellings, when it was said to Rahab, in whom the church was prefigured: “You shall gather your father and your mother and your brethren and the entire house of your father to your own self in your house, and it will be that everyone who goes out of the door of your house shall be his own accuser”;14 likewise, when the sacrament of the Passover contains nothing else in the law of the exodus than that the lamb that is slain in the figure of Christ be eaten in one house? God speaks, saying, “In one house it shall be eaten; you shall not carry the flesh outside of the house.” The flesh of Christ and what is holy to the Lord cannot be carried outside, and there is no other house for believers except the one church. This house, this hospice of unanimity, the Holy Spirit designates and proclaims, when he says, “God who makes those of one mind to dwell in his house.” In the house of God, in the church of Christ, those of one mind dwell; they persevere in concord and simplicity.
