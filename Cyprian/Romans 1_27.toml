If you were able … to direct your eyes into secret places, to unfasten the locked doors of sleeping chambers and to open these hidden recesses to the perception of sight, you would behold that being carried on by the unchaste which a chaste countenance could not behold. You would see what it is an indignity even to see…. Men with frenzied lusts rush against men. Things are done which cannot even give pleasure to those who do them.
