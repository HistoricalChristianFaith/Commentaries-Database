If God chastises whom he loves, and chastises that he may correct, brethren also, and priests particularly, do not hate but love those whom they chastise that they may correct, since God also prophesied before through Jeremiah and pointed to our own time saying, “I will give you pastors according to my own heart, and they shall nourish you, feeding you with discipline.”
