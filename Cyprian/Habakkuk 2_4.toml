“And if you will not believe, neither will you understand.” Also the Lord in the Gospel: “For if you believe not that I am he, you shall die in your sins.” Moreover, righteousness should subsist by faith. In it was life, as predicted in Habakkuk: “Now the just shall live by faith in me.” Hence Abraham, the father of the nations, believed. In Genesis “Abraham believed in God, and it was counted to him for righteousness.” In like manner Paul wrote to the Galatians: “Abraham ‘believed God, and it was reckoned to him as righteousness.’ So you see, those of faith are the descendants of Abraham. And the Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the gospel beforehand to Abraham, saying ‘In you shall all the nations be blessed.’ So then, those who are people of faith are blessed with Abraham who had faith.”
