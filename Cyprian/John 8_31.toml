And again, "If ye continue "saith He, "in my word, ye shall be truly my disciples; and ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.".
And again: "If ye shall abide in my word, ye shall be my disciples indeed; and ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free."

We must endure and persevere, beloved brothers, so that once we have the hope of truth and freedom, we may actually attain them. For the very fact that we are Christians is the substance of faith and hope. But if hope and faith are going to achieve their result, there must be patience. For we are not following after present but future glory.… Therefore, waiting and patience are needed so that we may fulfill what we have begun to be and may receive what we believe and hope for according to God’s own appearing.
