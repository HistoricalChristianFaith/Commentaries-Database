We see also that Enoch was taken away, because he was pleasing to God, as the divine Scriptures attest in Genesis: “Then Enoch walked with God and was no longer, because God had taken him.” Because he was pleasing before God, he was worthy to be taken away from the evil of this world. But the Holy Spirit also teaches throughugh Solomon that those who are pleasing to God are taken first and freed from here earlier, so they would not be tainted by too long a sojourn in this world.
