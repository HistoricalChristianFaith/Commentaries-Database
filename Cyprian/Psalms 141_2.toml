Or is anyone enticed by this contemplation that, although water alone seems to be offered in the morning, yet, when we come to dinner, we offer a mixed chalice? But when we dine, we cannot call the people to our banquet that we may celebrate the truth of the sacrament with all of the brotherhood present. But, in fact, the Lord offered the mixed chalice not in the morning but after dinner. Ought we then to celebrate the sacrifice of the Lord after dinner so that by repeated sacrifices we may offer the mixed chalice? It was fitting for Christ to offer the sacrifice about evening of the day that the very hour might show the setting and evening of the world as it is written in Exodus: “And the whole multitude of the children of Israel shall slaughter it in the evening.” And again in the Psalms: “The lifting up of my hands as evening sacrifice.” But we celebrate the resurrection of the Lord in the morning.
