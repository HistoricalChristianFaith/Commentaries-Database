Nor ought the reproaches of the lost to move us in any degree to depart from the right path and from the sure rule, since also the apostle instructs us, saying, "If I should please men, I should not be the servant of Christ.".
But if some of the perverse persons refuse to obey, let us follow the same apostle, who says, "If I please men, I should not be the servant of Christ.".
And the apostle also speaks, saying, "If I pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ.".
And that Paul also has gloriously and sublimely uttered, "If I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ.".
Also in the Epistle of Paul to the Galatians: "If I wished to please men, I should not be the servant of Christ."
