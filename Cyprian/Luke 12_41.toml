We must perceive and confess that the very frightful devastation of that affliction which has destroyed and is destroying our flock in great part has come about because of our sins. We do not keep the way of the Lord, nor do we observe the heavenly commands given to us for salvation. Our Lord did the will of the Father. Eager for our inheritance and advantage, following after pride, giving way to envy and to neglecting simplicity and faith, renouncing the world in words only and not in deeds, each one pleasing himself and displeasing all, we do not do the will of God.We are beaten as we deserve. It is written, “But that servant who knows his master’s will and did not obey his will, will be beaten with many stripes.” But what blows and stripes do we not deserve, when even confessors, who should have been an example in good morals to the rest, do not keep discipline?
