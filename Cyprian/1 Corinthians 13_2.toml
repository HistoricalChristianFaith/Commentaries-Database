Charity is magnanimous; charity is kind; charity envieth not; charity acteth not vainly, is not puffed up, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil; loveth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things Charity never falleth.".
It loveth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, beareth all things. Charity shall never fail."
