We also find that Enoch, who pleased God, was transported, as divine Scripture testifies in Genesis and says, “And Enoch pleased God and was not seen later because God took him.” This was pleasing in the sight of God—that Enoch merited being transported from the contagion of this world. But the Holy Spirit teaches also through Solomon that those who please God are taken from here earlier and more quickly set free, lest while they are tarrying too long in this world they be corrupted by familiarity with the world.
