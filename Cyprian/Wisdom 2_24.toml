The devil, seeing that human beings were made in the image of God, fell through malicious envy into jealousy and, compelled by this envy, caused another to be lost, not hurling down another by the instinct of his jealousy before he himself was hurled down by his own jealousy. He was made a prisoner before he imprisoned another. He was lost before he caused another to be lost, when, compelled by envy, he took from human beings the grace of immortality that had been given to them. He himself had in fact first lost what he once was. Beloved brothers, how great is the evil into which the angel fell by which that sublime and splendid nobility was deceived and subverted, by which the deceiver himself was deceived! From then on envy raged throughout the earth, since the one who will perish through the devil"s spite pays homage to the master of perdition, and the one who is jealous imitates the devil, as it is written, "Death entered the world through the envy of the devil." Consequently, "those who belong to his party imitate him." - "On Envy and Jealousy 4"
