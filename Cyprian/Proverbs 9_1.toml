The Holy Spirit through Solomon shows forth the type of sacrifice of the Lord, making mention of the immolated victim and of the bread and wine and also of the altar and of the apostles. “Wisdom,” he says, “has built a house and she has set up seven columns. She has slain her victims, mixed her wine in a chalice, and has spread her table.” … He declares the wine is mixed, that is, he announces in a prophetic voice that the chalice of the Lord is mixed with water and wine.
