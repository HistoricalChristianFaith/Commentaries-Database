The Holy Spirit set this forth of old, when he said in the Psalms, “O my king and my God. For to you will I pray; O Lord, in the morning you shall hear my voice. In the morning I will stand before you, and will see you.” And again through the prophet the Lord says, “At dawn they will be on watch for me, saying, ‘Let us go and return to the Lord our God.’ ” Likewise at the setting of the sun and at the end of the day necessarily there must again be prayer. For since Christ is the true sun and the true day, as the sun and the day of the world recede, when we pray and petition that the light come upon us again, we pray for the coming of Christ to provide us with the grace of eternal light.
