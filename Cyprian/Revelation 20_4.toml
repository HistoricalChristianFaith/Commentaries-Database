"And when he had placed those who were slain in the first place, he added, saying: "And whosoever had not worshipped the image of the beast, neither had received his mark upon their forehead or in their hand; "all these he joins together, as seen by him at one time in the same place, and says, "And they lived and reigned with Christ."

The rewards of divine promise do not await only the persecuted and the slain. If passion is lacking in the faithful, yet if the faith has remained sound and unconquered and, after forsaking all his possessions and so continuing in this way, shows that he follows Christ, he also is honored among the martyrs of Christ, as he himself says: “There is no one who leaves house, or land, or parents, or brothers or wife or children for the sake of the kingdom of God who shall not receive much more in the present time, and in the age to come life everlasting.” In the same way in the Apocalypse he says: “And I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded because of the name of Jesus and the Word of God.” And when he had put those beheaded in the first place, he added saying, “And who did not worship the image of the beast, and did not accept his mark upon their foreheads or in their hands.” And all these he joins together as seen by him in the same place and says, “And they came to life and reigned with Christ.” He says that all live and reigned with Christ, not only those who have been slain. He is referring to those who stand in the firmness of their faith and who in the fear of God have not adored the image of a beast and have not consented to his deadly sacrilegious edicts.
