"And that it might be more evident that the Lord is speaking there, not of the cup, but of baptism, the Scripture adds, saying, "But this spake He of the Spirit, which they that believe on Him should receive.".
He that believeth on me, as the Scripture saith, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water."
