The church encloses fruitful trees within its walls. It waters these trees with four rivers, that is, with the four Gospels, from which it bestows the grace of baptism by the salutary and heavenly inundation. Can he who is not inside the church be watered from the fountains of the church? How could one who is perverse and condemned by himself and banished beyond the fountains of paradise provide a healthful resource of water? How could one who has dried up and has failed with the dryness of eternal thirst bestow upon another the salutary drinks of paradise? Letters
