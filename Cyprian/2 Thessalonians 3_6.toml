The words of the apostle’s testimony are, “We command you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that you withdraw from all brothers who are living disorderly lives and not according to the tradition which they received from us.” And again he says, “Let no one deceive you with empty words; for because of these things the wrath of God comes on the children of disobedience. Don’t be, therefore, partakers with them.” We must withdraw, indeed flee from those who fall away, lest, while one is joined with them while they walk wickedly, passing over the paths of error and crime, wandering apart from the way of the true road, he himself also be caught in a similar crime. God is one and Christ one and his church one and the faith one and the people one, all joined together by the tie of concord into a solid unity of body. The unity cannot be torn apart, nor can the one body be separated by a division of its structure, nor torn into bits by the lacerating of its entrails. Whoever departs from the root of the parent body will not be able to breathe and live apart. By departing one loses the substance of health.
