Disasters occur either to discipline the obstinate people or punish evil people. The same God declares in the Holy Scriptures, “I have struck your children in vain. They have not received correction.” The prophet devoted and dedicated to God answers these words in the same way and says, “You struck them, but they have not grieved. You scourged them, but they have refused to receive correction.” See, God inflicts stripes, and there is no fear of God.
