How grave is the case of a Christian if, as a servant, he is unwilling to suffer when his master first suffered! How serious it is that we should be unwilling to suffer for our own sins, when he who had no sin of his own suffered for us! The Son of God suffered that he might make us sons [children] of God, and yet we who are human sons will not suffer so that we may continue to be sons of God! If we suffer from the world’s hatred, Christ first endured the world’s hatred. If we suffer reproaches in this world, if exile, if tortures, the maker and Lord of the world experienced harder things than these. And he also warns us, saying, “If the world hates you, remember that it hated me before you. If you were of the world, the world would love its own. But because you are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hates you. Remember the word that I said to you, ‘The servant is not greater than his lord. If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you.’ ” Whatever our Lord and God taught, he also did, so that the disciple might not be excused if he learns but then does not put into practice what he learned.Let none of you, beloved, be so terrified by the fear of future persecution or the coming of the threatening antichrist that you are not found armed for all things by the preaching of the gospel and its commands—and by the heavenly warnings. Antichrist is coming, but above him Christ comes also. The enemy goes about and rages, but the Lord immediately follows to avenge our sufferings and our wounds. The adversary is enraged and threatens, but there is One who can deliver us from his hands.
