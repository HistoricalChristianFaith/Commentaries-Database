Who is this God? It is he who is himself truth and whose word is truth. And what is truth? That which is not fashioned or made or represented by art, that is, that has never been brought into existence and is on that account called truth. If, therefore, someone worships that which is made with hands, it is not the truth that he worships or yet the word of truth.
