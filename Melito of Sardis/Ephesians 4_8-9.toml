Who is my opponent? I, he says, am the Christ. I am the one who destroyed death, and triumphed over the enemy, and trampled Hades under foot, and bound the strong one, and carried off man to the heights of heaven, I, he says, am the Christ.

Just as from a tree came sin, so also from a tree came salvation. By the cross death is destroyed, and by the cross salvation shines; by the cross the gates of hell are burst, and by the cross the gates of paradise are opened. The cross has become the way of saints and martyrs; the cross has become the chain of the apostles and the shield of faith of prophets. The cross is the guide of the fallen; the cross is the comfort of the possessed, and an immovable wall to believers. The cross is the strength of the weak, and the lifting up of the lowly. The cross is the guide of the faithful robber [Lk 23:30-43]; the cross is the destroyer of hell.
