Assist, therefore, one another in good faith, and by deed and with a hearty will; nor let any one remove his hand from the help of a brother, since “by this,” says the Lord, “shall all people know that you are my disciples, if you have love one toward another.” Wherefore, too, he speaks by the prophet, saying, “Behold how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity!” In a spiritual dwelling, I interpret it, and in a concord that is in God, and in the unity of the faith that distinguishes this pleasant dwelling according to truth, which indeed was illustrated more beautifully in Aaron and the priests clothed with honor, as ointment on the head, nurturing the highest understanding and leading even to the end of wisdom. For in this dwelling the Lord has promised blessing and eternal life. Apprehending, therefore, the importance of this utterance of the prophet, we have spoken this present brotherly word for love’s sake and by no means seeking, or meaning to seek, our own things.
