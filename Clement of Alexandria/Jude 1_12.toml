“Clouds without water” are those who do not have the divine and fruit-bearing Word in them. They are twice dead: Once, because they sinned by transgressing, and again when they were handed over to the punishments foreordained by God for them. A person may be said to be dead even when he is alive but not enjoying his inheritance.
