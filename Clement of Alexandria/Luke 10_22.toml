Of late, then, God was known by the coming of Christ: "For no man knoweth God but the Son, and he to whom the Son shall reveal Him.".
It is this same Father of His, then who being one is manifested by many powers And this was the import of the utterance, "No man knew the Father".
And He first announced the good righteousness that is from heaven, when He said, "No man knoweth the Son, but the Father; nor the Father, but the Son.".
"No one "says the Lord, "hath known the Father but the Son, and he to whom the Son shall reveal Him.".
Whence also this kind of cattle are apt to slip, not having a division in the foot, and not resting on the twofold support of faith. For "no man "it is said, "knoweth the Father, but he to whom the Son shall reveal Him."
