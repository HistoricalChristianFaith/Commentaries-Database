In saying, therefore, "I have given you milk to drink "has he not indicated the knowledge of the truth, the perfect gladness in the Word, who is the milk? And what follows next, "not meat, for ye were not able "may indicate the clear revelation in the future world, like food, face to face. "For now we see as through a glass "the same apostle says, "but then face to face.".
