"And not only for our sins,"— that is for those of the faithful, — is the Lord the propitiator, does he say, "but also for the whole world." He, indeed, saves all; but some [He saves], converting them by punishments; others, however, who follow voluntarily [He saves] with dignity of honour; so "that every knee should bow to Him, of things in heaven, and things on earth, and things under the earth;" [Philippians 2:10] that is, angels, men, and souls that before His advent have departed from this temporal life.
