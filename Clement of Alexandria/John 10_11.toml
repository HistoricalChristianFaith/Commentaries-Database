He is called Jesus: Sometimes He calls Himself a shepherd, and says, "I am the good Shepherd.".
-and with benevolence, for He alone gave Himself a sacrifice for us: "For the good Shepherd giveth His life for the sheep; ".
As then we say that it belongs to the shepherd's art to care for the sheep; for so "the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep; "
