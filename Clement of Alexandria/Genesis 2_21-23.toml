Among the Hebrews the prophets spoke by the power and inspiration of God. Before the law there was Adam, who used a power of prophecy over the woman and over the naming of animals; Noah, preaching repentance; Abraham, Isaac and Jacob offering a clear foreshadowing of a large number of events future or imminent.
