Isaiah says [about Christ], “The Lord has laid on him the iniquity of us all,” that is, to correct our iniquities and set them right. For that reason, he alone is able to forgive our sins, he who has been appointed by the Father of all as our educator, for he alone is able to separate obedience from disobedience.
