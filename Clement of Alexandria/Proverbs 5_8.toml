We should also be particularly careful of our eyes, for it is better to slip with the feet than with the eyes. The Lord offers a remedy for this weakness, indeed, with curt words: “If your eye scandalizes you, cut it out,” thereby tearing lust up by the roots. Melting glances, and sly looks out of the corner of the eye, which is what is also called winking, are nothing more than adultery with the eyes, since lust operates at a distance through them. The sight sins before the rest of the body does. “The eye, seeing beautiful things, gladdens the heart,” that is, when it knows how to see what is right it gives joy, “but he that winks with the eye deceitfully shall cause men sorrow.”
