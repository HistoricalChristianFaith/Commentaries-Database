With reason, therefore, the apostle has called the wisdom of God "manifold "and which has manifested its power "in many departments and in many modes".
-by art, by knowledge, by faith, by prophecy-for our benefit. "For all wisdom is from the Lord, and is with Him for ever "as says the wisdom of Jesus.
which He purposed in Christ."
