Since the soul became too enfeebled for the apprehension of realities, we needed a divine teacher. The Savior is sent down—a teacher and leader in the acquisition of the good, as the secret and sacred token of the great Providence. “Where, then, is the scribe? Where is the searcher of this world? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?” it is said. And again, “I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent,” speaks plainly of those who are wise in their own eyes and contentious. Excellently, therefore, Jeremiah says, “Thus says the Lord, ‘Stand in the ways, and ask for the eternal paths, what is the good way, and walk in it, and you shall find expiation for your souls.’ ”
