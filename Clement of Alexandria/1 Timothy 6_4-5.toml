Skill in sophistry, an enthusiasm of the Greeks, is a power operating on the imagination, using arguments to implant false opinions as if they were true. It produces rhetoric for persuasion and eristic for controversy. If the skills lack philosophy, then anyone at all would find them damaging.… So the admirable apostle was right to play down these appalling excesses in language skills.
