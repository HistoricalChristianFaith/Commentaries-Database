Daniel said there were 2, days from the time that the abomination of Nero stood in the holy city, till its destruction.… [This] makes six years and four months, during the half of which Nero held sway, and it was half a week; and for a half, Vespasian with Otho, Galba and Vitellius reigned.… After the 1, days … war ceased.
