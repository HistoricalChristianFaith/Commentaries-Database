Wherefore says the apostle, "Sin shall not have dominion over you; for ye are not under the law, but under grace.".
For it is written, "Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, whose sins are covered. Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin, and in whose mouth there is no fraud."
