Our Educator, O children, resembles his Father, God, whose Son he is. He is without sin, without blame… . God immaculate in human form, accomplishing his Father’s will. He is God the Word, who is in the bosom of the Father and also at the right hand of the Father, with even the nature of God. He it is who is the spotless image. We must try, then, to resemble Him in spirit as far as we are able… . Yet we must strive to the best of our ability to be as sinless as we can. There is nothing more important for us than first to be rid of sin and weakness and then to uproot any habitual sinful inclination. The highest perfection, of course, is never to sin in any least way, but this can be said of God alone. The next highest is never deliberately to commit wrong; this is the state proper to the man who possesses wisdom. In the third place comes not sinning except on rare occasions; this marks a man who is well educated. Finally, in the lowest degree we must place delaying in sin for a brief moment, but even this, for those who are called to recover their loss and repent, is a step on the path to salvation.
