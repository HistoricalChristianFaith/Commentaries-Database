Wisdom is open to all and loves humankind. Anyway, Solomon says, “My son, if you accept my words of instruction and keep them deep within you, your ear will listen to wisdom.” This means that the word is sown and kept deep in the soul of the learner as if in the ground. This is spiritual growth.So he adds, “You shall direct your heart to understanding and direct it towards instruction for your son.” For in my view, the union of soul with soul and spirit with spirit in accordance with the sowing of the word brings growth to the seed sown and produces life. Everyone who is educated in obedience to his educator becomes a son.
