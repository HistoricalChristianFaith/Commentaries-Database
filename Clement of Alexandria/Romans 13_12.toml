For the apostle decrees that, "putting off the works of darkness, we should put on the armour of light, walking honestly as in the day, not spending our time in rioting and drunkenness, in chambering and wantonness.".
Non enim "carnis curam gerere ad concupiscent as "didicimus; "honeste autem tanquam in die "Christo, et Dominica lucida vitae institutione, "ambulantes, non in comessationibus et ebrietatibus, non in cubilibus et impudicitiis, non in lit bus et contention bus."

By “day” and “light” he designates figuratively the Son, and by “the armor of light” he means the promises.
