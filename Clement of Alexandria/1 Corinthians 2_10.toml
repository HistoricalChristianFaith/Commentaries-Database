For it is not spurious words which those inspired by God and those who are gained over by them adduce, nor is it snares in which the most of the sophists entangle the young, spending their time on nought true. But those who possess the Holy Spirit "search the deep things of God".
"For the Spirit searches the deep things of God. But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit."

Those who possess the Spirit seek out the deep things of God, that is, the hidden secrets that surround prophecy.
