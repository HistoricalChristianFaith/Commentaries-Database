But are you so devoid of fear, or rather of faith, as not to believe the Lord himself, or Paul, who in Christ’s stead thus entreats, “Taste and see that Christ is God”? Faith will lead you in; experience will teach you; Scripture will train you, for it says, “Come hither, O children; listen to me, and I will teach you the fear of the Lord.” Then, as to those who already believe, it briefly adds, “Who is he who desires life, who loves to see good days?” It is we, we shall say—we who are the devotees of good, we who eagerly desire good things. Hear, then, you who are far off, hear you who are near: the word has not been hidden from any; light is common, it shines “on all people.” No one is a Cimmerian in respect to the word. Let us haste to salvation, to regeneration; let us who are many haste that we may be brought together into one love, according to the union of the essential unity; and let us, by being made good, conformably follow after union, seeking after the One who is good.
