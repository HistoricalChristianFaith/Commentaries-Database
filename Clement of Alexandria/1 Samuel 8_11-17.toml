I must now … express my disapproval of the possession of too many slaves. People resort to servants to escape work and waiting on themselves.… The Word has given a complete description of these offenders when he promised through the prophet Samuel that the people who were demanding a king would have not a kind master but one who would be an unfeeling tyrant, given over to immorality, “who will take,” he said, “your daughters to make him ointments and to be his cooks and bakers,” who will rule by law of war and not be zealous for the administration of peace.
