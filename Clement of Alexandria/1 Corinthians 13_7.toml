) is in truth celestial food, the banquet of reason. "It beareth all things, endureth all things, hopeth all things. Love never faileth.".
Although visited with ignominy and exile, and confiscation, and above all, death, he will never be wrenched from his freedom, and signal love to God. "The charity which bears all things, endures all things".
Love beareth all things, suffereth all things.'.
But the perfect man, out of love, "beareth all things, endureth all things"
