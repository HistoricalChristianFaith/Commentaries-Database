God raised Christ to the skies, transplanting mortality into immortality and translating earth to heaven—he, the husbandman of God, “pointing out the favorable signs and rousing the nations to good works, putting them in mind of their true sustenance,” having bestowed on us the truly great, divine and inalienable inheritance of the Father, deifying people by heavenly teaching, putting his laws into our minds and writing them on our hearts. What laws does he inscribe? “That all shall know God, from small to great,” and, “I will be merciful to them,” says God, “and will not remember their sins.” Let us receive the laws of life, let us comply with God’s corrections. Let us become acquainted with him, that he may be gracious.
