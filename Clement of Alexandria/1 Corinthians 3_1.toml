So also may we take the Scripture: "And I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal, even as unto babes in Christ; ".
For ye are yet carnal: for whereas there is among you envy and strife, are ye not carnal, and walk as men? ".
I have fed you with milk, not with meat: for ye were not yet able; neither are ye now able. For ye are yet carnal."
