By washing the feet of his disciples with his own hands as he sent them forth to noble deeds, the Savior manifested in an excellent way their journeying to bestow graces upon the nations. He purified that journeying in anticipation by his own power. The perfume left its aroma after it and suggests the sweetsmelling accomplishments that reach everyone. The suffering of the Lord, indeed, has filled us with its fragrance. .

For we are to God a sweet savour of the Lord, in them that are saved, and them that are lost; to one a savour of death unto death, to the other a savour of life unto life."
