Who are the two or three who gather in the name of Christ with the Lord in their midst? By three does he not mean husband, wife and child? “A wife is united with her husband by God.” But if a man wishes to be unencumbered and prefers to avoid producing children because of the time it takes up, then, says the apostle, “he had better stay unmarried like me.” … God through his Son is with those who responsibly marry and produce children, and it is the same God who in the same way is with the man who shows self-control in the light of the Logos.
