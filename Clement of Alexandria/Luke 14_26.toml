"Qui autem, inquiunt, non oderit patrem, vel matrem, vel uxorem, vel filios, non potest meus esse discipulus.".
He knows accurately the declaration, "Unless ye hate father and mother, and besides your own life, and unless ye bear the sign.
But let neither this trouble you, nor the still harder saying delivered in another place in the words, "Whoso hateth not father, and mother, and children, and his own life besides, cannot be My disciple."
