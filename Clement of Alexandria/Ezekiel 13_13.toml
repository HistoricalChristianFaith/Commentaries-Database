The words that follow describe and condemn some sin that has been committed. The judgment contained in these words is just, for it is as if he were giving notice in the words of the prophet that, if you had not sinned, he would not have made these threats.â€¦ The inspired Word exists because of both obedience and disobedience: that we may be saved by obeying it and educated because we have disobeyed.
