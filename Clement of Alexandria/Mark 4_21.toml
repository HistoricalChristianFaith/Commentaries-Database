A well, when pumped regularly, produces purer water. If neglected, and no one uses it, it changes into a source of pollution. Use keeps metal brighter, but disuse produces rust. For, in a word, exercise produces a healthy condition both in souls and bodies. So “No one lights a candle and puts it under a bowl, but upon a candlestick, that it may give light.” For of what use is wisdom, if it fails to make those who hear it wise?
