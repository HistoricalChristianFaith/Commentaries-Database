"The life was manifested." For in the Gospel he thus speaks: "And what was made, in Him was life, and the life was the light of men." [John 1:3-4]

"And we show unto you that eternal life, which was with the Father, and was manifested unto you."

He signifies by the appellation of Father, that the Son also existed always, without beginning.
