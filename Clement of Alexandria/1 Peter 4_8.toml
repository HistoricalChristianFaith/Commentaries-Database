This is love, to love God and our neighbour. This conducts to the height which is unutterable. "Love covers a multitude of sins. Love beareth all things, suffereth all things." Love joins us to God, does all things in concord. In love, all the chosen of God were perfected. Apart from love, nothing is well pleasing to God.
