Those who possess the Holy Spirit search out “the deep places of God”—in other words, they attain the hidden secrets that surround prophecy. But it is forbidden to share holy things with dogs, as long as they remain wild. It is never appropriate to dilute the pure stream of divinity, the living water, for interests that are full of malice, disturbed persons, still without faith, who are unrestrained in barking at the hunt.
