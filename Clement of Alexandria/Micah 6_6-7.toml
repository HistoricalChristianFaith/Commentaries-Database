Is everyone who is turning from sin to faith, turning from sinful practices (as if they were his mother) to life? I shall call in evidence one of the twelve prophets, who says, “Am I to make an offering of my firstborn son for my impiety? Should I offer the fruit of my womb for the sin of my soul?” Can the mother buy her way to God by giving up her firstborn? This must not be taken as an attack on the words “increase in numbers.” Micah is naming, by using the word impiety, the first impulses after birth, which do not help us to knowledge of God. If anyone misuses this as a basis for saying that that birth is evil, he should also use it as a basis for saying that it is good, in that in it we come to know the truth. “Come back to a sober and upright life and stop sinning.” But the sinner knows nothing of God. “We are not wrestling against flesh and blood but against spiritual beings, potent in temptation, the rulers of this dark world,” so there is forbearance. This is why Paul says, “I bruise my own body and treat it as a slave, because every athlete goes into total training.” By “total training” we understand not that he abstains from absolutely everything but that he shows self-control in those things he has taken a deliberate decision to use. “They do it to win a crown which dies, we for one which never dies,” if we win the contest. No effort, no crown!
