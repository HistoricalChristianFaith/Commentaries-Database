Therefore the Word who leads us his children to salvation is unquestionably an educator of little ones. In fact, through Hosea, the Word says plainly of himself, “I am your educator.” The matter he educates us in is fear of God, for this fear instructs us in the service of God, educates to the knowledge of truth, and guides by a path leading straight up to heaven.
