For on the believer alone, who is separated entirely from the rest, who by the Scripture are called wild beasts, rests the head of the universe, the kind and gentle Word, "who taketh the wise in their own craftiness. For the Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise, that they axe vain; ".
This, then, "the wisdom of the world is foolishness with God "and of those who are "the wise the Lord knoweth their thoughts that they are vain."
