The Lord says, “My teaching is not mine but my father’s, and he sent me.” About the robbers he says, “Anyone who speaks on his own authority is seeking his own glory.” Yet are the Greeks: “Lovers of self, arrogant.” In calling them wise, Scripture is not attacking the real sages but those masquerading as sages.
