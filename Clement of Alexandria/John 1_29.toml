But the unlovely and unsightly man will hear, "Friend, how did you come in here, without having a wedding garment?" [Matthew 22:12] And the fat and unctuous food — the delicacies abundant and sufficing of the blessed, — the fatted calf is killed; which is also again spoken of as a lamb (not literally); that no one may suppose it small; but it is the great and greatest.
