"Which are now," he says, [1 Peter 1:12] "reported unto you by them that have preached the Gospel unto you." The old things which were done by the prophets and escape the observation of most, are now revealed to you by the evangelists. "For to you," he says, "they are manifested by the Holy Ghost, who was sent;" that is the Paraclete, of whom the Lord said, "If I go not away, He will not come." [John 16:7] "Unto whom," it is said, "the angels desire to look;" not the apostate angels, as most suspect, but, what is a divine truth, angels who desire to obtain the advantage of that perfection.

Of ineffable and unutterable blessings, which eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, nor have entered into the heart of men; into which angels desire to look, and see what good things God hath prepared for the saints and the children who love Him."

These things were announced by the Holy Spirit, who is the comforter of whom Jesus said that, unless he himself went away, the Comforter would not come. The angels who want to glimpse these things are not the ones who fell, despite what many people think. Rather, these are the angels who desire to obtain the fullness of his perfection.
