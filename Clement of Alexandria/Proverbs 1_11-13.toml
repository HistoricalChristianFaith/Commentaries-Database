In the words of Solomon, “My son, let not sinners lead you astray, do not walk in their ways. Do not walk if they entice you saying: Come with us, let us share innocent blood: let us hide the just man in the earth unjustly, let us swallow him up alive as in hell.” This last passage is also a prophecy of the passion of the Lord.
