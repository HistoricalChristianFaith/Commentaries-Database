We can discover many counsels about other things, also, as about prayer, for example: “Good works are a prayer acceptable to the Lord,” Scripture says. The way to pray is prescribed: “If you see one naked, cover him, and do not look away from the members of your family. Then shall your light break forth as the morning, and your garments shall speedily rise, and your justice shall go before your face, and the glory of God shall encircle you.”
