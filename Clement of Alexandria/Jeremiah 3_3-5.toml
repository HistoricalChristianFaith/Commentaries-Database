Accusation is censure of wrongdoers.… Of this help the divine Instructor made use by Jeremiah, saying, “You have a prostitute’s forehead. You were shameless toward all. You did not call me to the house, I who am your father, and Lord of your virginity.” “And a fair and graceful harlot skilled in enchanted potions.” With consummate art, after applying to the virgin the disgraceful name of whoredom, he at once calls her back to an honorable life by filling her with shame.
