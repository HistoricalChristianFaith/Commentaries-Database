The Scripture makes good sense: “Cain left God’s presence and went to live in the land of Nod, opposite Eden.” Nod means “disturbance,” Eden, “the good life.” The good life from which the transgressor was expelled consisted in faith, knowledge, peace. Those wise in their own eyes … are happy to transfer to the disturbance of a tossing sea. They drop from the knowledge of the One who knows no birth to the realm of birth and death. Their opinions are constantly changing.
