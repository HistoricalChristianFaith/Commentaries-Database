"For he that humbleth himself shall be exalted, and he that exalteth himself shall be humbled.".
For is it not thus that some of our writers have understood that man straightway on his creation received what is "according to the image "but that what is according "to the likeness "he will receive afterwards on his perfection? Now Plato, teaching that the virtuous man shall have this likeness accompanied with humility, explains the following: "He that humbleth himself shall be exalted."
