The crown of the woman must be considered the husband, and the crown of the husband is his marriage. For both, the flower of their union is the child who is indeed the flower that the divine cultivator culls from the meadow of the flesh. “The crown of old men is their children’s children and the glory of children is their father,” it is said. Our glory is the Father of all, and the crown of the whole church is Christ. .
