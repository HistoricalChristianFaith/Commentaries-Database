For there is an instruction of the perfect, concerning which Paul writes to the Colossians: “We don’t stop praying for you, asking that you may be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding.”… On the one hand, there are the mysteries which were hid till the time of the apostles and were delivered by them as they received from the Lord; these, concealed in the Old Testament, were manifested to the saints. And, on the other hand, there is “the riches of the glory of the mystery in the Gentiles,” which is faith and hope in Christ; which in another place he has called the “foundation.”
