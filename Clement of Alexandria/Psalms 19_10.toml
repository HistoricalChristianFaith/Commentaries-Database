“Sweet is the Word that gives us light, precious above gold and gems; it is to be desired above honey and the honeycomb.” For how can it be other than desirable, since it has filled with light the mind that had been buried in darkness and given keenness to the “light-bringing eyes” of the soul? For just as, had the sun not been in existence, night would have brooded over the universe notwithstanding the other luminaries of heaven, so, had we not known the Word and been illuminated by him, we should have been nowise different from fowls that are being fed, fattened in darkness and nourished for death. Let us then admit the light that we may admit God; let us admit the light and become disciples to the Lord.
