And the expression, "When I was a child, I thought as a child, I spoke as a child".
"When I became a man "again Paul says, "I put away childish things."

This is a figure of speech for the way Paul lived under the law, when he persecuted the Word and was still senseless and childish, blaspheming God.

He is not referring to the growing stature that comes with age, nor to any definite period of time, nor even to any secret teaching reserved only for mature adults, when he claims that he left and put away all childishness. Rather he means to say that those who live by the law are childish in the sense that they are subject to fear, like children afraid of ghosts, while those who are obedient to the Word and are completely free are in his opinion mature.
