Solomon the son of David, in the books styled The Reigns of the Kings, comprehending not only that the structure of the true temple was celestial and spiritual but had also a reference to the flesh, which he who was both the son and the Lord of David was to build up, both for his own presence, where, as a living image, he resolved to make his shrine, and for the church that was to rise up through the union of faith, says expressly, “Will God in very deed dwell with humans on the earth?” He dwells on the earth clothed in flesh, and his abode with humans is effected by the conjunction and harmony that obtain among the righteous and that build … a new temple. For the righteous are the earth, being still encompassed with the earth; and earth, too, in comparison with the greatness of the Lord. Thus also the blessed Peter does not hesitate to say, “You also, as living stones, are built up, a spiritual house, a holy temple, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.” And with reference to the body, which by circumscription he consecrated as a hallowed place for himself on earth, he said, “Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up again.” The Jews therefore said, “In forty-six years was this temple built, and will you raise it up in three days?” “But he spoke of the temple of his body.”
