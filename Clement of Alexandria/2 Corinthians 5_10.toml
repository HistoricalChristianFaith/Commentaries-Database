Non intelligunt ergo, ut videtur, quod "omnes nos oportet manifestari ante tribunal Christi, ut refer at unusquisque per corpus ea quae fecit, sire bonum, sive malum: ".
"Quare si quis est in Christo, nova creatura est "nec amplius peccatis dedita: "Vetera praeterierunt "vitam antiquam exuimus: "Ecce enim nova facta sunt"

Those who drag in a doctrine of moral indifference do violence to some few passages of Scripture, thinking that they support their own love of pleasure; in particular, the passage “Sin shall have no authority over you; for you are not subject to sin but to grace.” But there are other such passages, which there is no good reason to record for these purposes, as I am not equipping a pirate ship! Let me quickly cut through their attempt. The admirable apostle in person will refute their charge in the words with which he continues the previous quotation: “Well then! Shall we sin because we are no longer under law but under grace? God forbid!” With these inspired prophetic words, at a single stroke he undoes the sophistical skill at the service of pleasure. So they have not understood, it seems, that “we must all appear before Christ’s tribunal, where each must receive what is due to him for his physical conduct, good or bad,” that is, where a person may receive recompense for what he has done by means of his body.
