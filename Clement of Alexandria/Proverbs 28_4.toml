The Stoics laid down their doctrine on the basis that the goal is to live according to nature, using the word nature improperly rather than “God,” since nature applies to plants, crops, trees and stones. At any rate, there is the clear statement, “Scoundrels think nothing of the law, but those who love the law set it in front of them like a wall.” For “the wisdom of able men will understand the paths of wisdom, but the folly of fools goes in the wrong direction.”
