This the Scripture.
"Accordingly, the blessed apostle very appropriately and urgently exhorts us "not to strive about words to no profit, but to the subverting of the hearers, but to shun profane and vain babblings, for they increase unto more ungodliness, and their word will eat as doth a canker."

You must not “make your phylacteries broad” in eagerness for empty repute. The Christian Knower is satisfied with finding an audience of one.
