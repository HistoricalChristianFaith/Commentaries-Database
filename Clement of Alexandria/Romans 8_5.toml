It is possible to think of those who have just recently been instructed in the faith and who are still little ones in Christ as carnal, for he calls those who have already believed by the Holy Spirit “spiritual” and those newly taught and not yet purified “carnal.” He speaks of these latter as carnal with good reason, for like the pagans they still mind the things of the flesh.
