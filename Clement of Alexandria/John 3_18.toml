The prophet says with justification, “The ungodly are not so, but as the chaff that the wind drives away from the face of the earth. And so, the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment” because they are already condemned since “those who do not believe are condemned already.” “Nor do sinners sit in the counsel of the righteous,” inasmuch as they too are already condemned and are not united to those who have lived without stumbling. “For the Lord knows the way of the righteous; and the way of the ungodly shall perish.” Again, the Lord clearly shows sins and transgression to be in our own power.
