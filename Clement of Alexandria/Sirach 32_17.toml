In Jeremiah it says, “Jerusalem has committed a great sin, and it has thus fallen into turmoil. All those who honored it now despise it, because they have seen its abomination.” Through Solomon, however, he attenuates the severity and harshness of the accusation and shows the sweetness of his pedagogy, saying, “My son, do not despise the Lord’s corrections, and do not spurn his reproofs. In fact, the one whom the Lord loves, he corrects, and he always scourges the one he accepts,” whereas “the sinner shuns reproof.” Therefore “let the just one accuse me,” says the Scripture, “and correct me, but let not the oil of sinners anoint my head.”
