The book of Wisdom plainly says, "For mercy and wrath are with him, for he alone is Lord of both." He is Lord of propitiations and pours forth wrath according to the abundance of his mercy. It is the same with his reproof. For the aim of mercy and of reproof is the salvation of those who are reproved. Now, that the God and Father of our Lord Jesus is good, the Word will again attest: "For he is kind to the unthankful and the evil," and further, when he says, "Be merciful, as your Father is merciful." Still further also he plainly says, "None is good but my Father, who is in heaven." In addition to these, again he says, "My Father makes his sun to shine on all." - "Christ the Educator 1.72.1â€“2"
