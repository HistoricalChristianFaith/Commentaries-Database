Thus the apostle, in his solicitude for us, discriminates in the case of entertainments, saying, that "if any one called a brother be found a fornicator, or an adulterer, or an idolater, with such an one not to eat; ".
Unde prae clare Apostolus: "Scripsi "inquit, "vobis in epistola, non conversari cure fornicator bus"
