“The wisdom of able men will understand the paths of wisdom, but the folly of fools goes in the wrong direction.” Prophecy says, “To whom shall I look if not to the man who is gentle and tranquil and who trembles at my words.” We have been taught that there are three forms of friendship. The first and best of these is based on virtue, since the love which proceeds from reason is firmly based. The second stands between the others and is based on mutuality. It involves mutual sharing and is beneficial to life. Friendship on the basis of free giving is mutual. The third, and last, comes, as we put it, from habit. Some say that it chops and changes, being based on pleasure.
