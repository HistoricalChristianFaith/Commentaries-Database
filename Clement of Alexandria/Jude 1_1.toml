Jude, who wrote the Catholic Epistle, the brother of the sons of Joseph, and very religious, while knowing the near relationship of the Lord, yet did not say that he himself was His brother. But what said he? "Jude, a servant of Jesus Christ,"â€” of Him as Lord; but "the brother of James." For this is true; he was His brother, (the son) of Joseph.
