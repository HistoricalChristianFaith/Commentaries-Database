But the teaching, which is according to the Saviour, is complete in itself and without defect, being "the power and wisdom of God; ".
The law of this man who possesses knowledge is the saving precept; or rather, the law is the precept of knowledge. For the Word is "the power and the wisdom of God.".
On hearing the voice of the Lord, whether that of His own person or that acting through His apostles, with all speed turned and believed. For we remember that the Lord is "the power of God"
