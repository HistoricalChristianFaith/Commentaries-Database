Those who are wild in respect of faith and polluted in life, not purified by the righteousness that is according to the law, are called wild beasts. But changed from wild beasts by the faith of the Lord, they become people of God, advancing from the wish to change to the fact. For some the Lord exhorts, and to those who have already made the attempt he stretches forth his hand and draws them up. “For the Lord dreads not the face of anyone, nor will he regard greatness; for he has made small and great and cares alike for all.” And David says, “For the heathen are fixed in the destruction they have caused; their foot is taken in the snare that they hid.” “But the Lord was a refuge to the poor, a help in season also in affliction.” Those, then, who were in affliction had the gospel seasonably proclaimed. And therefore it said, “Declare among the heathen his pursuits,” that they may not be judged unjustly.
