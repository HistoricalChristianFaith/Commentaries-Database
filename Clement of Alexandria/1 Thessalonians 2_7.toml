We ought now to be in a position to understand that the name “little one” is not used in the sense of lacking intelligence. The notion of childishness has that pejorative meaning, but the term “little one” really means “one newly become gentle,” just as the word gentle means being mild-mannered. So, a “little one” means one just recently become gentle and meek of disposition. St. Paul obviously suggests this when he says: “Although as the apostle of Christ we could have claimed a position of honor among you, still while in your midst we were children, as if a nurse were cherishing her own children.” A little one is gentle and for that reason decidedly amenable, mild and simple, without deceit or pretense, direct and upright of mind. Childlikeness is the foundation for simplicity and truthfulness.
