Then it is right to notice, with respect to the appellation of infant, that the infant is not predicated of the silly: for the silly man is called foolish: and infant is one that has newly become gentle and meek in Conduct. This the blessed Paul most clearly pointed out when he said, "When we might have been burdensome as the apostles of Christ, we were gentle among you, as a nurse cherisheth her children." The child is therefore gentle, and therefore more tender, delicate, and simple, guileless, and destitute of hypocrisy, straightforward and upright in mind, which is the basis of simplicity and truth.
