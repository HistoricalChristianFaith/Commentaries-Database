[Jesus] “spoke all things in parables, and without a parable he spoke nothing” [to the apostles]; and if “all things were made by him, and without him was not anything made that was made,” consequently also prophecy and the law were by him and were spoken by him in parables. “But all things are right,” says the Scripture, “before those who understand,” that is, those who receive and observe, according to the church’s rule of faith, the exposition of the Scriptures explained by him. And the church’s rule is the concord and harmony of the law and the prophets in the covenant delivered at the coming of the Lord. Knowledge is then followed by practical wisdom and practical wisdom by selfcontrol, for it may be said that practical wisdom is divine knowledge and exists in those who share in God’s life, while the selfcontrol that is mortal, which is present in those who philosophize, is not yet wise.
