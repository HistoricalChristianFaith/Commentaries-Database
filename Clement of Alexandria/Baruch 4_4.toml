He clearly calls us to goodness by Solomon when he says, “Blessed is the one who has found wisdom and the mortal who has found understanding.” “For goodness is found by him who seeks it and is likely to be seen by him who has found it.” By Jeremiah, too, he sets forth prudence when he says, “Blessed are we, Israel; for what is pleasing to God is known by us”—and it is known by the Word, by whom we are blessed and wise. For wisdom and knowledge are mentioned by the same prophet when he says, “Hear, O Israel, the commandments of life, and listen to know understanding.”
