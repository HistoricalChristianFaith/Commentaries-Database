"And if one of the unbelievers call us to a feast, and we determine to go "(for it is a good thing not to mix with the dissolute), the apostle bids us "eat what is set before us, asking no questions for conscience sake."

We must shun gluttony and eat only what is necessary. But if some unbeliever invites us to a banquet and we decide to accept, the apostle tells us to eat what is set before us. We do not need to abstain from rich foods completely, but we should not hanker for them either.
