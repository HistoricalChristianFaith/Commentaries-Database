With milk, then, the Lord's nutriment, we are nursed directly we are born; and as soon as we are regenerated, we are honoured by receiving the good news of the hope of rest, even the Jerusalem above, in which it is written that milk and honey fall in showers, receiving through what is material the pledge of the sacred food. "For meats are done away with".
But we who seek the heavenly bread must role the belly, which is beneath heaven, and much more the things which are agreeable to it, which "God shall destroy".
says the apostle, justly execrating gluttonous desires. For "meats are for the belly".
Nam cum "domino sabbati "etiamsi intemperanter vivat, nulla ratio reddenda sit, multo magis qui vitam moderate et temperate instituit, nulli erit rationi reddendae obnoxius. "Omnia enim licent, sed non omnia expediunt".
Etenim de ventre et cibis dictum est: "Escae ventri, et venter escis; Deus antem et illum et has destruet; ".
usque ad illud: "Corpus autem non fornicationi, sed Domino, et Dominus corpori."

We must restrain the belly and keep it under the control of heaven. God will finally bring to nothing all that is made for the belly, as the apostle says.
