In this way the Lord in the Gospels spurs on His disciples, urging them to attend to Him, hastening as He was to the Father; rendering His hearers more eager by the intimation that after a little He was to depart, and showing them that it was requisite that they should take more unsparing advantage of the truth than ever before, as the Word was to ascend to heaven. Again, therefore, He calls them children; for He says, "Children, a little while I am with you.".
Lignum hic prius erat aridum; si autem Logo obedierit, et sabbata custodieri, per abstinent am a peccatis, et fecerit mandata erit honorabilior iis, qui absque recta vitae institutione solo sermone erudiuntur. "Filioli, modicure "adhuc sum vobiscum".
It is He Himself who says, "Little children, a little while I am still with you."
