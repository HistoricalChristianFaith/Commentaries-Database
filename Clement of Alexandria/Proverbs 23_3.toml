There is no limit to the gluttony that these people practice. Truly, in ever inventing a multitude of new sweets and ever seeking recipes of every description, they are shipwrecked on pastries and honey cakes and desserts.To me, a man of this sort seems nothing more than one great mouth.â€¦ As for us, who seek a heavenly food, we must restrain the belly and keep it under the control of heaven.
