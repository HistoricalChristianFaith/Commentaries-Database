As, then, philosophy has been brought into evil repute by pride and self-conceit, so also ghosts by false ghosts called by the same name; of which the apostle writing says, "O Timothy, keep that which is committed to thy trust, avoiding the profane and vain babblings and oppositions of science (gnosis) falsely so called; which some professing, have erred concerning the faith."

Pride and opinionated views have corrupted philosophy. In the same way, false knowledge, though it bears the same name, has corrupted true knowledge. The apostle writes of it, saying, “Timothy, guard what has been entrusted to you. Avoid the godless chatter and contradictions of what is falsely called knowledge, for by professing it some have missed the mark as regards the faith.” Because this verse exposes them, the heretics regard the letters to Timothy as inauthentic. Well, if the Lord is “truth” and “the wisdom and power of God,” as in fact he is, it would be demonstrated that the true knower is the one who has come to know Son and his Father through him.
