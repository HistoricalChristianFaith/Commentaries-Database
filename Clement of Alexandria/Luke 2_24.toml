And when He says, "as suckling calves," He again alludes figuratively to us; and "as an innocent and gentle dove," the reference is again to us. Again, by Moses, He commands "two young pigeons or a pair of turtles to be offered for sin;" thus saying, that the harmlessness and innocence and placable nature of these tender young birds are acceptable to God, and explaining that like is an expiation for like. Further, the timorousness of the turtle-doves typifies fear in reference to sin.
