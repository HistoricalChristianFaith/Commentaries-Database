Rebuking censures what is base and highlights what is noble. This is shown by Jeremiah: “They were horses mad for females. Each one neighed for his neighbor’s wife. Shall I not visit them for these things? says the Lord. Should not I avenge my soul against such a nation as this?” He everywhere interweaves fear, because “the fear of the Lord is the beginning of reason.” - "Christ the Educator 1.9"

If birth is an evil, then the blasphemers must place the Lord who went through birth and the virgin who gave him birth in the category of evil. Abominable people! In attacking birth they are maligning the will of God and the mystery of creation. This is the basis of Cassian’s docetism, Marcion’s too, yes, and Valentinus’s “semi-spiritual body.” It leads them to say, “Humanity became like cattle in coming to sexual intercourse.” But it is when a man, swollen with lust, really and truly wants to go to bed with a woman not his own, that that sort of man actually becomes a wild beast. “They turned into stallions crazed for mares; each was whinnying for his neighbor’s wife.” - "Stromateis 3.17.102.1–3"

At another time, he speaks of us under the figure of a colt. He means by that that we are unyoked to evil, unsubdued by wickedness, unaffected and high-spirited only with him our Father. We are colts, not stallions “who whinny lustfully for their neighbor’s wife,” beasts of burden unrestrained in their lust. Rather, we are free and newly born, joyous in our faith, and hold fast to the course of truth. We are swift in seeking salvation, and we spurn and trample on worldliness. - "Christ the Educator 15"
