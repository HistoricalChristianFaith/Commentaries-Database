Is another people, and trust in another, and have willingly sold themselves to another; but those who perform the commandments of the Lord, in every action "testify "by doing what He wishes, and consistently naming the Lord's name; and "testifying "by deed to Him in whom they trust, that they are those "who have crucified the flesh, with the affections and lusts. ""If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit."
