Perhaps by the iota and tittle His righteousness cries, "If you come right unto Me, I will also come right to you; but if crooked, I also will come crooked, says the Lord of hosts;" intimating that the ways of sinners are intricate and crooked. For the way right and agreeable to nature which is intimated by the iota of Jesus, is His goodness, which constantly directs those who believe from hearing. "There shall not, therefore, pass from the law one iota or one tittle," neither from the right and good the mutual promises, nor from the crooked and unjust the punishment assigned to them. "For the Lord does good to the good, but those who turn aside into crooked ways God will lead with the workers of iniquity."
