We should sleep halfawakeâ€¦. A man who is asleep is not good for anything, any more than a man who is dead. Therefore, even during the night we should rouse ourselves from sleep often and give praise to God. Blessed are they who have kept watch for him, for they make themselves like the angels whom we speak of as ever watchful. .

But let us who are of the day be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love, and as an helmet the hope of salvation."
