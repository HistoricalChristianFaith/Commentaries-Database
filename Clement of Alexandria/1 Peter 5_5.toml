Dicunt autem gloriosi isti jactatores se imitari Dominum, qui neque uxorem duxit, neque in mundo aliquid possedit; se magis quam alii Evangelium intellexisse gloriantes. Eis autem dicit Scriptura: "Deus superb is resistit, humilibus autem dat gratiam.".
"Moses, `the servant who was faithful in all his house, 'said to Him who uttered the oracles from the bush, `Who am I, that Thou sendest me? I am slow of speech, and of a stammering tongue, 'to minister the voice of God in human speech. And again: `I am smoke from a pot. 'For God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace to the humble."
