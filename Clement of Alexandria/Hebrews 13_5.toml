For God's greatest gift is self-restraint. For He Himself has said, "I will neyer leave thee, nor forsake thee"

We must join in disciplining ourselves to beware of all that is subject to the passions. We must, like true philosophers, escape from any foods that arouse sexual desire, from a dissolute relaxation in bed, from luxury and all the passions that make for luxury. We realize that others find this a grievous struggle. It is no longer so for us, since self-discipline is God’s greatest gift. He has said, “I will never forsake you or abandon you,” who have judged you worthy by a decision that is wholly genuine. In this way, as we carefully strive to go to him, the Lord’s “easy yoke” will receive us.… There is, according to Hippocrates of Cos, a discipline of the soul as well as of the body, “a state of health which does not shrink from hardship and cannot have enough nourishment.”
