Most instructively, therefore, says Paul in the Acts of the Apostles: "The God that made the world, and all things in it, being the Lord of heaven and earth, dwelleth not in temples made with hands; neither is worshipped by men's hands, as if He needed anything; seeing that it is He Himself that giveth to all breath, and life, and all things."

Is it not the case that rightly and truly we do not circumscribe in any place that which cannot be circumscribed; nor do we shut up in temples made with hands that which contains all things?… It would indeed be ridiculous, as the philosophers themselves say, for a person, the plaything of God, to make God, and for God to be the plaything of art.… Works of art cannot … be sacred and divine.… And if the word sacred has a twofold application, designating both God himself and the structure raised to his honor, how shall we not, through knowledge, properly call the church “holy,” “made for the honor of God,” “sacred to God,” “of great value,” not being constructed by mechanical art … but by the will of God fashioned into a temple? For it is not now the place but the assembly of the elect that I call the church.
