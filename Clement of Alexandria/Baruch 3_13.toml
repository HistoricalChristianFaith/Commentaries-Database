And still another form of instruction is benediction. “And blessed is he,” he says by David, “who has not sinned; and he shall be as the tree planted near the channels of the waters, which will yield its fruit in its season, and its leaf shall not wither”—which is an allusion to the resurrection—“and whatever he will do will prosper with him.” This is what he wants us to be so that we may be blessed. Again, showing the opposite scale of the balance of justice, he says, “But not so the ungodly—not so; but as the dust that the wind sweeps away from the face of the earth.” By showing the punishment of sinners and how easily they are dissipated and carried off by the wind, the Teacher dissuades us from crime by means of punishment. And, by holding up the penalty we deserve, he shows the goodness of his beneficence in the most skillful way in order that we may possess and enjoy its blessings. He invites us to knowledge also when he says by the mouth of Jeremiah, “If you had walked in the way of God, you would have lived forever in peace.” Thus, when he exhibits the reward of knowledge here, he invites those who are wise to its love. And, granting pardon to him who has erred, he says, “Turn, turn, as a grape gatherer to his basket.” Do you see the goodness of justice, in that it counsels to repentance?
