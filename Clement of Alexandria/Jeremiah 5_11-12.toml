Accusation is the censure of wrongdoers. This mode of instruction God employs by David, when he says, “The people whom I did not know served me, and when their ears heard they obeyed me. Sons of strangers came to me, and halted from their ways.” And by Jeremiah: “And I gave her a divorce decree, but covenant-breaking Judah did not fear.” And again: “And the house of Israel disregarded me. The house of Judah lied to the Lord.”
