To inquire, respecting God, if it tends not to strife but to discovery, is salutary. For it is written in David, “The poor eat and shall be filled; and they shall praise the Lord that seek him. Your heart shall live forever.” For they who seek him after the true search, praising the Lord, shall be filled with the gift that comes from God, that is, knowledge. And their soul shall live; for the soul is figuratively termed the heart, which ministers life: for by the Son is the Father known.
