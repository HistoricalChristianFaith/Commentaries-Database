Let us bear about a deep love for the Creator; let us cleave to Him with our whole heart; let us not wickedly waste the substance of reason, like the prodigal. Let us obtain the joy laid up, in which Paul exulting, exclaimed, "Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?" [RomansÂ 8:35] To Him belongs glory and honour, with the Father and the Holy Spirit, world without end. Amen.
