In what manner do you think the Lord drank when He became man for our sakes? As shamelessly as we? Was it not with decorum and propriety? Was it not deliberately? For rest assured, He Himself also partook of wine; for He, too, was man. And He blessed the wine, saying, "Take, drink: this is my blood"-the blood of the vine. He figuratively calls the Word "shed for many, for the remission of sins"-the holy stream of gladness. And that he who drinks ought to observe moderation, He clearly showed by what He taught at feasts.
