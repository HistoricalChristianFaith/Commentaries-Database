He forgets the words of the Educator: “Every man that passes beyond his own bed, who says in his soul: Who sees me? Darkness compasses me about, and the walls cover me, and no man sees my sins: whom do I fear? The Most High will not remember.” Such a person is most wretched, for he fears only the human observation and thinks to hide from God. “He does not know,” Scripture continues, “that the eyes of the Most High Lord are far brighter than the sun, beholding all the ways of men and looking into the most hidden parts.” Another time, the Educator gives warning through Isaiah: “Woe to you who made your counsel in secret and say: Who sees us?” A light that can be seen by the senses may pass unnoticed, but that which illumines the mind cannot be ignored.
