"Rejoice," it is said, "that you are partakers in the sufferings of Christ:" that is, if you are righteous, you suffer for righteousness' sake, as Christ suffered for righteousness. "Happy are you, for the Spirit of God, who is the Spirit of His glory and virtue, rests on you." This possessive "His" signifies also an an angelic spirit: inasmuch as the glory of God those are, through whom, according to faith and righteousness, He is glorified, to honourable glory, according to the advancement of the saints who are brought in. "The Spirit of God on us," may be thus understood; that is, who through faith comes on the soul, like a gracefulness of mind and beauty of soul.
