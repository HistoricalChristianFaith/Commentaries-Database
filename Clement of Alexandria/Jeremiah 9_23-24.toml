What is the philosophy that the apostle bids us shun? This, then, “the wisdom of the world is foolishness with God.” “The Lord knows the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain.” Let no one therefore glory on account of pre-eminence in human thought. For it is written well in Jeremiah, “Let not the wise person glory in his wisdom, and let not the mighty person glory in his might, and let not the rich person glory in his riches. But let him that glories glory in this, that he understands and knows that I am the Lord, that executes mercy and judgment and righteousness on the earth: for in these things is my delight, say the Lord.”
