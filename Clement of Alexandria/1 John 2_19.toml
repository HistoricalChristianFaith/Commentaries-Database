"They went out from us; but they were not of us"— neither the apostate angels, nor men falling away —"but that they may be manifested that they are not of us." With sufficient clearness he distinguishes the class of the elect and that of the lost, and that which remaining in faith "has an unction from the Holy One," which comes through faith. He that abides not in faith.
