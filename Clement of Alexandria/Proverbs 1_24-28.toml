The correction of the Lord is very beneficial. He calls the same people, through David, also, “a perverse and exasperating generation, a generation that set not their heart aright: and whose spirit was not faithful to God. They kept not the covenant of God: and in his law they would not walk.” These are the reasons for his exasperation, and for these reasons he will come as judge to pass sentence on those who are unwilling to preserve goodness in their lives. Therefore, he treats them severely in the hope that perhaps he might curb their impulse toward death.… He knew that they repented out of fear, after neglecting his love; as a general rule, men always neglect the good that is kind, but serve it with loving fear if it keeps recalling justice.
