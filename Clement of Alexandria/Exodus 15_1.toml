It is said in the ode, “For he has triumphed gloriously: the horse and his rider has he cast into the sea.” The many-limbed and brutal affection, lust, with the rider mounted, who gives reigns to pleasures, “he has cast into the sea,” throwing them away into the disorders of the world. Thus also Plato, in his book On the Soul, says that the charioteer and the horse that ran off—the irrational part, which is divided in two, into anger and concupiscence—fall down. So the myth intimates that it was through the licentiousness of the steeds that Phathon was thrown out.
