"And that he knows that what is just is good, appears by his saying, "So that the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good".
Quare "lex quid era est sancta, et man datum sanctum, et just urn, et bonum.".
Wherefore the law is productive of the emotion of fear. "So that the law is holy "and in truth "spiritual".
Jesus, accordingly, does not charge him with not having fulfilled all things out of the law, but loves him, and fondly welcomes his obedience in what he had learned; but says that he is not perfect as respects eternal life, in as much as he had not fulfilled what is perfect, and that he is a doer indeed of the law, but idle at the true life. Those things, indeed, are good. Who denies it? For "the commandment is holy"
