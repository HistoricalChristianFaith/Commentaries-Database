Let the mention we make for our present purpose suffice, as it is not unsuitable to the flowers of the Word; and we have often done this, drawing to the urgent point of the question the most beneficial fountain, in order to water those who have been planted by the Word. "For if it is lawful for me to partake of all things, yet all things are not expedient.".
For there is one God who feeds the fowls and the fishes, and, in a word, the irrational creatures; and not one thing whatever is wanting to them, though "they take no thought for their food.".
Nam cum "domino sabbati "etiamsi intemperanter vivat, nulla ratio reddenda sit, multo magis qui vitam moderate et temperate instituit, nulli erit rationi reddendae obnoxius. "Omnia enim licent, sed non omnia expediunt".
Truly, "all things are lawful, but all things are not expedient "says the apostle: "all things are lawful for me, but all things edify not."

Those who take advantage of everything that is lawful rapidly deteriorate into doing what is not lawful.
