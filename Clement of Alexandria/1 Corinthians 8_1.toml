But the "supposition of knowledge inflates "and fills with pride; "but charity edifieth "which deals not in supposition, but in truth. Whence it is said, "If any man loves, he is known.".
But the knowledge of those who think themselves wise, whether the barbarian sects or the philosophers among the Greeks, according to the apostle, "puffeth up.".
And there are those who say that the knowledge about things sacrificed to idols is not promulgated among all, "lest our liberty prove a stumbling-block to the weak. For by thy knowledge he that is weak is destroyed. "
