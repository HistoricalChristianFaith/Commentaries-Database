The holy agape is the sublime and saving creation of the Lord.…An agape is in reality heavenly food, a banquet of the Word. The agape, or love, “bears all things, endures all things, hopes all things. Love never fails.” “Blessed is he who eats bread in the kingdom of God.” The most unlikely of all downfalls is charity that does not fail11 to be thrown down from heaven to earth among all these dainty seasonings. Do you still imagine that I refer to a meal that will be destroyed? “If I distribute my goods to the poor and do not have love,” Scripture says, “I am nothing.” The whole law and the word depend on this love. If you love the Lord your God and your neighbor, there will be a heavenly feast in heaven. The earthly feast, as we have proved from Scripture, is called a supper. It is permeated with love yet is not identified with it but is an expression of mutual and generous good will.
