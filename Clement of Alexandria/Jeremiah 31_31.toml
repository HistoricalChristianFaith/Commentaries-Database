For we find in the Scriptures, as the Lord says, “Behold, I make with you a new covenant, not as I made with your ancestors in Mount Horeb.” He made a new covenant with us. For what belonged to the Greeks and Jews is old. But we, who worship him in a new way, in the third form, are Christians. For clearly, as I think, he showed that the one and only God was known by the Greeks in a Gentile way, by the Jews Judaically and in a new and spiritual way by us.
