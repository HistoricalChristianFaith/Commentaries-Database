And it is ours to flee to God. And let us endeavor after this ceaselessly and energetically. For he says, “Come to me, all who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.” And prayer and confession with humility are voluntary acts. Therefore it is enjoined, “First tell your sins, that you may be justified.” What afterwards we shall obtain, and what we shall be, it is not for us to judge.
