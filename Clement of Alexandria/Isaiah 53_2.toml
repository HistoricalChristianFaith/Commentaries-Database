The Spirit gives witness through Isaiah that even the Lord became an unsightly spectacle: “And we saw him, and there was no beauty or comeliness in him, but his form was despised and rejected by people.” Yet, who is better than the Lord? He displayed not beauty of the flesh, which is only outward appearance, but the true beauty of body and soul—for the soul, the beauty of good deeds; for the body, the beauty of immortality.
