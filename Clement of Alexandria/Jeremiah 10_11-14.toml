Jeremiah the prophet, gifted with consummate wisdom, or rather the Holy Spirit in Jeremiah, exhibits God. “Am I a God at hand,” he says, “and not a God afar off? Can a person hide himself in secret places so that I cannot see him? Do I not fill heaven and earth? declares the Lord.” … For “the Lord who created the earth by his power,” as Jeremiah says, “has raised up the world by his wisdom.” For wisdom, which is his word, raises us up to the truth. It raises us who have fallen prostrate before idols. And this raising through the word is itself the first resurrection from our fall.
