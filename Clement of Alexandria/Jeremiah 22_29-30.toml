Someone who is in a state of ignorance is sinful and considered “earth and ashes.” Someone who is in a state of knowledge, being assimilated as far as possible to God, is already spiritual and thus is considered elect. Scripture calls the senseless and disobedient by the term “dirt,” which is clear from what Jeremiah the prophet says in reference to Joachim and his brothers: “Earth, earth, hear the word of the Lord. Inscribe this man as an outcast.”
