All these various ways and figures of speech speak of the Word: solid food, flesh, nourishment, bread, blood and milk. The Lord is all these things for the refreshment of us who believe in him. Let no one think it strange, then, that we speak of the blood of the Lord also under the figure of milk. Is it not named wine, metaphorically? “He washes his garment in wine,” Scripture says, “and his robe in the blood of the grape.” That means he will attire the body of the Word with his own blood, just as he will nurture those who hunger for the Word with his own Spirit.
