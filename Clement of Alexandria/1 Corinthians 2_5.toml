"That we should trust not in ourselves, but in God who raiseth the dead "says the apostle, "who delivered us from so great a death, that our faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God. ""For the spiritual man judgeth all things, but he himself is judged of no man.".
Wherefore also the apostle exhorts, "that your faith should not be in the wisdom of men "who profess to persuade, "but in the power of God"
