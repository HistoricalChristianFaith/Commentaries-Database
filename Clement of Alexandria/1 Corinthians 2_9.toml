And eyes anointed by the Word, and ears pierced for perception, make a man a hearer and contemplator of divine and sacred things, the Word truly exhibiting the true beauty "which eye hath not seen nor ear heard before.".
For those things which are really good, are what "neither ear hath heard, not hath ever entered into the heart".
"Lo, I make new things "saith the Word, "which eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, nor hath it entered into the heart of man.".
For God hath revealed it to us by the Spirit. For the Spirit searcheth all things, even the deep things of God.".
Of ineffable and unutterable blessings, which eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, nor have entered into the heart of men; into which angels desire to look, and see what good things God hath prepared for the saints and the children who love Him."
