But God’s righteousness cried out, “If you will come to me righteous, I will deal with you justly. If you walk treacherously, I will do so also, says the Lord of hosts.” He is suggesting that he will punish the treacherous ways of hardened sinners. The righteousness that is his by nature is indicated by the iota of the name Jesus. His goodness to those who believe out of obedience is immoveable and unwavering. “Since I called and you did not obey,” the Lord says, “you have disregarded my advice and have not heeded my reprimand.” The Lord’s reprimand is very beneficial. The Lord also says, through David, that these people are “an unjust and rebellious generation, a generation that does not set its heart straight and whose spirit does not trust in God. They did not keep God’s covenant and did not want to walk according to his law.” These are the reasons for his frustration and why he will come as a judge to pass judgment on those who do not want to choose to live a good life. On account of this he treats them quite severely in the hope of thwarting their march toward death. At any rate, through David he states very clearly his reason for his threat: “They did not believe in his wondrous deeds. When he killed them, they sought him and returned and came straight to God. They remembered that God was their helper and the most high God their redeemer.” In this way, he knew that they repented because of fear after they scorned his love for humankind. As a rule, people who have little regard for what is good behave kindly and remember to love humankind out of fear of justice.
