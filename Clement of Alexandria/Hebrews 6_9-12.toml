“We,” according to the good apostle, “wait for the hope of righteousness, for in Christ neither circumcision nor uncircumcision is of any avail, but faith working through love.” “We desire each one of you to show the same earnestness in realizing the full assurance of hope,” and so on to, “having become a high priest forever, after the order of Melchizedek.” Wisdom, full of every virtue, uses similar words to Paul’s: “Anyone who listens to me will live safely, trusting in hope.” The establishment of hope and hope itself are spoken of interchangeably. That is why he has done admirably to add the word trusting to “will live safely.” He is showing that the sort of person who has hold of the hope he hoped for is at peace. This is why he adds, “And he will be tranquil, without fear, free from all evil.” The apostle speaks openly in the first letter to the Corinthians when he says expressly, “Be imitators of me, as I am of Christ,” to bring this about. If you imitate me and I imitate Christ, then you are imitating Christ as he is representing God. So he establishes a target for faith in “the likeness to God so far as possible in justice and holiness combined with practical wisdom,” and the goal in the actualization of the promise on the basis of faith.
