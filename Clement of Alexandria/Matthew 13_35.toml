At times our Savior spoke the Word to the apostles by means of mysterious sayings. For prophecy says of him: “He will open his mouth in parables, and will declare things kept secret from the foundation of the world.” … The efficacy of the Word itself, being strong and powerful, gradually draws into itself secretly and invisibly everyone who receives it.
