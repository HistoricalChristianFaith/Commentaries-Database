For "if thou shalt love the Lord try God "and then "thy neighbour "let its first manifestation be towards God in thanksgiving and psalmody, and the second toward our neighbour in decorous fellowship. For says the apostle, "Let the Word of the Lord dwell in you richly.".
For the psalm is a melodious and sober blessing. The apostle calls the psalm "a spiritual song."
