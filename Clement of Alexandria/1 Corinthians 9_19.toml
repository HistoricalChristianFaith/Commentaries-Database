"For though I be free from all men, I have made myself servant to all "it is said, "that I might gain all. And every one that striveth for mastery is temperate in all things.".
For instance, Paul circumcised Timothy because of the Jews who believed, in order that those who had received their training from the law might not revolt from the faith through his breaking such points of the law as were understood more cam ally, knowing right well that circumcision does not justify; for he professed that "all things were for all "by conformity, preserving those of the dogmas that were essential, "that he might gain all.".
And Daniel, under the king of the Persians, wore "the chain".
But that he might not, by dragging all at once away from the law to the circumcision of the heart through faith those of the Hebrews who were reluctant listeners, compel them to break away from the synagogue, he, "accommodating himself to the Jews, became a Jew that he might gain all."
