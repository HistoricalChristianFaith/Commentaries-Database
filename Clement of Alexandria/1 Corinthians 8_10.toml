There are two sorts of food, one ministering to salvation, and the other which is fitting to those who perish.… We ought not to misuse the gifts of the Father, then, acting the part of spendthrifts like the rich son in the Gospel. Let us, rather, make use of them with detachment, keeping them under control. Surely we have been commanded to be the master and lord, not the slave, of food.
