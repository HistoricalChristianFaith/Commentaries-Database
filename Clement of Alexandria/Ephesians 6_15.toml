For He says, "Bring hither the fatted calf, kill it, and let us eat and be merry; for this my son" — a name of nearest relationship, and significative of what is given to the faithful — "was dead and lost,"— an expression of extremest alienation; for what is more alien to the living than the lost and dead? For neither can be possessed any more. But having from the nearest relationship fallen to extremest alienation, again by repentance he returned to near relationship. For it is said, "Put on him the best robe," which was his the moment he obtained baptism. I mean the glory of baptism, the remission of sins, and the communication of the other blessings, which he obtained immediately he had touched the font.
