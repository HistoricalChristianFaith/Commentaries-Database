How great is the power of God! His bare volition was the creation of the universe. For God alone made it, because he alone is truly God. By the bare exercise of volition he creates; his mere willing was followed by the springing into being of what he willed. Consequently the choir of philosophers are in error, who indeed most nobly confess that humanity was made for the contemplation of the heavens but who worship the objects that appear in the heavens and are apprehended by sight.… Let none of you worship the sun, but set your desires on the Maker of the sun; nor deify the universe, but seek after the Creator of the universe.
