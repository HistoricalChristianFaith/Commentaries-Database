In my view, the sketch of a soul which yearns to preserve the blessed tradition without losing a single drop runs something like this: “When a man loves wisdom, his father’s heart will be warmed.” Wells which are constantly baled out provide a clearer water; wells which no one draws from turn to rottenness. Use keeps iron brighter; disuse produces rust in it. In general, exercise produces fitness in souls and bodies.
