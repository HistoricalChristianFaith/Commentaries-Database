"Why call ye me Lord, Lord "He says, "and do not the things which I say? ".
Wherefore also he added: "But with all of them He was not well pleased. "Who is this? He who said, "Why do you call Me Lord, and do not the will of My Father? ".
For these point out the heretics, who indeed go upon the name of the Father and the Son, but are incapable of triturating and grinding down the clear declaration of the oracles, and who, besides, perform the works of righteousness coarsely and not with precision, if they perform them at all.

And "Why call ye Me Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say? "
