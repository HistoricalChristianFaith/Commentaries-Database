Christ the educator of humanity, our divine Logos, with every effort and with every gift of wisdom, has offered to save his children, warning them, reproaching, punishing, accusing, threatening, curing, making promises and granting grace. “With various bridles he keeps within bounds” the excessive outbursts of humanity. In short, the Lord conducts himself with us as we conduct ourselves with our children. “Do you have children? Discipline them,” Wisdom exhorts, “and make them obedient from their youth. Do you have daughters? Be concerned for their chastity, and do not show yourself too indulgent with them.” Yet, our children, male and female, are what we love the most above anything else.
