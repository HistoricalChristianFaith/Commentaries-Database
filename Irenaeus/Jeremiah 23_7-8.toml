The church is the seed of Abraham. Jeremiah says, “Behold, the days are coming, declares the Lord, when they shall no longer say, ‘The Lord lives, who led the children of Israel from the north country and from every region where they had been driven.’ He will restore them to their own land which he gave to their ancestors,” so that we may know that he who “raises up from the stones children to Abraham” in the New Testament is he who will gather, according to the Old Testament, those who will be saved from all the nations.
