Existing before all, and going before all.
For when the Lord said to them, "Your father Abraham rejoiced to see My day; and he saw it, and was glad "they answered Him, "Thou art not yet fifty years old, and hast Thou seen Abraham? ".
And teaching this very thing, He said to the Jews: "Your father Abraham rejoiced that he should see my day; and he saw it, and was glad".
Since, therefore, Abraham was a prophet and saw in the Spirit the day of the Lord's coming, and the dispensation of His suffering, through whom both he himself and all who, following the example of his faith, trust in God, should be saved, he rejoiced exceedingly. The Lord, therefore, was not unknown to Abraham, whose day he desired to see;

Christ himself … together with the Father is the God of the living who spoke to Moses and who was also manifested to the patriarchs. In teaching this very thing he said to the Jews, “Your father Abraham rejoiced that he would see my day; he saw it and was glad.” What did he intend when he said this? “Abraham believed God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness.” In the first place, [Abraham believed] that he was the maker of heaven and earth, the only God. Second, he believed that God would make his seed as the stars of heaven. This is what is meant by Paul, [when he says], “as lights in the world.” Righteously, therefore, having left his earthly family, he followed the Word of God walking as a pilgrim with the Word so that he might [afterwards] make his home with the Word.

Abraham was a prophet and saw in the Spirit the day of the Lord’s coming and the dispensation of his suffering through whom both he himself and all who trust in God would be saved, following the example of his faith. Since he saw this, he rejoiced exceedingly. The Lord, therefore, was not unknown to Abraham whose day he desired to see. The Lord’s Father also was not unknown. For Abraham had learned from the Word of the Lord and believed him. Therefore it was accounted to him by the Lord for righteousness.

Abraham also, knowing the Father through the Word who made heaven and earth, confessed that he was God. Having learned by an announcement [made to him] that the Son of God would be a man among men—by whose advent his seed should be as the stars of heaven—he desired to see that day so that he might himself also embrace Christ. Seeing it through the spirit of prophecy, he rejoiced.
