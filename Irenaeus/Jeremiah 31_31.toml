All things therefore are of one and the same substance, that is, from one and the same God, just as the Lord says to the disciples, “Therefore every scribe who is instructed concerning the kingdom of heaven is like a householder who brings forth out of his treasure things new and old.” He did not teach that the one who brought forth the old was one while the person who brought forth the new was another. Rather, he taught that they were one and the same. For the Lord is the good man of the house who rules the entire house of his Father and who delivers a law suited both for slaves and those who are as yet undisciplined. He provides fitting precepts to those who are free and have been justified by faith, as well as throwing his own inheritance open to those who are sons and daughters. And he called his disciples “scribes” and “teachers of the kingdom of heaven” of whom also he elsewhere says to the Jews, “Behold, I send to you wise men, and scribes and teachers; and some of them you shall kill and persecute from city to city.” Now, without contradiction, he means by those things that are brought forth from the treasure new and old—the two covenants. The old concerns that giving of the law that took place formerly. He points out the new as being that manner of life required by the gospel, of which David says, “Sing to the Lord a new song.” … And Jeremiah says, “Behold, I will make a new covenant, not as I made with your ancestors” in Mount Horeb. But one and the same householder produced both covenants, the Word of God, our Lord Jesus Christ, who spoke with Abraham and Moses, and who has again restored us to liberty and has multiplied that grace that is from himself.
