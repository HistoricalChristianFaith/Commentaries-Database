He also styles Him Son, and Aletheia, and Zoe, and the "Word made flesh, whose glory "he says, "we beheld; and His glory was as that of the Only-begotten (given to Him by the Father), full of grace and truth.".
But salvation, as being flesh: for "the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us.".
For they say that he, the Lord and Creator of the plan of creation, by whom they hold that this world was made, was produced from the Mother; while the Gospel affirms plainly, that by the Word, which was in the beginning with God, all things were made, which Word, he says, "was made flesh, and dwelt among us.".
Therefore the Lord's disciple, pointing them all out as false witnesses, says, "And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us.".
For to him all things are consistent: he has a full faith in one God Almighty, of whom are all things; and in the Son of God, Jesus Christ our Lord, by whom are all things, and in the dispensations connected with Him, by means of which the Son of God became man; and a firm belief in the Spirit of God, who furnishes us with a knowledge of the truth, and has set forth the dispensations of the Father and the Son, in virtue of which He dwells with every generation of men.
And again, showing the dispensation with regard to His human nature, John said: "And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us."
