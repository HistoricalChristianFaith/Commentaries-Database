God would make a new covenant with people, not such as that which he made with the ancestors at Mount Horeb, and would give to people a new heart and a new spirit. And again [it is written], “And do not remember the things of old: behold I make new things.” [This] plainly announced that liberty that distinguishes the new covenant and the new wine that is put into new bottles, [that is], the faith that is in Christ, by which he has proclaimed the way of righteousness sprung up in the desert and the streams of the Holy Spirit in a dry land, to give water to the elect people of God, whom he has acquired. [This is done] that they might show forth his praise but not that they might blaspheme him who made these things, that is, God.
