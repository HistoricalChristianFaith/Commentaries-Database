He does not call mammon Lord when He says, "Ye cannot serve two masters; "but He teaches His disciples who serve God, not to be subject to mammon, nor to be ruled by it. For He says, "He that committeth sin is the slave of sin."

Inasmuch, then, as he terms those “the slaves of sin” who serve sin but does not certainly call sin itself God, in this way also he terms those who serve mammon as “the slaves of mammon,” not calling mammon God. For mammon is, according to the Jewish language, which the Samaritans also use, a covetous person, and one who wishes to have more than he ought to have.… We cannot serve God and mammon.
