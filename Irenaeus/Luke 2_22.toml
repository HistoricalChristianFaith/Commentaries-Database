And still further does Luke say in reference to the Lord: "When the days of purification were accomplished, they brought Him up to Jerusalem, to present Him before the Lord, as it is written in the law of the Lord, That every male opening the womb shall be called holy to the Lord; and that they should offer a sacrifice, as it is said in the law of the Lord, a pair of turtle-doves, or two young pigeons:" [Luke 2:22] in his own person most clearly calling Him Lord, who appointed the legal dispensation. But "Simeon," he also says, "blessed God, and said, Lord, now let Your servant depart in peace; for my eyes have seen Your salvation, which You have prepared before the face of all people; a light for the revelation of the Gentiles, and the glory of Your people Israel." [Luke 2:29, etc.] And "Anna" [Luke 2:38] also, "the prophetess," he says, in like manner glorified God when she saw Christ, "and spoke of Him to all them who were looking for the redemption of Jerusalem." Now by all these one God is shown forth, revealing to men the new dispensation of liberty, the covenant, through the new advent of His Son.
