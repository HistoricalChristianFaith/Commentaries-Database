And thus do the words of the prophet agree, as it is written, “After this I will return, and will build again the tabernacle of David, which is fallen down; and I will build its ruins and set it up. The remnant may seek after the Lord, and all the Gentiles among whom my name has been invoked, says the Lord, doing these things.” His works are known from eternity by God. Therefore I for my part give this judgment, that we do not trouble those who from among the Gentiles are turned to God.
