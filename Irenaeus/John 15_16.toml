As much as God lacks nothing, so much do we stand in need of fellowship with God. For this is the glory of humanity: to continue and remain permanently in God’s service. This is also why the Lord said to his disciples, “You did not choose me, but I chose you,” indicating that they did not glorify him when they followed him but that, in following the Son of God, they were glorified by him.
