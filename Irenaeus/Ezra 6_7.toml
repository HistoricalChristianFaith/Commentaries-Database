When, in the captivity of the people by Nebuchadnezzar, the Scriptures were corrupted, and after seventy years the Jews went up to their country, then in the times of Artaxerxes, king of the Persians, he inspired Ezra the priest, of the tribe of Levi, to set in order the words of all the former prophets, and to restore to the people the legislation by Moses. [Adversus Haereses, 3. 24. 1]
