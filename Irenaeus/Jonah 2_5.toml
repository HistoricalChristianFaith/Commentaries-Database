Therefore, the hand of God was present with Jonah, working out a marvelous thing, a thing impossible by mans nature, nor the weakness of flesh can prevail against the will of God. For God is not subject to created things, but created things are subject to God; and things yield obedience to His will. Wherefore also the Lord declares, â€œThe things which are impossible with men, are possible with God (Luke 18:27). (Against Heresies Bk. 5.2;2)
