Now, that this God is the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, Paul the apostle also has declared, .
In accordance with this, too, does the apostle say, "There is one God, the Father, who is above all, and in us all.".
which the Lord grants to those who rightly believe in Him, and love Him, and who know that "there is one Father, who is above all, and through all, and in us all."
