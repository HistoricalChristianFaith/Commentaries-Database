The Scripture declares the truth, which says, “First of all believe that there is one God, who has established all things and completed them, and having caused that from what had no being, all things should come into existence”: he who contains all things, and is himself contained by no one. Rightly also Malachi said among the prophets: “Is it not one God who has established us?” In accordance with this too does the apostle say, “There is one God, the Father who is above all, and in us all.” Likewise does the Lord also say, “All things are delivered to me by my Father,” manifestly by him who made all things; for he did not deliver to him the things of another but his own.
