That this Luke was inseparable from Paul and his fellow laborer in the gospel, he himself clearly evinces, not as a matter of boasting but as bound to do so by the truth itself. For he says that when Barnabas, and John who was called Mark, had parted company from Paul and sailed to Cyprus, “we came to Troas”; and when Paul had beheld in a dream a man of Macedonia, saying, “Come into Macedonia, Paul, and help us,” “immediately,” he says, “we endeavored to go into Macedonia, understanding that the Lord had called us to preach the gospel to them. Therefore, sailing from Troas, we directed our ship’s course towards Samothracia.” And then he carefully indicates all the rest of their journey as far as Philippi, and how they delivered their first address, “for, sitting down,” he says, “we spoke to the women who had assembled,” and certain ones believed, even a great many. Again [Luke] says, “But we sailed from Philippi after the days of unleavened bread and came to Troas, where we stayed for seven days.” And all the remaining details of his course with Paul he recounts, indicating with all diligence both places and cities and number of days, until they went up to Jerusalem; and what happened to Paul there, how he was sent to Rome in bonds; the name of the centurion who took him in charge; and the signs of the ships, and how they made shipwreck; and the island on which they escaped, and how they received kindness there, Paul healing the chief man of that island; and how they sailed from there to Puteoli, and from there arrived at Rome; and for what period they sojourned at Rome. As Luke was present at all these occurrences, he carefully noted them down in writing, so that he cannot be convicted of falsehood or boastfulness, because all these particulars proved both that he was senior to all those who now teach otherwise and that he was not ignorant of the truth.
