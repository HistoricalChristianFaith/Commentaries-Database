For who else is there who can reign uninterruptedly over the house of Jacob for ever, except Jesus Christ our Lord, the Son of the Most High God, who promised by the law and the prophets that He would make His salvation visible to all flesh; so that He would become the Son of man for this purpose, that man also might become the son of God? And Mary, exulting because of this, cried out, prophesying on behalf of the Church, "My soul does magnify the Lord, and my spirit has rejoiced in God my Saviour. For He has taken up His child Israel, in remembrance of His mercy, as He spoke to our fathers, Abraham, and his seed forever." [Luke 1:46-47] By these and such like [passages] the Gospel points out that it was God who spoke to the fathers; that it was He who, by Moses, instituted the legal dispensation, by which giving of the law we know that He spoke to the fathers.

Therefore Abraham also, knowing the Father through the Word, who made heaven and earth, confessed Him to be God; and having learned, by an announcement [made to him], that the Son of God would be a man among men, by whose advent his seed should be as the stars of heaven, he desired to see that day, so that he might himself also embrace Christ; and, seeing it through the spirit of prophecy, he rejoiced. [Genesis 17:17] Wherefore Simeon also, one of his descendants, carried fully out the rejoicing of the patriarch, and said: "Lord, now let Your servant depart in peace. For my eyes have seen Your salvation, which You have prepared before the face of all people: a light for the revelation of the Gentiles, and the glory of the people Israel." [Luke 2:29, etc.] And the angels, in like manner, announced tidings of great joy to the shepherds who were keeping watch by night. [Luke 2:8] Moreover, Mary said, "My soul does magnify the Lord, and my spirit has rejoiced in God my salvation;" [Luke 1:46] — the rejoicing of Abraham descending upon those who sprang from him — those, namely, who were watching, and who beheld Christ, and believed in Him; while, on the other hand, there was a reciprocal rejoicing which passed backwards from the children to Abraham, who did also desire to see the day of Christ's coming. Rightly, then, did our Lord bear witness to him, saying, "Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day; and he saw it, and was glad."
