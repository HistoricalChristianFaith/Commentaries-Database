For who else is there who can reign uninterruptedly over the house of Jacob for ever, except Jesus Christ our Lord, the Son of the Most High God, who promised by the law and the prophets that He would make His salvation visible to all flesh; so that He would become the Son of man for this purpose, that man also might become the son of God? And Mary, exulting because of this, cried out, prophesying on behalf of the Church, "My soul does magnify the Lord, and my spirit has rejoiced in God my Saviour. For He has taken up His child Israel, in remembrance of His mercy, as He spoke to our fathers, Abraham, and his seed forever." [Luke 1:46-47] By these and such like [passages] the Gospel points out that it was God who spoke to the fathers; that it was He who, by Moses, instituted the legal dispensation, by which giving of the law we know that He spoke to the fathers.
