God came in a visible manner, and was made flesh and hung on the tree, that he might sum up all things in himself.… He is the Word of God, and very man, communicating with invisible beings after the manner of the intellect and appointing a law observable to the outward senses, that all things should continue each in its own order; and he reigns manifestly over things visible and pertaining to people; and he brings in just judgment and worth on all; as David also, clearly pointing to this, says, “Our God shall openly come and will not keep silence.” Then he shows also the judgment that is brought in by him, saying, “A fire shall burn in his sight, and a strong tempest shall rage round about him. He shall call on the heaven from above, and the earth, to judge his people.”
