Five men are said to have been with the Lord when He obtained testimony from the Father,-namely, Peter, and James, and John, and Moses, and Elias. The Lord also, as the fifth person, entered into the apartment of the dead maiden, and raised her up again; for, says the Scripture, "He suffered no man to go in, save Peter and James, and the father and mother of the maiden."
