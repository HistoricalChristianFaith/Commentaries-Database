As he finishes his Gospel, Mark concludes: “So then the Lord Jesus, after he had spoken to them, was taken up into heaven, and sat down at the right hand of God.” The ascension confirms what had been spoken by the prophet: “The Lord said to my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, until I make thy foes thy footstool.” Thus God who was announced by the prophets is truly one and the same as God who is celebrated in the true gospel, whom we Christians worship and love with the whole heart as the maker of heaven and earth, and of all things within it.
