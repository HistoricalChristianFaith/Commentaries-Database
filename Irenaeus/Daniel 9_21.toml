This passage reveals to us … that there is one and the same God the Father, who was declared by the prophets but made manifest by Christ. The Lord confirmed those things Daniel prophesied about the end, when our Lord said, “When you see the abomination of desolation that was told by Daniel the prophet.” The angel Gabriel explained the visions to Daniel. This Gabriel is both the archangel of the Creator (Demiurge) and the one who proclaimed to Mary the coming and incarnation of Christ. Thus, most clearly, it must be one and the same God who sent the prophets and who sent forth his Son and called us to recognize him.
