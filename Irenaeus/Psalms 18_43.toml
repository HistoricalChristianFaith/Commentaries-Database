We are not all the children of God: those only are so who believe in him and do his will. And those who do not believe and do not obey his will are sons and angels of the devil, because they do the works of the devil. And that such is the case he has declared in Isaiah: “I have begotten and brought up children, but they have rebelled against me.” And again, he says that these children are aliens: “Strange children have lied unto me.” According to nature, then, they are [his] children, because they have been so created; but with regard to their works, they are not his children.
