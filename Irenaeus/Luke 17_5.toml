Now if any man set Luke aside, as one who did not know the truth, he will, by so acting, manifestly reject that Gospel of which he claims to be a disciple. For through him we have become acquainted with very many and important parts of the Gospel; for instance, the generation of John, the history of Zacharias, the coming of the angel to Mary, the exclamation of Elisabeth, the descent of the angels to the shepherds, the words spoken by them, the testimony of Anna and of Simeon with regard to Christ, and that twelve years of age He was left behind at Jerusalem; also the baptism of John, the number of the Lord's years when He was baptized. And in His office of teacher this is what He has said to the rich: "Woe unto you that are rich, for ye have received your consolation." There are also many other particulars to be found mentioned by Luke alone: the answer which He gave to His disciples when they said, "Increase our faith;" also His conversation with Zaccheus the publican.
