Admirable sophists, and explorers of the sublimities of the unknown Father, and rehearsers of those super-celestial mysteries "which the angels desire to look into!".
For He has brought Himself, and has bestowed on men those good things which were announced beforehand, which things the angels desired to look into.
For there is the one Son, who accomplished His Father's will; and one human race also in which the mysteries of God are wrought, "which the angels desire to look into; "
