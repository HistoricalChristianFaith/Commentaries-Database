The prophets, receiving the prophetic gift from the same Word, announced his advent according to the flesh, by which the blending and communion of God and man took place, according to the good pleasure of the Father, the Word of God foretelling from the beginning that God should be seen by human beings and interacting with them on the earth; that he would confer with them and be present with his own creation, saving it and becoming capable of being perceived by it, and freeing us from the hands of all who hate us, that is, from every spirit of wickedness; and causing us to serve him in holiness and righteousness all of our days, in order that humanity, having embraced the Spirit of God, might pass into the glory of the Father.…Inasmuch, then, as the Spirit of God pointed out by the prophet what would happen in the future, forming and adapting us beforehand for the purpose of our being made subject to God—but it was a future thing that humanity, through the good pleasure of the Holy Spirit should see God—it was necessarily the case those who were used as instruments for announcing the future events should themselves see God, whom they intimated was to be seen by human beings. This was so that God and the Son of God, and the Son and the Father, should not only be prophetically announced but also that he should also be seen by all of his members who are sanctified and instructed in the things of God.
