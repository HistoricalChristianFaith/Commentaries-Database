When he came to his passion, he wanted to declare to Abraham and those with him the good news of the opening of the inheritance. After he gave thanks while holding the cup and then drank from it â€¦ he promised that he would again drink of the produce of the vine with his disciples. Christ thus showed the inheritance of the earth, in which the new produce of the vine is drunk, and the physical resurrection of his disciples. The new flesh that rises again is the same that received the new cup. He cannot be understood as drinking the produce of the vine when established on high with his own, somewhere above the heavens. Those who drink it are not only spirits, because it belongs to flesh and not to spirit to receive the drink of the vine.
