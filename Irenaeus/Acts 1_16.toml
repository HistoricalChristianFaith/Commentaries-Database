The Apostle Peter, therefore, after the resurrection of the Lord, and His assumption into the heavens, being desirous of filling up the number of the twelve apostles, and in electing into the place of Judas any substitute who should be chosen by God, thus addressed those who were present: "Men [and] brethren, this Scripture must needs have been fulfilled, which the Holy Ghost, by the mouth of David, spoke before concerning Judas, which was made guide to them that took Jesus. For he was numbered with us: [Acts 1:16, etc.] ... Let his habitation be desolate, and let no man dwell therein; and, His bishoprick let another take;" â€” thus leading to the completion of the apostles, according to the words spoken by David.
