These words [Stephen] said, and he was stoned. In this way he fulfilled the perfect doctrine, copying in every respect the Leader of martyrdom and praying for those who were slaying him, in these words, “Lord, lay not this sin to their charge.” Thus were they perfected who knew one and the same God, who from beginning to end was present with humankind in the various dispensations, as the prophet Hosea declares: “I have filled up visions and used similitudes by the hands of the prophets.”
