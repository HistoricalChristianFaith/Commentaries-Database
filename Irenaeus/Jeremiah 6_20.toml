Since God is merciful, he did not cut them off from good counsel. After he had said by Jeremiah, “Why do you bring me incense from Sheba and cinnamon from a far country? Your whole burnt offerings and sacrifices are not acceptable to me.” He proceeds: “Hear the word of the Lord, all Judah. These things says the Lord, the God of Israel, Make straight your ways and your doings, and I will establish you in this place. Put not your trust in lying words, for they will not at all profit you, saying, The temple of the Lord, The temple of the Lord, it is here.”
