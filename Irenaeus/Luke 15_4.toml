Moreover, that Achamoth wandered beyond the Pleroma, and received form from Christ, and was sought after by the Saviour, they declare that He indicated when He said, that He had come after that sheep which was gone astray.
Blending in one the production of their own Aeons, and the straying and recovery of the sheep .
