For he who holds, without pride and boasting, the true glory regarding created things and the Creator, who is the Almighty God of all, and who has granted existence to all; such an one, continuing in His love and subjection, and giving of thanks, shall also receive from Him the greater glory of promotion, looking forward to the time when he shall become like Him who died for him, for He, too, "was made in the likeness of sinful flesh," to condemn sin, and to cast it, as now a condemned thing, away beyond the flesh, but that He might call man forth into His own likeness, assigning him as His own imitator to God, and imposing on him His Father's law, in order that he may see God, and granting him power to receive the Father.
