They [heretics - disciples of Valentinus] moreover affirm that the Saviour is shown to be derived from all the Æons, and to be in Himself everything by the following passage: "Every male that opens the womb." [Exodus 13:2; Luke 2:23] For He, being everything, opened the womb of the enthymesis of the suffering Æon, when it had been expelled from the Pleroma.
