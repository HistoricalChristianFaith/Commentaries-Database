For where the church is, there is the Spirit of God. Where the Spirit of God is, there is the church and every kind of grace. The Spirit is truth. Those, therefore, who do not partake of him are neither nourished into life from the mother’s breasts, nor do they enjoy that most clear fountain that issues from the body of Christ. Instead, they dig for themselves broken cisterns out of earthly trenches and drink putrid water out of the mire, fleeing from the faith of the church lest they be convicted. They reject the Spirit with the result that they are not instructed.
