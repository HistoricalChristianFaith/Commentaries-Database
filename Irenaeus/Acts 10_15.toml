At that time Peter saw a vision in which a heavenly voice answered him, “What God has cleansed, you must not call common.” For the God who had distinguished through the law the pure food from the impure, that same God had cleansed the nations through the blood of his Son, and that is the God whom Cornelius worshiped.
