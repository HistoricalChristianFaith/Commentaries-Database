To God that human nature (hominem) which had departed from God; and therefore men were taught to worship God after a new fashion, but not another god, because in truth there is but "one God, who justifieth the circumcision by faith, and the uncircumcision through faith.".
For it is truly "one God who "directed the patriarchs towards His dispensations, and "has justified the circumcision by faith, and the uncircumcision through faith.".
Since this is the case, we must not seek for another Father besides Him, or above Him, since there is one God who justifies the circumcision by faith, and the uncircumcision through faith.

We were prefigured in the Jews, and they are represented in us, that is, in the church, and they receive the reward for what they achieved.
