The scribes and Pharisees, who from the times of the law had begun to despise God, did not receive his Word, that is, they did not believe in Christ. Of these Isaiah says, “You princes are rebellious, companions of thieves, loving gifts, following after rewards, not judging the fatherless and negligent of the cause of the widows.” He speaks in Jeremiah in the same way. “They,” he says, “who rule my people did not know me. They are senseless and imprudent children. They are wise to do evil, but to do well they have no knowledge.”
