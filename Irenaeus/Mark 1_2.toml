How plainly does the beginning of the gospel focus upon the expectations of the holy prophets. At once it points out that the One whom they confessed as God and Lord, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who had also made promise to him, would send his messenger before his face. This was John, crying in the wilderness, in “the spirit and power of Elijah,” ”Prepare the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.” For the prophets did not announce first one God and then another, but one and the same God under complementary aspects, and with many various names. .
