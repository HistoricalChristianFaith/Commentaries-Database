For "no man "he says, "hath seen God at any time "unless "the only-begotten Son of God, which is in the bosom of the Father, He hath declared .
He who worketh all things in all is God, .
If, then, neither Moses, nor Elias, nor Ezekiel, who had all many celestial visions, did see God; but if what they did see were similitudes of the splendour of the Lord, And prophecies of things to come; it is manifest that the Father is indeed invisible, of whom also the Lord said, "No man hath seen God at any time."

Clearly the Father is indeed invisible, of whom also the Lord said, “No one has seen God at any time.” But his Word, as he himself willed it and for the benefit of those who beheld it, did show the Father’s brightness and explained his purposes—as also the Lord said, “The only begotten God, which is in the bosom of the Father, he has declared [him].” And, he himself also interprets the Word of the Father as being rich and great. He appeared not only in one figure or in one character to those who saw him, but according to whatever purpose or effect he was aiming for in his plan of salvation.
