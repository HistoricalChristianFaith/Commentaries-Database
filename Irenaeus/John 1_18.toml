For "no man "he says, "hath seen God at any time "unless "the only-begotten Son of God, which is in the bosom of the Father, He hath declared .
He who worketh all things in all is God, .
If, then, neither Moses, nor Elias, nor Ezekiel, who had all many celestial visions, did see God; but if what they did see were similitudes of the splendour of the Lord, And prophecies of things to come; it is manifest that the Father is indeed invisible, of whom also the Lord said, "No man hath seen God at any time."
