Through these words he shows that he would have never gone to them if he had not been ordered to do so. Likewise, he would have never baptized them so unscrupulously if he had not heard them prophesy when the Holy Spirit rested on them. And that is why he said, “Can anyone forbid water that these, who have received the Holy Spirit as well as we, should not be baptized?” He wanted to show and teach those who were with him that if the Holy Spirit had not come to rest upon them, there would have been someone who would have kept them from baptism.
