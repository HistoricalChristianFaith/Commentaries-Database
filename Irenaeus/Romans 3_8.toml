These men, even as the Gentiles, have been sent forth by Satan to bring dishonour upon the Church, so that, in one way or another, men hearing the things which they speak, and imagining that we all are such as they, may turn away their ears from the preaching of the truth. But they lead a licentious life, and, to conceal their impious doctrines, they abuse the name of Christ, as a means of hiding their wickedness; so that "their condemnation is just," when they receive from God a recompense suited to their works.
