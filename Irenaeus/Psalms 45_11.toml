You do not make God, but God makes you. If, then, you are God’s workmanship, await the hand of your Maker that creates everything in due time; in due time as far as you are concerned, whose creation is being carried out. Offer to him your heart in a soft and tractable state, and preserve the form in which the Creator has fashioned you, having moisture in yourself, lest, by becoming hardened, you lose the impressions of his fingers. But by preserving the framework you shall ascend to that which is perfect, for the moist clay that is in you is hidden [there] by the workmanship of God. His hand fashioned your substance; he will cover you over [too] within and without with pure gold and silver, and he will adorn you to such a degree that even “the king himself shall have pleasure in beauty.” … For creation is an attribute of the goodness of God; but to be created is that of human nature. If, then, you shall deliver up to him what is yours, that is, faith toward him and subjection, you shall receive his handiwork and shall be a perfect work of God.
