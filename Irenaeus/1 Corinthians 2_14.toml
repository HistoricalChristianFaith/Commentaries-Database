True knowledge, then, consists in the understanding of Christ, which Paul terms the wisdom of God hidden in a mystery, which "the natural man receives not," [1 Corinthians 2:14] the doctrine of the cross; of which if any man "taste," [1 Peter 2:3] he will not accede to the disputations and quibbles of proud and puffed-up men, [1 Timothy 6:4-5] who go into matters of which they have no perception. [Colossians 2:18] For the truth is unsophisticated (ἀσχημάτιστος); and "the word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart," [Romans 10:8; Deuteronomy 30:14] as the same apostle declares, being easy of comprehension to those who are obedient.

Justly, therefore, did the apostle call all such "carnal "and "animal"
