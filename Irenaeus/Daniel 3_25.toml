It is manifest [in Scripture] that the Father is indeed invisible, of whom also the Lord said, “No one has seen God at any time.” But his Word, as he willed it and for the benefit of those who saw, did show the Father’s brightness and explained his will.… He appeared to those who saw him not in one figure or in one character but according to the reasons and purposes that he wanted to achieve, as we see written in Daniel. He was seen with those who were around Ananias, Azarias and Misael as present with them in the furnace of fire, in the burning, and preserving them from [the effects of] fire: “And the appearance of the fourth,” it is said, “was like the Son of God.” At another time [he is represented as] “a stone cut out of the mountain without hands” and as destroying all temporal kingdoms … and as himself filling all the earth. Then too he is the same being beheld as the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven and drawing near to the Ancient of Days.
