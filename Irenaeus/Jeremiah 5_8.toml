The prophets compare them to irrational animals, because of the irrationality of their conduct: “They have become like horses lusting for females. Each one of them neighs for his neighbor’s wife.” And again, “Man, when he is honored, was made to be like cattle.” This means that, for his own fault, he is compared with cattle, rivaling their irrational life. And we also, as the custom is, do designate people like this as cattle and irrational beasts.
