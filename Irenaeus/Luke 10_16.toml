For the Lord of all gave to His apostles the power of the Gospel, through whom also we have known the truth, that is, the doctrine of the Son of God; to whom also did the Lord declare: "He that heareth you, heareth Me; and he that despiseth you, despiseth Me, and Him that sent Me."

The Lord of all gave the power of the gospel to his apostles. By them, we also have learned the truth, that is, the teaching of the Son of God. The Lord said to them, “He who hears you hears me, and he who despises you despises me, and him who sent me.”
