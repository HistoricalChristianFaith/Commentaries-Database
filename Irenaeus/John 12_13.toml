The Lord granted, by means of his advent, a greater gift of grace to those of a later period than what he had granted to those under the Old Testament dispensation. For they indeed used to hear, from his servants, about the King who would come, and they rejoiced to a certain extent, inasmuch as they hoped for his coming. But those who have actually been in his presence and have been freed and made partakers of his gifts—they possess a greater amount of grace and a higher degree of exultation in their rejoicing because the King has arrived. This is also what David says, “My soul shall rejoice in the Lord; it shall be glad in his salvation.” And for this reason, on his entrance into Jerusalem, all those who were in the way recognized David their king in the sorrow of his soul, and spread their garments for him and ornamented the way with green boughs, crying out with great joy and gladness, “Hosanna to the Son of David; blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord: hosanna in the highest.” … What had been declared by David concerning the Son of God was accomplished in his own person.… It was he himself who was announced by the prophets as Christ, whose name is praised in all the earth.
