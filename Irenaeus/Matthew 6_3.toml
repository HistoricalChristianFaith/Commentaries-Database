And therefore has the Lord said: "Judge not, that you be not judged: for with what judgment you shall judge, you shall be judged." [Matthew 7:1-2] [The meaning is] not certainly that we should not find fault with sinners, nor that we should consent to those who act wickedly; but that we should not pronounce an unfair judgment on the dispensations of God, inasmuch as He has Himself made provision that all things shall turn out for good, in a way consistent with justice. For, because He knew that we would make a good use of our substance which we should possess by receiving it from another, He says, "He that has two coats, let him impart to him that has none; and he that has meat, let him do likewise." [Luke 3:11] And, "For I was an hungered, and you gave Me meat; I was thirsty, and you gave Me drink; I was naked and you clothed Me." [Matthew 25:35-36] And, "When you do your alms, let not your left hand know what your right hand does." [Matthew 6:3] And we are proved to be righteous by whatsoever else we do well, redeeming, as it were, our property from strange hands.
