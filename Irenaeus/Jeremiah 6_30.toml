Jeremiah says, “I set watchmen over you. Hear the sound of the trumpet. They said, We will not listen. Therefore the Gentiles have heard, and they who feed the flocks in them.” It is therefore one and the same Father who planted the vineyard, who led forth the people, who sent the prophets, who sent his own Son and who gave the vineyard to those other husbandmen that render the fruits in their season.
