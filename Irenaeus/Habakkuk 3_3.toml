And there are also some of them who say, “the Lord has spoken in Zion, and uttered his voice from Jerusalem,” and “in Judah is God known”5—these indicated his advent, which took place in Judea. Those, again, who declare that “God comes from the south, and from a mountain thick with foliage,” announced his advent at Bethlehem, as I have pointed out in the preceding book. From that place, also, he who rules and who feeds the people of his Father, has come. Those, again, who declare that at his coming “the lame man shall leap as a deer, and the tongue of the dumb shall speak plainly, and the eyes of the blind shall be opened, and the ears of the deaf shall hear,” and that “the hands which hang down, and the feeble knees, shall be strengthened,” and that “the dead which are in the grave shall arise,” and that he himself “shall take our weaknesses, and bear our sorrows”9—proclaimed those works of healing which were accomplished by him.
