The deceased daughter of the high priest; the widow's dead son, who was being carried out to burial near the gate of the city; and Lazarus, who had lain four days in the tomb, in what bodies did they rise again? In those same, no doubt, in which they had also died. For if it were not in the very same, then certainly those same individuals who had died did not rise again.
