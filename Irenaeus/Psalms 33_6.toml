The rule of the truth that we hold is this: There is one God almighty, who created all things through his Word; he both prepared and made all things out of nothing.… From this “all” nothing is exempt. Now, it is the Father who made all things through him, whether visible or invisible, whether sensible or intelligible, whether temporal for the sake of some dispensation or eternal. These he did not make through angels or some powers that were separated from his thought. For the God of all things needs nothing. No, he made all things by his Word and Spirit, disposing and governing them and giving all of them existence. This is the one who made the world, which indeed is made up of all things. This is the one who fashioned humankind. This is the God of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob, above whom there is no other God, or a Beginning, or a Power or a Fullness. This is the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.
