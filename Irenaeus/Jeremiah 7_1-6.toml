Wash! Make yourselves clean! Put away evil from your hearts. Learn to do well. Seek judgment, protect the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the widow. Come, let us reason together, says the Lord. And again: “Keep your tongue from evil, and your lips that they speak no guile. Depart from evil, and do good. Seek peace, and pursue it.” In preaching these things, the prophets sought the fruits of righteousness.
