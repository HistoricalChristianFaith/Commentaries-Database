The Word of God is the one who forms us in the womb, as he says to Jeremiah, “Before I formed you in the womb, I knew you. Before you came forth from the belly, I sanctified you and appointed you to be a prophet among the nations.” And Paul, too, says this in the same way, “But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother’s womb, that I might declare him among the nations.”
