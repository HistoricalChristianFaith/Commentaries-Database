No one was able, either in heaven or in earth or under the earth, to open the book of the Father … so that all things … might behold their King and that the Fatherly light might meet with and rest upon the flesh of our Lord and come to us from his radiant flesh. In this way, human beings might attain to immortality, having been invested with the Fatherly light.
