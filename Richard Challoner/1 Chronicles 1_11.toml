This prophecy partly relates to Solomon: but much more to Christ, who is called the son of David in Scripture, and who is the builder of the true temple, which is the Church, his everlasting kingdom, which shall never fail.

With the exception of the Laabim, from whom the Libyans were later given their name (they were at first called Phuthaei), and the Chasloim, who were later called Philistines (in debased form we speak of them as Palestinians), the six other nations are unknown to us, because they were overthrown in the Ethiopian war, and reached the stage where their former names were forgotten. They occupied the land from Gaza to the furthest borders of Egypt. (St. Jerome on Hebrew Names)
