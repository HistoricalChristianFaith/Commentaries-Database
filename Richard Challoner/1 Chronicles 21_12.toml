Three years famine: 2 Samuel 24:13 reads "seven years".  The apparent discrepency lies in the error in the Hebrew manuscripts.  The Greek Septuagint, which is a translation of a much more ancient version, reads "three years famine". (John Litteral) Or it can be explained as that which joined with the three foregoing years of famine mentioned, 2 Samuel 21. and the seventh year of the land's resting, would make up the seven years proposed by the prophet, 2 Samuel 24:13.
