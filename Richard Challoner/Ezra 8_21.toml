I proclaimed there a fast: It is not enough to part from Babylon, that is, figuratively from sin, but we must also do works of penance; and therefore Esdras here proclaimed an extraordinary fast to those that were come from captivity. This shows that fasting was commanded and practised from the earliest times.
