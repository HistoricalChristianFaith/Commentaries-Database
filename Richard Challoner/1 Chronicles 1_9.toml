The sons of Chus were Saba and Aevila, Sabatha, Regma, and Sabathaca: Saba is where the Sabaeans come from, of whom Virgil says: The incense tree belongs to the Sabaeans alone, and, elsewhere, And a hundred altars are warm with Sabaean incense. Aevila refers to the Gaetuli who are in the more distant parts of Africa and stay close to the desert. Sabatha: from this derive the Sabatheni, who are nowadays called the Astabari. But Regma and Sabathaca have little by little lost their old names, and it is not known what names they now have instead of their ancient ones. (St. Jerome on Hebrew Names)
