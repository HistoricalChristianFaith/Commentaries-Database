Up to the present day, Ethiopia is called Chus by the Hebrews, Egypt is called Mesraim, and the Libyans Phuth. So it is, then, that up to the present day the river of Mauretania is called Phut, and all the Libyan territory round about it is called Phuthensis. Many writers, both Greek and Latin, are witnesses to this fact. Finally, Chanaan held the land which the Jews later possessed after the Chanaanites had been expelled. (St. Jerome on Hebrew Names)
