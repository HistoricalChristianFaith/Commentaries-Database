There Moses was sent by God into Egypt; here Christ was sent from the Father into the world. Moses’ mission was to lead out of Egypt a persecuted people; Christ’s was to rescue all the people of the world who were under the tyranny of sin. There the blood of a lamb was the charm against the destroyer; here, the blood of the unspotted Lamb, Jesus Christ, is appointed your inviolable sanctuary against demons.
