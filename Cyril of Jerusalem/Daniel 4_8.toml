quote='''
The spirit filled the soul of Daniel with wisdom.… Even Nebuchadnezzar recognized that the Holy Spirit was in Daniel.… One thing he said was true and one was false. That he had the spirit was true, but he was not the chief of the magicians. He was no magician, but he was wise by the Holy Spirit.… You see the power of the Holy Spirit; they who had seen the vision do not understand, while they who had not seen it understand and interpret it.
