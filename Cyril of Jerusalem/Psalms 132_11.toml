That the Lord was to be born of a virgin we know clearly; now we must show of what stock the virgin was. “The Lord swore to David a firm promise from which he will not withdraw: ‘Your own offspring I will set on your throne.’ ” Again, “I will make his posterity endure forever and his throne as the days of heaven.” Then, “Once by my holiness I have sworn; I will not be false to David: his posterity shall continue forever, and his throne shall be like the sun before me; like the moon, which remains forever.” You see that the words concern Christ, not Solomon, for Solomon’s throne did not endure as the sun. But if anyone should object that Christ did not sit on the wooden throne of David, let us produce that saying: “The scribes and Pharisees have sat on the chair of Moses.” For this signifies not the chair of wood but the authority of his teaching.
