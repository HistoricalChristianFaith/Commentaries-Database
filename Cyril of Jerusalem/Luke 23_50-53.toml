We seek to know exactly where he was buried. Was his tomb made with hands? Does it rise above the ground, like the tombs of kings? Was the sepulcher made of stones joined together? What is laid upon it? O prophets, tell us exactly about his tomb. Where is it? Where should we look for it? They answer, “Look at the solid rock that you have hewn.” Look and see. You have in the Gospels, “In a rock-hewn tomb.” What is next? What kind of door does the sepulcher have? Again, the prophet says, “They have ended my life in the pit, and they have laid a stone over me.” I am “the chief cornerstone, chosen, precious.” He that is “a stone of stumbling” to the Jews but of salvation to those that believe was for a while within a stone. The tree of life was planted in the earth, to bring blessing for the earth that was cursed and to bring release for the dead.
