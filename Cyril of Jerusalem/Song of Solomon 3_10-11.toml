Every king is proclaimed by soldiers. It was fitting that Jesus also, in figure, be crowned by soldiers. For this reason Scripture says in the Canticles: “Daughters of Jerusalem, come forth and look upon King Solomon in the crown with which his mother has crowned him.” But the crown was also a mystery, for it was a remission of sins and release from the sentence of condemnation.
