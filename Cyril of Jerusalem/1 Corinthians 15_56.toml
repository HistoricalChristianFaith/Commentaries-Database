[[commentary]]

Baptism destroys the sting of death. For you descend into the water laden with your sins. But the invocation of grace causes your soul to receive this seal, and after that it does not lead you to be swallowed up by the dread dragon. You go down “deadly indeed in sin,” and you come up “alive unto righteousness.”
