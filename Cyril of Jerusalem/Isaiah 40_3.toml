While the heavenly powers rejoice, let the souls that are to be united to the spiritual bridegroom make themselves ready. For the voice is heard of one crying in the wilderness, “Prepare the way of the Lord.” For this is no light matter, no ordinary and indiscriminate union according to the flesh but the all-searching Spirit’s election according to faith.
