Do not abhor meats as if they were taboo. The apostle evidently knew people like that, since he says that there are those “who forbid to marry and command to abstain from meats which God has created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe.” If therefore you are abstaining from these things, let it not be as from things abominated, or your reward is lost, but as good things let them be transcended, in the quest of the fairer spiritual rewards that are set before you.
