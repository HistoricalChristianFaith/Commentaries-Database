Accept an additional testimony from the eighty-seventh psalm [LXX], where Christ speaks in the prophets—for he who then spoke afterwards came among us: “O Lord, the God of my salvation: I have cried in the day and in the night before you”; and subsequently, “I am become as a man without help, free among the dead.” He did not say, “I am become a man without help,” but “as a man without help”; for he was crucified, not because of helplessness but because he willed it; his death was not a result of involuntary weakness. “I am numbered with those who go down into the pit.” What is the sign? “You have taken my friends away from me” (for the disciples fled away). “Will you work wonders for the dead”? Then, “But I, O Lord, cry out to you; with my morning prayer I wait on you.” See how these verses manifest the actual circumstances of the passion and the resurrection.
