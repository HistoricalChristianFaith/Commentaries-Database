He said to him, “Yes, sir. The long duration of my illness makes me desire health. But, desire it as I may, I have no one.” Do not lose heart, my good fellow, because you “have no one.” You have God standing by you. One who is at once man and God under different aspects, for both must be confessed. The confession of the humanity without the confession of the divinity is unavailing, or rather earns a curse. For “cursed is one who puts his trust in humankind.”
