[Christ] did then truly rise, and after he had risen, he was seen again by his disciples. And the twelve disciples were witnesses of his resurrection, testifying not with words meant to please but contending for the truth of the resurrection even unto torture and death. Further, “on the word of two or three witnesses every word may be confirmed,” according to Scripture. There are twelve witnesses to the resurrection of Christ, and do you still disbelieve in the resurrection?
