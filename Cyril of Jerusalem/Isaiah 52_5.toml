The name of God is in its nature holy, whether we say so or not; but since it is sometimes profaned among sinners, according to the words, “Through you my name is continually blasphemed among the Gentiles,” we pray that in us God’s name may be hallowed; not that it comes to be holy from our being holy but because it becomes holy in us, when we are made holy and do things worthy of holiness.
