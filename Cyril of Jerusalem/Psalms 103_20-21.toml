“Your will be done on earth as in heaven.” God’s divine and blessed angels do the will of God, as David said in the psalm, “Bless the Lord, all his angels, mighty in strength, that do his pleasure.” So then in effect this is what you mean when you pray, “as in the angels your will is done, so likewise be it done on earth by human beings, O Lord.”
