Riches, gold and silver, are not the devil’s as some think, for “the whole world of riches is for the faithful man, but for the unfaithful not a farthing.” But nothing is more faithless than the devil. God through the prophet says plainly, “Mine is the silver, and mine is the gold.” Only use it well and there is nothing blameworthy in silver; but when you abuse a good thing and are then unwilling to blame your own conduct, you impiously put the blame on the Creator. One can even be blessed by money. “I was hungry, and you gave me to eat”4—undoubtedly by the use of money; “I was naked and you covered me”—assuredly by the use of money. Consider too that money can be a door to the heavenly kingdom. “Sell,” he says, “what you have, and give to the poor, and you shall have treasure in heaven.”
