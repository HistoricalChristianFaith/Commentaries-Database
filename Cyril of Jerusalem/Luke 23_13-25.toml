Many have been crucified throughout the world, but the demons are not afraid of any of these. These people died because of their own sins, but Christ died for the sin of others. He “did not sin, neither was deceit found in his mouth.” It was not Peter, who could be suspected of partiality, who said this, but Isaiah, who, although not present in the flesh, in spirit foresaw the Lord’s coming in the flesh. Why do I bring only the prophet as a witness? Take the witness of Pilate himself. He passed judgment on him, by saying, “I find no guilt in this man.” When he delivered him over and washed his hands, he said, “I am innocent of the blood of this just man.” The robber is another witness to Jesus’ innocence. He is the first man to enter paradise. He rebuked his friend and said, “We are receiving what our deeds deserved, but this man has done nothing wrong, because you and I were present at his judgment.”
