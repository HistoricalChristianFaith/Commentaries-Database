And if you would receive a testimony also, “listen,” he says. “But this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel: ‘And it shall come to pass after this, says God, I will pour forth of my Spirit’ ”—and this word, ‘I will pour forth,’ implied a rich gift; ‘for God gives not the Spirit by measure for the Father loves the Son, and has given all things into his hand’; and he has given him the power also of bestowing the grace of the all-holy Spirit on whomever he will—“I will pour forth of my Spirit upon all flesh, and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy;” and afterward, “Yea, and on my servants and on my handmaidens I will pour out in those days of my Spirit, and they shall prophesy.” The Holy Spirit is no respecter of persons, for he seeks not dignities but piety of soul. Let neither the rich be puffed up nor the poor be dejected, but only let each prepare himself for reception of the heavenly gift.
