[The Holy Spirit] is called Comforter, because he comforts and encourages us and “helps our weakness. For we do not know what we should pray for as we ought, but the Spirit himself pleads for us with unutterable groanings,” that is, clearly, to God. Often a person for Christ’s sake is treated with contumely and unjustly dishonored; martyrdom is at hand, tortures on every side, fire, swords, wild beasts and the abyss; but the Holy Spirit gently whispers, “Wait for the Lord,” for your present sufferings are slight, while your rewards will be great; endure for a little while, and you will be with the angels forever. “The sufferings of the present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory to come that will be revealed in us.” He portrays for the person the kingdom of heaven and even gives him a glimpse of the paradise of pleasure; and the martyrs, who must present their bodily countenances to their judges, are in spirit already in paradise, despise what appear to be hardships.
