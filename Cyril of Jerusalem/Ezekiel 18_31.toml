“Make for yourselves a new heart and a new spirit” that you may become a subject of joy for the citizens of heaven. For if there is joy “over one sinner who repents,” according to the Gospel, how much more will the salvation of so many souls gladden the blessed saints? You have entered on a good and glorious course: run the holy race in good earnest.
