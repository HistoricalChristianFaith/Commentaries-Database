That the Holy Spirit subsists, lives, speaks and foretells I have told you repeatedly on former occasions. Paul writes clearly to Timothy, “Now the Spirit expressly says that in later times some will depart from the faith.” This we see in the factions of former times and in our own day. How diverse and multiform are the errors of the heretics.
