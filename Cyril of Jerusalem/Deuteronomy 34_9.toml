It is written, “Now Joshua, the son of Nun, was filled with the Spirit of wisdom, since Moses had laid his hands upon him.” Note the same ceremonial everywhere, both in the Old and the New Testament. In Moses’ day the Spirit was given by the imposition of hands; and Peter imparted the Spirit by the imposition of hands. Upon you also, who are to be baptized, the grace will come.
