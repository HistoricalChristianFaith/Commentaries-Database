He is not ashamed to assume flesh, who is the creator of those very parts. Who tells us this? The Lord said to Jeremiah: “Before I formed you in the belly, I knew you. Before you came forth out of the womb, I made you holy.” If, then, in making humanity he was not ashamed of the contact, was he ashamed in making for his own sake the holy flesh, the veil of his Godhead? It is God who even now creates children in the womb, as it is written in Job, “Didn’t you pour me out as milk and curdled me like cheese? You have clothed me with skin and flesh and have knit me together with bones and sinews.” There is nothing polluted in the human frame unless a person defiles it with fornication and adultery. God, who made Adam, also made Eve. Both male and female were formed by God’s hands. None of the parts of the body as formed from the beginning are polluted. - "Catechetical Lectures 12.26"
