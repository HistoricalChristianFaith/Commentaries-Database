Though the enemy is unseen, we have our faith as a strong protection, according to the saying of the apostle: “In all things taking up the shield of faith, with which you may be able to quench all the fiery darts of the most wicked one.” Oftentimes a fiery dart of desire of base indulgence is discharged by the devil; but faith, representing to us the Judgment and cooling the mind, extinguishes the dart.
