May God at length grant you to see that night when darkness is turned into day, of which it was said “the darkness hides not from you, but the night shall shine as the day.” Then let the gate of paradise be opened to each man and each woman among you. Then may you enjoy waters that bear Christ and have his sweet savor. Then may you receive his name of Christian, and the capacity for heavenly things. And even now, I pray you, lift up the eyes of your mind: take thought now of angelic choirs, and God the master of the universe enthroned, with his only-begotten Son sitting on his right hand, and his Spirit with him, while thrones and dominations do him service, and likewise each man and woman of you as being in a state of salvation. Even now imagine that your ears catch those lovely strains wherewith the angels acclaim you saved. “Blessed are those whose transgressions are forgiven and whose sins are covered” when, as stars of the church, you enter paradise with glorious body and radiant soul.
