But in case anyone, from simplicity or perverse ingenuity, should suppose that Christ is but equal in honor to righteous people … it is well to make this distinction beforehand, that the name of the Father is one, but the power of his operation is many. And Christ himself, knowing this, has spoken unerringly, “I am ascending to my Father and your Father.” He does not say, “to our Father,” but distinguishing and saying first what was proper to himself, “to My Father,” which was by nature. Then he adds, “and your Father,” which was by adoption. For however high the privilege we have received of saying in our prayers, “Our Father,” who art in heaven, yet this gift is one of loving-kindness. For we call him Father, not as having been by nature begotten of our Father who is in heaven but having been transferred from servitude to sonship by the grace of the Father, through the Son and Holy Spirit. We are permitted to speak this way because of the ineffable loving-kindness [of our Father].

The Father, having begotten the Son, remained the Father and is not changed. He begat Wisdom yet did not lose wisdom himself. He begat power yet did not become weak. He begat God but did not lose his own Godhead. Neither did he lose anything himself by diminution or change. He who was begotten does not lack anything either. Perfect is he who begat, perfect is that which was begotten: God was he who begat, God is he who was begotten; God of all himself, yet giving the Father the title as his own God. For he is not ashamed to say, “I ascend to my Father and your Father, and to my God and your God.” But in case you might think that he is a Father of the Son in the same way that he is Father of creation, Christ drew a distinction in what follows. For he did not say, “I ascend to our Father,” lest the creatures should be made fellows of the Only Begotten. Instead, he said, “My Father and your Father.” He is in one way mine, by nature. He is, in another way, yours, by adoption. And again, “to my God and your God,” in one way mine, as his true and only-begotten Son, and in another way yours, as his workmanship. The Son of God then is very God, ineffably begotten before all ages.
