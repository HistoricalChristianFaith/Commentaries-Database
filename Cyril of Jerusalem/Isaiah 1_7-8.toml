Isaiah lived almost [two] thousand years ago and saw Zion in a hut. The city was still standing, beautiful with public squares and clothed in honor; yet he says, “Zion shall be plowed like a field,” foretelling what has been fulfilled in our day. Observe the exactness of the prophecy; for he said, “Daughter Zion will be left like a hut in a vineyard, like a shed in a melon patch.” Now the place is full of melon patches.
