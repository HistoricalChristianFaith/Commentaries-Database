With unspeakable mercy, God deigned to be called the Father of humankind. He is in heaven, they on earth. He is the eternal Maker. They are made in time. He holds the earth in the hollow of his hand. They are like grasshoppers on the earth. Yet people forsook their heavenly Father and said to wood, “you are my father, and to the stone, you have begotten me.” And for this reason, I think, the psalmist says to humankind, “Forget your own people as well, and your father’s house.”
