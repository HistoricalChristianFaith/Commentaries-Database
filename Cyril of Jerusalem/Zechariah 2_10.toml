The Lord heard the prayer of the prophets. The Father did not despise our race, which was perishing; he sent from heaven his own Son the Lord as our physician. One of the prophets says, “The Lord whom you seek, comes; and he shall come suddenly.” Where will he come? “The Lord shall come to his temple,” where you took up stones against him. Another of the prophets, on hearing this, says to him, “In speaking of God’s salvation, do you speak softly? In announcing the good tidings of God’s coming for salvation, do you speak in secret?” “Go up onto a high mountain, Zion, herald of glad tidings; say to the cities of Judah”—what shall I say?—“Here is your God! Here comes with power the Lord God.” Again the Lord himself has said, “ ‘Behold, I come, and I will dwell in the midst of you,’ says the Lord. ‘And many nations shall be joined to the Lord.’ ” The Israelites rejected salvation through me; “I come to gather nations of every language,” for, “he came unto his own, and his own received him not.” You come, and what do you bestow upon the nations? “I come to gather nations of every language … I will set a sign among them.” For from my conflict on the cross I will give to each of my soldiers a royal sign to bear upon his forehead. Still another prophet said, “He inclined the heavens and came down, with dark clouds under his feet.” For his coming down from heaven was unknown to humanity.
