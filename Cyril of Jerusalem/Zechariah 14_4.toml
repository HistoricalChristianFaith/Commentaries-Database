But it might happen that he should sit upon a foal; give us rather a sign where the king who enters will stand. Give us a sign not far from the city, that it may not be unknown to us; give us a sign nearby and clearly visible, that being in the city we may behold the place. Again the prophet answers, saying, “That day his feet shall rest upon the Mount of Olives, which is opposite Jerusalem to the east.” Is it possible for anyone standing within the city not to behold the place?
