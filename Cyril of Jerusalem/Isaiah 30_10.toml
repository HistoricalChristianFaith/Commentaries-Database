[[commentary]]

The chief priests and the Pharisees, through the agency of Pilate, sealed the tomb; but the women saw him who was risen.… The chief priests lacked understanding, but the women beheld with their own eyes. When the soldiers came into the city and told the chief priests what had happened, they said to the soldiers, “Say, his disciples came by night and stole him while we were sleeping.” Well did Isaiah foretell this also, in their persons: “But tell us, and relate another error.” Christ has risen and come back from the dead, and by a bribe they persuade the soldiers.
