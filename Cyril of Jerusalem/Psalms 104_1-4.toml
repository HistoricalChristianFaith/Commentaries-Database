What we proclaim is not one single coming of Christ but a second as well, much fairer than the first. For the first presented a demonstration of long-suffering, but the second wears the crown of the kingdom of God. Most things about our Lord Jesus Christ are twofold. His birth is twofold, once of God before the ages and once of the Virgin in the end of the ages. Twice he comes down, once all unseen like dew on a fleece and a second time still future and manifest. When first he came, he was swaddled in a manger. When next he comes he will “clothe himself with light as with a garment.” At his first coming “he endured the cross, despising the shame”; at his second, he comes surrounded with glory and escorted by hosts of angels. We do not therefore simply rest on Christ’s first coming, by itself, but let us look forward also to his second; and as we say of his former coming, “Blessed is he that comes in the name of the Lord,” so also we will say the same words again at his second coming, that we may meet our Master in company with angels and say, “Blessed is he that comes in the name of the Lord” as we worship him. The Savior comes again, but not to be judged again, for he will pass judgment on those who passed judgment on him, and he who before kept silence as they judged him now reminds those lawless people who did their outrageous deeds to him on the cross and says, “These things you have done, and I kept silence.” He adapted himself when he came then and taught people by persuasion, but this time it is they who will be forced to bow to his rule, whether they want to or not.
