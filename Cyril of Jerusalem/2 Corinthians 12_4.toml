Elijah was taken up to heaven only, but Paul into heaven and paradise (for it was but fitting that the disciples of Jesus should receive more manifold grace) and “heard secret words that man may not repeat.” But Paul came down again from heaven, not because he was unworthy to abide in the third heaven but after enjoying gifts beyond man’s lot.
