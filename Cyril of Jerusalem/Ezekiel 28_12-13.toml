The chief author of sin, then, is the devil, the author of all evil. Not I but the Lord has said, “The devil sins from the beginning.” Before him no one sinned. Nor did he sin because by nature he was of necessity prone to sin—or else the responsibility for sin would reflect on him who created him in this way—but after being created good, he became a devil by his own free choice, receiving that name from his action. Though he was an archangel, he was afterwards called devil (slanderer) from his slandering, and though he was once a good servant of God, he was afterwards rightly named Satan, for Satan is interpreted “the adversary.” This is not my teaching but that of the inspired prophet Ezekiel. For taking up a lament against him, he says, “You were a seal of resemblance and crown of beauty; you were begotten in the paradise of God,” and a little further on, “Blameless you were in your conduct from the day you were created until evil was found in you.”
