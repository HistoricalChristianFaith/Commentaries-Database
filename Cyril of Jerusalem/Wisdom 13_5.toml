If it is not possible to see the divine nature with eyes of flesh, it is possible to gain an image of the divine power of the Creator from his works. Solomon says this: “In fact, one knows the author by analogy from the greatness and beauty of creatures.” He does not say simply that one knows the author from creatures but adds “by analogy.” The more we consider his creatures in a contemplative way, in fact, the more God will show himself to be great. And the more our heart is raised in contemplation, the higher will be the image that we have of God.
