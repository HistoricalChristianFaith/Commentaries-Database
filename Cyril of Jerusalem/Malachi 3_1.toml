Of these two comings the prophet Malachi says, “And suddenly there will come to the temple the Lord whom you seek”; that is one coming. Of the second coming he says, “ ‘And the messenger of the covenant whom you desire, yes, he is coming,’ says the Lord of hosts. ‘But who will endure the day of his coming? And who can stand when he appears? For he is like a refiner’s fire or like the fuller’s lye. He will sit refining and purifying.’ ” In what immediately follows the Savior himself says, “I will draw near to you for judgment, and I will be swift to bear witness against sorcerers, adulterers and perjurers.” It was with this in view that Paul says in due warning: “But if anyone builds upon this foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, straw—the work of each will be made manifest, for the Day of the Lord will declare it, since the day is to be revealed in fire.” Paul indicates these two comings also in writing to Titus in these words: “The grace of God our Savior has appeared to all men, instructing us, in order that, rejecting ungodliness and worldly lusts, we may live temperately and justly and piously in this world; looking for the blessed hope and glorious coming of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ.” Do you see how he speaks of a first coming, for which he gives thanks, and of a second we are going to look for? We find the same lesson in the wording of the creed we profess, as delivered to us, that is, to believe in him who “ascended into heaven and sat down on the right of the Father, and is to come in glory to judge the living and dead, of whose kingdom there will be no end.”
