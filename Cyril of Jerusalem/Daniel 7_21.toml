Paul says further, “who opposes and exalts himself above all that is called god or that is worshiped,” that is, above every divinity, so that antichrist will be the bitter foe of the idolatrous cults. He continues, “so that he sits in the temple of God.” What temple is that? Paul says it is the destroyed temple of the Jews. For God forbid that it should be that temple of God in which we are! Why should I suggest such a thing? Lest you should think me complacent about us Christians. For if antichrist will come to the Jews as messiah and seek worship from the Jews, he will show great zeal for the temple so as to deceive them the more, hinting that he is that man of the house of David destined to rebuild the temple erected by Solomon. Antichrist will come at such a time as there shall not be left of the temple of the Jews “one stone on another,” to quote the sentence pronounced by the Savior. For it is not until all the stones are overthrown, whether by the decay of age or through being pulled down for building material or in consequence of this or that other happening, and I do not mean merely the stones of the outer walls but the floor of the inner temple where the cherubim were, that antichrist will come “with all signs and lying wonders” treating all the idols with disdain, at first adopting a show of being humane but later displaying his ruthlessness, especially toward the holy people of God. For it says, “I beheld, and the same horn made war with the saints,” and in another Scripture it says, “And there shall be a time of trouble, such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time.” Antichrist is the terrible wild beast, the great dragon unconquerable by people and ready to swallow them up.
