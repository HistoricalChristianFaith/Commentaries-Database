For this reason Solomon also, in Ecclesiastes, covertly alluding to this grace, says, “Come hither, eat your bread with joy,” that is, the mystical bread. “Come hither,” he calls, a saving, beatific call. “And drink your wine with a merry heart,” that is, the mystical wine. “And let oil be poured out upon your head”: you see how he hints also of the mystical chrism. “And at all times let your garments be white, because the Lord approves what you do.” It is now that the Lord approves what you do, for before you came to the grace your doings were “vanity of vanities.”
