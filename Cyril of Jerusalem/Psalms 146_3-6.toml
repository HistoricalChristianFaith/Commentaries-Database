There are many uses of the word spirit in general in the sacred Scriptures, and a person could easily become confused from ignorance, if he did not know to what sort of spirit the particular text refers. Therefore, we must be sure of the nature of the Holy Spirit according to Scripture. For example Aaron is called Christ (anointed), and David also, and Saul and others are called Christs, yet there is only one true Christ; similarly since the name of spirit has been given to many things, we must determine what in particular is called the Holy Spirit. Many things are called spirits; our soul is called spirit; this wind that is blowing is called spirit; great valor is called spirit; impure action is called spirit; and a hostile devil is called spirit. Take care, therefore, when you hear such things, not to mistake one for another because of the similarity of name. Scripture says of the soul, “When his spirit departs he returns to the earth”; and again of the soul, “Who forms the spirit of a person within him.” It says in the Psalms of the angels, “Who make your angels spirits”;16 it says of the wind: “With a vehement spirit you shall break in pieces the ships of Tharsis”; and “As the trees of the woods are moved with the spirit”;18 and “Fire, hail, snow, ice, spirit of storm.” Our Lord says of his blessed teaching: “The words that I have spoken to you are spirit and life,” that is, they are spiritual. The Holy Spirit is not an utterance of the tongue; he is living, granting wise speech, speaking and discoursing himself.
