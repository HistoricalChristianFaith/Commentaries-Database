You must also know that the Holy Spirit empowers the martyrs to bear witness.… A person cannot testify as a martyr for Christ’s sake except through the Holy Spirit. If “no man can say ‘Jesus is Lord,’ except in the Holy Spirit,” will any man give his life for Jesus’ sake except through the Holy Spirit?
