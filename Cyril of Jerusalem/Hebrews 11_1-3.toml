“Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. For by it the elders obtained a good report.” Notice how great a dignity the Lord bestows on you in transferring you from the order of catechumens to that of the faithful. The apostle Paul says as much when he affirms, “God is faithful, by whom you were called into the fellowship of his son Jesus Christ.” Since God is here called faithful, you also in receiving this title receive a great dignity. God is called faithful in the same way that he is called good, just, almighty and maker of the universe. Consider therefore to what kind of dignity you are rising, seeing you are to become a partaker of a title of God.Here, then, it is further required that each of you be found faithful in his conscience: “for a faithful man it is hard to find”—not that you need to reveal to me what is on your conscience, for you are not to be “judged by man’s judgment.” But you are supposed to show the sincerity of your faith to God, “who tries the reins and hearts” and “knows the thoughts of men.” A faithful person is a great thing, being richest of all rich people. For “to the faithful person belongs the whole world of wealth,” in that he disdains and tramples on it. For they who in appearance are rich and have many possessions are poor in soul: since the more they gather, the more they pine with longing for what is still lacking. But the faithful person (a strange paradox, indeed) is rich in poverty. Such a person knows that we only need to have “food and clothing” and, being “content with these,” he has trampled riches under foot.

It is not only among those of us who bear the name of Christ that the dignity of faith is great. Rather, all things that are accomplished in the world, even by those who are strangers to the church, are accomplished by faith. By faith the laws of marriage yoke together those who have lived as strangers. Because of the faith in marriage contracts, a stranger is made partner of another stranger’s person and possessions. By faith, farmers are also sustained, for the one who does not believe that he shall receive a harvest is not going to endure the work. By faith seafaring men, trusting to the thinnest plank, exchange that most solid element, the land, for the restless motion of the waves, committing themselves to uncertain hopes and carrying with them a faith more sure than any anchor. By faith therefore most of men’s affairs are held together: and not among us only has there been this belief, but also, as I have said, among those who are outside the church. For if they receive not the Scriptures but bring forward certain doctrines of their own, even these they accept by faith.
