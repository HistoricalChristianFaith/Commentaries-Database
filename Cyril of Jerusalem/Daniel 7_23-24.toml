These doctrines are not the fruit of ingenuity but are derived from the sacred Scriptures read in the church, particularly as gathered out of the prophecy of Daniel, in today’s lection, and according to the interpretation given by the archangel Gabriel, who spoke as follows, “the fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom on earth, which shall surpass all kingdoms.” Ecclesiastical commentators have traditionally taken this kingdom to be the Roman Empire.… Further on Gabriel continues his interpreting and says, “And the ten horns out of this kingdom are ten kings that shall arise; and another king shall rise up after them, and he shall surpass in wickedness all who were before him” (not merely the ten kings, you note, but all kings that ever were) “and he shall subdue three kings” (clearly out of the ten that preceded him; and he had reduced three of the ten to powerlessness; it is equally clear that he will reign as the eighth king) “and he will speak great words against the Most High.” Antichrist is a blasphemer and flouter of all law. He will not succeed to the empire but will usurp it by means of sorcery.
