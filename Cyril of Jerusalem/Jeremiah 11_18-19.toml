Listen to Jeremiah and be convinced: “I was as a meek lamb that is carried to be a victim. Did I not know it?” (Read it thus as a question, as I have put it. For he who said, “You know that after two days the Passover shall be here, and the Son of man will be delivered up to be crucified,” did he not know?) “I was a meek lamb that is carried to be a victim. Did I not know it?” (What sort of lamb? Let John the Baptist interpret, when he says, “Behold the lamb of God, who takes away the sins of the world!”) “They devised a wicked counsel against me, saying (Was it that he who knew the counsels did not know their result? And what did they say?): “Come, and let us put wood on his bread.” (If the Lord shall count you worthy, hereafter you shall learn that his body, according to the Gospel, bore the figure of bread.) “Come, and let us put wood on his bread, and cut him off from the land of the living (Life is not cut off. Why do you toil to no purpose?) And let his name be remembered no more.”
