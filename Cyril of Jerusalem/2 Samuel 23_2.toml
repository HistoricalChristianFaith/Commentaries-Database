In Moses’ day the Spirit was given by the imposition of hands; and Peter imparted the Spirit by the imposition of hands. Upon you also, who are to be baptized, the grace will come. In what manner I do not say, for I do not anticipate the proper time.… We learn clearly in the book of Kings [Samuel], of Samuel and David, how by the Holy Spirit they prophesied and were leaders of the prophets. Samuel in fact was called the “seer.” David says plainly: “The spirit of the Lord has spoken by me;” and in the psalms: “and do not take your holy spirit from me;” and again: “May your good spirit guide me on level ground.”
