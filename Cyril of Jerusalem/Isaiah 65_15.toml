With the ungrudging generosity of his godhead, Christ has granted to all of us to bear his name. For whereas as human sovereigns have some special title of sovereignty that they keep exclusively from use by other people, Jesus Christ, being Son of God, has deigned to bestow on us the title of Christians.… But some will say, “The name of ‘Christians’ is new and was not previously in use”: and new-fashioned phrases are often objected to on the score of strangeness. The prophet made this point safe beforehand, saying, “But on my servants shall a new name be called, which shall be blessed upon the earth.”
