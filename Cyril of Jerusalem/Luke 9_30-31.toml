What strange thing do we announce when we say that God became man and when you say that Abraham received the Lord as a guest? What strange thing do we announce when Jacob says, “I have seen a heavenly being face to face, yet my life has been spared”? The same Lord who ate with Abraham also ate with us. What strange thing do we announce? We present two witnesses who stood before the Lord on Mount Sinai: Moses was “in the hollow of the rock,” and Elijah was once in the hollow of the rock. Being present at his transfiguration on Mount Tabor, they spoke to his disciples “of his death that he was about to fulfill in Jerusalem.”
