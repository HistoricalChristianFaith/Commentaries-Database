For just as man is said to perish, according to the text, “The just perishes, and no one takes it to heart,” and this is said, though the resurrection is expected, so we look for a resurrection of the heavens. “The sun will be turned to darkness, and the moon to blood.” Let the converts from the Manichaeans be instructed and no longer make the luminaries their gods or impiously think that this sun that is darkened is Christ. Listen to the Lord’s words: “Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away,” for the master’s creatures are less precious than his words.
