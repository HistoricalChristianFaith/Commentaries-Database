One might gather from a passage in Ezekiel that Ezekiel saw him, but what does Scripture actually say? He saw “the likeness of his glory”; not the Lord but only the likeness of his glory, not the glory as it really is. Yet, on beholding the likeness of his glory and not the glory itself, he fell to the earth in fear. But if the vision of the likeness of the glory inspired the prophets with fear and trembling, anyone attempting to look on God would surely lose his life.
