With baptism the old covenant ends and the new begins. This is seen in the fact that the inaugurator of the New Testament is John the Baptist. “Among those born of women there is none greater than John.” He is the crown of all the prophetic tradition: “For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John.” Of the gospel dispensation he was the firstfruits, for we read “the beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ” and after some words “John did baptize in the wilderness.”
