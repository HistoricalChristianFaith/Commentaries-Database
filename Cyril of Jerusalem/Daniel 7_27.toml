Take, also, another like expression. “For until this day … when Moses is read, the veil is on their hearts.” Does “until this day” mean “up to the time that Paul wrote the words and no longer”? Does it not mean until this present day and indeed to the very end? And if Paul should say, “For we come as far as you also in preaching the gospel of Christ, having hope, when your faith is increased, to preach the gospel in the regions beyond you,” you can see clearly that the phrase “as far as” sets no limit but indicates what lies beyond. With what meaning, therefore, ought you to recall the words “till he has put all enemies”? Just the same as in another saying of Paul, “But exhort each other daily, while it is called today,” this clearly means for all time. For as we must not talk of a beginning of the days of Christ, so never suffer anyone to speak of an end of his kingdom. For Scripture says, “his kingdom is an everlasting kingdom.”
