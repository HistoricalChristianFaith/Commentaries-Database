upon all flesh:
This suggests not only those from the circumcision, but all those without distinction who are called through faith, be they from pagans in their error, be they small or great, slave or free, barbarians or Scythians; 

sons and your daughters shall prophesy :
Implying in this the liberality of the grace and its equal application to all; the female sex would not be rejected by God if they performed with zeal what pleases him and opted for that attitude, nor would they be without a share in recompense and sanctification if they proved commmendable in faith and the goodness of their actions. 

and your elders:
in my view meaning by elder pre-eminence and priority coming from quality of virtue, mature, as it were, with spendid achievements, and distinguised and admirable for mature thinking.
