Even though Elijah the Tishbite was taken up to heaven, he was not greater than John. Enoch too was translated17 but was not greater than John. Moses was the greatest of lawgivers and all the prophets were admirable, but none greater than John. It is not I who would dare to compare prophet with prophet, but their Master and ours who himself declared “Among those born of women there is none greater than John.” Not “born of virgins,” observe! but “born of women.”
