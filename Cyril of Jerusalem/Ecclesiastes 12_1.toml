Ecclesiastes knew of the Lord’s coming at the end of the world when he said, “Rejoice, O young man, while you are young.” Subsequently [he said], “Ward off grief from your heart, and put away trouble from your presence. Remember your Creator, before the evil days come, before the sun is darkened, and the light, and the moon, and the stars; and they who look through the windows go blind” (this signifies the power of sight). [Remember] “before the silver cord is snapped” (he means the cluster of the stars, silvery in appearance). [Remember before] “the golden fillet shrinks back” (here is indicated the sun with its golden aspect, for the fillet-like flower is a well-known plant, with ray-like shoots of foliage circling it), “and they shall rise up at the voice of the sparrow, and they shall see from the height, and terrors shall be in the way.” What shall they see? “Then they will see the Son of man coming upon clouds of heaven,” and they will mourn, tribe by tribe. What happens when the Lord comes? “The almond tree will bloom, and the locust will grow sluggish, and the caper berry will be scattered abroad.” According to the interpreters the blooming of the almond tree signifies the passing of winter; our bodies, after the winter, then, are to flourish with a heavenly bloom.
