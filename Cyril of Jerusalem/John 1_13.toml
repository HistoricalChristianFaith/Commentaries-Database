The Father, being very God, begot the Son like himself, very God; not as teachers beget disciples, not as Paul says to some, “I became your father in Christ Jesus through the gospel.” For in this case [Paul is speaking about] he who was not a son by nature becoming a son by discipleship. But in the former case [of Jesus], he was a son by nature, a true son—not as you, who are to be illuminated, are now becoming sons of God: for you also become sons but [do so] by adoption of grace, [not by nature].
