“Blessed is he that waits.” … That is why we are to go into hiding and take to flight. For quite likely “we shall not have gone over the cities of Israel till the Son of man comes.” Who are the “blessed” that bear witness devoutly for Christ? I tell you that those who are martyrs at that time take precedence over all other martyrs. For … the martyrs under antichrist do battle with Satan in his own person.… [The antichrist will] show illusory signs and wonders.… May it not enter into anyone’s heart to ask, “What did Christ do greater than this? For what power enables this man to do such deeds? Unless God willed it, he would not have allowed it.”
