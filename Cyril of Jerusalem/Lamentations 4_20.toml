Read the Lamentations. In those Lamentations, Jeremiah, lamenting you, wrote what is worthy of lamentations. He saw your destruction, he beheld your downfall, he bewailed Jerusalem that then was; for that which exists now shall not be bewailed; for that Jerusalem crucified the Christ, but that which exists now worships him. Lamenting then, he says, “The breath of our countenance, Christ the Lord, was taken in our corruptions.” Am I then stating views of my own? Behold he testifies of the Lord Christ seized by men. And what is to follow from this? Tell me, O prophet. He says, “Of whom we said, ‘Under his shadow we shall live among the nations.’ ” For he signifies that the grace of life is no longer to dwell in Israel but among the Gentiles.

Hold more steadfastly the faith in “One God the Father almighty; and in our Lord Jesus Christ, his only-begotten Son; and in the Holy Spirit the Comforter.” Though the word itself and title of Spirit is applied to them in common in the sacred Scriptures, it is said of the Father, God is a Spirit, as it is written in the Gospel according to John; and of the Son, a Spirit before our face, Christ the Lord, as Jeremiah the prophet says; and of the Holy Spirit, the Comforter, the Holy Spirit, as was said. Yet the arrangement of articles in the faith, if religiously understood, disproves the error of Sabellius also.
