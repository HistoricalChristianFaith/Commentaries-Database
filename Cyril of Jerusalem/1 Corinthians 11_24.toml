The teaching of the blessed Paul is of itself sufficient to give you full assurance about the divine mysteries by admission to which you have become one body and blood with Christ.… When the Master himself has explicitly said of the bread, “This is my body,” will anyone still dare to doubt? When he is himself our warranty saying, “This is my blood,” who will ever waver and say it is not his blood?… With perfect confidence, then, we partake as of the body and blood of Christ.
