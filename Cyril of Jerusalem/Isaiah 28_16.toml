Was his tomb made with hands? Does it rise above the ground, like the tombs of kings? Was the sepulcher made of stones joined together? And what is laid upon it? Tell us exactly, O prophets, about his tomb also, where it lies, and where we shall look for it. But they answer, “Look upon the solid rock which you have hewn,” look and see.… I, who am “the chief corner stone, chosen, precious,” lie for a while within a stone, I, who am “a stone of stumbling” to the Jews but of salvation to them that believe.
