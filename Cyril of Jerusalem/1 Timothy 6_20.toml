[[commentary]]

I have many other testimonies from holy Scripture to the fact that the kingdom of Christ endures throughout all ages. But I will content myself with what I have said, because the day wears on. And do you, my hearers, worship him alone as king, and flee every misguided heresy.… Flee the false Christ, and look for the true. You have been taught the way to be among those on his right hand at the judgment. Retain “that which is committed to you” concerning Christ, and be adorned with good works. So you will stand with a good courage before the Judge and thereafter inherit the kingdom of heaven.
