John, filled with the Holy Spirit from his mother’s womb, was sanctified for the purpose of baptizing the Lord. John himself did not impart the Spirit but preached the glad tidings of him who does. He says, “I indeed baptize you with water, for repentance. But he who is coming after me, he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire.” Why fire? Because the descent of the Holy Spirit was in fiery tongues. Concerning this the Lord says with joy, “I have come to cast fire upon the earth, and how I wish that it would be kindled!”
