The sum of your sins does not surpass the magnitude of God’s mercies. Your wounds are not beyond the healing skill of the great Physician. Only surrender to him with faith, tell the Physician of your malady. Repeat the words of David: “I said, I will confess against myself my iniquity to the Lord,” and in like manner will be verified the second part of the verse: “And you forgave the wickedness of my heart.”
