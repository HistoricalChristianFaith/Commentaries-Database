Now Golgotha is interpreted “the place of a skull.” Who were they, then, who prophetically named this spot Golgotha in which Christ the true head endured the cross? The apostle calls him “the image of the invisible God,” and a little after, “the head of the body, the church.” And again, “The head of every man is Christ.” And again, “[He] is the head over all principalities and powers.” The head suffered in “the place of the skull.” O wondrous prophetic appellation! The very name also reminds you, saying, “Do not think of the Crucified as a mere man.” He is “the head of all principalities and powers.” That head that was crucified is the head of all power and has for his head the Father, “for the head of the man is Christ, and the head of Christ is God.”
