Having been bound, Christ went from Caiaphas to Pilate; is this also written? Yes: “And having bound him, they led him away as a present to the King of Jarim.” But some keen listener will object: “Pilate was not a king.” (Let us pass over for the time the main points of the inquiry.) “How then, having bound him, did they lead him as a present to the king?” But read the Gospel: “Pilate, hearing that he was from Galilee, sent him to Herod; for Herod was then king and was present in Jerusalem.” Notice the exactness of the prophet, for he says that he was sent as a present. For “Herod and Pilate became friends that very day; whereas previously they had been at enmity with each other.” It was fitting that he, who was to restore peace between earth and heaven, should first put at peace the very men who condemned him, for the Lord himself was there present, “who reconciles the hearts of the princes of the earth.” Mark the exactness of the prophets and their truthful testimony.
