He [Jesus] was not baptized to receive the forgiveness of sins. He was without sin. Being sinless, still he was baptized so that he might give grace and dignity to those who receive the sacrament. “Since the children share in flesh and blood, so he in like manner has shared in these,” that we, sharing his incarnate life, might also share his divine grace. Jesus was baptized that we in turn also made here partakers with him, might receive not only salvation but also the dignity.
