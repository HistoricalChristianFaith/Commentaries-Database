Hear now in regard to thirty pieces of silver: “And I will say to them, ‘If it seems good to you, give me my wages, or refuse.’ ” One recompense is due me for curing the blind and the lame, and I receive another; instead of thanksgiving, dishonor, and instead of worship, insult. Do you see how Scripture foresaw all this? “And they counted out my wages, thirty pieces of silver.” O prophetic accuracy! A great and unerring wisdom of the Holy Spirit! For he did not say ten or twenty but thirty, exactly the right amount. Tell also what happened to this payment, O prophet! Does he who received it keep it, or does he give it back? And after its return what becomes of it? The prophet says, “So I took thirty pieces of silver, and I cast them into the house of the Lord, into the foundry.” Compare with the prophecy of the Gospel, which says, “Judas repented and flung the pieces of silver into the temple and withdrew.”
