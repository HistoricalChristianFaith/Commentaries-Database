Although to Adam it was said “For the day you eat of it, you must die,” today you have been faithful. Today will bring you salvation. The tree brought ruin to Adam; the tree [of life] shall bring you into paradise. Fear not the serpent; he shall not cast you out, for he has fallen from heaven. I say not to you, “This day you shall depart,” but “This day you shall be with me.”
