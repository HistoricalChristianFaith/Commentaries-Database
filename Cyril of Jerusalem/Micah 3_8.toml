If, further, one works through the twelve minor prophets, many testimonies to the Holy Spirit are to be found. Thus Micah speaks as God’s mouthpiece and says, “Truly I am full of power by the Spirit of the Lord.” Joel cries, “ ‘And it shall come to pass afterwards,’ says God, ‘that I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh’ ” and what follows. Haggai said, “ ‘For I am with you,’ says the Lord of hosts … ‘my Spirit remained among you.’ ” And in like manner Zechariah says, “Receive my words and my statutes which I commanded my servants the prophets.”
