Now this Father of our Lord Jesus Christ is not circumscribed to some place, nor is there heaven beyond him, but “the heavens are the work of his fingers,” and “the whole earth is holden in the hollow of his hand.” He is in everything, and yet nothing contains him. Do not imagine that God is smaller than the sun or that he is as large as the sun. For, as he made the sun, he must have been already incomparably greater than the sun and more resplendent with light. He knows what is to come, and nothing equals him in power. He knows everything and does as he wills. He is not subject to any law of sequence, or genesis, or fortune or fate. He is perfect by every measure. He possesses unchangeably every kind of virtue, never less and never more, but ever in the same degree and manner.
