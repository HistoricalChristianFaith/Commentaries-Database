But while honoring our heavenly Father, let us also honor the “fathers of our flesh,” since the Lord in the Law and the Prophets has clearly laid this down, saying: “Honor your mother and your father, that it may be well with you, and that you may have a long life in the land.” Let those present who have mothers and fathers pay attention to this command. “Children, obey your parents in all things, for this is pleasing to the Lord.” For our Lord did not say: “He who loves father or mother is not worthy of me,” else what was well written you might interpret falsely out of ignorance, but he added “more than me.”
