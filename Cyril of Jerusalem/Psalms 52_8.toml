You are being armed not with perishable but with spiritual weapons. The paradise in which you are being planted is the soul’s paradise, wherein you will be named with a name you did not have before. You were a catechumen till now, but now you are to be called believer. Henceforth you are transplanted among the olives of that paradise or are being grafted on a good olive tree being taken from a wild olive. You pass from sins to righteousness, from defilements to purity. You are becoming part of the holy Vine. If, then, you abide in the Vine, you grow into a fruitful branch; but if you do not so abide, you will be burned up in the fire. Let us therefore bring forth worthy fruit. For let not that come about, that there should happen to us what happened to the barren fig tree in the Gospel. Let not Jesus come in these days and utter the curse on the fruitless; instead may all of you say, “I am like a green olive tree in the house of God; my trust is in the tender mercy of God, forever and ever”; not a material olive tree but a spiritual and glorious one. It is God who plants and waters, but it is yours to bear fruit; God’s to bestow the gift, and yours to receive it and keep it forever. But do not esteem the gift lightly because it is given freely. Rather, receive it reverently and guard it with care.
