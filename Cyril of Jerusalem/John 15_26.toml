He is called the Comforter because he comforts and encourages us and helps our infirmities. We do not know what we should pray for as we should, but the Spirit himself makes intercession for us, with groanings that cannot be uttered, that is, he makes intercession to God. Very often, someone has been outraged and dishonored unjustly for the sake of Christ. Martyrdom is at hand; tortures on every side, and fire, and sword, and savage beasts and the pit. But the Holy Spirit softly whispers to him, “Wait on the Lord.” What is now happening to you is a small matter; the reward will be great. Suffer a little while, and you will be with angels forever. “The sufferings of this present time are not worth comparing to the glory that shall be revealed in us.” He portrays to the person the kingdom of heaven. He gives him a glimpse of the paradise of delight.
