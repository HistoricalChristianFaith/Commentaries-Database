You have often heard also the words of the psalm: “To the dust of death you have brought me down.” Think also of the prophecy of Jacob in the Scriptures: “He lay down and couched as a lion, and as a lion’s whelp; who will disturb him?” Similarly in Numbers: “Lying down he has slept as a lion, and as a lion’s whelp.”
