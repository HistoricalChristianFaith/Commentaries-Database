What would you do then? That he who came for our salvation should become a minister of destruction because people could not bear him? Or that he should suit his grace to our measure? Daniel could not bear the vision of an angel, and were you capable of the sight of the Lord of angels? Gabriel appeared, and Daniel fell down; and of what nature or in what guise was he that appeared? His countenance was like lightning, not like the sun, “and his eyes as lamps of fire,” not as a furnace of fire. “And the voice of his words [was] as the voice of a multitude,” not as the voice of twelve legions of angels; nevertheless the prophet fell down.… If an angel appearing took away the prophet’s strength, would the appearance of God have allowed him to breathe?… So then after trial had shown our weakness, the Lord assumed that which people required: for since people required to hear from one of like countenance, the Savior took on him the nature of like affections, that people might be the more easily instructed.
