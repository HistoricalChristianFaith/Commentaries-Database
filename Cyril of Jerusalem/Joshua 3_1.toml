But Jesus [Joshua], son of Nave [Nun], was a type of him in many things; for when he began to rule the people, he began from the Jordan; thence also did Christ begin to preach the gospel after he was baptized. The son of Nave [Nun] appoints the twelve to divide the inheritance; and Jesus sends forth the twelve apostles, heralds of truth, into the whole world. He who was the type saved Rahab, the harlot, who had believed; the true Jesus … says, Behold: “the publicans and the harlots are entering the kingdom of God before you.” With but a shout, the walls of Jericho collapsed in the time of the type; and because of these words of Jesus, “There will not be left here one stone upon another,” the temple of the Jews just opposite us is fallen; not that this sentence was the cause of its ruin, but rather the sin of the transgressors. - "Catechetical Lectures 10.11"
