Let the virgins likewise form a separate band, singing hymns or reading; silently, however, so that while their lips speak, no other’s ears may hear what they say. For, “I suffer not a woman to speak in church.” Let the married woman imitate them: let her pray and her lips move but her voice not be heard. So shall Samuel come among us: your barren soul, that is to say, shall bring forth the salvation of “God who has heard your prayers.” For that is the meaning of “Samuel.” - "Catechetical Lectures, Procatechesis 14"
