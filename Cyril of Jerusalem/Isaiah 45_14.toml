Would you receive yet a third testimony to Christ’s godhead? Hear Isaiah saying, “Egypt has labored, and the merchandise of Ethiopia,” and soon after, “In you shall they make supplication, because God is in you, and there is no God except you. For you are God, and we knew it not, the God of Israel, the Savior.” You see that the Son is God, having in himself God the Father, saying almost the very same which he has said in the Gospels. … And again he has not said, “I and the Father am one” but “I and the Father are one,” that we should neither separate them nor make a confusion of Son-Father.
