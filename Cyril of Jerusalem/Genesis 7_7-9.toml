During the actual exorcism, while waiting for the others, let men be with men and women with women. For now I need Noah’s ark that I may have Noah and his sons together, separate from his wife and his sons’ wives. For although the ark was one and the door was closed, yet decorum was observed. So now, though the church doors are barred and you are all inside, let distinctions be kept: men with men, women with women. Let not the principle of salvation be made a pretext for spiritual license. Keeping close together is a good rule, provided that passion is kept at a distance.
