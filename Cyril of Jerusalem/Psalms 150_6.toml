But someone will say: if the divine nature is incomprehensible, then why do you discourse about these things? Well then, because I cannot drink up the whole stream, am I not even to take in proportion to my need? Or because I cannot take in all the sunlight owing to the constitution of my eyes, am I not even to gaze on what is sufficient for my wants? On entering a vast orchard, because I cannot eat all the fruit therein, would you have me go away completely hungry? I praise and glorify him who made us; for it is a divine command that says, “Let everything that has breath praise the Lord!” I am endeavoring now to glorify the Lord, not to describe him, though I know that I shall fall short of glorifying him worthily; still I consider it a godly work to try all the same. For the Lord Jesus encourages my weakness when he says, “No one has at any time seen God.”
