Do you want to have proof concerning the incomprehensibility of the divine nature? Try looking at the three children who praised the Lord in the fiery furnace, saying, “Blessed are you who behold the depths and sit over the cherubim.” Tell me the nature of the cherubim, and then look on him or the nature of him who sits over them! And yet, Ezekiel within the limits of possibility offered a description of them, saying, “Every one has four faces, the first of a man, the second one of lion, the third of an eagle and the last one of a year-old calf; every one has six wings and has eyes on every side; under each there is a spinning wheel of four sides.” But in spite of these descriptions that he made, we cannot succeed in constructing for ourselves an exact idea of what he was talking about. If we cannot understand what the throne is that the prophet has described, how will we succeed in comprehending the one who sits on the throne, when he is invisible and mysterious? It is impossible then to construct an idea of the divine nature; it is possible only to offer up praises for the works that it has made and that are before our eyes.
