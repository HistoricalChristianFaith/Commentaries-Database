Nothing is excluded from the dominion of God, for Scripture says of him, “All things serve you.” God, then, rules over all things, and in his forbearance he endures even murderers and robbers and fornicators, having determined a fixed time for requiting each, that they who, granted a long reprieve, remain impenitent may suffer the greater condemnation. There are kings … who reign on earth, yet not without power from on high. This, of old, Nebuchadnezzar knew from experience when he said, “his kingdom is an everlasting kingdom.”
