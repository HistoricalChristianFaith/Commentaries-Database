Antichrist will come at such a time as there shall not be left of the temple of the Jews “one stone upon another,” to quote the sentence pronounced by the Savior. For it is not until all the stones are overthrown, whether by the decay of age, or through being pulled down for building material or in consequence of this or that other happening, and I do not mean merely the stones of the outer walls, but the floor of the inner temple where the cherubim were, that Antichrist will come “with all signs and lying wonders” treating all the idols with disdain.
