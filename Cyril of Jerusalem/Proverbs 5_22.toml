Clothed as you are in the rotten garments of your offenses and “held fast in the meshes of your own sins,” listen to the prophet’s voice saying, “Wash yourselves clean! Put away the misdeeds of your souls from before my eyes,” that the angelic choir may chant over you: “Happy [are] they whose faults are taken away, whose sins are covered.”
