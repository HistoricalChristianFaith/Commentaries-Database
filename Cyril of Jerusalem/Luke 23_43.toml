quote='''
The tree brought ruin to Adam. It will bring you into paradise. Do not fear the Serpent. He will not throw you out, for he has fallen from heaven. I do not say to you, ‘This day you will depart,’ but ‘This day you will be with me.’ ” Take heart; you will not be thrown out. Do not fear the flaming sword, because it stands in awe of its Lord.
