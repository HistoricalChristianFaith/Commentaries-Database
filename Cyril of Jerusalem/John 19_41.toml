And since we have touched on things connected with paradise, I am truly astonished at the truth of the types. In Paradise was the fall, and in a garden was our salvation. From the tree came sin, and until the tree, sin lasted. In the evening, when the Lord walked in the garden, they hid themselves. And in the evening the robber is brought by the Lord into paradise.

A garden was the place of his burial, and a vine was what was planted there, as he said, “I am the vine.” He was planted therefore in the earth in order that the curse that came because of Adam might be rooted out. The earth was condemned to thorns and thistles; the true Vine sprang up out of the earth, that the saying might be fulfilled, “Truth sprang up out of the earth, and righteousness looked down from heaven.” And what will he that is buried in the garden say? “I have gathered my myrrh with my spices”; and again, “myrrh and aloes, with all chief spices.” Now these are the symbols of burial.
