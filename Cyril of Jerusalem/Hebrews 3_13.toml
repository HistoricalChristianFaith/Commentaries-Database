Take also another like expression. “To this day whenever Moses is read a veil lies over their minds.” Does “to this day” mean “up to the time that Paul wrote the words and no longer”? Does it not mean until this present day and indeed to the very end? And if Paul should say, “We are come all the way to you with the gospel of Christ, having hope, when your faith is increased, to preach the gospel in lands beyond you,” you can see clearly that the phrase “all the way” sets no limit but indicates what lies beyond. With what meaning, therefore, ought you to recall the words “till he has put all enemies”? Just the same as in another saying of Paul, “But exhort each other daily, as long as it is called ‘today,’ ” which clearly means for all time. For as we must not talk of a beginning of the days of Christ, so never suffer anyone to speak of an end of his kingdom. For Scripture says, “his kingdom is an everlasting kingdom.”

“Give us this day our superessential bread.” Ordinary bread is not “superessential,” but this holy bread is superessential in the sense of being ordained for the essence of the soul. Not of this bread is it said that it “passes into the stomach and is discharged into the drain.” No, it is absorbed into your whole system to the benefit of both soul and body. By “this day” he means “daily,” as in Paul’s “while it is called ‘today.’ ”
