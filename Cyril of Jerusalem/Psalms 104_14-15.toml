Having learned these things and been fully assured that what seems to be bread is not bread, though sensible to taste, but the body of Christ; and that what seems to be wine is not wine, though the taste will affirm that it is so, but the blood of Christ; and that of this David sang long ago, saying, “And bread strengthens a person’s heart, to make his face to shine with oil,” “strengthen you your heart,” by partaking of it as spiritual, and “make the face of your soul to shine.” And so having it unveiled with a pure conscience, may you “reflect as a mirror the glory of the Lord” and proceed from glory to glory, in Christ Jesus our Lord, to whom be honor and might and glory for ever and ever. Amen.
