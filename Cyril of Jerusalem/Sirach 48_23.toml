For Hezekiah, by now without hope, according to the words of the prophet who told him the judgment, his life was extended fifteen years. The sun, continuing on its way, he made to retreat. This was a sign. The sun went backwards for Hezekiah but was eclipsed for Christ. In both phenomena, the retreat and the eclipse, a sign was given, although with different meaning with respect to Hezekiah and to Jesus. If Hezekiah managed to have the divine judgment revoked, would Jesus not give the remission of sins? Be converted, therefore, and mourn over your sins, close the door and pray to obtain the forgiveness of sins6 and avoid the burning flames, since confession has the power to put out the fire itself, just as it has the strength to tame lions.
