The lesson also which was read today invites you to the true faith, by setting before you the way in which you also must please God. It affirms that “without faith it is impossible to please him.” For when will an individual resolve to serve God, unless he believes that “He is a giver of reward”? When will a young woman choose a virgin life, or a young man live soberly, if they don’t believe that for chastity there is “a crown that does not fade away”? Faith is an eye that enlightens every conscience and imparts understanding. The prophet says, “And if you do not believe, you shall not understand.” Faith “stops the mouths of lions,” as in Daniel’s case, for Scripture says concerning him, “Daniel was brought up out of the den, and he was found to be hurt in no way, because he believed in his God.” Is there anything more fearful than the devil? Yet even against him we have no other shield than faith, an impalpable buckler against an unseen foe. For he sends forth various arrows and “shoots down in the dark night” those that are not watching. However, since the enemy is unseen, we have faith as our strong armor, according to the saying of the apostle, “In all things taking the shield of faith with which you shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked one.” A fiery dart of desire to indulge one’s baser instincts is often shot from the devil’s bow. But faith, suggesting a picture of the judgment, cools down the mind and quenches the dart.
