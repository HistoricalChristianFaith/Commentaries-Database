Jonah fulfilled a type of our Savior when he prayed from the belly of the fish and said, “I cried for help from the midst of the netherworld.” He was in fact in the fish, yet he says that he is in the netherworld. In a later verse he manifestly prophesies in the person of Christ: “My head went down into the chasms of the mountains.” Yet he was still in the belly of the fish. What mountains encompass you? But I know, he says, that I am a type of him who is to be laid in the sepulcher hewn out of rock. While he was in the sea, Jonah says, “I went down into the earth,” for he typified Christ, who went down into the heart of the earth.
