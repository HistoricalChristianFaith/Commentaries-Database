For Paul has also shown us that there are these two comings, in his epistle to Titus where he says, “The grace of God our Savior has appeared unto all men, teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously and godly in this present world; looking for that blessed hope and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Savior Jesus Christ.” You note how he acknowledges with thanksgiving the first coming and that we look for a second.… So our Lord Jesus Christ comes from heaven and comes with glory at the last day to bring this world to its close.
