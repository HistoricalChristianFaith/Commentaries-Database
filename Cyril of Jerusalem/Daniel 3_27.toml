Recall what happened to Ananiah and his companions. From which sources did they make water flow or how many vessels of water did they use to extinguish the fire that rose up forty-nine cubits high? Even when the flame rose a little too high, faith was poured out there to extinguish the fire like a river when all confessed their sin, saying, “You are right, O Lord, in all this that you have made; yes, we have sinned in committing evil.” And their confession dissipated the flames. - "Catechetical Lectures 2.16"
