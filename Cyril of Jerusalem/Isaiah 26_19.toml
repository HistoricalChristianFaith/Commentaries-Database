Isaiah the prophet says, “The dead men shall rise again, and those who are in the tombs shall awake.” And the prophet Ezekiel, now before us, says most plainly, “Behold, I will open your graves and bring you up out of your graves.” And Daniel says, “Many of those who sleep in the dust of the earth shall arise, some to everlasting life and some to everlasting shame.”67And there are many Scriptures that testify of the resurrection of the dead. For there are many other sayings on this matter. But now, by way of remembrance only, we will make a passing mention of the raising of Lazarus on the fourth day and just allude, because of the shortness of the time, to the widow’s son also who was raised. And merely for the sake of reminding you, let me mention the ruler of the synagogue’s daughter, and the rending of the rocks, and how “there arose many bodies of the saints which slept,” their graves having been opened. But especially be it remembered that “Christ has been raised from the dead.”

Do not listen to those who say that this body is not raised up; for raised it is, as Isaiah witnesses, saying, “The dead shall arise, and they in the tombs shall be raised.” Or, as Daniel says, “Many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall arise, some to everlasting life and some to everlasting shame.” But while rising again is the common lot of all people, the manner of rising again is not alike for all. For while we all receive everlasting bodies, those bodies are not alike for all. That is to say, the righteous receive such bodies as may enable them to join with the band of angels throughout eternity, while sinners received bodies in which to undergo through the ages the torture of their sins.
