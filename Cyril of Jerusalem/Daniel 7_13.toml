He is called Christ, not for any unction from human hands but from the Father’s, as having been anointed for eternal high priesthood on behalf of humanity. He is called the dead, not as having gone to “join the majority,” like all souls in Hades, but as the one “free among the dead.” He is called Son of man, not as it is said of each one of us that we sprang from earth, but in the context of his “coming in the clouds of heaven” to judge both the living and the dead. He is called Lord, not in the catachrestic sense in which the title is given to people, but as possessing lordship by right of nature and forever. He is called Jesus because the name fits him, and he has that appellation in view of the saving medicine he brings. He is called Son, not meaning that God promoted him to that dignity but that he was naturally begotten as Son.
