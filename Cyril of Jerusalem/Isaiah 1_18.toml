[[commentary]]

The Father will be seated, having “his garment white as snow, and the hair of his head like the pure wool.” This is spoken anthropomorphically. And the spiritual sense? That he is the King of such as are not defiled with sins. For God says, “Your sins shall be as white as snow, and shall be as wool.” Wool is the emblem of forgiveness of sins, as also of innocence.
