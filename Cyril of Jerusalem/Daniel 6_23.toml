The lesson that was read today invites you to the true faith, by setting before you the way in which you also must please God. It affirms that “without faith it is impossible to please him.” For when will an individual resolve to serve God, unless he believes that “he is a giver of reward”? When will a young woman choose a virgin life, or a young man live soberly, if they do not believe that for chastity there is “a crown that does not fade away”? Faith is an eye that enlightens every conscience and imparts understanding. The prophet says, “And if you do not believe, you shall not understand.” Faith “stops the mouth of lions,” as in Daniel’s case, for Scripture says concerning him, “Daniel was brought up out of the den and was found to be hurt in no way, because he believed in his God.”
