Isaiah lived almost a thousand years ago and saw Zion in its primitive form. The city was still standing, beautified with public squares and clothed in honor; yet he says, “Zion shall be plowed like a field.” He was foretelling what has been fulfilled in our day. Observe the exactness of the prophecy; for he said, “Daughter Zion shall be left like a hut in a vineyard, like a shed in a cucumber patch.” Now the place is full of cucumber patches. Do you see how the Holy Spirit enlightens the saints? Therefore do not be distracted by a common term but hold fast to what is exactly true.
