Such a person not only cuts himself off from the rewards of his virtues but even lays himself open to being condemned to eternal punishment, because the good action, which ought to be performed in consideration of a merciful God, has been performed in order to gain praise. Take away the favors, take away people’s admiration, and you will find few who do something good either for the love of God, or barring that, for fear of God; yet no less is the blame with which we are tainted, because we place people before God and human glory before heavenly glory. This disease of pride is acute; it poisons from either side, and it wounds when least expected. For some boast of themselves because they are good, others because they are bad. Of the good who boast, it is said, “For God has scattered the bones of those who are pleased with themselves.” Of the evil who boast it is said, “For the wicked person is praised in the desires of his soul, and the worker of injustice shall be blessed.” There are also the words of the apostle: “Their god is the belly, their glory is in their shame.”
