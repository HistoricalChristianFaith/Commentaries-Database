The disease of pride is acute; it poisons from either side, and it wounds when least expected. For some boast of themselves because they are good, others because they are bad. Of the good who boast it is said, “For God has scattered the bones of those who are pleased with themselves.” Of the evil who boast it is said, “For the wicked person is praised in the desires of his soul, and the worker of injustice shall be blessed.”
