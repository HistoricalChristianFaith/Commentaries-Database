A brother asked an old man, “What shall I do for my sins?” He replied, “He who desires to be free from his sins shall be freed from them by weeping, and he who wishes to build virtues in himself will build them by weeping. Even the Scriptures are composed of mourning, for our fathers said to their disciples, ‘Wail.’ There is no other way to life except this.”A brother asked an old man, “What shall I do, father?” He replied, “When Abraham entered the Promised Land, he first bought a tomb for himself, and near the tomb he made sure of land for a possession.” The brother said to him, “What is a tomb?” He answered, “A place of mourning and weeping.”
