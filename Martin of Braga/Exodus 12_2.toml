Consequently our elders decided that one full month must be observed for the birthday of the world and that Easter should be observed in whatever part of it both the day and the moon coincided. This is not without scriptural authority, for Moses said, “This month shall stand at the head of your calendar, the first month of the year.” With these words he consecrated a whole month for the day of the world’s birth. Thus our elders, who had found that March  was the birthday of the world, defined April  as a limit in determining the first month. So it will be permitted to celebrate Easter neither before March  nor after April But when during this month both the moon and the day coincide, that is, the fourteenth day of the moon and Sunday, then Easter is to be celebrated. Now again, since the fourteenth day of the moon frequently does not fall on Sunday, they preferred to have the moon extended for seven days, provided they observed Sunday in the joy of the resurrection. So when the day falls thus, we always postpone Easter as far as the twentyfirst day of the moon for the sake of Sunday, so that Easter is celebrated neither before March  nor after April In this way it is found that the month and the day and the moon are retained in the observance of Easter.
