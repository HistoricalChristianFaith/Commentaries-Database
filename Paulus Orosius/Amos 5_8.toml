What, then, is your opinion about that section of the statement that follows, “He brings about rain upon the just and the unjust”? Surely he who gives, gives when he wishes and gives where he wishes, either by arranging the well- ordered nature or by lavishly bestowing his own munificence. And in case you contemplate also casting aside this statement, in keeping with the madness of your impiety, listen to the prophet testifying about this truth: “He who calls for the waters of the sea and pours them out upon the face of the earth. The Lord is his name.”
