We understand how devoted he was who, as he himself maintained, left his dead father so as to lay hold of the Lord of life. For he says, “First permit me to go and bury my father.” The one whom he had left behind as dead he begs that he might return and bury. Sorrow did not hold him nor death detain him, because he was hastening to life. He had not yet closed the eyes of the dead man, not yet buried the stiff limbs, but as soon as he learned that the Lord had come he forgot the feeling of paternal piety, believing that there was a greater piety in loving Christ more than one’s parents. Perhaps he had read the prophetic passage that says, “Forget your people and your father’s house.” So he forgot his father and remembered his Savior. Perhaps he had also heard the Lord’s Gospel words: “The one who loves his father or mother more is not worthy of me.” Thus, as Tobit is justified because he abandons his meal for the sake of a burial, this man is approved because he abandons the burial of his father for the sake of Christ. For the one is not afraid to pass over his meal because of some earthly work intervenes, while the other fears lest some delay cause him to omit the eating of heavenly bread. Thus, although in consideration of Christ we owe burial to everyone, this man forsook his father’s burial out of love for Christ. - "Sermons 41.2"
