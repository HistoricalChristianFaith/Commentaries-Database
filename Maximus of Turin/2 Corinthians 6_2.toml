The holy apostle presents testimony from the prophets when he says: “At an acceptable time I heard you, and on the day of salvation I helped you.” And this follows: “Behold, now is the acceptable time; behold, now is the day of salvation.” Hence I also testify to you that these are the days of redemption, that this is the time, as it were, of heavenly medicine, when we shall be able to heal every stain of our vices and all the wounds of our sins. We shall do so if we faithfully implore the physician of our souls and do not, as people scarcely worthy of the undertaking, despise his precepts. For a person wearied of his illness has found healing when he very carefully observes his doctor’s orders; but if he does one thing when another is ordered, then the transgressor and not the physician is guilty if the sickness is aggravated.
