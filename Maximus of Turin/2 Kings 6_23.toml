Thus, when the king of Syria wanted to capture holy Elisha the prophet and subject him to his power and had surrounded him with many warriors and troops, he was not terrified or disturbed but said to the servant who brought him the information: Do not fear, for there are more on our side than on theirs. O the faith of the holy prophet! He does not fear the adversaries whom he sees because he knows that angels are with Him in whom he believes; he is not afraid of earthly plots because he knows that heavenly auxiliaries are present to him. There are more on our side, he says, than on theirs. What a remarkable thing! There are more defenders from heaven merited by holiness than there are attackers on earth produced by wickedness. See the merit of blessedness! The prophet already speaks of a multitude while his servant is still uncertain of salvation. How much more do spiritual eyes discern than fleshly ones! The one perceives a throng of warriors, and the other catches sight of a sign of protection. How great is the divine mercy! A benefit is conferred upon human beings, and it is not seen; those in danger obtain help, and they do not know it. For this is the kindness of the Savior, that He should intervene for the sake of salvation and not let Himself be seen, that He should be sensed through His benefits and not be discerned through sight.
Hence he errs who thinks that when he has waged a war successfully, he has overcome by his own power. For he ought to know that adversaries are conquered more by merits than by strength and are overcome not so much by power as by holiness, just as holy Elisha overcame his foes not by arms but by prayer. For when he said to his servant, in order to drive out his fear, that there were more defenders present, but his fear could not be removed, then he prayed to the Lord and said: Lord, open his eyes that he may see! And his eyes were opened and he saw, and behold, there was a whole mountain full of horsemen, and so forth. The prayer of the prophet, then, opened his servantâ€™s eyes. It is not to be wondered at if prayer, which opened heaven for an army to come, opened his eyes so that he could see the army. It is not to be wondered at, I say, if he who promises new auxiliaries inserts new eyes. Or why would not he who furnished an army of angels produce an army of seers? Why, I say, would not he who penetrated the darkness of the clouds by his merits cleanse dullness of vision by his prayer? Necessarily, then, with this deed holy Elisha offered safety to his frightened servant, to whom he had already given clearness of vision. - "Sermon 83.2-3"
