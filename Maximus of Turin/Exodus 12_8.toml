Yet they were also completely ignorant of the commands of Moses himself, who ordered them specially to eat this bitterness when he established the paschal sacraments for them to observe and said, “You will eat it with bitterness, for it is the pasch of the Lord.” For he did not order, as they think, the consuming of the very bitter juices of insignificant herbs with the roasted flesh of a lamb. Rather, he commanded the fruitful devouring of the bitter words of Christ’s precepts with the sacrament of the Lord’s passion. For do not the words of the Lord seem to be bitter when he says: “If you wish to be perfect, leave all that you have and come, follow me?” And when he says that one is not to possess two tunics or a wallet or sandals, that bitterness of such words is a medicine for souls.
