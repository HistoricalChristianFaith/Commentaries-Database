Take note of the expression he used. He does not say “flourished,” but “flourished again,” for nothing flourishes again unless it had flourished previously. The Lord’s flesh flourished when he first came forth from the Virgin Mary’s undefiled womb, just as Isaiah says: “A shoot will come forth from the root of Jesse, and a flower will come up from his root.” It flourished again, when, after the flower of his body was cut down by the Jews, it sprouted forth from the tomb with the renewed glory of the resurrection. In the manner of a flower, it breathed forth at the same time a scent and the gleam of immortality on all people, circulating the scent of good works with its sweetness and demonstrating the incorruptibility of the eternal divinity with its gleam.
