Someone might say of last Sunday’s sermon, in which we preached that there was no less glory in Joseph’s grave receiving the Lord than in holy Mary’s womb begetting him, “What comparison can there be between the womb and the grave, since the one brought forth a son from its innermost bowels while the other only gave him a place of burial?” But I say that Joseph’s love was no less than Mary’s, since she conceived the Lord in her womb and he did so in his heart. She offered the secret place of her inmost members to the Savior; he did not deny him the secret place for his own body. She wrapped the Lord in swaddling clothes when he was born; he wrapped him in linen cloths when he died. She anointed his blessed body with oil; he honored it with spices. Each one’s service is similar and each one’s love is similar; hence each one’s reward must also be similar. But there is this difference: an angel called Mary to her service, but righteousness alone persuaded Joseph.

Let us see why they placed the Savior in someone else’s grave instead of his own. They placed him in another person’s grave because he died for the salvation of others. They did not impose death on him. He endured death for us. Death did not just happen to him, but it benefited us. Why should he, who did not have his own death in himself, have his own grave? Why should he, whose dwelling remained in heaven, have a burial place on earth? Why should he have a grave? For only three days, he did not so much lie as one dead in a tomb as rest as one sleeping in a bed. The brief period of time itself certainly indicates sleep rather than death. A tomb is the dwelling of death. Christ who is life did not need a dwelling for death, nor did he who is always living require a habitation of the deceased. We have correctly laid up this life in our own tomb so that as he gives life to our death, we may rise with him from the dead.

Let us see, then, what happens to the Lord’s body after they take it down from the cross. Joseph of Arimathea, a righteous man, as the Evangelist says, took it and buried it in his new tomb in which no one had ever been laid. Blessed is the body of the Lord Christ, which in birth comes forth from a virgin’s womb and in death is placed in the grave of a righteous man! Clearly this body is blessed. Virginity brought it out, and righteousness held it! Joseph’s grave held him incorrupt, just as Mary’s womb preserved him inviolate. In the one, a man’s impurity does not touch him; in the other, death’s corruption does not hurt him. In every way, holiness and virginity are bestowed on that blessed body. A new womb conceived him, and a new grave enclosed him. The womb is the Lord’s womb. It is virginal. The tomb is virginal. Should I not rather say that the tomb itself is a womb? There is, in fact, a great similarity. Just as the Lord came out from his mother’s womb living, so also he rose living from Joseph’s tomb. Just as he was born from the womb in order to preach, so also now he has been reborn from the tomb in order to evangelize. The last birth is more glorious than the first. The first conceived a mortal body, but the last brought out an immortal one. After the first birth, he descends to hell, but after the last birth, he returns to the heavens. The last birth is more religious than the first. The first kept the Lord of the whole world locked in the womb for nine months, but the last held him in the belly of the grave for only three days. The first offered hope to all rather slowly, but the last raised salvation for all quite quickly.
