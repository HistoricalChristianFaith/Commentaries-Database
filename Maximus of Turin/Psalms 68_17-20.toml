But what are we to make of the fact that an eagle often snatches away its prey and often takes the prey belonging to another? But not even in this respect is the Savior unlike the eagle. In a manner of speaking, he indeed took away the prey when he carried mankind to heaven, whom he bore after snatching them away from the jaws of hell; he brought to the heights the captive slave out of his captivity, whom he rescued from the lordship of another, that is, from the devil’s power, as it is written in the prophet, “When he ascended on high, he led captivity captive and gave gifts to mankind.” At any rate, this sentence is understood in this way, namely, that the Lord by rescuing mankind took captive for himself the captivity of mankind, whom the devil had taken captive for his benefit, and thus, just as he says, he took captivity itself captive and brought it to the heights of the heavens. Therefore, both captivities are designated by the one word, but they are not equal. For the captivity of the devil subjects one to slavery, but the captivity of Christ restores one to freedom.
