These garments are the prophecies and readings of the heavenly Scriptures by which the mystery of Christ the Lord was announced.… The Savior’s opponents, namely, the wicked heretics who daily lay their unholy hands upon him as the soldiers did, … divide these Scriptures for their own purpose and scatter the garments of the one body throughout the various members, and while they strip the Lord, they clothe him with their own teachings.
