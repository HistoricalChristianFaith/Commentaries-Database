People are in the habit of dancing or singing as the custom is with vows, particularly at marriages, and so we have marriages to which a vow is attached and at which we are expected to dance or sing. Our vows are celebrated when the church is united to Christ. John says, “The one who has the bride is the bridegroom.” It is good for us to dance because of this marriage, for David, both king and prophet, danced before the ark of the covenant “with much singing.” He broke into dancing in high rejoicing, for in the Spirit he foresaw Mary, born of his own line, brought into Christ’s chamber. He says, “And he, like a bridegroom, will come forth from his chamber.” He sang more than the other prophetic authors did because he was gladder than the rest of them. By these joys, he united those coming after him in marriage. By inviting us to his own vows in a more charming way than usual, having danced with such joy in front of the ark before his marriage, he taught us what we ought to do at those other vows. The prophet David danced.
