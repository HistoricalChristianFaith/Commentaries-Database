Then the people of Israel came to the twelve springs after Marah. We read in the prophet, “Bless the Lord from the springs of Israel.” It is the Christ, who is blessed in no other way than the mouths of the apostles and the teaching of the disciples. The apostles ought to be called “springs,” since they abound in the grace of preaching like purest springs and sprinkle the sweet cup of the sacrament from the abundant wisdom of their veins after the bitterness of the law. Nor is it astonishing if the drink of the springs is sweet, in whose midst the food of the palms is also sweeter. But as for the seventy palm trees planted next to the apostolic springs, I would say that they are those seventy disciples who for the sake of mankind’s salvation are directed by the Lord in a degree second only to the apostles. The evangelist Luke in his description of them asserts that they were appointed two by two. Like palm trees, they returned with exultation after healing people and boasted before the Lord that even the demons were subjected to them. Therefore, they are rightly compared to palms since they emerge as victors over the devil, adorned with the prize of the palms.
