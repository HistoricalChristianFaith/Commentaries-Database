Blessed, then, is almsgiving, which both renews the recipient and rejoices the giver, “for God loves a cheerful giver,” and for this reason it is better to give to him first. Joyful, therefore, and cheerful is the one who attends to the poor. Quite clearly he is joyful, because for a few small coins he acquires heavenly treasures for himself; on the contrary, the person who pays taxes is always sad and dejected. Rightly is he sad who is not drawn to payment by love but forced by fear. Christ’s debtor, then, is joyful, and Caesar’s sad, because love urges the one to payment, and punishment constrains the other; the one is invited by rewards, the other compelled by penalties.
