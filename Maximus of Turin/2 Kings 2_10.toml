Angels bring Elijah to heaven, then, and angels watch over Elisha on earth. What is there to wonder at if angels, who carried away the master, protected the disciple? And what is noteworthy in the fact that the deference that they showed to the father they also manifested to the son? For he is the spiritual son of Elijah; he is the inheritor of his holiness. Justifiably is Elisha called the spiritual son of Elijah because when he went up to heaven Elijah left a double spirit of his grace to him. For when Elisha was given the right to ask for whatever he wanted before Elijah would be taken from him, he asked that a double portion of Elijah might be in him. Then Elijah said, “What you have asked is hard, but so it shall be for you.” O precious inheritance in which the inheritor is left more than is possessed and the one who receives obtains more than the giver owned! Clearly this is a precious inheritance that is doubled by a kind of meritorious interest when it is transferred from father to son. Elijah, therefore, left a double portion to Elisha, although he himself had a single spirit of holiness. In a marvelous way, then, Elijah left more grace on earth than he carried with him to heaven. - "Sermon 84.2"

Angels carry Elijah to heaven while angels guard Elisha on earth. Why is it so amazing if the angels who carried the master were also guarding the disciple? And what is noteworthy if the allegiance which they displayed toward the father they also offer to the son? For Elisha is the spiritual son of Elijah and the heir of his holiness. Elisha is therefore rightly called the spiritual son of Elijah, for when Elijah was ascending to heaven he left behind for Elisha a double spirit of his grace. For when an opportunity was given to Elisha to ask for whatever he wanted before Elijah was taken from him, he asked that a double spirit of Elijah be in him. Then Elijah responded: “You have asked for something difficult, but it will be done for you.” O precious inheritance in which more is left to the heir than was actually possessed, and the ones who receives the inheritance receives more than the giver owned! This is certainly a precious inheritance, which is doubled by some interest derived from merits when it is transferred from the father to the son! So Elijah, although he had a single spirit of holiness, left a double portion to Elisha. In an amazing way, he left more grace on earth for Elisha than he took with himself to heaven.
