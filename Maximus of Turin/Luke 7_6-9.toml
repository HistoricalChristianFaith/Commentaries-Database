See how the devout centurion becomes worthier to receive health as he confesses that he is unworthy. In considering his dwelling unacceptable, he has made it the more honorable and acceptable.… The Lord does not go to his house, but the Lord’s healing goes. The Savior does not visit the sick man, but the Savior’s health visits him.
