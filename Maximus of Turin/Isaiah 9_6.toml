For this reason the apostles are told, “unless you change and become like this child.” He does not say “like these children” but “like this child.” He chooses one; he proposes one. Let us see, then, who he might be, who is proposed to the disciples to be imitated. I do not think that he is from the people, nor from the ordinary crowd, nor from the vast multitude—this one who was given, through the apostles, as an example of holiness to the entire world. I do not think, I say, that he is from the ordinary crowd but from heaven. For he is the child from heaven about whom the prophet Isaiah says, “A child is born to us, a son is given to us.” Clearly he is the child who, like an innocent, did not curse when he was cursed, did not strike back when he was struck, but rather in his very suffering prayed for his enemies, saying, “Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.” Thus simplicity, which nature has given to infants, the Lord augmented with the virtue of mercy.
