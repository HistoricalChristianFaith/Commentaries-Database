Christ is a dove because he commands his holy ones to be as doves when he says, “Be simple as doves.” But the prophet speaks of what Christ the dove is when, in his person, he describes his return to heaven after his suffering: “Who will give me wings like a dove, and I shall fly away and be at rest?” When Christ the Lord, therefore, initiated the sacraments of the church a dove came down from heaven. I understand the mystery, and I recognize the sacrament. For the very dove that once hastened to Noah’s ark in the flood now comes to Christ’s church in baptism.
