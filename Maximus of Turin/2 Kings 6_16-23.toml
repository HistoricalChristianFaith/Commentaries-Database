When the king of Syria wanted to capture the holy prophet Elisha and make him subject to his own authority and surrounded him with many divisions of armed men, Elisha was not terrified or distraught, but said to the servant who served as messenger: “Do not be afraid for there are more with us than there are with them.” O the faith of the holy prophet! He does not fear the enemies whom he sees, since he knows that there are angels with him whom he trusts. He does not dread earthly ambushes, because he knows that heavenly auxiliary troops are there for him. “There are more with us,” he says, “than there are with them.” This is an amazing thing. Holiness merits more defenders from heaven than the foes that immorality leads onto the field. “There are more with us than there are with them.” Behold the merit of blessedness! The prophet makes his announcement about the multitude while the servant is still uncertain of his own salvation. How much more do spiritual eyes perceive than those of the flesh! One sees the number of the armed men, while the other perceives the sign of their protection. How great is the divine mercy! A blessing is delivered to people, but it is not seen. They receive help while they are in danger, but they do not know it. For this is the mercy of the Savior, that he intervenes for salvation and in doing so he does not allow himself to be seen. He is sensed by the benefits that he bestows, but not with the eyes.So they are in error who think that when a battle is waged successfully, they have overcome through their own strength. For they should know that adversaries are conquered by merits rather than by strength, and they are overcome not so much by power as by holiness, as holy Elisha was overcoming his enemies by prayer and not by arms. For when he was telling his servant to banish his fear, that those defending them were more than those opposing them, not even then was the servant’s fear able to be dispelled. Then Elisha prayed to the Lord, saying: “Lord, open his eyes so that he can see!” And his eyes were opened and he saw, and there was a whole mountain filled with horsemen.” So the prophet’s prayer opened the servant’s eyes. It is no surprise that a prayer opened his eyes to see an army, since prayer opened heaven so that an army came. It is no surprise, I say, if the God who was promising new auxiliaries implanted new eyes. Or why could he not bring forth an army of seers who furnished an army of angels for battle? Why, I say, could not he, who through his merits penetrated the darkness of the clouds, have wiped away the dullness from the servant’s eyes? Certainly then holy Elisha granted safety by this act to the fearful servant to whom he had restored the brightness of sight.
