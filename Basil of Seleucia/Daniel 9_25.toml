Since there is much testimony from the writings of the Law and the Prophets concerning the coming of the Savior, so that the Jews cannot deny it, the more thoughtful among them admit that he will come but say that he has not yet come. We have deemed it fitting, therefore, to offer this proof from the discourse of the archangel Gabriel as he spoke precisely of the times to the prophet Daniel in the vision that came to him.… When the times were fulfilled in the days of Augustus, the foretold Christ came to his people, was crucified and fulfilled all the things written about him through the holy angels and prophets. Thus, even if they do not blush on hearing the testimony of the archangel, let them cease from their vain waiting for the Messiah. Since the prophet Daniel was one of those longing to see the coming of the Messiah, our Lord himself says about him and the others, “Many prophets and just people longed to see those things that you see, but they did not see them, and to hear those things that you hear but did not hear them.”
