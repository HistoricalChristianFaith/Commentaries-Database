“He has not treated the barren woman well,” that is, the woman who is without help because of her lack of children. And notice again how ill treatment is considered an act of impiety. “Keep away from evil,” the divine psalmist says, “and practice good.” “And he had no pity on a feeble woman,” that is, on a woman who needs help because of her feeble nature. “And in wrath he has overthrown the helpless.” In fact he did not overthrow the feeble and the helpless for any rational cause, but because of the impulse of his wild soul, while being inflamed with his wrath; and he reduced them to extreme poverty.
