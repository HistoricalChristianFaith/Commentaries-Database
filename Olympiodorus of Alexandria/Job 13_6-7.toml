“Consider now the words which I am about to say in order to correct you, and then judge whether I pronounce them thoughtfully.” “Do you not speak before the Lord and utter deceit before him?” “Do you not realize that God hears your speeches? How do you dare, while he hears you, say false words?” Consider also these words from that blameless and truthful man, how falsehood is able to blame everything, even when one appears to speak according to God. Therefore Job ponders with truth and frankness all the words that are spoken, so that God himself may approve him, as God is the truth. Falsehood, in fact, comes from the evil one, as the Savior says.
