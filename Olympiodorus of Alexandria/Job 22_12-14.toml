Eliphaz pronounces a serious accusation of impiety and madness against Job. “In fact,” he says, “you committed iniquities, as if [God] did not realize they were [committed] in the land of the Lord, but as if he judged in darkness. That is, as if, in judging, he did not see what happened in his land. You said, in fact, that since he is invisible and separates himself with clouds from what happens among us, and only goes around the circle of heaven, he does not deem it worthy to take care of earthly things.” This is what the pagan philosophers thought, when they said that God does not take care of what is under the moon.
