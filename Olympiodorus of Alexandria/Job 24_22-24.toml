“Therefore when he has risen, he will not feel secure of his own life.” For these reasons the impious, after rising every day not really believing that he will live, remains in fear and is frightened. As the wise Solomon stated, “Fear, indeed, is nothing other than the abandonment of the supports offered by reason.” “When he has fallen sick, let him not hope to recover, but let him perish by disease.” The diseases of the body, in fact, often occur because of sin. “Let him not hope,” that is, the lack of hope is due to the consciousness of his sins. “Let him perish” by disease, that is, by the blows of calamity. “For his exaltation has hurt many.”For this reason, “let him perish,” because his exaltation has hurt many. “But he has withered as mallows in the heat or as an ear of corn falling off of itself from the stalk.” Other examples [from the Greek Bible] read “like grass.” In a similar way, the psalmist also says, “Quick as the grass they wither, fading like the green in the field.” And he rightly says, “falling off of itself,” indeed, for everybody sin itself becomes a punisher.
