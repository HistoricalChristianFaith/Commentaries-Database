“My flesh is corrupt under my skin, and my teeth grip my bones.” “While I am alive,” Job says, “my flesh putrefies, and my bones are chewed by the teeth of some wild animal.” “Pity me, pity me, O friends, for it is the hand of the Lord that has touched me.” “You are not ashamed before the one who says righteous words. As benevolent persons, you have compassion upon me and take pity by considering also the respect due to what has been inflicted on me by God. You will not be tested by God through the same calamities.” “Why do you persecute me as also the Lord does, and are not satisfied with my flesh? Why do you add your wrath to divine wrath without doing this according to God’s will? Even though God punishes, he, nonetheless, wants to be good to us—and therefore, why do you insatiably use the harshness of your words against me?” In fact, abusive words are sufficient to devour flesh. So let us fear invectives and insults, because we are aware of the fact that they wound our brothers.
