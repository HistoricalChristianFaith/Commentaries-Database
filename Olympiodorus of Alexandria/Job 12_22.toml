“Revealing deep things out of darkness, and he has brought into light the shadow of death.” The literal meaning is, “He manifests the things which are hidden to all, and preserves those who are in danger and close to death.” He calls danger “the shadow of death,” because, as shadow is very close to the body that produces it, so danger is very close to the death that causes it. However, the profound meaning of this sentence appears to announce prophetically the advent of the Lord, who said to the prisoners, “Come out, and to those who are in the shadow, show yourselves,” “and appeared to those, who sit in darkness and in the shadow of death.”
