The real meaning is this, “Suppose I willingly submit the judgment of my actions to the eyes of the Lord.” What happens to me? God is invisible in his nature. Will I look for him in those material things that are before me? He cannot be seen. He is before me, but I do not perceive him. When he moves to the left, I cannot grasp him, and when he is on the right, I cannot see him at all. These words do not mean that God passes from one place to another bodily or by moving, but they intend to show that he is present everywhere and, nonetheless, escapes our perception and cannot be comprehended by us. “If I am no longer,” that is, “If I further extend my research, I will be out of myself and dizzy in reflection while I try to comprehend what is incomprehensible.”
