God “removed our sins from us,” but we are attracted to them, and for them we are punished. It says that he sends, because nothing happens without God’s consent. The “perverse nation” was first the Babylonians, then the Romans. This can also be understood as those who teach false knowledge, resorting to the deceptions of the sophists.
