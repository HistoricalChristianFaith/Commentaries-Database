Bildad says, “I suggest you pray to the Lord with all your devotion and diligence. Everything else should come after your prayers.” This is what “be early” means. And if you are true and empty of any deceit and falseness, God will give you back a condition of life and a status worthy of a righteous person. You will enjoy an abundance of goods as great as you possessed earlier. Notice how Bildad demonstrates in this part of his discourse of praise his belief that the happiness of the righteous is found in the material goods of worldly life.
