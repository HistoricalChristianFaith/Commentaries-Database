“For he has broken down the houses of many poor men, and he has plundered a dwelling, though he did not build it. His possessions provide no security.” He has broken down, that is, has shattered mercilessly [their houses], has carried off all their properties and has not given them back. In fact, he has not mended this situation, that is, has not returned what he has stolen. But, as he has carried off the properties of the poor and has not restored them, so his own possessions will not be saved either. “He shall not be saved by his desire. There is nothing remaining of his provisions; therefore his goods shall not flourish.” The impious, Zophar says, will not save himself through his desire, and then he will not have any provision left, because he does not possess anything that has been left to him by his absolute misery.
