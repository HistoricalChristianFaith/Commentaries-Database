“He stretches out the north wind upon nothing, and he upon nothing hangs the earth.” Indeed the support of the earth is nothing but an understructure, but it is suspended and is sustained by divine will. “Binding water in his clouds, and the cloud is not dispersed under it.” In fact, if he does not order the clouds to rain, they do not release rain on earth in the quantity that has been ordered by him. “He constrains the elements with his purposes hidden, stretching out his cloud upon them.” Heaven is often called “the throne of God” in holy Scripture. Air is placed before the face of heaven. Therefore, he says that God, by containing the air and expanding the clouds, does not allow them to release rain, if not in the measure that he knows to be convenient and useful.
