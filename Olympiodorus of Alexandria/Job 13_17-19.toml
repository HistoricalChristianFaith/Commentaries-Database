The Lord is near those, it is said, who invoke him, and therefore God is kindly disposed toward them. So listen, Job says, to what I am about to say: I will maintain my kindly disposed judgment upon God, who is just and speaks truthfully; and by trusting his truthfulness, I believe that I will appear to say words more righteous than yours. Or, in a different sense, “I am near my judgment,” that is, I am ready to suffer what God has decreed. Confiding in his truthfulness, I hope I will be seen to be righteous.
