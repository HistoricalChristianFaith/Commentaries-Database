He added the term “justice.” Because, however, he is the peace of sinners, as David says, for this reason the Lord adds, “My peace I leave you, my peace I give you.” In fact, the enemies’ attacks can no longer destroy the peace of justice or defeat the glory of piety. And moreover, because Christ is our peace, he is also our justice and our glory and is the model for our behavior according to justice, and by him we also have been called.
