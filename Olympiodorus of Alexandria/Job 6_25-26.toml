Job’s words mean … “It is likely you have suffered the same in many things.” Truth, however, is always hateful to many. Therefore, you despise my words of truth. “You do not come down to me,” Job says, “nor do you speak about the gifts of grace like people who desire to encourage. On the contrary, you accuse me openly, whereas I have never accused you. I hope, however, that after answering each of you, my words will defeat you.”
