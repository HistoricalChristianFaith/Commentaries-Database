He says this again to his friends with a bit of hesitation, If afflictions entirely derive from sins, why did he who observes all that happens on earth allow them to go without being visited by him? “And they took no notice,” that is, the iniquitous took no notice of the fact that they were not visited. Indeed it is believed and taught about divine visitation, “The Lord reproves the one he loves, as a father checks a well-loved son.”
