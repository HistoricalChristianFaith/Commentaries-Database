He calls her a widow because she was without the divine care, alone and desolate—clearly she who is now alone. Or, furthermore, the only one to have had the divine temple. Or the only one to have been encircled by the Assyrians but not conquered, because in fact “the Lord tried me harshly but did not give me over to death.” But above all it is the synagogue that deserves the name widow, which, having acted arrogantly toward Christ her spouse, has been abandoned. - "Fragments on Baruch 4.12"
