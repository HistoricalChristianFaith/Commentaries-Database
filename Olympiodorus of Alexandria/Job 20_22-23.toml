Perhaps not even his goods will flourish, but they will become corrupted while still in bloom. In fact, if he appears to be full and abundant in all goods, then every need and affliction will assault him, so that he fills his belly, that is, fills his soul with every pain. “Let God send upon him the fury of wrath; let him bring a torrent of pains upon him.” God, by striking him with the most severe punishment, will bury him in pains as under a snowstorm.
