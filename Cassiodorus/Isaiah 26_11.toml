A fire went before the Lord’s coming when the hearts of the unfaithful seethed at the preaching of the prophets so that they were fired with the heat of anger, and they debated the murder of those preachers. So this is the fire that shall go before him, but it devoured instead those who stirred it. As the prophet Isaiah said, “And now fire will devour your enemies.” Next comes, “And shall burn his enemies round about.” “Shall burn,” as we have stated, refers to the indignation and sudden mental heat that the enemies of the holy church experienced at that time. “Round about” we must interpret as “on all sides,” for as the preachers were few, a countless crowd of enemies hemmed them in.
