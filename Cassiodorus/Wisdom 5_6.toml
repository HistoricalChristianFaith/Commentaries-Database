"And he will remain with the sun, and before the moon, from age to age." This speaks of the honor of the Incarnation, who remains united to the Word. He in fact sits at the right hand of the Father, reigning forever in glory. By "sun" is certainly meant the Word of the Father, the Son of God, who is God made man. Christ is one, out of two: two distinct natures, each perfect. Indeed, of him the godless will say, "For us the sun has not risen, and the light of righteousness did not shine on us." Then, "And before the moon, from age to age," and by this must also be understood what was said earlier, "He will remain." Christ in fact remains before the moon, which is to say before the church, which perceives him at all times thanks to the lights of the heart. Rightly the moon can be compared with the church, which does not have a splendor of its own but in some way receives the light of the sun. Astronomers accurately explain this, among other things. - "Explanation of the Psalms 71.5"
