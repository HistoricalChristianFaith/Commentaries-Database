David, as we have said, took on the character of the Lord Savior, and so what was to take place at the Lord’s passion is now recounted of him. David was not to be effaced from the kingdom allotted to him, just as the inscription of the Lord’s title could not be changed. The psalmist added, “When he fled from Saul into the cave.” This incident seems to be very similar in the cases of both David and the Lord. Just as David in fleeing from Saul hid in a cave, so the Lord Savior’s divinity is known to have been hidden within the temple of his body from the unfaithful Jews. In this way the individual events concerning David and Christ are shared by them in this respect.
