The Lord Christ … entered the temple in Jerusalem free from all sin. For while others entered the house of God for purification, he alone entered in such a state that he might stand before the face of the Father without sin. He did not do this that the law might grant him something, but so that he, as the best legislator, might bestow something on the law by fulfilling it.

He testifies in the Gospel that he always spoke without deceit when he says “Everything that I have heard from my Father I have made known to you.” What could be more pure or simple than that the unchangeable truth, without corruption by any addition or omission, might come to human ears in the purest possible integrity. “Nor did he commit any wrong against his neighbor.” … [This virtue is] demonstrated in the life of the Lord: … Not only did Jesus hurt no one, he also endured all things patiently.
