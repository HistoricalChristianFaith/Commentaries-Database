"But the barbarians showed us no small courtesy," etc. Everyone being now on the shore, as terrible cold was upon them and they were weakened by long fasting, the barbarian inhabitants of the place supplied them with the provisions of courtesy. And when Paul had gathered together a bundle of sticks, and had put them on the fire, a viper that happened to be there bit and clung to his hand. As it hung on his flesh, the inhabitants of the place first thought he was a murderer who, after the danger of the sea, had, they imagined, finally met the outcome of vengeance. When he was seen, however, to be safe, they believed he was a god, as venom had done him no harm. Then, they were also courteously received by a certain Publius. His father suffered from fever and diarrhea, and Paul cured him by saying a prayer. As a result, there was a concourse of many people who lived on the same island, and people afflicted with various conditions were cured.
