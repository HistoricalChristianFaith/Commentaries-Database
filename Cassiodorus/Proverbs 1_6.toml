“He made darkness his cover, his pavilion around him: dark water in the clouds of the air.” … Remember that darkness is used also in a good sense, as in this passage from Solomon’s Proverbs: “He also understands a parable and a dark saying.” All divine matters that we do not know about are dark to us, that is, deep and obscure, though they bask in continuous light. A hiding place, namely, the secret place of his majesty, which he reveals to the just when it falls to them to gaze face to face upon the glory of his divinity. “His pavilion around him”: this expression is explained as the glorious worthiness of the blessed, that those who have persevered faithfully in his church dwell beside him. “Around him” indicates his nearness, for he encircles and penetrates all things, but he is not encircled by anyone, because he is not able to be hemmed in by any place.
