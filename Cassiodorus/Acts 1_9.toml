"And when he had said these things, while they looked on, he was raised up: and a cloud received him out of their sight," etc. Luke declares that, with those words which he said above, while the apostles looked on, the Lord suddenly ascended to heaven; and, lest anyone should think that such a miracle was a figment of imagination, he says that angels of God stood by them, saying: "Why do ye wonder at these things? He will so come for the Judgement as he was manifestly taken from the midst of you." Then Luke says that the apostles returned from Mount Olivet, where all this took place, to Jerusalem, and entered an upper room, where eleven men, whose names he gives, were staying together. They were persevering in their prayers with holy women, and Mary the Lord's mother and his brothers, so that he who was seen to have been taken up should not go away from them.
