God judges without getting upset, and he causes distress for others while maintaining his affection for them. He does not become enraged when some emotion rises within him against the wicked, but he withholds from them the influence of his grace. Since the blessed Godhead, which always remains the same, eternal and immovable, does not experience emotions, therefore the wrath of God refers to God’s retribution against sinners. But such a change of emotion is characteristic of human weakness so that someone becomes sad after being happy, irritated after being at peace, offended after being of good intentions. The phrase “then he will say” indicates the time when he will come to judge the world. Therefore the text speaks appropriately about wrath and rage since obstinate sinners will receive all that they deserve.
