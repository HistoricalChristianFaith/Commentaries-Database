“Who can understand his sins? Cleanse me from my hidden faults, O Lord.” See, the door of the third section opens, in which the prophet implores that all his sins would be washed away until the eloquence of his mouth would be rendered acceptable in the sight of the Lord. But because transgressions occur by means of human errors in three manners—thought, word and deed—he attests that that immense sea of sins, condensed in brevity, originates from two sources. The “hidden” sin is that which is called “original,” in which we are conceived, born and sin by a secret will, such as when we covet our neighbor’s property, when we desire to take vengeance on our enemies, when we want to be exalted above others, when we seek after tastier foods, and do things similar to these things. They sprout up and quietly seize us in such a way that they seem to be hidden to many until the deed is done. But if these things should be rendered visible to someone—as Solomon warns, “Do not go after your evil desires”20—we nonetheless ought to notice that there are many sins which we altogether do not know, of which we are able to understand neither their origins nor their manners of snatching us away. One must understand the phrase “Who understands all his sins?” from this perspective, because when he will go on to say in Psalm 51, “My sin is always before me” and elsewhere, “I have made my sin known to you,” how can it not be understood that whenever he sins he is compelled to confess? But if you add the word “all,” then this objection is shown to be obviated.
