"And sailing from Troas, we came with a straight course to Samothracia. "After sailing from Troas, Paul and Silas, walking through some cities, came to Philippi, "which is the chief city of part of Macedonia, a colony." There a certain woman, Lydia, a seller of purple, converted to Christ, and with her entire household obtained the grace of baptism. The apostles, at her request, stayed at her house for the night. On the next day, as they went to prayer, there came upon them a girl having a pythonical spirit, who brought much gain to her masters by selling divination to the people. While she importunately followed the apostles, Paul commanded the unclean spirit to go out from the girl who was under his control. Then her masters, for whom her madness was a source of profit, incited the magistrates and the people to mistreat Paul. They beat the apostles with rods and, handing them over to guards, bound them with prison bonds.
