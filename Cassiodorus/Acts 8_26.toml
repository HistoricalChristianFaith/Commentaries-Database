"Now an angel of the Lord spoke to Philip, saying," etc. An angel told Philip to go to the way where queen Candace's eunuch was about to pass. The eunuch, returning from Jerusalem, where he had come to adore on account of the devotion of his mind, was sitting in his chariot, reading the passage in the prophet Isaiah where he says: "He was led as a sheep to the slaughter; and as a lamb before his shearer, he did not open his mouth", etc. Then Philip said to him: "Thinkest thou that thou understandest what thou readest?" And the eunuch made him mount the chariot and reveal to him the secrets of the Scriptures. Having received these with a faithful mind, he caught sight of some water on the way and, kindled with fervor of mind, asked to be baptized on the spot. When that was done, the Holy Ghost fell upon the eunuch, and Philip, being suddenly transported, vanished; and he was found in Azotus spreading the word of the Lord with his habitual preaching.
