How splendidly joined to each other are the sections proceeding from the same source to achieve the salvation of the human race. Who would not be amazed that what is said earlier in different psalms is clearly assembled so harmoniously here? Similarly David himself in the Chronicles is filled with the holy Spirit and made the Lord’s praises resound with great expressions of joy by assembling sections of Psalms 95; 104 and 105, so that incense compounded of different aromas could happily rise to the Lord’s presence; for sentiments that are clear, in no sense at odds with each other are united without difficulty.… My judgment is that there is another apt feature in the present instance: the action of the Lord made one church out of the two peoples.
