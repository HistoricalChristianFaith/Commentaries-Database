“I will sing your mercy and judgment; to you, O Lord, will I play music.” A heavenly multitude of the blessed on earth brought forth the prelude, that it might in short order include all things. For the power of the Lord always either shows mercy or judgment. But neither mercy is found without his judgment nor his judgment found without his mercy, for both of them join themselves in mutual alliance. Nor does any deed of his appear that does not seem to be filled with all virtues. For just as he said “mercy and judment” here, in another place he says “justice and peace” instead of these two names, and again, “mercy and truth,” or “justice and judgment are the preparation of your seat,” so that everywhere he might show that God is affectionate and just. There is no doubt that this type of speaking can be added among those that are peculiar to the divine Scripture. For also at that glorious time of his coming he shows mercy in the first place when he says, “Come, blessed of my Father,” etc., but not without fairness because he has delivered the promises to the faithful. But afterwards judgment follows when he said to the ungodly, “Depart from me, you cursed, into eternal fire,” but he will nonetheless not say it without affection since he shows that he exacts vengeance after much patience. You see then that these two are both linked together to each other and shine once they have been set in their places. Therefore, let sinners, who wickedly despair of their salvation, listen to the merciful Lord; let the haughty, who do not think that their evil will be punished, understand the judge. Thus here all has been sung most comprehensively and fully, because in these two words all the works of the Lord and the edification of the entire church have manifestly been told.
