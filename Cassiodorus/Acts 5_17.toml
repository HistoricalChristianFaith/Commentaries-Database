"Then the high priest rising up, and all they that were with him," etc. Having learned of those events, the high priest and the rest of the heresy of the Sadducees were filled with great envy and, detaining the apostles, they threw them into the common prison, setting guards at the door. But an angel of the Lord opened the doors and led them out, telling them to teach the people in the temple in their usual manner. Unaware of this, the princes and priests sent ministers to the common prison on the following day. These found the prison carefully guarded, yet none of those whom they had thrown into it on the previous day were inside. They found out by others' report that the men whom they were looking for were in the temple preaching the wonderful works of the Lord to the people. Then the officer, going to the synagogue, brought them without any violence before the council, and they tried a second time to forbid them from their habitual preaching. Then Peter and the apostles, filled with confidence, persisted in proclaiming the word of the Lord. Greatly angered by this, they plotted to kill them; they plotted secretly, because the people were to be feared.
