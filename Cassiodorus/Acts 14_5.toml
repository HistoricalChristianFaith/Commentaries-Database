"And when there was an assault made by the Gentiles and the Jews with their rulers," etc. When the people in the uproar that had been stirred up in Iconium tried to kill Paul and Barnabas, they fled to Lystra and Derbe and other regions of Lycaonia, and all the people there were converted to the Christian religion. In Lystra lay a certain man impotent in his feet from his mother's womb, to whom Paul, looking upon him, enjoined with a loud voice in front of everyone, in the name of Jesus Christ: "Stand on thy feet a healthy man." When the crowd in Lycaonia saw this, thinking that they were not men, but gods, they hastened to offer them sacrifices of cattle in their ancestral manner. Then Barnabas and Paul, rending their clothes, affirmed in every way that they were mortals like them, but that it was the Lord Christ who performed those things by his power, he who made the heaven, and the earth, and all things that are contained within their circumference. Calmed by means of this speech, the people were scarce stopped from the sacrifice that they had intended.
