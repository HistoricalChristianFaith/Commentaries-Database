"And as they were speaking these words to the people," etc. The princes and the priests, and the rest of the high-ranking men among the Jews, seeing that about five thousand men had believed the apostles, decided to jail them, to prevent the whole crowd believing them. On the next day, they brought the apostles before the council and asked them by what power or by what name they had been able to perform such miracles. The apostle Peter, as usual, declared out loud that the miracle had been performed by the name of Christ, who is the "corner stone", as can be read in Psalm 117, whom the Jews thought should be crucified, but whom God raised from the dead. Then the council wondered at the confidence of the apostles, who they did not know were literate; and they knew, too, that they had been with Christ. Perturbed by the truth itself, they ordered them no more to preach in the name of Jesus Christ.
