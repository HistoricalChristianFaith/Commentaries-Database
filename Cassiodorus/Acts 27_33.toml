"And when it began to be light, Paul besought," etc. After fourteen days of storm, Paul besought them to take food, since it was clear that, of two hundred seventy-six men, not even a hair of their heads had been lost. To encourage others by his own example, he broke bread and himself began to eat. When it was day, catching sight of a certain creek, they made towards the nearby shores. The ship, however, was broken up by reefs and waves, and the decision was that everyone should swim out. It thus came to pass that, while the ship was lost, everyone quickly reached the wished-for land unhurt.
