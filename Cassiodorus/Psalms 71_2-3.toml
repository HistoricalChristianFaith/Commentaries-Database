“Deliver me in your righteousness and rescue me; incline your ear to me and deliver me.” When he says “in your righteousness,” he seeks divine mercy. In other words it pertains to his righteousness to spare a suppliant. For thus it pleased his righteousness to forgive a person who is known to condemn his own deeds. He says, “Deliver me from the pressing dangers; rescue me from the power of the devil,” so that he may not be condemned with him forever. When he says “incline,” he professes that he is humbly prostrate, because unless divine grace is inclined to freeing someone, he is not able to arrive by his own merits at that mercy which he desires. For it is not the merit of anyone that reaches God, but rather he himself is merciful and comes straightaway to sinners.
