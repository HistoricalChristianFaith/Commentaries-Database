"And on the next day, when Agrippa and Bernice were come with great pomp." On the next day, when Agrippa and Bernice had entered the city's hall of audience together with Festus and a numerous crowd, at Festus' commandment, Paul was brought into the middle, so that Festus might prove by Paul's testimony every detail of what he had told the king in private. Festus declared that Paul had been brought before Agrippa after his appeal so that the truth of the matter might be known and Paul might be sent to Caesar together with an explanation of the case.
