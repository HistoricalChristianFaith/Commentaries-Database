"And when he was come up to Jerusalem, they that were of the circumcision contended with him." When Peter was come up to Jerusalem, faithful Jews contended with him as to why he had gone in to men uncircumcised and had eaten with them. But he related truthfully by what vision he had been warned and what injunction he had received from the Divinity. Having heard that, all the people gave thanks to God because the Lord Christ had granted life-giving repentance and the gifts of the Holy Ghost to the Gentiles too.
