"Now hearing these things, they were cut to the heart, and they gnashed with their teeth. "The unbelieving, unable to tolerate Stephen's preaching, were hastening unanimously to effect his death. Stephen, raising his eyes to heaven, saw the Son standing on the right hand of the Father. When he said this in pure truth, the crowd of madmen ran violently upon him and, having cast him out of the city, pelted him with stones. But Stephen, dying, prayed for them that this crime might not weigh down his persecutors. Paul too consented to his death, and he raised a great persecution against the church established in Jerusalem; for, after Stephen's body was buried with pious lamentation, this Paul made a havoc of the church with a hatred as great as the affection with which he would later defend it. Meanwhile Philip the deacon, another one of the seven, going down to the city of Samaria, earnestly preached the word of the Lord and performed by the power of Christ many miracles on the people who desired it, and the city was filled with great joy as a result.
