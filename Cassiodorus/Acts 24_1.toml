"And after five days the high priest Ananias came down," etc. After five days, the Jews came to the judge Felix against Paul, with the orator Tertullus [â€¦] Then, the parties having been presented, the orator Tertullus, overconfident in human eloquence, began maliciously to attack Paul: the latter, he said, wanted to cause disorder among peaceful Jews around the world with new preachings. They had arrested him and wanted immediately to punish that great crime according to their law; but Lysias the tribune, as they all knew, had taken him away and sent him to be judged by Felix. The rest of the Jews testified in a dreadful-sounding voice that the things just said were so.
