In the holy Scripture Christ is often called a child because of his innocence of mind. As Isaiah says, “For a child has been born to us, and a son has been given to us.” - "Exposition of the Psalms 85.16"

We often find the Lord Christ described as a child because of the purity of his innocence. The simplicity of youth bestows on a child the blessing of aversion from vices and from the malice of the world. As Christ himself attested, “Of such is the kingdom of heaven.” “Child” is used in the text: “Behold my child whom I have chosen, my beloved in which my soul delights,” and in another passage: “A child is born to us, and a son bestowed on us.” - "Exposition of the Psalms 68.18"
