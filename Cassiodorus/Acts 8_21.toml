We must, I think, investigate the fact that often in the divine Scriptures heart stands for understanding.… It may be clear to all without doubting that the source of our thoughts is there, and that good and evil are drawn from there. The seat of thought is that tiny part of the body with the appearance of fire, so that it is rightly placed in the position from which good counsel can come to us.
