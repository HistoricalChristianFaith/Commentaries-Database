In these words, a very glorious and orthodox statement seems to shine upon us, that no one attains to God’s grace by his own merits. For in speaking of God’s mercies “which are from the beginning of the world,” the church continuously praises the Lord as the dispenser of mercies who does not receive human good works as an earlier step, but first grants his own gifts. Certainly all heresies have been devised by a detestable notion. On this basis, we are given insight into how destructive the Pelagian evil is, because it is recognized how persistently it is refuted.
