"But Peter seeing, made answer to the people," etc. The apostle Peter, seeing religious zeal roused among the people, said that they ought not to look upon him himself for such actions, but they ought to glorify the Lord Christ, whom they had decided to crucify. Blaming them for all the other things they did in the Lord's passion, he said that the Lord was the one who had enabled things that clearly exceeded human power. He urged them to convert to the Lord before the time of Judgement in order to gain forgiveness for their error, for the Lord must be obeyed in all things, as Peter proved with Moses's testimony: it was promised that from Abraham's seed would come the Lord, who would be able to save every man from his own wickedness.
