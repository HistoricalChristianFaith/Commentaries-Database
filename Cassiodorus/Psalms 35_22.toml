What a wonderful patience there was in him who was the greatest Majesty! Was he unable to descend alive from â€¦ the cross to put his enemies to shame, if after dying he rose from the tomb on the third day? But it was not suitable for the divine power to be moved by the words of those hurling insults, so that consequently they might blush even more when all the predictions were confirmed.
