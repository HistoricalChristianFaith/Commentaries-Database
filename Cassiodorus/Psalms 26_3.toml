He was not able to forget his mercy, for he is constantly aware that he is the recipient of help; the kindness that has been delivered to him always stands before his eyes.… “In your truth” stands for “In your Christ,” for he is the one who says, “I am the way, the truth and the life.” For he is not able to be pleasing to the Father, unless he has been strengthened by such faith.
