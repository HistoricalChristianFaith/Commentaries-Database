After explaining the grace toward the just, he now turns his attention to the punishment of the wicked.… Understand that he sees both groups, but his gaze results in a different outcome for each group; he looks at the just to hear them, but looks upon sinners to destroy them. When he says “from the earth,” he means the future homeland, which only those who have pleased God will possess. The “remembrance” of the sinners will perish, because there will not be any recollection of them among the just.… Those who leave the Lord’s memory surely go on to eternal punishments.
