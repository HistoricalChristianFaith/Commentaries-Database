"And Agrippa said to Festus." Then Agrippa said to Festus: "This man might have been set at liberty, if he had not appealed to Caesar." Then Paul was delivered to centurion Julius with the guards, to sail to Italy. Going on board, they came to Sidon on the second day, where the centurion, treating Paul kindly, permitted him to go to his friends. From there they came to Cyprus, from there to Lystra; from there, having been moved over into a ship of Alexandria, they sailed past Crete to Salmone, and then reached Good-havens after some time. There, with the sailing season being now over, Paul told his companions it would be better if they could winter in that place to avoid being shipwrecked. The centurion, improvidently disagreeing with him, hastened towards the harbor of Phenice, which was more safely situated.
