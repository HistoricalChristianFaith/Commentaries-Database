“Nonetheless, God shattered the heads of his enemies and of those who walk in their sins through a head of hair.” Lest the evils of the obstinate be thought to be unpunished, he says, “Nonetheless God shattered the heads of his enemies,” so that you would recognizes that punishment also comes upon the treacherous and obstinate. The “heads of the enemies” are indeed the authors of the Jewish rebellion, but also without doubt the teachers of the heretics. For the former persecuted Christ in the flesh, but the latter rage furiously against the very deity (if one can even mention such a blasphemous thing!). Next follows the phrase “of those who walk through a head of hair,” that is, who seek such minutia of pretenses so that they seem to be able to walk through the very heads of hair and scrutinize them thoroughly. This refers to the cunning of empty questions, which abandon matters that would be useful and seek after unnecessary matters in their abominable arguing. And in order to attest to their studies as idle, he adds “in their sins,” because their thinking was foolish, which led them to their faults. Examples are the Manicheans, the Priscilians, the Donatists, the Montanists14 and others who mix themselves with the stenches of their filthy teaching.
