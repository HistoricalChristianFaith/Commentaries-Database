The holy man demands judgment because he is certain of the Lord’s mercy. As Paul has it: “As to the rest, there is laid up for me a crown of justice, which the Lord, the just Judge, will render to me in that day.” He walks in his innocence because … he puts his trust in the Lord. The presumption he shows is not in his own powers but in God’s generosity.
