He adds, “His name is holy and to be feared.” “Holy” pertains to the incarnation, as he himself says, “Guard my soul because I am holy.” “To be feared” pertains to the omnipotence of his divine nature on high, just as is said in another psalm, “You are to be feared, and who can oppose you?” These two phrases pertain to this purpose so that we may call upon him as our advocate and fear him as our judge. Both of those things have been skillfully joined so that love alone may not render us negligent or fear alone may not make us only devoid of hope.
