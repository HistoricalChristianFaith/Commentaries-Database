There are two types of sinners. One type believes the law, but is not strong enough to fulfill its commands because of the weakness of its flesh.â€¦ The other type is brash, beyond hope, blasphemous, for it makes plans for itself to commit sin by its free will. This type of sinner despises all things and it grumbles to itself, confident in the notion that God does not trouble himself with the affairs of mortals.
