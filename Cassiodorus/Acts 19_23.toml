"Now at that time there had arisen no small disturbance about the way of the Lord," etc. An uproar about the Christian religion arose likewise in Ephesus. There was a certain Demetrius who made silver shrines in Diana's temple. He used to bring no small wages to the craftsmen. This man, seeing that the observance of rites risked complete extinction because of Paul's preachings, he violently stirred up the above-mentioned craftsmen against the apostles and his disciples. Having caught Gaius and Aristarchus, Paul's companions, they dragged them from the theatre, where they were preaching the word of the Lord, to the judges, to be heard by them. When Paul would have entered to the people, his disciples and friends did not let him (for there was great confusion throughout the city), for fear that all the people's rage would turn on him, whom they knew to be the initiator of the preaching that was detrimental to them.
