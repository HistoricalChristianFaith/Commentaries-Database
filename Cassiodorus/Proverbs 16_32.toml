That anger is less offensive which does not lead to indignant actions. In the words of Scripture, “He that conquers his anger is better than he who takes a city.” So the injunction to control anger is extended, so that if we are already angry we do not sin through impulsive rashness. Because of human frailty we cannot govern our hot emotions, but with the help of God’s grace we contain them with the discipline of reason.
