That anger is less offensive which does not lead to indignant actions. In the words of Scripture, “He that conquers his anger is better than he who takes a city.” So the injunction to control anger is extended, so that if we are already angry we do not sin through impulsive rashness. Because of human frailty we cannot govern our hot emotions, but with the help of God’s grace we contain them with the discipline of reason.

The type of anger which does not lead to deeds motivated by anger is easily forgiven, as Scripture says: “He that conquers his anger is better than he who captures a city.” For this reason, the command to manage anger is given so that, if we are already angry, we may not sin through an act of indiscreet rashness. Because of our human brokenness we are not able to get complete control of our hot emotions, but with God’s help, we contain them by the power of reason that we are taught.
