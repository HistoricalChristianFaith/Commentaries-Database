The petition for judgment does indeed appear to be dangerous, but a separation from evil people is recognized to be an appropriate request from one who is well deserving. Therefore this request does not arise from the detestable pride in merits, but it is the just petition of a faithful servant, asking to be separated from the most vile in order not to have a portion with wicked people. A holy person asks for judgments to be made because of certainty in God’s mercy, as the Apostle says: “As to the rest, a crown of righteousness has been set aside for me, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will grant to me on that day.” The psalmist walks in innocence because he puts his hope in the Lord, as he says later; nor does he find confidence in his own powers, but in God’s generosity. A fitting proof of this matter follows, for he maintains that he has not been weakened in his trust in the Lord. This is the “innocence” which he spoke about earlier, namely, his confidence in God’s power that no weakness of sin is able to weigh him down.
