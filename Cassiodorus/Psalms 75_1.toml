“We will confess to you, O God; we will confess to you and call upon your name; I will tell all your miracles.” In this one verse the rule of holy devotion is explained in an orderly manner, for that Jewish people which would believe in Christ the Lord, whom the title admonishes, “Do not destroy forever,” breaks forth in voice and promises most devoutedly its confession. To confess (as we have often said) is to profess something in a conversation with many people. For even if one person is said to confess, he or she is understood to be allied with others who have already preceded in the faith or who will follow them. Next is the phrase, “We will confess to you.” The repetition itself attests to the solidity of the promise, which is never put forth in a transitory manner, but rather only when the firmness of the mind is being indicated, as in such phrases as “My heart is prepared, O God, my heart is prepared” and phrases similar to them. The word “to you” was said so that the worship of other gods might be denied because it is the true devotion that rightly reveres the Creator alone. And let us look carefully at the fact that to confess even once to an earthly judge often produces death, but frequent confession to God does not produce any danger, but salvation. The words are arranged in a beautiful order. He first says that he confesses, that is, he mourns his sins; afterwards he says that he calls upon the name of the Lord. For it is appropriate that we first purge our hearts by confession and in this way ought to call upon the name of the Lord to receive help. For to whom will he come other than to those whom he recognizes to be his own? But if he will call on him without feeling, he will appear to be demanding judgment upon himself, not forgiveness. Therefore, such things ought to be be stated in advance so that we may be able to call upon divine mercy with confidence.
