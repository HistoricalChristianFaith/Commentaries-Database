Those who trust in human honors have been snared by their own perverse desires and have fallen into the pit of death.

A Christian is said to rise in two senses; first, when he is freed by grace from the death of vices in this life and he continues in God’s grace of justification.… Second, there is also the general resurrection at which the just will receive their eternal rewards. In this passage it is clear that both senses of resurrection are appropriate. For this reason, when he adds “we have been raised,” it is because in any sort of resurrection the faithful arise from their humble status and are elevated to divine rewards.
