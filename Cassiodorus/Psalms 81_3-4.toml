“Sound the trumpet at the beginning of the month, on the day of your notable solemnity.” We must also consider that we are commanded through the instruments of the musical discipline both to play the lyre for the Lord and to observe the day of solemnity, so that every action of ours may be directed to the Lord and offered to his ears in most pleasant music, just as musical instruments are directed towards a sweet-sounding melody and coalesce smoothly into one harmony. For there is great power and delightful knowledge in that discipline, which the teachers of secular literature (as God graciously granted them to know, since he bestows everything that is useful) made able to be discerned through their theoretical writings, namely those things which in the nature of matter were previously held in secret. Therefore, the first division of this discipline is harmony, rhythm and meter. The second is a division of instruments into percussion, stringed instruments and blown instruments. The third is divided into six harmonies. The fourth is divided into fifteen tones. Thus, the power of all that most beautiful discipline is explained by such distinctions of ancient teachers; we read in the secular books that many miracles have occurred through these means. But—to omit the legendary tales of secular literature—we read that David drove a demon from Saul by his melodious harp and the divine Scripture attests that the walls of Jericho fell straightaway by the sounding of the horns, so that there can be no doubt that musical sounds often accomplish great and powerful deeds, at least if the Lord orders and permits them.
