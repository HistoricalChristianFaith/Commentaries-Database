"And Saul, as yet breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord," etc. Paul, still meaning harm to the Lord's faithful, asked the high priest for letters, so that, if he found any preachers of Christ, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem. This proved without a doubt rather to be his own release from bonds, for just as he was on his journey the Lord said to him: "Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?" Trembling at these words, he fell on his face and, having become blind, he entered Damascus led by others' hands. There was in that city the disciple Ananias, who was told to go to Paul and give him back his sight by the imposition of his hand. Ananias, however, remembering the past, replied to the Lord that Paul was a persecutor of the Church, so much so that, having recently received from the chiefs the authority to do so, he bound the Lord's faithful in chains; but the divine mercy replied to Ananias that he whom he knew to have previously been filled with criminal iniquity had been made into a vessel of election.
