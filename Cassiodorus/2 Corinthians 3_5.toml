Since the Lord’s call comes before all merit, and he does not find a thing deserving but makes it so, for that reason it is called gratuitous; otherwise it would be called just. So this is the good will which summons and draws us. We can think or perform nothing which benefits us without our obtaining it from the Author of goodness. As Paul says, “For we cannot think anything of ourselves, as of ourselves, but our sufficiency is from God.” So let the Pelagians’ madness fall silent, lest in seeking falsely to ascribe some goodness to itself the will is instead deprived of him who bestows it.
