We read in the Song of Songs of the church which bears the image of the Lord Savior, “I am black and beautiful,” that is, black physically and beautiful in heavenly merits. He demonstrates why he used the word beautiful: as Christ put it, the world was reconciled to God through grace. - "Exposition of the Psalms 44.3"
