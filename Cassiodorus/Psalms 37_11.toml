He says the meek will possess the Jerusalem to come, a city about which much has already been said; it is a city constantly filled with the sweetness of good things where its inhabitants do not earn their living through trade, but feed on delight in God. There no one works to live, but in quietness receives all that the blessed soul desires. There the eye of the heart is fattened by a blessed hunger. There the soul is restored by sight alone, since whatever pertains to its desire is granted to it in the contemplation of the Lord’s face.
