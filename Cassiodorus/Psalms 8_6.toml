“You have placed all things under his feet.” … Just as nothing is independent of the work of the Lord, so nothing can be shown to be outside the power of Christ, since he is going to judge the world. For by saying “all things,” the psalm seems to have omitted neither earthly nor heavenly things. This interpretation is in harmony with what the divine interpreter, the Apostle testifies: “In subjecting all things to him, he left nothing that is not subject to him.”
