"And they were persevering in the doctrine of the apostles," etc. As those who had converted continued devoutly in the doctrine that they had embraced, and as the apostles frequently performed great miracles, the fear of the Lord and the number of the faithful people increased daily. There was great concord among the believers, such that everyone would sell their own possessions and a brother would unfailingly be provided with whatever he stood in need of. Great also was their devotion to meeting in the temple. They would, too, take their food in simplicity of heart and with thanksgiving. That is why the Lord, favorably inclined towards them, always increased their number. Once, when Peter and John went up to the temple for prayer, they took the hand of a man who had been lame from his mother's womb and made him walk with firm steps. The people, seeing this, were filled with inexpressible wonder, and their eagerness to see more grew greater and greater, with vehement devotion.
