After the previous psalms (as has been said), in which the prophet ascended by divine mercy to the peak of all virtues, he addresses those who stand in the house of the Lord so that after all God’s immense acts of kindness have been conferred, the heavens and the earth would not cease to praise their Creator. And see with what distinction those commandments have grown in these two verses. First he said, “Praise the name of the Lord.” And lest you should think that this was commanded to any and all, he added, “Praise the Lord, you servants,” that is, “You who are his servants, devoted with eager will, and sense that you have a Lord whom you do not despise by any superstition.” Third, he says, “You who stand in the house of the Lord,” that is, “You who stand in holy belief in him with a persevering and unvacillating will.” This is said against those who have suffered a downfall and fallen suddenly from the honor conferred upon them. Next are the words, “In the halls of the house of our God.” The first entrance of a rather large home is called the hall. There those who live there have been known to make hearths for themselves to drive out the cold. And from the very murky billows of black smoke, these places were called halls (atria) on the grounds that they are pitch black (atra), as antiquity has passed down to us. And because no statement stands empty, which does not seem to contain some mystery, he also says that even those who seem to enter the first portion of the Lord’s house ought to praise the Lord.
