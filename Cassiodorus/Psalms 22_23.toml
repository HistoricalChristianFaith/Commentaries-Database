Once the Lordâ€™s passion has been related a little more extensively, he moves on to the third section in order that their hearts may not be distraught by a lingering sadness. In this part, he addresses the faithful, so that they may praise him, recognizing his ordering of events, and in order that they may gather together to celebrate the proclamation of him with universal rejoicing. For through his suffering has come the salvation of the faithful and the life of the just. Now let us consider what a sweet emotion is demonstrated in the fear of the Lord. For human fear does not engender praise, but rather blame. But the fear of God, because it is just and right, produces praise, imparts love and kindles the warmth of love.
