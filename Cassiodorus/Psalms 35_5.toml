Dust is indeed an earthy yet very dry and thin substance, which cannot remain in its place when the wind blows, but is lifted into the flowing breezes. So also the desires of sinners, when they have been admonished by the inspiration of the truth, are lifted by the Lord’s help from their earthly vices and brought to the heavenly virtues. So here the desire is expressed for evil people to come to heavenly life through a blessed improvement.… This angel afflicts the converted in order that they may be brought into that blessed homeland by the gift of humility. Such affliction is a kindness, since the desire is expressed that it may present itself as a great gift.
