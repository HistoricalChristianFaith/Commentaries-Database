"And when the Jews of Thessalonica had knowledge that the word of God was also preached at Berea." When the Thessalonian Jews had knowledge that the apostles were preaching about Christ in Berea, they came there and stirred up the people with constant uproar, saying that they should beware of those men who threw the world into confusion with new preaching. Then the brethren saw fit to send Paul over to Athens, while keeping Silas and Timothy there for a time. Coming to Athens, Paul disputed vigorously in every single place, seeing the city wholly given to idolatry. As the news spread, some citizens seized him and brought him to the Areopagus, where a gathering of philosophers was assembled. Some called him a word sower, others a preacher of new gods. Then the wise, having set Paul in the middle, desired to hear the doctrine that he was spreading far and wide.
