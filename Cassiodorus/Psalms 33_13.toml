quote='''
A person does not look to the Lord, but the Lord looks to a person … for when it says “and he looks upon,” it indicates the graces of the One who shows compassion, for we say that we look upon those to whom we claim that something has been bestowed. Consider that he does not say that sins were looked upon, but people. When he looks upon sins, he punishes, but when he focuses his attention on a person, then he pardons.
