The anger of the Lord is spoken of in two senses. First, when the Lord punishes in order to save, as in the following verse: “For he scourges every son whom he accepts.” Second, when he sends to eternal fire about which another psalm speaks: “O Lord, do not rebuke me in your anger, nor reproach me in your wrath.” An improper meaning is surely drawn from the realm of human experiences. For when we punish some guilt, we go astray by getting upset at the deeds. But God executes judgment while in a state of tranquility, for he is unacquainted with the confusing experiences of emotion.
