For it is the function of the blood of the Lord that as it makes drunk it heals the mind, shielding it from fancies, not leading it toward sins. This wine makes them sober; this fullness empties them of evils. One who does not become full with this cup will be rendered hungry with an eternal lack … Anyhow, when God bestows such things, he does so that they may draw them to the kingdom of heaven. And about this cup it is said in the Gospel, “Whoever drinks from the water that I give will never thirst and will become in them a source of water springing up for eternal life.”
