"And when there arose a great dissension, the tribune fearing lest Paul should be pulled in pieces. "When a great dissension arose between Pharisees and Sadducees, the tribune, fearing lest Paul should be pulled in pieces by the Sadducees, ordered him to be taken back to the castle. In the night, the Lord said to Paul: "Be constant, Paul; for as thou hast testified of me here, so must thou preach my name also in the city of Rome." On the following day, forty Jews made a conspiracy and resolved to kill Paul. Paul's sister's son heard of it and told Paul in the castle. Paul asked the guards to bring the young man to the tribune. When the young man had told the tribune everything in order, the tribune commanded him to let no one know it had been told to him.
