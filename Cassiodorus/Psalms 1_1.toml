[[commentary]]
quote='''
It is important to pay close attention to the order of the text, especially how all of it is directed against Adam. He departed when he abandoned the Lordâ€™s commandment; he stood when he delighted in sin, that is, when he erroneously estimated that he would acquire the knowledge of good and evil. But he sat on the chair of pestilence when he left to his descendants the precedents of a dangerous teaching.
