“They will become inebriated,” an expression that usually describes the corrupt habit of people who become inundated with too much wine and become sluggish by this affliction of their mind, is here directed to the situation of good people. So this heavenly inebriation blocks the remembrance of worldly matters and causes fleshly things to depart from the mind, just like the intoxication of wine separates our actions from our senses.… What an incredibly praiseworthy inebriation! This intoxication we must pursue in all our prayers as the source of moderation and for the soundness of mind that is acquired through it. This inebriation does not produce tipsiness, confusion, delirium or blackouts. But the healthier the soul becomes, the more it is filled with drunkenness. So let us consume this drink eagerly, not with our physical lips, but with the purest disposition of the heart. From this drink one does not receive temporal happiness, but rather the joys of eternal life.
