“For the Lord will judge his people, and he will [give] comfort among his servants.” The reason for the previous praise is stated: “For the Lord will judge his people,” that is, the Jewish people, to whom he revealed great miracles and assigned his prophets so that the people would not sin. He also sent to them his own Son, so that their accursed hardness could finally be melted. But because they persisted with accursed obstinacy, he will certainly judge them, because they were unwilling to be his, though he had chosen them from all nations as his possession. To them he says, “Hear, O people, and I will speak,” and elsewhere, “My people, what have I done to you?” So he will judge them. But hear what follows as it concerns the faithful: “He will again have compassion upon us.” He means when he will render their promised rewards to those on earth afflicted with harsh contempt on account of his name. Scripture says of them, “Blessed are they that mourn, for they shall be comforted,” and in another place are the words “He that believes in me is not judged but will pass from death to life. But he that does not believe is already judged.”
