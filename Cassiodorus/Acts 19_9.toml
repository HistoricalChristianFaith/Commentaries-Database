"But when some were hardened, and believed not," etc. When some of the Ephesians, stubborn-willed, believed not, he separated his disciples from them and discussed daily in Tyrannus's school for two years, performing many miracles, so that his handkerchiefs were laid on sick people and they were restored to their former health. There were, however, seven deceitful brothers, the sons of the chief of the synagogue, who would say to demoniacs: "I conjure you by Jesus Christ, whom Paul preacheth, to go out quickly." But the wicked spirit would answer to them: "Jesus I know" "indeed, and Paul I know; but who ye are, I know not." And the possessed would fight against them tenaciously. When that became known, a great multitude of the people converted. Then people who had been following curious arts of the world brought their books and, judging them superfluous, consumed them with fire. Those books had been bought for as much as fifty thousand pieces of silver. After all this was done, Paul sent two men, Timothy and Erastus, to Macedonia, and himself remained in Asia for a time.
