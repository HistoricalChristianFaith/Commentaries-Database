"And it came to pass that Peter, as he passed through, visiting all, came to the saints who dwelt at Lydda," etc. When Peter came to Lydda, he found there a man named Aeneas who, being ill of the palsy, had kept his bed for eight years. Peter said to him: "The Lord Jesus Christ healeth thee", and he was immediately cured. When they saw this miracle, all the people - all who dwelt at Lydda and Saron - converted to God. Then Dorcas, a woman devoted to almsdeeds and holy works who lived in Joppe, was deprived of life. Peter was sent for so that he should come there and show the wonderful works of God. A crowd of poor people, whom Dorcas had been supplying with clothes, were begging Peter that the mother of the poor be given back to them. Then Peter knelt down and prayed, saying: "Arise, in the name of Jesus Christ;" and he presented her alive to the people, after having summoned them. A large number of people believed in the power of the Lord as a result of this event; whereupon it came to pass that Peter stayed many days with one Simon, a tanner.
