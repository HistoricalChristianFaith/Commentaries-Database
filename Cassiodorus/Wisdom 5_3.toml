After the light disappears, there remains only the recompense for merits. "Who in the underworld sings your praises?" must be understood to refer to forgiveness. As Solomon says of the godless, "Repentant, they will say to one another, groaning in anguish of spirit," etc. In fact, it is clear that the rich man who saw Lazarus at rest confessed his sins, but his plea was not granted. That is because confession is to be made in this world, in which one also finds forgiveness. - "Explanation of the Psalms 7.6"
