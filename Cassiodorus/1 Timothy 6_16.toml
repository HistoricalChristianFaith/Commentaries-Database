Since Paul says, “Only he that has immortality and inhabits inaccessible light,” how can the psalmist say here, “Come to him, and be enlightened? But the problem is solved by this brief statement of the truth: his light is said to be inaccessible when the unique and almighty nature of its substance is described; but when the grace of the sacred Godhead pours forth, we both approach him and obtain blessed enlightenment.
