"But Peter and John answering, said," etc. Peter and John replied to the priests and the whole council that they ought to obey the Lord's commandments rather than men's threats. On account of the people, whom they had rendered favorable by their deed, they were sent away from the council; and, coming to their own company, they informed them of what had happened to them. Then, giving glory to God, they said with a loud voice that which is written in Psalm 2, "Why have the Gentiles raged", etc. They confirmed that the things that had been written had come to pass in Jerusalem according to God's counsels, and they asked for a greater grace of preaching and of miracles to be granted to them. After this prayer, they were filled with the Holy Ghost, and were preaching the word of the Lord with unrelenting strength. And all the believers had but one heart and one soul, so that no one among them was afflicted by any want, but those who possessed something gladly gave what would be useful to everyone collectively.
