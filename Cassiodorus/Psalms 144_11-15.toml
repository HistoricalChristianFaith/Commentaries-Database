“Blessed is the man.” This is a very beautiful and apt beginning. As a result, it seems to take its beginning from blessedness, because the Holy Spirit was warning the weakness of the human race. Consequently, he invites the souls of the fearful so that the delicate hearts of mortals would not withdraw. For who would not be stirred up to some difficult tasks, when happy blessedness is mentioned in advance? Therefore, he is called a blessed man, just as the authority of our forebears have handed down to us, as is most fitting for a man who is pursued by all his desires. But the prophet reminds us in the 143rd psalm that this man is said to be blessed in two ways when he says, “They said that the people are blessed who have these things,” and again appends, “Blessed is the people whose God is the Lord.” Therefore, the blessed man of the world is he who, as he thinks, is supported by very great security and perseveres in constant joy and worldly abundance. But he excellently applied “man” to that blessed man who is not removed from his plan by any adversity, for he is called a man (vir) from his strength (viribus), who does not know how to fail in his endurance or to boast in some elation in prosperous times, but firmly planted with a stable mind and confirmed in the contemplation of heavenly matters, he always remains dauntless.
