The phrase “Sing and exult and play the lyre” follows. Although these words seem to be similar, nonetheless they are separated by some distinction. Singing is shouting the praises to the Lord, as is befitting for the mouth of a serious Christian to do. Exulting is declaring the vows of the mind with great affection. Playing the lyre is fulfilling the commandments of the Lord with good deeds. As to the fact that he admonishes this to be done so many times, it is because we must rejoice there in a diverse variety of virtues.
