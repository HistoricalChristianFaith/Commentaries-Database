[The Lord] visits with a rod when he imposes stern punishment. In the same spirit Paul when writing to the Corinthians said, “What will you? Shall I come to you with a rod? Or in charity and in the spirit of meekness?” He also visits us with stripes when he takes lighter vengeance on us; for a rod strikes us in one way, but whips flick us in another. Clearly each of these befalls Christian people according to the nature of their sin, enabling them to make progress toward salvation. As Solomon puts it: “For whom the Lord loves, he chastises; he whips every son whom he accepts.”
