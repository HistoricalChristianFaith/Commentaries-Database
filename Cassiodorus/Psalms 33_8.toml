The prophet rightly asks that all things be moved by the Lord, because everything that is arranged by his ordering is always applied to useful matters. But although he had earlier spoken about all things in a general way, he now turns his attention to people. Even though the universe needs to be administered by his command, the human race has the greatest need of such administration; the human race is known to be subject to acts of sin because it has become corrupted from its original nature because of vices that creep into it.
