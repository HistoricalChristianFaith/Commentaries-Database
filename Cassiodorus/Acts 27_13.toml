"And the south wind gently blowing, thinking that they had obtained their purpose." When they had left the harbor of Finicena, thinking that they could reach their destination with a harbor, suddenly the wind called Euroaquilo began to blow very violently against them. Then the ship, with folded sails, began to be swept along through the waters, so that, when passing the island of Cauda, they were losing the boat and, undergirding the ship with ropes, they tried to save it. But, as the winds intensified, they were in such great danger that they could see neither sun nor stars for many days. Then Paul, telling of a promise from the Lord that he had heard in his sleep, gave courage to the others, saying that, except for the ship itself, God had given him all the people who were voyaging with him. On the fourteenth day, as, with the storm still raging, the seamen had decided to flee, Paul said that everyone could not be saved unless the seamen remained in the ship. Then the soldiers, cutting off the ropes, deemed it preferable to give up the boat.
