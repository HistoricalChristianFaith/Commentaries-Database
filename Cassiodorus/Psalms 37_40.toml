Free to Hope. Cassiodorus: He also adds the reason for the liberation: it is because “they have hoped in him”—not because they have not sinned, but because they have placed their hope in the Lord’s compassion. This can also be applied to the judgment, when he will deign to present an eternal reward to his saints.
