The snare was certainly hidden by the enemies, but there was not one which could be hidden from Christ, nor did he fall into death by being deceived, but consciously he accepted it in order to liberate us. So the Jews hid a trap for Christ because they believed that he was only a man, and they were devising a plan to destroy him by an ambush. So he says that he will be brought out, in other words, by the kindness of the resurrection he will be raised quickly to the heavenly realms.
