You see here that sinners do not possess understanding except when the gracious Lord grants it to the converted, for understanding implies doing the right thing and directing one’s prayers to the Lord’s commands. This is the understanding which the psalm’s heading indicates and that the Lord’s power pours out in mercy on the penitent.
