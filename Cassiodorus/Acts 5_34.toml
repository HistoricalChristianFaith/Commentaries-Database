"But one in the council rising up, a Pharisee, named Gamaliel, a doctor of the law, said. "Gamaliel, whom the apostle Paul also praises, spoke publicly to persuade them that they should desist from persecuting the apostles, saying: "If their preaching be from men, it will undoubtedly fail, as did that of Theodas and of Judas of Galilee; if, on the other hand, it be from God, it cannot possibly be destroyed by any power." Then they scourged the apostles and let them go, charging them that they should no longer be involved in such preachings; but they kept preaching the word to the nations. Meanwhile, there arose a murmuring of the Greeks, saying that their widows were treated with despicable contempt in the daily ministration. Because of this matter, seven chosen men were appointed as deacons so that they should manage matters of this sort with moderate authority, while the apostles should devote themselves only to preaching. This office was also consecrated on them by the imposition of hands. A multitude of the priests, too, hastened at that time to obey the Lord.
