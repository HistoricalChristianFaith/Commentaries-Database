Because implies that the Lord stood at his right hand, and He testifies that delight has arisen in His thoughts and joy on His tongue. Perfect joy is that which is both conceived in a joyful heart and brought forth in eager speech. Just as He used the word moreover of His evils, so he repeated the word of His blessings, so that humanity might be thought to have received heavenly joys according to the measure of His human troubles. For He says that His joy has welled over His gladness because the suffering flesh which He took up for the salvation of all of us has corruption.
