"And when it came to pass that, being parted from them, we set sail, we came with a straight course to Coos." Then, as though violently parted from them, they came to Coos; and moving on to Rhodes and Patara, passing through Phenice and Cyprus, they came all the way to Tyre. Having found some disciples there, Paul stayed with them for seven days. Warned by the power of foreknowledge, they said to Paul that he should not hasten to go up to Jerusalem, as a grievous storm awaited him there. Having said a prayer and taken leave, they came from there to Ptolemais, and then to Caesarea, where Paul entered the house of Philip the preacher, who was one of the seven whom the apostles had earlier put in charge of the management of tables. This man had four virgin daughters who prophesized the words of the Lord. While they stayed there, there came from Jerusalem a prophet named Agabus, who, taking Paul's girdle and binding his own feet, said that the man whose girdle it was would soon be bound in that manner by the Jews, and delivered into the hands of the Gentiles. Then the disciples, together with the faithful, asked Paul to avoid the imminent dangers.
