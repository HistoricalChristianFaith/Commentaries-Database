"And Joseph, who, by the apostles, was surnamed Barnabas," etc. Here are given examples of faithful and of deceitful people: Joseph, who was surnamed Barnabas, went away unhurt, because he brought the entire price; Ananias, on the other hand, and his wife Saphira, who kept back by fraud the price of the land they had sold, were cursed, and gave up their unfortunate souls in front of everyone; and the same people carried out the husband and later his lifeless wife. After this event, everyone's fear and faith increased, and the apostles' preaching kept intensifying. None of their opponents dared to join them, since the people's favor towards them kept growing, when sick people were cured by a word from the apostles and by Peter's shadow as he passed by. Not only the people of that city, but also people from neighboring cities would try this with growing faith.
