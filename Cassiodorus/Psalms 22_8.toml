These words are in fact specifically found in the Gospel, for when Christ was hanging on the cross, the Jews were saying: “He hoped in the Lord: let him deliver him now, if he wants him.” O heavenly wholeness! Do we not here seem to be going through the Gospel rather than a psalm, since these things have been fulfilled with such accuracy that they seem to have been enacted rather than about to take place.
