"A great multitude also of the priests obeyed the faith," etc. One of those who had been chosen for the management of tables, one called Stephen, did great signs and wonders by the power of the Lord Christ; and since none of the unfaithful could withstand his preachings, false witnesses were brought against him to say that he had spoken words of blasphemy against God and Moses. Setting him before the council, they tried to inquire about such statements.
