We should regard the “surrounded city” as the physical location of Jerusalem, which is set in the midst of the nations and is known to exist as the temple of God. The nations that are located around it were worthy to receive the precepts of the Christian teaching, as if the purest of springs opened itself up to them, and they were irrigated with the gifts of heavenly life. So in this city the Lord “has made his mercy wonderful,” since it was there in fact that he deemed it fitting to teach, to perform miracles, and to suffer for human salvation. There too he revealed the glory of his resurrection, where he chose to make known such immense mysteries.
