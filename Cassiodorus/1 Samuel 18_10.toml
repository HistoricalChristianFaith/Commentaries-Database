It was also through a wicked angel that the transgressor was tempted in the account of the book of Kings [Samuel], where it says “The evil spirit from God came upon Saul.” Just men, too, like Job and the apostle Paul and others of that kind were tried by the devil. It is clear that all created things are subject to the discretion or command of the Creator.
