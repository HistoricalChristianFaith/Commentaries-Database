Even though the Lord’s mercy always goes before us, he says here, “it will follow me.” It follows, particularly to guard, but it goes in front to grant grace. For if it were merely following, no one would perceive the gifts that are granted. If it were only going in front, then no one would be able to preserve the gifts that had been received. For the ambushes that the devil prepares behind us are quite substantial, and unless the Lord’s mercy follows, our human weakness is very easily deceived. For precisely when a person believes that he has moved beyond a vice, he is more easily deceived because of his unwary ignorance. For this reason, it is most essential both that the Lord’s grace go before us and that his mercy follows us.

For this is the final perfection of all good things.… “The house of the Lord indicates the Jerusalem to come, which endures “for the length of days,” without uncertainty, for it is an enduring blessedness and a joy that never ends.
