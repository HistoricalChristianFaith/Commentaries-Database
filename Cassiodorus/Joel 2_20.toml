Joel, the prophet, offers evidence about [the devil] with these words: “And I will remove far off from you the northern one, and I will drive him into the land thirsty and desert, and I shall expel his face into the nearest sea and his hinder parts into the utmost sea.” We thank you, Lord, for this arrangement. What would the devil do if free, when he afflicts the world when bound?
