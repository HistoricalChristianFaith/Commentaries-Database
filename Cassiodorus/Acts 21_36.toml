"Then Paul took the men, and the next day, being purified, entered with them into the temple." Paul, gladly taking the above-mentioned advice, took the four brethren, purified and with their heads shaved, and boldly entered the synagogue on the following day. He spoke there, giving them notice of the purification needed until an oblation was given to the Lord for their salvation. After seven days, those Jews that were of Asia, recognizing Paul, seized him and, causing an uproar, gathered the people against him, saying that this was the man who, against the law of Moses, persuaded the nations that circumcision should be abandoned. When they had decided to kill him, the tribune of the band suddenly arrived with soldiers and centurions and, by reasoning, stopped them from their criminal intention. Then the tribune commanded Paul, saved from the people but bound with two chains, to be brought to the castle. There the bound apostle asked the tribune to permit him to speak to the people. His wish was granted and, having obtained silence with a gesture of his hand, he spoke to the crowd in Hebrew.
