Next comes, “And praise him highly, all you peoples.” High praise is the praise of all the faithful brought together as one; this is recognized to apply to the catholic church, which is gathered from various parts of the world. For all the Gentiles are generally reminded among their own peoples so that no one will say at the judgment of the Lord that he was passed over.

He added, “And the truth of the Lord remains forever.” Here “the truth” means “the Son of the Lord,” as he himself says, “I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life.” As the Arian3 (who is out of his mind) thinks, there was a time when the Son did not exist (it is awful even to say this!); that would mean that there was a time when the Father was without the Truth, without the Way and without the Life. But because the Father cannot be believed to have ever been without these things, it accords well with our salvation and the truth itself to confess that the Son is coeternal and of one substance with the Father in all things.
