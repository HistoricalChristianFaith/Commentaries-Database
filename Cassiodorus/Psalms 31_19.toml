There is an abundance of sweetness, for the Lordâ€™s sweetness is expressed by the many benefits that he gives. He is sweet when he corrects, sweet when he pardons, and sweet when he promises eternal rewards to believers. But you must understand that he is only sweet to those who have acquired a taste for him. His sweetness cannot come to those who have not deserved to experience him.
