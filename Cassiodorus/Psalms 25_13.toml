When the just have been stripped of their bodies, the perfect blessedness that is promised to the saints at the resurrection is not immediately granted; but it says that the soul is able “to dwell in good things,” since even if those rewards have still been withheld, “which an eye has not seen, nor ear heard, nor have they entered into the human heart,” they still feast on the most certain delight of the hope of their future reward.
