"And Paul departed from Ephesus and went down to Caesarea," etc. Walking out of there, Paul came down to Caesarea, where he saluted the congregation of the church. Then he left for Antioch and, after staying there for some time, traveled through the countries of Galatia and Phrygia, confirming all the disciples, so that they should continue in the rules they had received. A certain Apollo, an Alexandrian-born Jew, who was an eloquent man and fervent in spirit, came to Ephesus. There, as he spoke boldly with the Jews in the synagogue, Aquila and Priscilla took him to them and taught him the Lord's Scriptures more diligently, revealing the truth. And as he was desirous to go to Achaia, they wrote that the devout people should receive him confidently. It then came to pass that he convinced the Jews confidently and decisively.
