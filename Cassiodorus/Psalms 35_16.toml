This is what happens to savages when they are conquered by reason. When words fail them because of the truth, then they gnash their teeth and so communicate their desires by a silent threat. All of this is in the interest of a great act of building up the human race, so that its members may not count it a burden to suffer what they recognize that their own Head has endured.
