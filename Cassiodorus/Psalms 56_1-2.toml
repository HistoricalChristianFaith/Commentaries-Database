“Have mercy upon me, Lord, because man has trampled me underfoot; all day long he wages war and afflicts me.” The virgin mother Church, who gives birth to the faithful people and yet does not lose her virginity, asks her heavenly bridegroom with pious tears that she would not be allowed to be oppressed by her enemies, even as she recognizes that she still dwells in the misfortune of this world. “Trampled underfoot” refers back to that which he had spoken in the title in regards to the winepress, for wine is pressed out to the same degree that a grape is thoroughly crushed. Here he absolutely indicates the “man” to be the devil, just as in the gospel the Lord speaks of the very man, “Now the hostile man, who sowed the thistles, is the devil.” The phrase “all day long he wages war and afflicts me” follows. He describes what the holy church endures in this world, namely, that she is recognized to be enduring the attacks of the devil without any letup, just as the apostle says, “Our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against rulers and authorities of this darkness.” It is a dire war because it is hidden. It is a difficult war because it is being waged with one who is stronger. For what sort of war is it to come into conflict with an enemy and not to see his ambushes? Also, our adversary is not lacking in diligence and does not ever withdraw when defeated, but he comes back all the more savagely to the same extent that he happened to be able to be defeated by divine grace. But we call it a war in a figure of speech, using the word in a sense opposite to its meaning (antiphrasis7), much as we speak of a grove which has no glow or a fish pond which has no fish. Therefore, let no one of the faithful complain that he is harassed by the very frequent contrivances of the devil, because if we wish to belong to Christ, we will always endure the devil as our enemy here.
