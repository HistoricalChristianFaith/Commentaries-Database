"And when they were come to Jerusalem, they were splendidly received by the church." When Paul and Barnabas were come to Jerusalem with the brethren because of the question that was being inquired into, they were received with great joy by the whole church. There again, there was much disputing between the Pharisees who had already converted and the apostles about circumcision. Then Peter, filled with the Holy Ghost, explained that the Gentiles were not to be purified by circumcision, but by faith. James the bishop, who was called the Lord's brother, also followed this view and supported it with great reasonings and with a prophet's testimony, saying that Moses was content with his name being uttered with reverence in the synagogue on every sabbath.
