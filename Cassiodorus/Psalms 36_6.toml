An abyss is a depth of water that we can neither measure nor peer all the way into. Who could discern what lies within the deep ocean, or who could comprehend its broad-ranging spaces? So also we are neither able to embrace Godâ€™s judgments with our mind, nor are we able to define them through some action of reason.
