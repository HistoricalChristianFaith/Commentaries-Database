"And sending from Miletus to Ephesus, he called the ancients of the church." Sending from Miletus to Ephesus, the apostle Paul summoned the bishops of the church, and there retraced for them his story with great affection, reminding them of the moderation and humility with which he had behaved among them, above all bringing to their notice the word of the Lord so that false preachers, when they came, might not overturn their hearts, and that they might not make the too dangerous mistake of deviating from established rules. He mentioned, too, that he had been a financial burden to no one; on the contrary, giving them the affection of a spiritual father, he had fed himself and his colleagues with his own hands, since it was, as everyone knew, a more blessed thing to give than to receive. He said that, after taking leave, he would depart and never see their faces again. When he had said these things, he knelt down and prayed with all the people, and everyone's weeping sounded loudly, and, kissing his neck, they cried with profuse tenderness because he had told them they would not see him again.
