“Then Saul sent and watched his house to kill him.” This too is fittingly associated with the Lord’s passion, for house indicates the tomb where he rested in a three-day death. The Jews’ leaders sent men to guard it, to destroy so to say the fame of his name, so that by some trick it should not be claimed that he rose again, an eventuality which Christ had been heard earlier proclaiming. It was better that his enemies should of their own accord desire to condemn this, for it allowed the whole world to acknowledge the fact more certainly. The evidence which the unwilling witness offers is beyond doubt; it cannot be called partisan when confirmed by the guilty person.
