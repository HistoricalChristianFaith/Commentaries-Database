I foresaw the Lord always in my sight:
He passes on to the unique remedy by which to avoid sins, for the person who with the mental eye always gazes on the Lord in no way turns to sins. 

for he is at my right hand, so that I may not be moved:
It was fitting for Him to speak of the Lord as being at His right hand, for if the Lord does not occupy that place the Devil will at once seize it for ambush. As was written of Judas, Set the sinner over him, and let the Devil stand at his right hand (Ps. 109:6).
