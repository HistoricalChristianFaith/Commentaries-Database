"They therefore being dismissed, went down to Antioch," etc. When they came to Antioch, the above-mentioned Barnabas and Silas, gathering together the multitude, delivered the epistle to the brethren. Upon reading it, they rejoiced that the cause of scandal had been removed. Furthermore, Judas and Silas, being prophets also themselves, disposed the hearts of all to the same will. After staying there for some time, they were let go by the brethren to return to those who had sent them; but Silas remained there, while Judas returned alone to Jerusalem. Paul and Barnabas were staying in Antioch, assiduously teaching the word of God; but after a few days, reminded of fatherly duties, they decided to travel again through those regions where the word of the Lord had been spread far and wide. Then, a dissension having arisen regarding John, alias Marcus, Barnabas, taking John, sailed to Cyprus, while Paul, taking Silas, departed for Syria and Cilicia, confirming the churches, so that they should continue in the teachings of the fathers with strength of mind.
