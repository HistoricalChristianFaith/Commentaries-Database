A Christian is said to rise again in two senses; first, when in this world he is freed by grace from the death of vices, and he continues being justified by God; in the words of the most wise Solomon, “A just man falls seven times and rises again.” Second, there is the general resurrection, at which the just will attain their eternal rewards.
