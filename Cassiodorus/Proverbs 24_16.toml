A Christian is said to rise again in two different senses: when he perseveres in God’s gifts of justification after he has been set free by grace from the death of the vices in this world, as the most wise Solomon says: “A just man falls seven times and he rises again.” There is also said to be that general resurrection at which the just will obtain their eternal rewards.
