"And passing through Pisidia, they came into Pamphylia," etc. It is related that, preaching in like manner through various cities, they departed for Antioch. There, they told the assembled faithful what great things the Lord had granted the Gentiles; how, opening the door of faith, he had thought fit to show them the truth in its fullest extent. But, when they had been staying there for a while, some false counselors persuaded the Gentiles, who had already received the preaching and believed, that they could not be saved unless they underwent circumcision, as the Lord commanded through Moses. The matter caused dissension among the people. It was then decided that those who were in Jerusalem should be consulted about this question, so that by their agreement an end might be put to the dispute that had arisen. On the way, they told through peoples, cities and individual regions what great things the Lord had granted the Gentiles, and great joy grew daily among the brethren as a result.
