“Let them praise his name in the choir; let them play music for him on the timbrel and harp.” In an earlier verse he said that we must rejoice in the Lord Christ, but now he says that we must praise the name of the Lord in the choir. That is to say, in the choir that never suffers any scattering, boredom or scandal, but is gathered in the uprightness of merits and always exists with the dearest unity. But another psalm explains what this choir is like and how big it is: “From the rising of the sun to its setting, praise the name of the Lord.” The chorus that is gathered from the beginning of the world from the multitude of the heathen also cannot be gathered except in that heavenly homeland.
