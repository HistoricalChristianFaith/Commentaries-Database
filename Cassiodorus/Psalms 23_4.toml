The shadow of death … is the devil, who lays traps for us in secret so that, once we have been misled by the mists, we might fall headlong into eternal death. But this situation is not feared by the true believer, even if, while relying on divine mercy, he ventures to walk in the midst of these traps.

The rod refers to the justice and strength of the Lord Savior, as he says in another psalm: “A rod of fairness is the rod of your kingdom.” The staff evokes the notion of support for human beings. With the staff, the foot itself is planted securely and the whole body of those who lean on it with their weight from above is supported.… The faithful claim that they have found consolation in these two things.… There is no doubt that the staff brings consolation; it is always taken up to bring help for human weakness. What should we say about the rod, which strikes, beats and punishes our vices with the courtroom’s severity? This too also clearly consoles the faithful when improvement results, and it leads people back to the Lord’s path. It is appropriate to say that everything that helps us comforts us, even if something saddens us for the sake of correction.
