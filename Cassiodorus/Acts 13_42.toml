"And as they went out, they desired them, that on the next sabbath, they would speak unto them the words of God." As Paul and Barnabas went out of the synagogue, a crowd of Jews begged them to speak their words about the Lord Christ again on the following sabbath. On the next sabbath, as the people had very eagerly come together to hear them, some of the Jews, moved with great envy, tried to contradict them. Paul and Barnabas replied to them: "It indeed behoved us first to speak the word of God to you; but because you have rejected it, we turn to the Gentiles as we have been commanded." At these words, the Gentiles rejoiced and received the Christian doctrine most readily. But the disappointed contradictors stirred up honorable women and the chief men of the city, and expelled Barnabas and Paul from their territory. Barnabas and Paul, coming to Iconium, converted many people to the Lord; and an uproar arose against them again, stirred up by their adversaries; but it was immediately calmed with the help of the Lord. It came to pass under these circumstances that some people sided with the apostles while others sided at all costs with the Jews.
