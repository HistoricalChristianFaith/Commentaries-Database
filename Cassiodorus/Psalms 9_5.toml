From here on, the most sacred second advent of the Lord is explained, when unbelieving nations will be rebuked and the devil with his schemes will perish forever. For when the Lord is present, all things will be peaceful, and the devil’s feisty depravity will no longer remain.… The word forever indicates the Lord’s coming kingdom which will not end in any age or time.… Therefore let the heretics stop saying that at some point the devil and his followers can be summoned back to grace, since they hear so clearly that they will be condemned “forever and ever” so that not even a trace of their name is able to remain.
