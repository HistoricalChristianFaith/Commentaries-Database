"Now when Paul and they that were with him had sailed from Paphos," etc. When Paul and Barnabas had sailed from Paphos with the rest who had come with them, they came to Perge in Pamphilia, and passed through it. John, departing from them at Perge, returned to Jerusalem. Paul and Barnabas, walking through Perge, came to Antioch in Pisidia. Entering the synagogue there, they listened to a reading of the prophets and the law. The rulers of the synagogue sent to them, saying that, if any one of them had a word of exhortation, he should speak, just as they did in other cities, where the truth they spoke was believed. Then Paul, having obtained silence with a gesture of his hand, preached the Lord Christ's doctrine to the people, explaining what was said with the testimonies of the prophets in order to bring the people to the fullest faith by revealing the truth; assuring them that the Lord Christ was the only one who justified the severity of the law by the gift of his grace; telling them they should be careful, as the Scripture warns, not to refuse to believe what the truth itself was known to tell them.
