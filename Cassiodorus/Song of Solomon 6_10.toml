You are rightly compared with this figure since you raise your precious head over all races, and you transmit the souls of the just like resplendent stars to the kingdom above. You are a pyramid full of heavenly corn, the blessed gathering of saintly people from diverse nations, the shining assembly of bright minds, a structure that cannot be dismantled since it is fashioned from living stones, the eternal happiness of all who are blessed, brighter than the sun, whiter than snow, without spot or wrinkle. Of you it is written in the Song of Songs: “Who is she that comes forth as the morning rising, fair as the moon, bright as the sun, terrible as an army set in array?” - "Exposition of the Psalms, Preface 17"
