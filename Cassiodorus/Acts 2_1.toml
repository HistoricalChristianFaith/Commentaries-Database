"When the days of the Pentecost were accomplished, they were all together in one place," etc. When fifty days had passed, as the Lord Christ had promised them, there was suddenly a mighty sound from heaven as the Holy Ghost came, and heavenly fire appeared above the heads of all who were sitting in the house, and they began to speak the tongues of various nations. As the news spread, men from various peoples who had gathered in Jerusalem came and wondered at them who, being Galileans, spoke of the wonderful works of God in the tongues of the peoples. Some, looking at the phenomenon reasonably, thought rightly that it had been granted by a gift of God; others, stupidly mocking, rather ascribed it to drunkenness.
