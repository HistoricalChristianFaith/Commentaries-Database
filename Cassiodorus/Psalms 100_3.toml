“Serve the Lord in gladness; enter his sight with rejoicing.” But that joy is love, at any rate, which (as the apostle says) “is not puffed up, does no harm, is not ambitious” and all the other things which describe this excellent virtue in Paul’s marvelous explanation. Therefore, they are those who serve the Lord in gladness, who love him above all things and regard one another with brotherly love. Oh, what free bondage! Ah, a servitude more exceptional than all other forms of domination, to which such joy is ascribed as is not contained in the glory of kingdoms! But see what sort of reward follows that joy which is commanded in this world, for he says, “Enter his sight with rejoicing.” It is much more difficult and much more excellent to rejoice before the sight of such a judge, when one is being warned to approach with the knowledge so as to take the joys of humility while he is shown to be fearsome to all the haughty.
