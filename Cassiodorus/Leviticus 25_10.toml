THE NUMBER OF THIS PSALM IS NOT WITHOUT REASON. IT HAS REFERENCE TO THE YEAR OF THE JUBILEE, WHICH AMONG THE JEWS DISSOLVED OLD CONTRACTS AND OBLIGATIONS AND WHICH IN LEVITICUS THE LORD ORDERED ALL DWELLERS ON EARTH TO CALL THE YEAR OF REMISSION. THE NUMBER ALSO REFERS TO PENTECOST, WHEN AFTER THE LORD’S ASCENSION THE HOLY SPIRIT CAME ON THE APOSTLES, WORKING MIRACLES AND IMPARTING THE GIFT OF CHARISMS. SO TOO THIS PSALM, WHICH IS GIVEN THE NUMBER 50, if recited with a pure heart, looses sins, cancels the bond of our debt and, like the year of remission, frees us through the Lord’s kindness of the debts of our sins.
