"But Paul standing in the midst of the Areopagus, said," etc. Paul, set in the midst of the Areopagus, poured out the honey of heavenly philosophy, starting his speech beautifully with the fact that among their various idols he had found an inscription that read "to the unknown god". He said that they should, therefore, seek the one whom they themselves declared to be unknown to them. He preached, in order, the Lord Christ, who with all his power made the heaven and the earth and all things in them, and he showed to them that even examples from their own authors made it clear that, being the "offspring of God," they should not worship things made with hands. When they heard, among other things, about the resurrection of the dead, many believed it, while others thought it was a lie. After these things, going down from Athens, he came to Corinth, where, preaching the Lord Savior to Jews and Greeks, he taught the dogmas of the Christian religion.
