As we said earlier, the seven-formed Spirit has been denoted here, as you easily infer by calculation and recognize by his activity. But we must regard this Holy Spirit as one and the same as him whose virtues are known by Isaiah’s witness to be the same seven which we have mentioned: the Spirit of wisdom, of understanding, of counsel, of courage, of knowledge, of piety, of fear of the Lord; and he distributes these to each as he wills. It should not trouble you that everywhere Isaiah ascribes the words to the voice of the Holy Spirit, for clearly “voice” is associated with the whole Trinity. We read of the Father’s voice when he says, “This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased,” and again of the Son’s voice in the words “Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me?” Likewise in the Acts of the Apostles we read of the Holy Spirit: “Separate for me Paul and Barnabas, for the work to which I have called them.”
