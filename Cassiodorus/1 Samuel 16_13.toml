So clearly holy David was filled with heavenly inspiration, and not through human actions, the birth of twins, angels, visions, a dream, a cloud and a voice from heaven, or any other way of that kind. As the first book of Kings [Samuel] says of him: “And the spirit of the Lord came upon David from that day forward.” The Lord himself too says in the Gospel: “If David in the spirit calls him Lord, how do you say he is his son?” By these words we realize that the psalms were clearly expressions of prophecy through the holy Spirit.
