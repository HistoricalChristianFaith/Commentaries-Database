Whoever purifies his deeds through his zeal for noble behavior washes his hands “among the innocent.” He did well to add “among the innocent,” for the guilty are also able to wash their hands, as Pontius Pilate did … when he polluted his soul by his foul betrayal of the Lord.… But whoever cleanses his deeds with the tears that render satisfaction washes his hands in the spiritual sense.
