Though hyssop is a tiny plant, its roots are said to penetrate the heart of rocks. It is also known to be good for a personâ€™s internal wounds. In Leviticus it was dipped in sacrificial blood and sprinkled seven times on the body of a leper, revealing by way of anticipation that inward stains of sins could be effectively removed by the precious blood of the Lord Savior.
