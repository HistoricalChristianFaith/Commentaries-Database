"Ye men, brethren, let me freely speak to you of the patriarch David," etc. And since the apostle Peter had mentioned David, who was regarded by the Jews as a venerable prophet, Peter, taking from David an opportunity for his preaching, showed that David had nonetheless died, and said that his sepulcher was with them while David himself had prophesied that the Lord Christ's flesh would never be subject to corruption. For God raised him again from the dead, and he received the Father's promises in the fullest truth. Peter asserted that the gift which was seen to have been granted had come from the Lord Christ, for it was proven by the example of David's Psalm 109 that he was the Lord. Luke declares that three thousand men, moved to compunction by this preaching, made penance and were baptized.
