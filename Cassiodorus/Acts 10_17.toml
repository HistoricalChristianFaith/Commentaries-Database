"Now, whilst Peter was doubting within himself, what the vision that he had seen should mean," etc. As Peter thought in bewilderment about the above-mentioned vision, the Holy Ghost said to him: "Behold, men seek thee; Cornelius hath sent them. Arise and go with them, for they were sent at my behest to seek thee." When Peter had gone down to them without hesitation, they explained to him, in order, the reason why they were sent. Peter lodged them and, on the next day, he hastened to Cornelius with them. When Cornelius saw him, he fell at his feet and adored. Peter, retaining his humility, stopped Cornelius from it, asking him - even though he had been informed of it - for what reason he had had him called. Cornelius explained to him what he had been told by the angel when praying, and waited with the rest to hear from Peter what things might conduce to the salvation of all.
