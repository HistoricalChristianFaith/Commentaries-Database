"And Ananias went his way, and entered into the house, and laid his hand upon him, and said." Walking in to Paul, Ananias cleansed his eyes by the imposition of his hand, causing scales to fall off. Paul was baptized in the name of Christ, and was also reinvigorated by the taking of food, for he had been weakened by a three-day fast. Then, having been looked upon by heavenly kindness, growing strong in the Christian doctrine, he preached the word of the Lord in the synagogues: he had been changed for the better. Now after several days, a plot was hatched among the Jews against him too. He was placed in a basket by the disciples and secretly let down from the wall by a rope, and then came to Jerusalem. Having been brought by Barnabas before the apostles, he told them all that had happened to him by a gift of the Lord. Then, joined to them in the most loving fellowship, he preached together with them the Lord Christ whom he had previously thought worthy of persecution. As a result, the unbelieving hurriedly sought to have him killed, but the apostles decided, by a holy arrangement, to send him away to Tarsus. Meanwhile, the whole of Judea and Samaria had peace and grew in the splendor of the Lord.
