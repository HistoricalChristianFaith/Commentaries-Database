As if you did not know that all human beings come from Adam and that it is written that the nations will believe in Christ, as it is said, “My house will be called a house of prayer for all nations.” … The saints were uncircumcised before they were circumcised, and Abraham before circumcision had faith, since there is one God who justifies a circumcision of faith. And he proclaims that each nation ought to be saved through the faith of Christ, that is, by faith in him.
