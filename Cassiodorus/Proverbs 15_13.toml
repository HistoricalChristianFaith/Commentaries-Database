The church explains how it can please the Lord in the light of the living, which means in the brightness of the saints, among whom [the church] is made beautiful, spotless and without wrinkle. Whatever befalls them shines from its face. Just as a man’s healthy constitution makes his face more handsome, just as in Solomon’s words, “When the heart rejoices the countenance flourishes,” so the beauty of the features of holy church is diffused abroad when found in the merits of the blessed.
