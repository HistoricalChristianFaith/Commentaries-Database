One person prays to the Lord almost all his life, another is converted in middle age, another is saved at his life’s end.… God with merciful patience awaits the hour of our conversion at any time, and so he bears with the guilty and awaits sinners with the words, “It is not my will that a sinner should die, but that he be converted and live.” The only requirement is that in this life we confess all our sinning, for here we fail through human frailty.
