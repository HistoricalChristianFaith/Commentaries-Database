"And at midnight, Paul and Silas praying, praised the Lord." When Paul and Silas, thrown into custody, were chanting praises to the Lord at midnight, suddenly there was a great earthquake, such that the foundations of the prison were shaken. All the doors were opened, and the bonds of all the bound prisoners were loosed. When the keeper of the prison realized this, he drew his sword and would have killed himself; but Paul cried out to him with a loud voice not to lay violent hands on himself, since the prisoners entrusted to his charge could be found right there. The keeper, having kindled a light, indeed found there all the men that he sought. Then, falling down at the feet of the apostles, he implored to be saved. Hearing the word of the Lord, he believed, and he is known to have been baptized with his entire household. He brought the apostles to his own dwelling, smeared their stripes with ointment and refreshed them with a table laid for them; and he was overjoyed to have, with his entire household, obtained the grace of Christ. The magistrates too were perturbed by the earthquake, and commanded that the apostles be let out of custody. Paul replied: "Since we are Romans and, though innocent, are suffering the bonds of prison, we cannot come out secretly, unless they who commanded such injustices come themselves to throw us out."
