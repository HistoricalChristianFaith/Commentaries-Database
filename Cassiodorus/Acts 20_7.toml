"And on the first day of the week, when they were assembled to break bread." On the day before his departure from Troas, Paul, continuing his speech until midnight, was teaching very earnestly and pleasantly, when it came to pass that one of the young men present, overcome by sleep, fell from the loft and was in danger of death. Paul, embracing him with religious affection, gave him back safe and sound to the people present. Then, having refreshed himself with bread and preached to the people until daylight, he departed for Assos by land. His disciples, traveling by ship as he had told them to, met Paul in the above-mentioned city. From there, they departed together for Mitylene, Chios, Samos, Miletus; for Paul had determined to leave Ephesus unvisited, so as to reach Jerusalem on Pentecost day.
