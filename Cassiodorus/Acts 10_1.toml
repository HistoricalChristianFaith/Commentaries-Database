"And there was a certain man in Caesarea, named Cornelius," etc. Cornelius, a Gentile living in Caesarea, devoted to almsdeeds and prayers, saw in a vision an angel of God saying to him: "Thy prayers and almsdeeds have reached the sight of the Lord: send men to Joppe to Peter, who lodgeth at the house of Simon the tanner, and have him come quickly to save thee." Meanwhile, as Peter in that house, about the sixth hour of the day, was hungry and desirous to taste somewhat, there came upon him an ecstasy of mind; and he saw a vessel like a white linen sheet, in which were all four-footed beasts, creeping things and fowls, be let down from heaven; and there came a voice to him: "Arise, Peter; kill and eat;" and a little later: "That which God hath cleansed, do not thou call unclean." This was done three times, and we know the vessel was taken back up to heaven. It signified, indeed, that nations all around the world would believe in the Lord Christ.
