But notice what “Lift up” means: “Give alms more generously,” for the Lord not only demands pious words from us, but also deeds. He added, “in the sanctuary,” so that the hand of a Christian may produce the alms. For if heretics or pagans give alms, their hands are not lifted up in the sanctuary, inasmuch as Christ accepts only those very alms that a faithful Christian offers to his name. Nonetheless, lest someone arrogate anything to himself, he says that one ought to bless the Lord while doing this act, since he himself grants both a merciful mind and abundant wealth. Thus he teaches that the love of the Lord ought to be fulfilled with sacred praises and pious deeds. When these things have been accomplished, see how a worthy reward follows.
