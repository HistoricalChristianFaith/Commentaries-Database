The disciples said to him, since they could not detain him: "The will of the Lord be done. "When they came to Jerusalem, they were received gladly by the brethren. On the next day, Paul went to James, telling him all that the divine power had granted the Gentiles by his ministry. That made them very happy, and, rejoicing with him, they gave thanks to the Lord, but they warned him to be careful about the people of the Jews, as he was clearly much suspected by them on the grounds that he taught, against the law of Moses, that circumcision should be abolished. They advised him to take four men of their company and to enter the synagogue with them after they had shaved their heads: when the Jews realized this, they would believe that he would not say anything against the law of Moses. As for the Gentiles that believed, they said that they had written to them what things it was enough for them to abstain from and had told them to continue in the rules they had been taught.
