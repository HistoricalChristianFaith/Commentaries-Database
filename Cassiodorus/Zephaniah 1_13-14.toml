With reference to that day the prophet Amos says, “Woe to them that desire the Day of the Lord. To what end is this Day of the Lord for you? The day itself is darkness and not light.” The prophet Zephaniah says the same thing: “The voice of the Day of the Lord is grim and bitter.” That is why the penitent now introduced before us earnestly supplicates in the ordered divisions of his prayer that he may not be convicted for his deeds on that day of judgment. What is more beneficial and farsighted for the person who could have no hope in his own deserts because of the sins which he has committed than to decide to pray to God’s fatherly love while in this world, where there is opportunity for repentance?
