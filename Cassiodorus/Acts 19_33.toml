"Alexander therefore, beckoning with his hand for silence, would have given the people satisfaction. "Alexander, one of Paul's disciples, having obtained silence by a gesture of his hand, would have given satisfaction to the furious people. As soon as they perceived him to be a Jew, to stop him from saying anything against Diana, they proclaimed with a loud voice for two hours that great was Diana of the Ephesians. The town clerk, fearing that such a great uproar would throw the city into confusion, obtained silence and persuaded the people that, if Demetrius and his craftsmen raised a matter against any people, they should be heard by calm judges. Innocent men, who had not spoken anything against Diana, should not be put in danger of death. This reasoning was accepted and the whole uproar calmed. Then Paul, taking his leave of the disciples, set forward for Macedonia. After teaching numerous people there, he came to Greece. From there, walking through the neighboring countries, he came to Troas with his disciples, where they are known to have abided for seven days.
