"And at the same time, Herod stretched forth his hands, to afflict some of the church. "King Herod, with wicked presumption, murdered John's brother James, who was preaching the word of the Lord. Seeing that he had pleased the Jews in so doing, he sent Peter to prison as well, setting sixteen soldiers to guard him with great care. Prayer was being incessantly poured out for him throughout the church. On the night before the day appointed for his trial, he is known to have been visited by an angel and freed both from the bonds of chains and from the dangers of guards, all in such a way that, though it was truly happening, he thought it was taking place in a dream. When he came to himself, however, the truth was manifest, and he realized that the Lord had thought fit to free him through his angel. Coming to the house of Mary the mother of John, where a multitude of faithful were praying for him, he knocked at the door repeatedly and finally came in. He then told them how an angel had come to release him from the bonds of custody, and he ordered this to be told to James and to the other brethren.
