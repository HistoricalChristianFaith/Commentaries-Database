This is what happened with the body of the Lord Savior: it was fastened with nails and pierced with a spear and thereby brought us a fruit which remains forever. For this reason, we are now not afraid to say that God suffered in the flesh, that God died for the salvation of all. So Father Augustine says admirably in his usual way: “It was an accustomed matter for humankind to die. But in order that this might not always hold sway among humankind, something new happened in that God died.” So also the Apostle says: “But we preach Christ, and him crucified.” So that you may not think that the Virgin’s Son was somehow some other one, as some of those who are without reason do, he added: Christ, who is surely “the power of God and the wisdom of God. For God’s foolishness is wiser than human wisdom, and God’s weakness is stronger than human strength.” For what seems so foolish or so weak to unbelievers as when they hear that God, the Son of God, was both crucified and buried? “But it pleased God through the foolishness of the proclamation to save believers.” For the Lord’s incarnation is the marvelous height of his mercy, an unimaginable gift, an incomprehensible mystery. From the same source, either salvation issues forth for those of the right mind or destruction is begotten for corrupted minds.
