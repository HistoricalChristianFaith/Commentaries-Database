As for the fact that he says, “And he has looked upon,” he indicates the grace of the one who shows mercy. We say that they see that we look upon those to whom we declare that something has also been offered. And consider that he did not say that the sins were seen, but rather the sons of men were. For when God looks at their sins, he punishes them; when he looks at a person, he absolves them, just as he will say in Psalm 51, “Turn your face from my sins,” and elsewhere, “Do not turn your face away from me.” Thus, we must understand and retain this salutary distinction.
