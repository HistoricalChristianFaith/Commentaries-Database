"Then Paul answered (the governor making a sign to him), saying." When the orator Tertullus had made the claims he wanted, Paul, after first saying things that might win him the goodwill of the judge, responded thus: when he had come to Jerusalem following the custom of his nation to adore the Lord and bring alms to his nation, he had neither gathered a multitude nor caused any tumult; but, while held by centurions, he had cried to the people: "It is concerning the resurrection of the dead, which ye too believe in, that I today stand to be judged." And he affirmed that they could not prove anything like what they, with wicked intentions, had invented about him. By all means, since they were present, they should say if they remembered any other thing done by him that conduced to disorder in the city. The judge Felix put off their hearing until the tribune Lysias should be present, commanding a centurion that Paul, while kept in custody, should be easy, and that he should not prohibit anyone to minister unto him what might contribute to comforting him.
