There remains the Pelagians’ second act of wickedness, because they posit free will to such a degree in human strength that they think that they by themselves, apart from the grace of God, can conceive of some good or do it. But if this were the case, why would the prophet say, “O my God, his mercy will precede me”? When you hear that you were preceded by the mercy of the Lord, one is given to understand that nothing of yours preceded God’s mercy. In another psalm he also says, “Unless the Lord builds the house, they labor in vain who built it.” Again he says, “The steps of a person are directed by the Lord and he delights exceedingly in his way.” In another place the psalmist also attests, “The Lord raises up those who have been broken; the Lord loosens those who have been shackled; the Lord gives light to the blind.” When you hear that the Lord goes before, builds, directs and raises up, unbinds and illumines without any preceeding merits, what of your own do you recognize that you have begun except only that by which you are rightly damned for your haughtiness?… But you interpret these words and others similar to them with the most evil intention, namely, in order that you may believe that people take the beginning of their good will from their own powers and afterwards receive the help of grace, so that (it is wrong for this even to be uttered!) we are the cause of his kindness rather than he being the cause of his own kindness.
