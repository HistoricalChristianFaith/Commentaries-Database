“The rejoicings of the Lord are in their throats, and two-edged swords in their hands to execute vengeance upon the nations, chastisements among the people.” We must observe how beautiful, how useful these differing expressions are. Earlier he said that the saints rejoice in their beds; now he says that the Lord’s rejoicings are set in their throats, the sense being that they never cease to praise, whether in thought or in tongue, him from whom they obtain eternal gifts. He also moves on to explain the power that they wield, with the words “and two-edged swords in their hands.” The two-edged sword is the word of the Lord Savior, of which Christ himself says in the Gospel: “I have come not to send peace to the earth but a sword.” It is a two-edged sword because it contains two Testaments. First it separated Jews from Gentiles; subsequently it segregated and cut off Christians from the enticements of the whole world. There is one sword but two ways of cutting that he grants to the chosen peoples at various selected moments of time. So the prophet says that these swords are in their hands, in other words, in the power of the saints, as Scripture has it: “The word of the Lord came to the hand of Haggai the prophet.” So the blessed ones will assume this power and pass judgment in company with the Lord. As Scripture says, “You shall sit on twelve seats, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.” For note what follows: “To execute vengeance upon the nations, chastisements among the people.” This truly takes place when they shall judge in company with the Lord.
