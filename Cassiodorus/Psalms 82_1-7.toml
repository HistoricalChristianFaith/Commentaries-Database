“The Lord, the God of gods, has spoken and called the earth from the rising of the sun until its setting.” The power of the Lord is proclaimed in advance so that no one might believe that his incarnation ought to be deemed as being of moderate import and so that the depravity of all unbelief may be removed. Human beings who receive the grace of the divine majesty for their good conduct are called “gods,” just as he says in another psalm, “I have said, ‘You are gods and children of the Most High.’ ” Therefore, they are called “children,” just as they are called “gods,” because grace, not nature, offers each title. But the God of the gods is the Lord Christ, for he himself (along with the Father and the Holy Spirit) is truly called God of the gods. Nonetheless, the name “God of gods” does not altogether belong to the Divinity, but as we have already said, human language cannot indicate his exalted stature beyond this.
