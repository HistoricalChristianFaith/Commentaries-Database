“But God is our king before the ages; he has worked salvation in the midst of the earth.” That understanding of Asaph, which the superscription was predicting and foretelling in the spirit of prophecy that the Savior the Lord would come, pertains to the second section and lists in a rhetorical tour de force how many miracles he has done in heaven and on earth. And that he was speaking about his incarnation—lest anyone might think that he was a temporal lord—he attests that he had already been a king before the foundation of the world, as he himself says in the gospel, “I was born in this [age].” For the times are called ages [secula] because they roll back into themselves [in se]. Next comes the phrase, “He worked salvation in the midst of the earth.” Although this can also be understood to refer to the miraculous deeds which he is recognized to have done visibly before people, nonetheless we would take this better to refer to the salvation of souls, which he did through his life-giving preaching.

“You strengthened the sea in your power; you crushed the heads of dragons on the waters.” And truly it would show what he said earlier—namely, that the Lord the Savior was king before the ages, who deigned to suffer for us, so that he would destroy death by dying, bestow freedom to the captives and recompense to the guilty—so he repeats the miracles which he had once done among the nation of the Jews. For he strengthened the watery deeps of the Red Sea, when the water was divided in two walls so as to make the ship-traversing sea into a path of dry land. Next comes “You crushed the heads of dragons on the waters.” The mystery of the earlier miracle explains well enough that that prefigurement of the crossing of the Red Sea was pointing to the waters of Holy Baptism, where the heads of dragons, that is, of unclean spirits, were made nothing because the salvific font makes clean the souls which the demons make unclean with the filth of their sins.
