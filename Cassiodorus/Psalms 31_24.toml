This is the power of the entire psalm and in it the usefulness of the sacred passion is concentrated … namely, that they not be frightened by the sufferings predicted, but that the hearts of the faithful find strength for the glorious imitation that they knew had been introduced to provide the healing of salvation for the world.… So this is an appeal to good people not to withdraw themselves from their good intention because of the weakness of their flesh.… For in this way, the hearts of those who endure are strengthened, if they fortify their hope through the Lord’s power.
