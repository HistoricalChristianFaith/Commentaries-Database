"And the serjeants told these words to the magistrates," etc. When they heard the words of the apostles, the magistrates were very afraid, because the apostles had called themselves innocent Romans sent to prison. Going to the apostles, they besought them to depart unhurt out of their city. Having done so, the apostles came to Lydia and told their brethren, in order, what great things the Lord had granted them. Moving on from there, they came to Thessalonica, where, entering the synagogue, Paul explained to them that, according to the holy Scriptures, the Lord Christ was to suffer for our salvation and quickly to rise again after three days. Many among the people and several noble women, believing in this, are shown to have joined the apostles' faith. The Jews, under the influence of envy, stirred up an uproar and expelled them. Coming to the synagogue, they discussed in their usual manner. The noble people there examined the divine Scriptures very carefully, and a great part of them believed in the Lord Christ.
