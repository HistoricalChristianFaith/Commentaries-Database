The cup of the Lord is at any rate “filled with mixed wine.” Although it is constantly drunk, nonetheless it is never fully drained. But when he says “mixed wine,” he is pointing to the New and Old Testaments, which make a salvific drink for souls when both are mixed. The Jews drink wine only, but not mixed wine, because they do not want to receive the health of the New Testament. The Manichaeans14 also do not drink mixed wine because they partly accept the New Testament but spit out the sacraments of the old law in rash boldness. He added, “And he tips it from this to this.” This absolutely refers to the two peoples, namely the Jews and the Gentiles, because he took the cup from the mouth of the Jews who did not believe and tipped it for the Gentiles nations to drink instead. It is a blessed and secure refreshment to receive the cup of salvation from him, who always knows how to offer beneficial things. This manner of speaking is peculiar to sacred Scripture, since it is scarcely able to be found in secular writings (or at least as I think).
