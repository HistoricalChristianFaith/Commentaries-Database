"Whereupon, O king Agrippa, I was not incredulous to the heavenly vision." As Paul spoke the above-mentioned things, Festus, incredulous, said: "Paul, thou art beside thyself, and much reading confuseth thy mind." Paul, retaining his gravity, replied that he was not beside himself, but had spoken words of truth and soberness; indeed, king Agrippa too must know about those things, for things that had happened publicly had been able to come to his knowledge. He affirmed, too, that Agrippa believed the prophets. Agrippa replied delightfully that Paul wanted quickly to make him a Christian. Paul, with eagerness of charity, wished that both he and the rest of the audience would become such as he himself was, except his bonds. After the assembly was dismissed, they spoke among themselves, saying Paul had done nothing to deserve killing.
