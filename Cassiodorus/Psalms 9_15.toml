When he says that “the Gentiles got stuck,” he means not those who are held by the fear of the Lord, but those who are so pinned down by the nails of their sins that they are not able to cast them off; unyielding bands appear to restrain them.… For we describe as captured those who are entangled by an intricate deceit. “Foot” here refers to the mental steps and the depraved desire which cause men to pursue vice. This is what Solomon says in Proverbs: “Their feet rush into evil and are quick to pour out blood.”
