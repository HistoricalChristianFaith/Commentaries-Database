So in Genesis [sic] he bade Moses say of himself, “Go and say to the children of Israel, I am who I am. He who is has sent me to you.” So he wanted his eternity to be denoted by the present tense. This use of present time (“today”) is acknowledged to be peculiar to the divine Scriptures in the sense of perpetuity.

The phrase “I am” belongs to the divinity. It does not change with time but is always there and remains eternal. So the reply to Moses was “I am who I am” and again “He who is has sent me.” But we must first investigate why God alone claims this term which denotes essence for himself. When it was spoken, there were angels, heavenly creatures and all earthly creatures as were decreed to exist. But because he is the only uncreated and eternal nature which did not begin in time and subsists as one divinity in three persons, God alone is rightly said to be, for he needs no one for his existence but ever abides by the strength of his own power. In it there is another mystery: a single syllable, sum (“I am”), is embraced by three letters, so we are taught that the holy Trinity is one God.
