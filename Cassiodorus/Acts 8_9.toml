"Now there was a certain man named Simon, who before had been a magician in that city," etc. As many became believers, Simon, a magician altogether famous for devilish crafts, seeing such great miracles, speedily desired to be baptized as well; but when the devout in Samaria were receiving the Holy Ghost by the imposition of the apostles Peter and John's hands, Simon offered them money so that they might grant him, too, the power to make people receive the grace of the Holy Ghost by the imposition of his hand. Peter rebuked him as he deserved, saying that he had no part with the faithful, since he imagined the Holy Ghost could be acquired with money. Condemned by such a rejection, Simon asked them with his lips to pray for him, while he did not have it in his heart. As for the apostles, they kept preaching the word of the Lord in many towns of Samaria.
