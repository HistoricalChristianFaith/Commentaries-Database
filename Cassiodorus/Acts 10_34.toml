"And Peter opening his mouth, said," etc. Peter said: "In very deed I perceive that God is not a respecter of persons, but that a man who worketh justice in any nation becometh pleasing to him." Then, continuing with words of the right faith, he preached to them that Jesus Christ was the Lord of all things, whom the Jews had decided to crucify and who, rising again from the dead, had stayed with his disciples for forty days, and all else that the doctrine of the Christian faith required. As he spoke, the Holy Ghost fell on the believers, and those who had come with Peter were overjoyed to see such gifts granted among the Gentiles as well. He then ordered them to obtain the grace of baptism in the name of Christ. As the news spread, the brethren who were in Judea were filled with the greatest joy. Peter, going to Jerusalem, kept preaching the word of the Lord with continued devotion.
