Among the ancients there were two types of triumphs: a greater one having to do with chariots, which was called a laureled triumph; the other, a lesser triumph, was called an ovation. But leaving such things to worldly people, he affirms that he has been exalted in the name of the Lord. For chariot and horse do not exalt, though they seem to glorify people with honors in this world. But it is the Lordâ€™s name which leads to eternal rewards.
