"Now they who had been dispersed by the persecution that arose," etc. They who had been dispersed after Stephen's passion went about as far as Phenice and Cyprus and Antioch, speaking the word to none but the Jews only. But there were nonetheless some among them who, when they were entered into Antioch, spoke words of preaching to the Gentiles, and a great number of the people believed them, and tidings of the matter reached Jerusalem. Barnabas, sent by the apostles, found what had been said about them to be true. He rejoiced greatly and exhorted many people to continue in their undertaken purpose. Hearing, too, that Saul was in Tarsus, Barnabas went to him and, bringing him to Antioch, he is known to have preached with him in the church for a whole year, and is shown to have converted many people. It was there that disciples were first named "Christians". And in these days there came prophets to announce the future famine that came to pass under the emperor Claudius. Mention is made of the disciples sending what they could find to the brethren who dwelt in Judea, by the hands of Barnabas and Paul.
