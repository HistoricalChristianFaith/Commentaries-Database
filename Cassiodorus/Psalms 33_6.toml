If we examine the passage more carefully, he even indicates the holy Trinity here. For by using the term word he reveals the Son, by adding “of the Lord” he speaks of the Father, and with the phrase “by the spirit of his mouth” he surely wants the Holy Spirit to be understood, who proceeded from the Father before all time. And in order that you may understand the unity manifest in three persons, he refers to his mouth, rather than their mouths.
