An oven is a round structure made of bronze for baking bread.… Sinners are rightly compared with it, since at the coming judgment they will be tormented both with mental grief and with punitive pain, because with a stubborn mind they have lived in opposition to the Lord’s laws. The time of the Lord’s anger is the day of judgment when the Son of Man will be seen by all, but only the righteous will look on him also through the contemplation of his divinity.… Earlier, in praise for the Lord Christ, the psalmist described the honor and glory of Christ through the diverse character of his graces. Now … he says that his enemies will be afflicted with various punishments so that they might be rendered as disgusting as he is marvelous.… They will be sentenced to be devoured by undying flames. No delay accompanies the Lord’s command, but as soon as he determines it, it is completed.
