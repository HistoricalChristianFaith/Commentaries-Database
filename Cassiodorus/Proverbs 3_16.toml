As Proverbs has it, “Length of days and years of life are in his right hand,” and this means eternal blessedness, whereas “In his3 left hand are riches and glory,” denoting the good things of this world, though there is no doubt that these can be bestowed by him. Moreover, it is his right side to which the saints are allotted when separated from the rest to obtain their rewards, whereas the left side is that mentioned when sinners are to be condemned to eternal punishment; for the saints have longed for things heavenly, whereas sinners have sought worldly goods. We also read that sinners have given the left hand’s role to their right hand; our prophet is to say of them in Psalm 143: “Their mouth has spoken vanity, and their right hand is the right hand of iniquity.” But the true use of the right hand is where the bestowal of the Lord’s grace is demonstrated.
