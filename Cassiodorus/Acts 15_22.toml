"Then it pleased the apostles, and the ancients, and the whole church, to choose men and to send to Antioch." It pleased the apostles and the ancients who dwelt in Jerusalem to send with Paul and Barnabas to Antioch Judas, who is surnamed Basabas, and Silas, through whom they sent a letter to this effect: they should not believe that the law of circumcision was necessary for them, but they should only abstain from idols, fornication and strangled blood, and trust that they were in a good position if they persevered in the grace of the Lord.
