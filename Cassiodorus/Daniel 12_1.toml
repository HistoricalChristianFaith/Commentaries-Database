The devil is also called a prince, as in the Gospel passage, “Behold, the prince of this world comes, and in me he will not find anything.” Likewise a good angel is called a prince, as we read in Daniel: “Michael your prince.” So they are saying that the hope of humankind must rest in neither wicked nor good angels but in the Lord alone. Even if we love the good angels for the devotion they bestow on us, we praise the Lord’s blessing that they manifest.
