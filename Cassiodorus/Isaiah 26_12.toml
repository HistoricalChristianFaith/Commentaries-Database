“All have fallen.” Anyone who refuses to seek out a strong foundation necessarily falls. “Together they became useless,” namely, with regard to the work for which they were created. “There is none who does good.” There was no one who would do good, because the Jews broke the commandments and the Gentiles spurned the law of nature. When anyone from either party did good, therefore, he knew that he was indebted to grace, not to nature, as the prophet said in reference to the Lord: “in the presence of whom no one is innocent.” Isaiah also says in his canticle: “O Lord our God, you will give us peace, for you have accomplished all of our works in us.” - "Exposition of Romans 3"

So they are truly wise who entrust themselves to the power and dispensation of the Godhead; him alone they seek, and the outcome is all that is good for them. This is the message of the prophet Isaiah: “Lord our God, give us your peace; for you have bestowed all things on us.” Next comes: “And he gave ear to me.” Note that this utterance to the Lord, so short but magnificent in its devotion, sought that he should deign to give ear; what is there that he has failed to give us when out of pity he has granted such a request? For his gaze on us spells deliverance and a bestowal of gifts so great that even the greedy suppliant ceases to beg for them. - "Exposition of the Psalms 76.2"
