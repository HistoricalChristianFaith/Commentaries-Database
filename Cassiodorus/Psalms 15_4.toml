When people swear an oath, they make a promise with God as their witness. But when God himself makes a promise, it is more appropriate to say that he has sworn. For “to swear” means “to speak justly” or “to speak truthfully.” Now a person speaks truthfully when he promises those things which are fulfilled. Therefore God’s swearing consists in making promises and fulfilling them, as it says elsewhere: “The Lord has sworn truthfulness to David, and he will not deceive him.”
