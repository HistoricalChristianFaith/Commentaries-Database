The heart reveals its silent longing, to which the Godhead listens more than to the most thundering voices of nations. He said to Moses, “Why do you cry to me?” although we do not read that Moses had said anything. So the faithful man said that his heart was speaking to the Lord, since he seemed to offer his thoughts by this means.
