We appropriately regard shoe as the gospel preaching, for just as the shoe’s protection wards off troublesome thorns and other injuries from our feet, so the authority of the gospel protects our most glorious way of life, which is often compared with advancing on foot. So fulfilled by such kind help and with the Lord’s protection we can pass through the world without suffering gashes.
