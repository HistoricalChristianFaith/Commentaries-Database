"They will see the death of the wise. The foolish and the senseless will perish as well, and they will leave their riches to others." He thus arrives at the second way of teaching when he says that the sinners of this world will die along with the wise and that their riches, which they loved exceedingly, will be given as an inheritance not to their own but to strangers, which hurts even more. Not even their own heirs would enjoy the possession of those things for which they committed every kind of sin, as Solomon says: "Not even in the things in which they sinned were they able to rejoice." The sinner sees that the wise of this world, like, for example, Solon of Athens, Philo of Lacedemonia, Aristippus, and all the others who were highly praised for worldly wisdom, are not free from death. Rather, he sees that they die, like all those whom he considered to be partakers of divine Wisdom. It then says that "the foolish and the senseless will perish together." It is indeed necessary that the foolish and the senseless perish in desperation, knowing that their wise ones die. Nevertheless, these things must be understood in a more spiritual way. The senseless are those who did not want to listen to the proclamations of the prophets. Rightly called foolish are those who did not want to receive Christ the Lord, even when he came in person. They will perish together, because they will be condemned in the future judgment. The Jews left their riches to strangers, since, having despised the Lord and Savior, the rewards of their salvation passed to other peoples. - "Explanation of the Psalms 48.11"
