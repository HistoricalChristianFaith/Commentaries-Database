"Then Agrippa said to Paul." Then Agrippa gave Paul permission to speak for himself. Paul first praised the judge, then gave a truthful summary of all that had happened to him from the beginning, relating how he had persecuted the Christian people, what he had later heard on his way to Damascus when he was surround by the light of the Lord, and how he had, as was unavoidable, obeyed the Lord's words. He declared that, consequently, he had preached to the people and the Gentiles so that, converting and doing worthy works of penance, they might gain the rewards of eternal life: that was why the angered Jews had determined to kill him. He affirmed that, having been delivered from their hands by the help of the Divinity, he had until that time kept preaching the things that were written in the Prophets and the rest of the divine Scriptures.
