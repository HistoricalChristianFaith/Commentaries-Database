In his regard for the afflicted, he says to the Lord in the manner of human weakness, “Why have you withdrawn far away?” This does not mean that God leaves a place and moves to another location since he is completely present in every place. But God is thought to have withdrawn when he is slow to help.… For we think that we are being spurned if we are put off even for the shortest time. But God’s presence is much more fruitful when he furnishes us with the consolations that come through great patience.
