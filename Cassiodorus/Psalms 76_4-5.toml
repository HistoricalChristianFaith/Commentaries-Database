“You marvelously illuminate from the eternal mountains.” He comes to the second part, where he explains in sequence the various miracles of the Lord. And to keep people from investigating where that illumination comes from, he added, “from the eternal mountains,” that is, from preachers, who are truly eternal mountains because they stand in constant and unchangeable loftiness. Earthly mountains are not permanent and they have no life. But preachers, who are always wise in the task of the Lord, know how to last forever. And he keeps the order of the truth in a beautiful way. He said that Lord illuminates through the eternal mountains, because he himself gave to the prophets and the apostles what was published through the whole world by their holy preaching. And keep in mind that by this epithet “eternal” he keeps separate true preachers from false ones. For the latter cannot be called “eternal” when they teach the corrupt things of their perversity and are destroyed along with their teachings.
