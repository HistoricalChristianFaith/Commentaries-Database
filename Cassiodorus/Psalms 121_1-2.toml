When he says, “I lifted up,” he shows that he had advanced to a certain contemplation. Lifting up is bringing something to higher levels. “My eyes” refers to the sight of the heart. The following has been written about them: “Unveil my eyes and I will consider marvelous things from your law” and “The commandment of the Lord is clear, illuminating the eyes.” If you were to turn those eyes of flesh, what good would it have been if he had chosen to see mountains situated among forests or rough rocks? But if you were to investigate this matter spiritually, it is altogether beneficial that he be believed to have lifted the eyes of his heart either to holy men or to the divine books or to lofty angels. They are truly mountains in their size and solidity. If he sought help from them, he was sustained. But lest we should perhaps put our hope in the mountains previously spoken about, the second verse shows whence truly our help can come: the one arranging all things in a salutary order. Thus, insofar as there is hope in the mountains, it is nonetheless so that we may know that the Lord offers help to us through them. It is the Lord from whom are the needed kindness and salvific protection and unshaken happiness, as the apostle says: “Neither is he who plants anything nor he who waters, but God who gives the growth.” And lest you might think that there is another Lord, since this word is equivocable, he says, “[the Lord] who made heaven and earth,” meaning the Word, through whom all things were made.
