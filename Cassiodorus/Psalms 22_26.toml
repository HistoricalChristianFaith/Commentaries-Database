Note that he wrote only the word poor to indicate those who despised the enticements of this world with the most lavish contempt; not the rich who are stuffed with the happiness of this world, but the poor, namely, those who hunger for God’s kingdom.… The poor praise the Lord, while the rich exalt themselves. The rich collect earthly treasures, while the poor become rich with heavenly abundance. Their resources differ, and each has a completely different mindset. The rich acquire their wealth from this world, but the poor from God.… The poor possess what they could never lose; the rich cling to what not only the dead but even the living frequently lose.
