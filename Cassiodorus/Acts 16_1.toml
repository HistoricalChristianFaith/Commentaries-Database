"And when they had gone round these nations, he came to Derbe and Lystra." When Paul had gone round the above-mentioned nations, he came to Derbe and Lystra, and there found a certain Timothy, a disciple born of a Gentile father. Wishing to take him with him, he circumcised him in order subtly to cut short any uproar from the Jews. As he passed through the cities that he had intended, he delivered to them the Christian decrees that had been established by the rest of the apostles in Jerusalem. As they tried to go to various cities, the Holy Ghost barred them from some places and told them to go elsewhere. For when they came to Troas, Paul saw in a dream a Macedonian saying: "Pass over into Macedonia, and help us". Then they all understood as a fact that their journey had been divinely ordained, and they could only do gladly what the Divinity had thought fit to command.
