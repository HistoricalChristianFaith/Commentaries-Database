This statement, as has been noted, refers to the devil and his followers.… For when he gives the command, “pray for your enemies,” this statement does not apply to people. Thus, he asks that they be condemned whom he knows by virtue of his foreknowledge would not come to the remedies of repentance. For in what follows, when he turns his attention to people, he desires that they be converted, not that they perish.
