The hand that applies the lashes is oppressive to the sinner, and the hand that avenges is heavy. “Day and night” indicate continuous time so that the hand which did not draw back from punishment was rightly felt to be heavy. He would not have experienced this type of humiliation with such a happy demeanor unless it had been the hand of the Godhead that had pressed upon him.
