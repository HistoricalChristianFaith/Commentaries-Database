"But they said to him: We neither received letters concerning thee from Judea," etc. The Jews replied to Paul that they had had no opportunity to learn either by letters or by a messenger the things that he had just told; but they asked him, instead, to let them know what he had preached in other places. A day was appointed and when they came to Paul's lodgings, he spoke of the kingdom of the Lord Christ, who had clearly been promised by Moses and the Prophets. While some agreed, others were unbelieving and Paul, reproving them, quoted an example from Isaiah, declaring that the Gentiles would receive the salvation that they refused to receive. This statement caused the Jews to have no small reasoning among themselves. As for Paul, remaining two years in his own hired lodging, he continually instructed those who came to him about the kingdom of the Lord Jesus Christ: though bound with iron chains, he daily loosed believers' bonds of sins.
