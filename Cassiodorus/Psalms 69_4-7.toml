The phrase “It was made a reproach against me” follows. The good are always a reproach to the wicked, because the good by no means acquiesce to the crimes of the wicked and withdraw from them and are not joined them by any association. They attest to those reproaches, boxings of the ears, scourgings and spittings, which our Lord the Savior endured at the hands of the maddened mob.
