This is a short psalm, but it annihilates the boundless wickedness of pagans who believe that the glory of the heavenly majesty could not have descended to the humility of suffering. How foolish they are. For their thinking is confounded by the Source of the world’s realization that it has been freed! As Paul says, “Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am the chief.”
