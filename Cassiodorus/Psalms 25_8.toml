The Lord is sweet, because while he surpasses all in his kindnesses, he still waits for the sinner’s conversion.… He is upright since, after frequent rebukes and very long periods of waiting, he opposes the wicked and humbles the proud and profane in order that they may at length become wise and regret that they have gone astray. That he established a law was surely in keeping with his sweetness and uprightness, for those whom he did not want to go astray, he preferred to correct through the proclamation of a law. But so that someone might not believe that this came as a punishment derived from God’s harshness, he laid out the purpose of the law that was brought forth, its goodness and sweetness. “On the way,” that is, in the present life, a law is established through which we are admonished to live righteously.
