Anger that does not lead to deeds motivated by anger is easily forgiven, as Scripture says: “He that conquers his anger is better than he who captures a city.” For this reason, the command to manage anger is given so that, if we are already angry, we may not sin through an act of indiscreet rashness. Because of our human brokenness we are not able to get complete control of our hot emotions, but with God’s help, we contain them by the power of reason that we are taught. So the blessed prophet permitted what is typical behavior, but forbade what incurs guilt. For if we should become angry and not restrain ourselves through our consciousness of the Lord, but instead should be kept from our wish by some obstacle we cannot avoid, then we must certainly bear the guilt for the action, even if are unable to carry out what we wanted. Another interpretation that finds favor with some is this: we ought to be angry at our past sins, so that we can escape evil in the present. For we cannot turn away new sins unless we condemn old ones with a curse that is truly worthy of praise. For what is repentance but being angry at oneself, so that one is horrified at what he has done and torments oneself, so that the angry judge may not be the one to do it.
