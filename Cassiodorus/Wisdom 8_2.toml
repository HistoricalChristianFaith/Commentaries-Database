"Your wife like a fertile vine within your home, and your sons like olive plants around your table." Once again the literal sense must be avoided here. We see in fact that many very holy men have neither wife nor sons and that the wicked have all that. How then can this part of the blessing be applied, which you know often does not pertain to the good but to the bad? "Wife" has the sense of sister. For this reason, as the wife of the blessed man one must understand wisdom, as Solomon says, "Who sought to take her as a wife." And elsewhere, "Love her, and she will watch over you. Do not abandon her, and she will care for you." She is therefore the wife of the righteous, who captivates her husband with a chaste embrace. - "Explanation of the Psalms 127.3"

EXPLANATION OF THE PSALMS 127:3.Mary Is Beautiful Like Wisdom. Andrew of Crete: Foreseeing you, the prophet Isaiah exclaimed by divine inspiration, “See, the virgin will be with child.” And, “The root of Jesse will be raised.” And, “Blessed is the root of Jesse.” And, “A shoot shall sprout from the stump of Jesse, a shoot will grow from his roots.” Because of you the great Ezekiel proclaimed, “Here is the door toward the east. The door will be closed, and no one may enter by it. Only the Lord God will enter and leave by it, and the door will remain closed.” Prophesying of you, the beloved man30 calls you a mountain, saying, “A stone taken from you, without human hands,” hewn but not cut, removed but not split by the assumption of our humanity. You are the greatness of that awesome economy “into which angels desire to look.” You are the beautiful dwelling of the descent of God, the land truly desired. In fact, “the king desired the glory of your beauty” and was enamored with the riches of your virginity: he made his dwelling in you, “and dwelled among us” and through you reconciled us with God the Father. You are the treasury of the “mystery hidden from ages past.” You are truly the living book of the spiritual Word, silently written in you with the life-giving pen of the Spirit. You alone are truly the book, written by God, of the new covenant that God once established with humanity. You are that “chariot of God in its tens of thousands,” you who have led thousands of those gladdened by the incarnate one. You are Mount Zion, the fertile mountain, the rugged mountain, “that God has chosen as his dwelling,” from whom he who is above all being took shape and was formed in our flesh endowed with an intellectual soul.
