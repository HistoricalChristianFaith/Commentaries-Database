"But Peter standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice, and spoke to them," etc. But blessed Peter, standing up with the eleven apostles, spoke with a loud voice, saying that, seeing it was but the third hour of the day, they were not, as some thought, drunk with must, but rather filled with the honor of the Holy Ghost. He also supported this claim with a quote from the prophet Joel, so as to declare to them that the knowledge exhibited by the disciples was not to be ascribed to intoxication but truly to divine mercy. Then, he condemned the wickedness of the Jews, who chose to crucify the Lord Christ, whom God, loosing the laws of hell, raised up from the dead. This is also supported by an example from Psalm 15.
