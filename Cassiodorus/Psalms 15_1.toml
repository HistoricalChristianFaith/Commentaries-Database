Unlike some of the psalms, this one is not shrouded in darkness, but here the Lord responds to the prophet’s question following the pattern of the Decalogue, indicating that one reaches his blessed hall by ten virtues.… This is that divine Decalogue, a spiritual psaltery of ten strings. This is a number befitting of a crown, which only the one who destroyed the world’s vices together with his Father was able to fulfill. Let us constantly ask for his almighty power so that we who are not able to fulfill what has been commanded may be able to do them once we have been enriched by his gift.
