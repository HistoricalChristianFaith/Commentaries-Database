These incidents are quite well known from our reading of Exodus, for quails rained down like the heaviest shower, and the Jews received manna to get their fill. But to demonstrate that this was a prefiguration, he spoke not of manna but of the bread of heaven, so that the Lord Savior’s coming could be visualized in this blessing, for he is “the living bread which came down from heaven.” The meaning of manna, as was stated at Psalm 77, is “What is this?” He disposed of the problem surrounding the name, and with the statement “He filled them with the bread of heaven,” he explained the answer to the question about manna, for the Lord of heaven is indicated by the phrase, and the nature of manna is clearly acknowledged.
