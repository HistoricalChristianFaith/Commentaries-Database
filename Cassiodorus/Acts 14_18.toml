"And as they stayed there and taught, there came thither certain Jews from Antioch," etc. As Paul and Barnabas were staying in Lystra surrounded by great devotion from the citizens, there came some utterly wicked Jews, who, persuading the multitude, pelted Paul with stones and drew him out of the city, as if he were dead. But he rose and, with his disciples, entered safe and sound and with unconquered confidence the city from which he had been expelled. On the next day, he departed with Barnabas to Derbe, where, preaching the word, he converted many people to the Lord. From there they returned again to Lystra, Iconium and Antioch, confirming the spirits of disciples, so that they should continue resolutely in the rules they had been taught. Then, ordaining priests to them, they prayed with fasting and left them to the Lord, entrusting them to him in a holy way.
