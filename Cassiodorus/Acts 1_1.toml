"The former treatise I made, O Theophilus, of all things which Jesus began to do and to teach," etc. Having completed the treatise of the Gospel, which Luke says he did after the Lord's Resurrection, he declares, writing to Theophilus, that he has also collected the Acts of the Apostles, so that the undoubted perfection of the Christian faith may be made apparent by the most reliable witness accounts. Luke starts by saying that Jesus Christ, when he was about to ascend to the Father, commanded his disciples that they should not depart from Jerusalem, so that, although they had been baptized, they should be filled with the fullness of the Holy Ghost.
