Next comes “May the haughtiness of those who hate you always ascend to you.” We note that this has been aptly spoken concerning the Romans, about whom he says earlier, “In the middle of your hall they have placed their standards,” in order to move the Almighty Judge most vehemently against the enemies of Jerusalem. Their haughtiness is what the Lord especially curses, for through it both the angel fell and the blessed state of the first man departed. And consider how wisely the sharpest vice was placed last so that he might say after everything that one item what would be kept in the confines of memory. Thus those who have been devoted to the Lord with a pure mind deplore simply and wisely; thus those who obey the godly rules pour forth their complaint, although they do not know how to be deceived by their grief, however excessive it is.
