"And when Silas and Timothy were come from Macedonia, they were earnest that Paul's preaching," etc. When Silas and Timothy were come from Macedonia to Corinth, where Paul was, he was earnestly teaching the word of the Lord; but as some Jews would not listen, he shook his garments and said to them: "Let the Lord Christ's blood that was shed weigh you down; for my part I will, as I have been commanded, go forthwith to instruct the Gentiles. "And departing for the house of a certain Titus, he then taught the ruler of the synagogue, Crispus, and the latter received the commandments of the Christian faith along with all his house and many other people. One night, the Lord said to Paul in a dream: "Do not fear the wishes of contradictors; I am with thee, and I permit no man to overcome thee. "This reminder gave him strength, and he stayed for a year and six months in the same city, teaching confidently. Because of his new preaching, he was brought by the Jews to the judgement seat of proconsul Gallio. But Gallio, saying that questions of divine law did not concern him, turned them out of doors and sent them away. After several days, Paul took leave of the brethren and came to Ephesus with Aquila and Priscilla. There, though many people begged him to stay, he could not remain very long, as he was hastening towards Jerusalem for the festival of Pentecost.
