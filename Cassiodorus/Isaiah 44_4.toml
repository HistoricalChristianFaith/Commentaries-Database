The willow is a type of saintly and faithful persons. As Isaiah puts it, “There shall spring up, as it were, grass in the midst of water, and the willow in ever-flowing water.” So it is on people like these that we hang our instruments, when we bestow them by sharing the grace from reading from the divine Scriptures. Our instruments are the means of bestowing the grace of psalmody and the cause of our joy when it is bestowed on us in turn.
