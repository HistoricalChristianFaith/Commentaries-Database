In human usage, light and fountains are quite distinct, or rather, in opposition to one another, since a fountain snuffs out the light of flames. But with God, these two images find a unity even though whatever you might say about him is both true and also ultimately inadequate. We say that God is Light, because “he enlightens every person who comes into the world”; he is a Fountain, because he satisfies the hungry and empty.… This verse properly says about the Savior, “in your light we will see light”; namely, the light of the Father and of the Holy Spirit, since through the Son’s preaching the entire Trinity was revealed to us.
