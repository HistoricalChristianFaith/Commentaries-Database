Let us consider how this psalm closes with such a sweet and fitting end, indicating with a single word the benefits of the Lord that even volumes cannot explain.… “Your good will”: since the Lord’s call precedes any merit, and he does not find anyone worthy, but makes him worthy, it is described as a gracious call; otherwise, it would have been called just. So this is his good will that calls us and draws us to God. We are not able to think or to do anything that is beneficial unless we receive this from the Author of goodness. Thus, as the Apostle says, “For we cannot think anything of ourselves, as if there is something originating from ourselves, but our sufficiency is from God.”
