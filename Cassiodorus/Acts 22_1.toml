"Men, brethren, hear ye the account which I now give unto you," etc. Paul, being inclined to simplicity of heart, told the people, in order, how he had been chosen by the Lord when he was a persecutor of the church; he did not even fail to mention, with a broken heart, his crime relating to Stephen's blood; but he said that he had heard from the Lord, whom he could not oppose, that he would be sent to preach to the Gentiles. The Jews, who had been listening thus far, began to shout loudly to the tribune that a man trying to convince them of such things should be removed from the living.
