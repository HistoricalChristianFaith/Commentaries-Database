"And after some days, Drusilla, Felix's wife, who was a Jew." After some days, Felix, at the request of his wife Drusilla, had Paul brought before her. As Paul discussed much about faith in the Lord and about justice, and chastity, and about the judgement to come, Felix, moved by the truth of his preaching, said to him: "For this time, go thy way; and when I have a convenient time, I will make sure thou art present." And he summoned him frequently, believing that he could take money from him as was done in secular matters. Meanwhile, when two years were ended, Felix had for successor Portius Festus; and, to please the Jews, Felix left Paul in bonds. Then, when Festus came to Caesarea, both Paul and the Jews who persecuted him were presented before him, and he sat in the judgement seat. Paul declared that he had done harm to no one, wondering why he was suffering such hate and persecution; and he therefore proclaimed that he should be sent to Caesar. Festus briefly replied: "Since thou hast appealed to Caesar, thou shalt go to Caesar".
