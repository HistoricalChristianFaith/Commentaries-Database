"Now when day was come, there was no small stir among the soldiers," etc. Now when day was come, a great argument arose among the prison guards as to how Peter had escaped so many watches of men and so many chains. When Peter could not be found, Herod became violently angry with the guards, whom he ordered to be put on trial. Herod himself went down to Caesarea and Judea. He was angry with the people, but they managed to placate him with great supplication, rescuing Blastus the chamberlain. There Herod, sitting on the judgement seat in kingly apparel, spoke overproud words against the Lord; therefore an angel of the Lord struck him because he had not given glory to God; and Herod, swarming with worms, gave up the ghost. With such things being seen by people, faith in the Lord was everywhere on the rise. Barnabas and Saul, taking with them John, who was surnamed Mark, left Jerusalem for Antioch, where one could see a blessed group of prophets and doctors. The Holy Ghost told these not to detain Barnabas and Saul, but to let them perform the task for which they were seen to have been chosen. Barnabas and Saul, coming to Salamina, preached throughout the island all the way to Paphos the word that the Lord had thought fit to entrust to them. Meanwhile they found a false prophet, a Jew named Bar-jesu. This man tried to oppose Barnabas and Saul when they were with the proconsul Sergius and Paulus, a prudent man; but, subdued by the Lord's power, he achieved nothing.
