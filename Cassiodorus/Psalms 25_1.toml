This is the first psalm laid out by the Hebrew alphabet.… In the course of the whole book, there are two types of these psalms. The first is the type which is shown to contain the entire alphabet, as Psalms 111, 112 and 119.… The other type is the one that omits letters … such as the present psalm and Psalms 34, 37 and 145.… The alphabetic acrostics are not known as something unusual in the divine Scriptures, for Jeremiah also lamented the captivity of Jerusalem with a lament which repeated the alphabet four times. By doing this, he taught that the sacraments, which are the letters, also indicate for us the mysteries of heavenly matters.… In the entire psalm, the church prays in marvelous supplication, using the figure known as ethopoeia, that it might not appear in God’s view to be despicable to its enemies. In the first part, the church asks that it may understand the Lord’s instructions and ways. This section contains five letters of the alphabet which we noted. In the second part, the church requests the benefits that he has granted to the holy fathers from beginning of the world; in the third part, the church says that those who keep the Lord’s commands are worthy of eternal rewards; it attests that it remains constantly in the same desire; this is where the psalm contains the remaining nine letters.
