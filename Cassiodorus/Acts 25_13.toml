"And after some days, king Agrippa and Bernice came down to Caesarea." After some days, king Agrippa and Bernice came to Caesarea to salute Festus; and as they stayed with him for some time, Festus told king Agrippa, in order, the events that had taken place involving a certain Jew named Paul, and declared that the man, oppressed by the dishonesty of the Jews, had appealed to Caesar. Then, as Agrippa wished to see him, Festus promised he would hear him on the next day without fail.
