He rightly made an appeal for the Lordâ€™s justice, since he knew that he would suffer at the hands of the unjust. What a truly amazing and divine exchange! He received death and gave salvation in return; he endured injuries and distributed honors; he took upon himself pain and conferred safety. He is both unique and fully devoted who offered sweet things when he received what was bitter.
