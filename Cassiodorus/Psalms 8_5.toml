From here on the humility and glory of the Lord Savior is related. He was made less not because of any necessity inherent in his role as servant, but by his loving free wish; as the Apostle says, “He emptied himself, taking the form of a servant.” The psalm continues with the words “a little less than angels,” because Christ took up the cross to win the salvation of all, since it was for this reason that the Creator of angels was made less than angels. The words “a little less” are well stated, since he took on himself a mortal body, though he had no sin. He “was crowned with glory and honor” when, after his utterly miraculous resurrection, as God he was exalted in as much as he had been made man, and he received the trust of the whole world.
