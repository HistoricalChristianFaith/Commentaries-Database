Blessed are those who will go through the days mentioned before and will exceed them by 45 days; that is, When the evils are completed, there will be rest for the people and the end of their afflictions. According to others: 1, days, that is, “Jesus Christ, Great Savior”—if you count the letters of these four words, they give the name cited above; that is, [Daniel] has received the revelation that he will encounter and see Jesus, etc. Severus says, “Happy are those who persevere” in order to see the days in which his economy is fulfilled, after his baptism to his ascension, and in which he has been pleased with his aspect and miracles, [days] that will make 1,335. Theodoret31 asserts that these three years and a half constitute the time when the antichrist will reign at the end, and the 45 days the time beginning from the moment in which “the son of perdition” will be condemned, and Elijah will triumph and will drive all people away from the [antichrist], will admonish the Jews and will pray our Lord until he appears from heaven.
