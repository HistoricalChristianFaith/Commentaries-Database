The words “come up to the valley of Jehoshaphat” will not gather them and bring them down, but he will let them accomplish their plan. In fact, he talks about the people over whom the house of Gog rules. “To the valley of Jehoshaphat,” that is, to the valley of judgment. “Jehoshaphat” is interpreted as judgment and sentence.
