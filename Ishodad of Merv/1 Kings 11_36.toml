The words “so that David may always have a lamp” refer to that small part of the kingdom which was like the sun in the abundance of its light: “Your throne will be like the sun before me.” Moreover, as we light many firebrands from a lamp, so a large number [of kings] will descend from the royal lineage of David “until he, to whom kingship belongs, comes.”
