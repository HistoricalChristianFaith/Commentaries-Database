quote='''
The author signifies by “the lion” those powerful men who inspire people with fear, as lions do. By “lioness” he means their wives, who were evil and inspired fear simply by speaking. In the same manner, their children were arrogant and quite cruel. All these have perished. They were extinguished instantly.
