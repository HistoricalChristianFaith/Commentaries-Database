“The money for the assessment.” [The Scripture] uses [this term] for the money which is voluntarily given by the people for the “assessment” of their own person and whose payment has survived from the time of Moses who, after the [Israelites] were counted in the census, prescribed that four zouzē should be deducted from each of them. This form of contribution was perpetuated up to the days of our Lord as a memory of the kindness of God toward them. But at the time of our Lord they only gave two zouzē, because they had become poor.
