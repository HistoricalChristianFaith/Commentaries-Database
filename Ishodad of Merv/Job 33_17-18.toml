The words “that he may turn them aside from their deeds” means this: by way of those [dreams and visions] God keeps people from shameful actions. The words “he covers the body of man” [mean] sometimes he brings on righteous diseases and pains as well, in order to preserve him in this manner from the punishment of perdition.
