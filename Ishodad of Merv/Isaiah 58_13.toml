“If you call the sabbath a delight,” in other words, you honor it for the banquets and the drinks, finding your joy on that day as if it were a party. “If you honor it, not following your will or speaking any word.” Indeed, it was not forbidden to them to speak but it was forbidden to lie. And by the word will he does not prohibit them from doing their own will, but from acting according to a will that is contrary to the will of God. By mentioning the sabbath, he alludes to all the commandments of the law.
