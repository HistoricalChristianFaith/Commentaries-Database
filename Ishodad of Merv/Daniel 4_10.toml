“Its top,” that is, of the tree, is his thoughts and the pride of his spirit. “Its foliage” is his army. “Its fruits” are his nobles. “The animals of the fields and the birds” are the nations and kingdoms that he has subdued. “From it all living beings were fed” are because the silver and gold that were for the benefit of people were coined by his mint. “A holy watcher” is one of the spiritual beings. “Its branches” is his dominion. “Its stumps and roots” is said because his sovereignty will last until his return. “With bands of iron and bronze in the grass of the field” are the words because when he is in the desert and feeds on vegetables, his sovereignty will stay with him in this manner, like something bound with iron and bronze.
