“Ho, everyone who thirsts, come to the waters,” that is, you, who are deprived of any kind of good, run to the fear of God, because you will be educated through the doctrine that comes from me; even though you possess nothing better, at least pay “the price,” which is repentance, and buy the virtue of the fear of God thanks to the generosity that [comes] from his mercy. This is what the words “without money and without price” mean.
