“Job would sanctify them,” that is, Job purified them through the waters of cleansing and through the sacrifices that he offered for them. And since the righteous man had full confidence in the fact that his children were free from manifest sins, thanks to the education and instruction which he had given them, he offered sacrifices for their secret sins and thoughts by saying, “It may be that my children have sinned and cursed God in their hearts.”
