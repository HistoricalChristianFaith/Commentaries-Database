How can God say that he will always be in this temple when he threatens to destroy the house? The gifts of God are without second thoughts, as far as it depends on him, but our wickedness turns them away from us. In fact, he does not simply give gifts but gives them in order that we may repent. That is why he says in Jeremiah, “And if I shall pronounce a decree on a nation and kingdom, to rebuild and to plant it, and they do evil before me, so as not to listen to my voice, then I will repent of the good that I spoke of, to do it to them.”
