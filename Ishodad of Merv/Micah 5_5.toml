“We will raise against them seven shepherds and eight princes.” By means of the events that happened in the days of Hezekiah, at the time of the ruin of the Assyrians, Micah provides information about those things that will happen through the agency of Zerubbabel toward the people of the house of Gog. By the numbers seven and eight he has indicated the complete and total destruction that befell the Assyrians through the intervention of the angel. The allusion is to the words of Ecclesiastes: “Cast your bread upon the waters, for you will find it after many days. Give a portion to seven, or even to eight, for you know not what evil may happen on earth.”However, others suppose that he means by “seven shepherds” the prophets who lived before the invasion of the Assyrians, who prophesied their ruin, and that he means by the “eight princes of men” Hezekiah and the princes who assisted him.…
The phrase “seven shepherds” may indicate the fullness of the punishment that the Assyrians will undergo through the agency of the angel, while “eight bites of men” indicates what was in store for the survivors after their flight. What happened was that the Assyrian king was murdered by his sons and the others were exterminated by their fellow citizens.… From the spiritual point of view the verse applies to Satan, the abolisher of the law and the gospel, who was defeated by the prophets, the apostles and the angels.
