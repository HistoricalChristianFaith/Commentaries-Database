There are different opinions about this coldness in David’s body. Some say, “[That was] due to the fact that he was a child of old age, [who was born] after all his brothers, so that, as the body of his father had already become cold with age, so he also, while getting old, grew weak and cold.” But we actually see that in all generations the children born from old parents are often stronger than those who were generated in youth. Others say, “[That coldness] derived from his extremely old age, and from his prolonged fast and the mortifying of the flesh and the abstinence that he had imposed on himself as a penitence for his sin.” However, “Caleb was eighty-five years old and still possessed the vigor of youth,” as he himself declared. And, among other things, David was not so old, as at that time he was only seventy. Others say, “He had become cold as a consequence of his numerous toils and wars.” But the true reason is that taught by the School: “It was because of the fright [caused by] the vision of the angel, who appeared to him in a terrifying manner, that his body withered and grew cold as a consequence of his fear, as is attested in the book of the Chronicles as well.” And this is what Daniel says too: “At the sight of you my bowels were turned within me, and so how could I continue to live?” Therefore the same happens to David: after he saw the angel holding his sword, who entered Jerusalem to destroy it, the warmth fled and the coldness reigned over his body.
