“The sanctuary was cast to the ground.” Indeed, when Antiochus gets into Jerusalem and kills forty thousand [inhabitants] and rapes the women, he then enters the temple, destroys the candlestick, breaks the table of the breads of the presence and all the vessels of the sanctuary, builds an altar to Zeus inside the temple, which he calls “temple of Zeus,” and offers a pig to him. He gets into the treasury, where he steals eighteen hundred golden talents and the vessels of the cult. When he departs from [the city], he leaves behind some immoral men in order to overturn the prescriptions and laws of the righteous.
