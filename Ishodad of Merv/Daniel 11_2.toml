After Cyrus, who reigned first, there were numerous kings in Persia until those three. But the angel indicates by “three kings” those who were called with the name Darius, because there were only three kings who had the same name Darius. And by revealing through whom the kingdom of the Persians would have ceased, he says, “The fourth shall be far richer than all of them,” that is, Darius, who became more powerful than all his predecessors; “and when he has become strong,” this Darius, he means, “in his homeland,” in power and riches, “he shall stir up,” that is, he will cause Alexander, of the house of the Greeks, to march against him.
