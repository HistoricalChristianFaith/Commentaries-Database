“But you, O Bethlehem, you are too little for what you are.” That is, even though in comparison with your enemies you are little in force and number and incapable to lead “the thousand of Judah,” yet, thanks to the help that I give you, the powerful ruler will be able to make war against them. For I have destined him to that from the beginning, through the promises already made to David. This is said with the usual reference to Zerubbabel, but its true meaning has been revealed in Christ, because when he appeared, all the promises made to Abraham and David were fulfilled.
