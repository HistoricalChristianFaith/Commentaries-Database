The words, “He will cover the light with his hands” [mean] that when he wants to make the rain fall for the sake of earth, he condenses the air as if with his hands and covers the sun with clouds. And the words “he will go toward them so that they may come to meet him” [mean] that in the same instant in which his command goes to his works, they promptly come to meet him, that is, the performance instantly follows the command.
