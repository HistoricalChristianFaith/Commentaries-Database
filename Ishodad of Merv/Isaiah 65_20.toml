“For the child shall die a hundred years old, and the sinner a hundred years old shall be accursed.” Some authors understand these words as referring to the time after the return from exile. For a hundred years their prosperity lasted, and then the Macedonian kings rose against them. This is clearly explained in the book of the Maccabees.
