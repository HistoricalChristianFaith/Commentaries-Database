“I will rise in authority among peoples,” because of the stupefaction for all that has happened to me. And the words, “I will be a veil on their faces,” that is, whoever hears about my horrible misfortunes will veil his face. This is said as an analogy of the fact that when one hears a horrible thing, he brings his hand to his forehead and veils his eyes.
