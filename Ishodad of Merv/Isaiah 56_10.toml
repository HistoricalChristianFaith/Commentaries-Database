“They are all stammering dogs” who stutter the praise of God and “cannot bark” against the idols, as against strangers. “They dream, lay down and love to slumber,” that is, they love to sleep in the graves and in the places where sacrifices are offered to demons, and there they expect from them visions, dreams and ghosts.
