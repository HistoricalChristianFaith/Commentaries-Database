The words “there was nothing in the ark except the two tablets of stone” does not mean that the author did not know that there were also the jar [containing the manna], the staff [of Aaron], and so forth. He simply wants to signify all the rest by mentioning the most important part, because he writes for the Jews who already knew the other objects.
