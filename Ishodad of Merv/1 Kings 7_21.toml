[The Scripture] calls the [pillar] on the south “Jachin,” indicating through it the humility of the priesthood; while the one on the north, called “Boaz,” signifies the power of kingship. It is possible that in Hebrew the two pillars indicate the two powers. The capitals at their top symbolize the power that is due to priests and kings and the weights of government, which are imposed on them. The sculptures, the lily work and the garlands of flowers signify the brightness and dignity of priesthood and kingship.
