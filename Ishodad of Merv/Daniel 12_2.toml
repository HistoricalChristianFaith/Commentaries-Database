“And many of those who sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake,” that is, many of those who lie among afflictions and are prostrated by their misfortunes, that is, the Maccabees—“some to everlasting life,” that is, their patience and justice will make them rejoice in the life in the two worlds, and, in addition, it will make them illustrious through a precious memory in all the centuries after those, in which they lived—“and some to destruction and the opprobrium of their fellow citizens,” that is, the impious and scandalous priests will be given to punishment because of their crimes, and they will leave an evil and accursed name to their fellow citizens forever.
