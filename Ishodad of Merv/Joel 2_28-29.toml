“I will pour out my spirit on all flesh.” In the first instance he talks about Ezekiel, Daniel, Haggai, Zechariah and other prophets whose names are not mentioned. In addition, “your daughters” will sing and intone psalms in happiness, as well as the rest of the people. This means I will openly reveal to you my fondness and will largely pour it onto you. Therefore these words follow: “My Spirit abides among you,” and also, “My spirit shall not abide in man forever, for he is flesh.” But the truth of these words is found in Christ and in the apostles, as well as in the prophets and in the righteous ones, who were filled with the Spirit, and in the daughters of Philip. Recall Peter, who testifies when he preaches to the Jews: “This is,” he says, “what Joel predicted.” Then the words: “The sun shall be turned to darkness and the moon to blood.” He talks according to the state of mind of those who are plunged into their afflictions.
