“The host was given over,” so that “the regular burnt offering” that is, the sacrifices and offerings, were abolished and removed from their place. They were called so, because they had been established since the days of Moses and had continued constantly, or because the Jews offered sacrifices in the morning and the evening; and they came to an end as a consequence of the intervention of that criminal. “The place of his sanctuary,” that is, he destroyed, scattered and overturned the vessels and adornments of the house of the Lord.
