“Your wickedness affects others like you.” If one asks, “Why does God judge [the wicked] if their sin does not harm him personally?” [the author] brings forward the reason and says, “Because of the multitude of oppressions people cry out; they call for help.” It is not for him, he says, that the [impious] are punished, but because of those who are oppressed and robbed and cry out to him, so that he may take revenge on those who compel them to suffer afflictions.
