“They will hatch adders’ eggs.” Also the children, whom they have generated, are evil and want to be even more harmful than their parents. “And they have woven a spider’s web.” As the threads woven by the spider catch the flies, so their schemes catch the poor amid the trials, which they organize arbitrarily. According to Qatraya, he calls “spider’s web” their faith in the idols, which is of no use for the [spiders] on the day when they are caught. Through the words “adders’ eggs,” he shows their venomousness and iniquity, and through “spider’s web,” their weakness.
