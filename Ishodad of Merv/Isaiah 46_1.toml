“Bel” and “Nebo” are Babylonian idols. Bel is the statue that Nebuchadnezzar erected in the plain of Dura; its name derives from “Babel.” Nebo was the teacher of the school for children in Mabbugh; since he was extremely stern toward the children, one of them, in order to please him, made a statue for him, and they worshiped it and so appeased his anger; and after this generation, people were seduced by that statue, and worshiped it and called it god.
