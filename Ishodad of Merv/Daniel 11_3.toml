“And [Alexander] shall arise,” he says, “and will kill [Darius] and will take action as he pleases,” and nobody will rise against him. This Darius, son of Arshak, was the tenth king after Cyrus, and in his sixth year Alexander marches against him and kills him. Alexander, when he came to Jerusalem, enters the temple, worships God and honors the temple with many gifts.
