If it is true that Moses knew Job, why did he never mention him in any of his works? It is evident that [Job] lived before the law, because we know that in every time, in every place and in every person, the knowledge of God exists without the need of a human instruction, as is attested by [Job’s] friends, who composed a high doctrine on God. Evagrius says, … There is no time in which virtue did not exist, nor a time in which it will not exist.
