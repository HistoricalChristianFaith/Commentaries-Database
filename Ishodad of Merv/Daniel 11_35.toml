When the priests, who give scandal, that is, the wise ones with regard to evil … are overturned and fall, they will become a furnace of testing before everybody’s eyes, and it will be recognized that because of their evil actions punishment has come over them and more evils are forthcoming. “And may understand until the time of the end,” that is, everybody will consider and understand, with regard to the evils that will befall them, that they come according to justice until the time of the end, because evilness has “still an interval” to gain its successes.
