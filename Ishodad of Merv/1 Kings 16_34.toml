Jericho remained in ruins as a sign and memory of the power of God and the victory of the people of Israel. But the insolent Ahab decided to refute the words of Joshua and said, “As the words of his master Moses, who said, ‘The sky over your head shall be bronze and the earth under you iron’3 did not happen, so the words of his disciple will not happen.” However, when [the city] was re-established at the cost of Abiram’s death, his firstborn, the people feared God and showed him that he was not allowed to rebuild the city, so he stopped. But, a bit later, he attributed all these events to chance and resumed his work by setting the gates of the city. Then Segub, his youngest son, died. For this reason Elijah burned with zeal and stopped heaven for three and a half years.
