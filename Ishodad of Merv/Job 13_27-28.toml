“You observe the strength of my feet.” The words “you observe” signify God’s consideration, because we keep our eye on what we care for. And the words “my feet” refer to the firmness, because feet are supports. But these words are also analogous to the roots of the plants. That is, you have sent me tribulations and imposed them on me with force and care.
