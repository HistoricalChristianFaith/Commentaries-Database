The house that Solomon built for the [Lord] was sixty cubits long,‚Äù that is, the double of the tabernacle. It is extremely likely that it included two rooms, an interior and an exterior. The interior was twenty cubits long, while the exterior was forty cubits. [The house] was built on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite, which David had bought together with the garden. David had prepared the materials for the construction of the house, as the book of Chronicles reports.
