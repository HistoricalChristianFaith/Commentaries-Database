Joab runs to the tent for two reasons: first of all, in order to escape his death, if possible; second, because he imagined that, if he were killed in that place, the tent of God would become polluted as a consequence of his death, and the people would rise up against Solomon, so that, since he had not been able to harm him during his life, he conspired to cause a rebellion at his death. This can be compared with what the demons who entered the swine did in order that the owners of the herd might become enraged and might kill our Lord; but it did not happen as they had planned. That is why Solomon, in the same manner, acting in accordance with the commandment of the law, “Take him, who has sinned, from my altar for execution,” forcing Joab to get out so that the innocent blood which he had shed without reason was avenged.
