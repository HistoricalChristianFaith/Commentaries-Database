“Your brothers who hate you.” Consider them as your brothers, he says, even though they hate you because of your faith, and lead them to the fear of God, so that “the Lord may be glorified in you.” According to Henana, consider them to be execrable and evil, he says, even though they are your brothers by nature. “When they are cast out for my name, the Lord will be glorified” in you, “and they will be put to shame,” and maybe, he says, they will be put to shame because of that and will abstain from evil actions.
