“He shall give them up until the time when she who is in labor has brought forth.” This is what the prophet calls Jerusalem. This means he will abandon them to the afflictions of captivity until the time of the return. This means that these predictions will not come true before they are back from their captivity. Henana of Adiabene says “she who is in labor” means Jerusalem because she is in the pains of labor, which are her afflictions, and waits the birth of her salvation, until according to her expectations it sets to her return and her pains’ end. But in the same manner they will endure different difficulties until the Virgin gives birth to Christ.
