[The Scripture] defines them as diseases deriving from changes in the weather. Blight [occurs when] wheat does not grow. Therefore [we read] these words: “Pharaoh saw ears blighted by a burning wind.” Mildew derives from excessive heat and constant bad weather and descends on wheat in the form of drops like rain. One who ignores it calls it “dew,” but it burns and dries up wheat when it falls on it.
