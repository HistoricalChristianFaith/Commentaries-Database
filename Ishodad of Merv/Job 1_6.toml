There was never a special meeting where Satan dared to speak, to formulate questions and receive answers—nothing of the sort—but these facts are reported in a narrative style for the edification of the listeners.… They never took place in reality, and here the devil did not address God or pose questions; Satan never had the faculty to speak to God or to see him who is the one that “the creatures of fire and spirit” cannot see, but [the devil] meditated in his heart, and God, “who searches the hearts and examines the mind,” knew the devil’s malice.
