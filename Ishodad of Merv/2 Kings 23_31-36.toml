Jehoahaz, also called Shalom, reigned three months until the Egyptians came back from Mabboug. At that stage [Pharaoh] enchained him and brought him to Egypt. So [Jehoahaz] left his country and never came back, according to the prophecy that Jeremiah had spoken against him. Pharaoh appointed his brother Heliakim as the new king and gave him the name of Jehoiakim.
