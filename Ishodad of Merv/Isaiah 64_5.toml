“You were angry, and we sinned.” This is a sentence with reversed terms, that is, since we have sinned, you were angry and had us deported; and this is analogous to the words “and they made his grave with the wicked.” “Some day we will be saved.” With the same mercy through which you saved us once from Egypt, we will be saved from Babylon as well.
