Since the Law forbade praying or sacrificing outside Jerusalem, why did Solomon offer one thousand whole burnt offerings on the altar of Gibeon? Because the tabernacle was in Gibeon, as is attested in the book of Chronicles, and therefore, out of veneration for the ancient residence, [Solomon] went there every year to offer his burnt offerings.
