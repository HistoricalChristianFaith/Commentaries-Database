Theodoret interprets (“the king who will come”) as the foreign kingship and the unlawful doctrine. Others say, “With the king who will come,” meaning with the Christ who will come. Instead of the words “the anointed one shall be killed,” the Jews [say foolishly], “The oil30 shall be cut off.” Therefore, since there is no oil, and the oil of the anointment does not flow anymore, and it stops and does not proceed anymore, there was nobody to anoint with it both the kings and the priests according to the rule observed since Moses and afterwards. It was necessary that the law come to an end, because without priesthood and without the anointment of all that was anointed under the law, the law itself could not survive anymore. In the same manner, with what will your “anointed prince” be anointed, as there is no oil or ointment? “Its end shall come with a flood” and with destruction just like in the deluge of the generations of Noah.
