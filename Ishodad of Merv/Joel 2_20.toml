“I will remove the northerner,” both the Assyrian and Babylonian. Someone may ask, “Since for its position Babylon is not situated north of Jerusalem, why does God say through the prophet, ‘I will remove the northerner far from you’ and ‘Out of the north evil shall break forth upon’ these people”? And we answer that first of all, these words are not said in consideration of the geographical position of Babylon and Jerusalem but of those northern nations subject to the Babylonians—the Arzanites, the Araratites2—who will come down to Jerusalem with the Babylonians. Second, it is because those who want to reach Jerusalem from the regions of Babylon, Persia and the east go up toward the region of the north and then come down toward Jerusalem in the south.
