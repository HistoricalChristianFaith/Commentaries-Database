quote='''
Here the author is probably speaking about what happened in Egypt for three days, or about what happens sometimes to the stars that become hidden. Perhaps he is alluding to what occurred at the beginning: God kept the light close to him, as though it was in a bag. The interpreter9 says the author does not maintain that the things he mentions actually happened but that, if God desires it, they will certainly occur.
