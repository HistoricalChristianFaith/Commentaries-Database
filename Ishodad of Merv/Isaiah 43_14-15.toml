“I have brought down all the runaways and the Chaldeans,” that is, “For your sake I will send you to Babylon” and will make the Medes rise, in order to deliver you from captivity. And when the Babylonians fly from you in every manner, through the land and the sea, they will be captured in “their ships” and be imprisoned. He calls “runaways” the Medes because of their previous weakness.
