Somebody may ask why Elijah, who did not fear Ahab’s authority, was frightened and fled when Jezebel sent him the message. We answer: The providence of God is directed by him and proceeds toward us in two different ways: either by means of benefits or corrections. This is evident from many events. When [Elijah] stopped the heavens, and tortured the Jews through a famine, and killed the prophets of Baal and made the fire come down on the fifty and fifty, he did not tremble before the king because [God’s] providence assisted him. But when he slightly turned away from him, he could not resist before Jezebel’s threats. The same thing happened to David. He was brave and warlike when the army of Israel was frightened by Goliath, and he killed Goliath, because he was supported by divine providence. But when he was tested through divine desertion, even though the generals of his army surrounded him, he was afraid of the other Philistine.
