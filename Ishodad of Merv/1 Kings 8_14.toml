While the king prayed and blessed the people, he stood on a pillar of bronze whose height was five cubits and whose width was two cubits. He climbed it by means of a flight of steps. All the kings stood on it when they needed to speak to the people. This is why [the Scripture] says, “And when she looked up, Jehoash stood on the pillar, according to the royal custom.”
