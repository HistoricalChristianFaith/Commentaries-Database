It is better to drink wine in moderation than to drink water in excess. Some who are holy drink wine in moderation. Some who squander water immoderately may be depraved and pleasureloving. So it appears to me. Do not therefore ascribe blame or praise to the eating of food as such, or to the drinking of wine, but rather to those who make proper or improper use of food and drink. Recall Joseph who in patriarchal times drank wine with the Egyptians and was in no way injured in his judgment, having taken heed to the admonitions of his conscience. But then compare the sorrier examples of Pythagoras, Diogenes and Plato, and with them also the Manichaeans, and other sects of philosophers, who did not heed these admonitions. Some of them came to such a pitch of sensuality or pride that they even forgot the God of the universe and worshiped lifeless images. So the blessed Apostle Peter and those who were with him did not hesitate to receive wine and make use of it. It was just because of this that our Lord’s detractors actively reproached the redeemer of all and their teacher, and made complaints against him, saying, “Why do not your disciples fast like John?” Lausiac History.
