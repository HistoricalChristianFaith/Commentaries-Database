Old; about fifty. (Salien) (Calmet) 
This is an aggravation of his guilt. (Haydock) 
Solomon spent the first thirty years of his reign in virtue: but towards the termination of it, he gave into idolatry, and into such excesses, that he deserves to be ranked with Henry VIII, who began well, but ended with dishonour. (Haydock) 
Heart, and mind also, ver. 9. He sacrificed to idols, not only externally, but gave them internal worship; (Salien) so much was his understanding darkened, unless (Haydock) he acted against his better knowledge, Ecclesiastes ii. 9. (Tirinus) 
Father who did not continue long in sin. (Du Hamel) 
"The wisdom, which had been given to him, entirely abandoned his heart, which the discipline even of the smallest tribulation had not guarded. "(St. Gregory, Pastoral. p. 3.) 
"He had commenced his reign with an ardent desire of wisdom, and when he had obtained it by spiritual love, he lost it by carnal affections. "(St. Augustine, Doct. iii. 21.) 
"Prosperity, which is a severe trial for the wise, was more disadvantageous to him than wisdom herself had been profitable. "(St. Augustine, City of God xvii. 20.) 
The Fathers do not attempt to palliate the guilt of Solomon; and those aggravate his crime, who endeavour to excuse him by saying, that his mind was still convinced that there could be but one God, and that his adoration of idols was merely external, and out of complaisance to his wives. See Santius,(Calmet)
