Gave me not. Jesus Christ chargeth them not here with a want of faith, but with a want of good works. They certainly believed, but they attended not to good works; as if a dead faith, i.e. a faith not working by charity, could bring them to heaven. (St. Augustine, de fideoper. chap. xv. and ad Dulcit. q. 2. ad 4.) 
Jesus Christ suffers his members to want, in mercy to them, and to afford others an opportunity of showing their love for him, and of redeeming their sins by alms-deeds, as was said to the king of the Chaldeans, peccata tua eleemosynis redime. (Daniel iv.)
