The Fathers here find the blessed Trinity expressed; (Calmet; Menochius) and the Council of Trent admonishes us to follow their unanimous interpretation, which is here adopted by Baumbgarte, a Protestant, 1719. St. John informs us that all was made by the Word, from whom the Father and the Holy Spirit cannot be separated. (Berthier) 
Seneca (consol. 8.) seems to have had some idea of this mystery. Quisquis formator universi fuit, sive ille Deus est potens omnium; sive incorporalis Ratio, ingentium operum artifex; sive divinus Spiritus, per omnia maxima et minima Ã¦quali intentione diffusus. The power of them may designate the stars and angels, which the Hebrew styles "the army "of heaven, Isaias xxiv. 21., and Matthew xxvi. 53. (Calmet)

Calvin rejects this proof of the Trinity as weak, (Amama) as he did not like the word Trinity, nor perhaps the mystery itself. (Haydock)
