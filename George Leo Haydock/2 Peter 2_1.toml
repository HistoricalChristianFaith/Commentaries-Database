Sectas introducere, doxas, as this Greek word sometimes signifies; witness Aristotle, 4. Eth., where he puts as apposite, kata doxan, kai kat aletheian. Ver. 13. In conviviis, agapais, which reading Dr. Wells prefers before apatais, the common reading: in the Protestant translation, with their own deceivings.

Lying teachers among you, some of which were already come, and many more were to follow, who shall bring in sects, (heresies) leading to perdition, and deny the Lord who bought them, denying the divinity of Jesus Christ, our Redeemer; such were the disciples of Simon, and many after them. (Witham) 
Sects of perdition; that is, heresies destructive of salvation. (Challoner)
