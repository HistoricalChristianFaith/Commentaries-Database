Oxen. In 3 Kings vii. 24., we read Hebrew, "knops "(Haydock) or "apples. "
Of ten. Hebrew, "ten in a cubit. "Hence there must have been 600 heads of oxen, as the sea was thirty cubits in circumference, and there were two rows. (Calmet) 
Others suppose that there were only five in each row, or only one in each cubit. See Vatable and 3 Kings. The Septuagint and Syriac omit this verse. (Calmet) 
Yet it is found in the best editions of the Septuagint. (Haydock)
