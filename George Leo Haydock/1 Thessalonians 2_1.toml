Vain. Our entrance among you was not in vain fables, or lies; our preaching was not in trifles: (Oecumenius) or rather was not without fruit. Others have spoken of it every where; but why refer you to others when yourselves know that it was every where followed by abundance of good works, faith, patience? (Estius)
