Altar of holocausts, much larger than that of Moses. The one which was built after the captivity, was a square of fifteen cubits. This of Solomon was only ten in height. A sloping ascent was made up to it, according to Josephus; (Jewish Wars vi. 5., or v. 14.) or the steps were closed in, if we believe others. See Exodus xxvii. 1., and xx. 26. It is thought (Calmet) that the inside of the altar was filled with earth, (Menochius) or with rough stones: (Exodus xx. 24.; Du Hamel) but that is not certain, with regard to the brazen altar. See 1 Machabees iv. 44, 47. (Calmet)
