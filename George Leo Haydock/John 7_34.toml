And shall not find me. Some understand it, you shall wish me conversing with you, as at present, healing diseases but as I shall suffer death shortly, you shall not find me. Others expound it, you shall seek for your Messias, but not owning me, who am truly he, you shall not find your Messias; and you cannot come to me in my kingdom of glory, because you will not believe in me. (Witham) 
Or where I shall be. The present tense is not unfrequently used for the future, by the hagiographers. See Chap. xiii. 33.
