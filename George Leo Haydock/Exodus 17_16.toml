Hand of the throne. The Lord hath lifted up his hand, and sworn on his throne, that war, (Chaldean) or the hand of Amalec hath attacked the throne (Israel, the inheritance) of the Lord; therefore shall he pursue them for ever. The Septuagint have followed a different reading, "because with a secret hand the Lord will fight; and some suggest, that instead of ces, throne, we should read nos, signal, or standard. "Since the hand has attacked the standard of the Lord, the war of the Lord is against Amalec. (Le Clerc.) 
Or "the Lord has taken his standard into his hand to destroy the Amalecites for ever. "(Chateillon.) (Calmet)
