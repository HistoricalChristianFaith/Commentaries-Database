Called to be an apostle, or a called apostle. That is, not only having the name of an apostle, but having his call to this high function, and his mission from God. 
Separated unto the gospel of God. He means that he was separated from others, and appointed by the Holy Spirit to preach the gospel, as we read Acts xiii. 2. when the Holy Spirit to those of the Church at Antioch, said, Separate me Saul and Barnabas, for the work unto which I have taken them.
