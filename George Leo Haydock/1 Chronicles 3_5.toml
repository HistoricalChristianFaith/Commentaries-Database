Solomon is put last, though the eldest, because of his genealogy is to be continued. Some think that the three others were the sons of Urias, adopted by David, as Solomon styles himself an only son; (Proverbs iv. 3.) but that only means singularly beloved, and an heir, (Calmet) as David had certainly another child by Bethsabee, who died in his infancy. (Tirinus) 
Bethsabee. Syriac and Arabic, "Bersabee. "Hebrew, "Bathshuah "all erroneously. 
Ammiel, or Eliam, (2 Kings xi. 3.) as the same man had two names, (Calmet) or, in this instance, we must allow a transposition. (Haydock)
