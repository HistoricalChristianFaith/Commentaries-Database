Living waters; viz., the gospel of Christ. (Challoner) 
Last: Mediterranean. (Haydock) 
The prophet now turns to the figurative Jerusalem. The earthly city was not well supplied with water. (Calmet) 
It was in the most dry and barren part of the country. (St. Jerome in Isaias xlix.) 
As much as the Mediterranean excels the Dead Sea, so much do the Gentiles surpass the Jewish converts in numbers. See chap. xiii 1. (Calmet) 
The true faith is Catholic in all places, and at all times. (Worthington)
