Abraham's bosom. The place of rest, where the souls of the saints resided, till Christ had opened heaven by his death. (Challoner) 
It was an ancient tradition of the Jews, that the souls of the just were conducted by angels into paradise. The bosom of Abraham (the common Father of all the faithful) was the place where the souls of the saints, and departed patriarchs, waited the arrival of their Deliverer. It was thither the Jesus went after his death; as it is said in the Creed, "he descended into hell "to deliver those who were detained there, and who might at Christ's ascension enter into heaven. (Calmet) See 1 Peter iii. 19. 
"Many shall come from the east and the west, and shall sit down with Abraham. "(Matthew viii. 11.)
