Paul: It is observed that St. Paul never calls himself an apostle in either of the epistles to the Thessalonians. The reason why he deviates from his ordinary custom on this occasion, probably is, that joining his name with the other two, he did not like to assume a title, though his due, which the others did not possess. (Estius) 
Such condescension to your neighbours' feelings, even in trifles, is highly delicate and praiseworthy. (Haydock)
