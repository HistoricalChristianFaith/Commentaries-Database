O Lucifer. O day-star. All this, according to the letter, is spoken of the king of Babylon. It may also be applied, in a spiritual sense, to Lucifer, the prince of devils, who was created a bright angel, but fell by pride and rebellion against God. (Challoner) (Luke x. 18.) (Calmet) 
He fell by pride, as Nabuchodonosor did. (Worthington) 
Homer (Iliad xix.) represents the demon of discord hurled down by Jupiter to the miserable region of mortals.
