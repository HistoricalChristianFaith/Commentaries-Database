Troglodites, who dwell in caverns, near the Red Sea. Pliny ( v. 8., and vi. 29.) speaks of the city Suca, which in Hebrew means a tent, as here we read succiyim, (Haydock) "dwelling in tents "which some explain of the Arabs, who are called Scenites, on the same account. (Tirinus) 
People of this description, without any fixed abode, inhabited the Stony as well as the Desert Arabia, chap. xiv. 14.
