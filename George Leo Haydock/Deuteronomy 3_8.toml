Beyond. East of the promised land of Chanaan, which the sacred writers have generally in view. (Haydock)

There is no need, therefore, to suppose that this and similar passages have been inserted by a later writer. (Haydock) 
Hermon, which profane authors commonly call Antilibanus, (Calmet) was a part of the range of the mountains of Galaad, by which name it goes frequently, though it be also denominated Seon, or Sion, (chap. iv. 48.; Menochius) and the different nations had other names for it, ver. 9. (Haydock) 
It does not appear that Moses went much beyond the torrent of Jeboc. But he knew that the territory, as far as Hermon and Emath, belonged to the Hebrews, and he probably, sent some troops to take possession of it. They did not, however, entirely banish the Hevites, that dwelt from Baal-Hermon to the entering into Emath. These and some other nations were left by God to instruct Israel, Judges iii. 3.
