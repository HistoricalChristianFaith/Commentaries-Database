Enemy. God revenges the injuries done to his Church, as if they were done to himself, Acts ix. 4. (Worthington) 
The enmity of Jacob and of Esau seemed to commence in the womb, and was increased by the purchase of the birth-right, till Jacob's prudence disarmed his brother. Their descendants sought every opportunity to injure one another. The Idumeans showed their ill-will particularly, when the Jews were most distressed. This was a piece of the greatest cruelty.
