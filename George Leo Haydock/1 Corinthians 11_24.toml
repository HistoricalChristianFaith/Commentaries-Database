Juvenius, a native of Spain, and a priest, who flourished under Constantine the Great, about the year 329, has left us the life of Christ in hexameter verse, where speaking of the institution of the eucharist, he says, "Christ taught his disciples, that he delivered to them his own body "and when he gave them the chalice, "he taught them that he had distributed to them his blood: and said, this blood remits the sins of the people: drink this, it is mine. "(Bibl. Max. P. P. T. iv. p. 74) Discipulos docuit proprium se tradere corpus, Edocuitque suum se divisisse cruorem. Atque ait: Hic sanguis populi delicta remittit: Hunc potate meum.
