Women By the Greek again, sober, grave By these women are commonly understood such as had made a vow of not marrying, and who assisted at the baptism of women; (Witham) i.e. deaconesses, who were women charged with the assistance, and sometimes with the instruction, of persons of their own sex. (Bible de Vence) 
Not given to detraction, or calumnies, as in the Greek. A necessary admonition. (Witham)
