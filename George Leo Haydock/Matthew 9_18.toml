A certain ruler. Literally, a prince of a synagogue. He is called Jairus. (Mark v. Luke viii.) 
My daughter is just now dead: or, as the other evangelists express it, is at the point of death; and her father having left her dying, he might think and say she was already dead. (Witham) 
In effect, news was shortly after brought him that she was dead. It is thus that some commentators explain the apparent difference found in Mark v. 22, and Luke viii. 41. 
But come, lay thy hand Let us admire and imitate the humility and kindness of our Redeemer; no sooner had he heard the request of the ruler, but rising up, he followed him. Though, says St. Chrysostom, he saw his earthly disposition, requesting him to come and lay his hand upon her.
