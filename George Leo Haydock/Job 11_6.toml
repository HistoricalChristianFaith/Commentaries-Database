Law. Hebrew Thushiya, (Haydock) "the essence "of any thing. Hence it is explained, "law, strength, comfort "We might translate, "and that the reality of thy crimes deserved double punishment "The obligations of the natural, and also of the written law of Moses, with which Job was (Calmet) perhaps (Haydock) acquainted, (chap. xxii. 22.) are very numerous and difficult. The ways of Providence are not easily understood, though some are obvious enough. He rewards and punishes. (Calmet) 
Septuagint, "for it is double of what has come against thee, and then thou wouldst know that thy sins are justly requited. "Protestants, "that they are double to that which is: Know, therefore, that God exacteth of thee less than thine iniquity deserveth "1 Esdras ix. 13. (Haydock)
