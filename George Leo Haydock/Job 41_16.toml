Angels. Elim. That is, the mighty, the most valiant, shall fear this monstrous fish, and in their fear shall seek to be purified, (Challoner) by contribution. (Sanchez) 
R. Levi has given a ridiculous exposition, which is adopted by Sa (Amama) and others, (Haydock; see Ezechiel ii. 7.; Aristotle iv. prob. 32.) as the natural consequences of fear. (Calmet) (Menochius) 
The Fathers refer this to the fall of Lucifer, when the other angels might tremble for their own safety. (Haydock) 
Angels with reverent fear honour God's power, and his most perfect servants are filled with apprehensions at his judgments; as the most valiant are terrified at the sight of this huge fish. (Worthington) 
Septuagint, "If he turn, there is fear among the wild quadrupeds, jumping on the land. "Hebrew, 'When he raiseth up himself, the mighty are afraid: by reason of breakings, they purify themselves. "(Protestants) or "spoil themselves "(Calmet) expecting nothing but certain death. (Amama)
