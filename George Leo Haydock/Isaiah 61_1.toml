Lord. Hebrew adds, "God. "Adonai seems to have been inserted to prevent the pronunciation of Jehovah, (Kennicott) which alone occurs in the Septuagint, Arabic, and in St. Luke, iv. 18. (Haydock) 
Thus Elohim may have been substituted for Jehovah, Genesis xxii. 8., as ver. 14, "Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah jireh, because he had said that day on the mount: Jehovah will provide "a victim, even Jesus Christ in the same place. Perhaps no part of the Bible is "so absurdly translated "as this, (Kennicott) by Protestants. (Haydock) 
St. Luke follows the Septuagint in his quotation, only instead of to preach a, he has an explanation, to set at liberty them that are bruised. Isaias may here speak of himself, (Chaldean) yet only as a figure of Christ. The Jews admit that the Messias is meant. Christ had received the Holy Spirit at the Jordan, John i. 32. He performed these works, (Luke vii. 22.) particularly addressing his discourse to the meek and poor, Sophonias iii. 12., and Zacharias xi. 7., and 1 Corinthians i. 26. (Calmet) 
He was not anointed with oil, like Aaron, but with the Holy Spirit; so that of his fullness others must receive, Acts x. 39. (Worthington)
