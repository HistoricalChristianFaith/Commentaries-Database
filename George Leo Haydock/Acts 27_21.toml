Not. Have saved this harm and loss, which you have brought upon you by not following my advice. (Witham)

The mildness of St. Paul's address to them on this occasion is admirable. He mixes no severe rebuke for their past want of confidence in his words, but seems only solicitous for their future belief. In telling them that none of them should perish, he does not utter a mere conjecture, but speaks with prophetic knowledge; and, if he says they were all given to him, it was not to enhance his own merit, but to engage their faith and confidence in his veracity. (St. Chrysostom, Act. hom. lii.)
