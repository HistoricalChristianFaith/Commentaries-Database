Thanksgiving. St. Jerome, Septuagint, and Syriac have read in a different manner from the present Hebrew, (Calmet which has, "for the tithes to gather into them, out of the fields of the cities, the portions of (or by) the law assigned to the priests Tora, "law "has been read, toda, "thanksgiving "by St. Jerome; and sarim, "princes "has been substituted for sadim, "fields. "(Haydock) 
The Syriac admits the second reading. (Calmet) 
Septuagint omit the first entirely. "For the tithes, and for the collections in them, brought to the princes of the cities, being the portions for the priests "(Haydock)
