New moon of Tisri, Leviticus xxiii. 24. 
Noted. Hebrew, "in the obscure, in the day of our solemnity. "(Calmet) 
Protestants, "in the time appointed, on our solemn feast-day. "Cose may denote "obscure or appointed "(St. Jerome) "in the middle of the month "(Haydock) which alludes to the feast of tabernacles, when the Jews dwelt under the shade of tents, made of branches. This was esteemed "the most holy and greatest "of their festivals. (Josephus, viii. 2.) (Numbers xxix. 12., and Proverbs vii. 20.) (Calmet) 
It may also be explained of the new moon of Tisri, (Menochius) when the people were admonished of the beginning of the civil year, or of the three great festivals to be then celebrated, perhaps (Haydock) in memory of the world's creation, at that season. (Berthier) 
How carefully ought we not, therefore, to celebrate the Christian holidays, which are instituted to excite our gratitude for greater benefits! (Haydock) 
The days of the new moons (Numbers xxviii. 11.) were consecrated, to acknowledge God's constant providence; and that of Tisri in particular, (Numbers xxix. 1.) to thank him for the preservation of Isaac, Genesis xxii. 18. (Worthington) 
But the Lord's day reminds us not only of the world's creation, but also of its redemption, Romans iv. 25. (Berthier)
