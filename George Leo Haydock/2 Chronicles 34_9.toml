Seduced. Using the arts of seduction, as well as open force. Hebrew, "Manasses made Juda.err "4 Kings xxi. 16. There is a fund of malice in the human heart, which easily prevails on people to yield, on such occasions, if the grace of God do not support them. Yet, as they are not still without a sense of duty and religion, many will readily comply with the invitations of a pious king, when he earnestly endeavours to reform his people. But these conversions too frequently prove false and unstable, chap. xxix. 36. (Haydock)
