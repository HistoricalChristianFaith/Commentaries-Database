Daughter. Bury thy dead, and delay thy return no longer. The Israelites did not soon make use of the leave granted by Cyrus. (Calmet) 
Man. Hebrew, "a hero. "(Tirinus) 
The fathers generally explain this of the incarnation. (Calmet) 
Christ had the perfect use of reason in the virgin's womb. (Haydock) 
He was the brightness of his Father's glory, Hebrew i. 3. Even some ancient Jews apply this to the Messias. (Galatin. vii. 14.) But the moderns understand that women would offer themselves in marriage; the times would be so happy. This was not so unusual in countries where polygamy prevailed, Ruth iii. 9., Isaias iv. 1., and Canticle of Canticles viii. 1. (Calmet) 
Hence this is hardly the meaning; for God promises something new. (Haydock) 
"The Lord hath created a new thing in a woman. "(Aquila) 
Symmachus agrees nearly with the Septuagint, "because the Lord has created thee by salvation a new plantation. Men shall go about in thy salvation. "This "might be explained, if it were not sacrilegious to argue respecting God's word by human sense "says St. Jerome; though this censure of "the Vulgate "(Septuagint) seems rather harsh. He complains here of his copy. Theodoret explains it of the apostles going through the world to spread the gospel. (Haydock) 
Behold whence thy happiness must come, (Menochius) O thou who hast so long proved faithless, going astray after many lovers. (Haydock) 
Christ, in his mother's womb, was in stature small, but a perfect man (Worthington) in the use of reason (Haydock)
