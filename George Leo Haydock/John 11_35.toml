Jesus wept. A mark of his human nature, when he was going to give them a proof of his divinity, in raising the dead to life. (Witham) 
The tears of the disconsolate sisters called forth tears from the tender commiseration of Jesus. Nor was it unworthy the Son of God to shed tears. See Luke xix. 41. About to give proofs of his divinity in raising the dead, he is pleased to give, first, undoubted proofs of his humanity, that he might show himself both God and man.
