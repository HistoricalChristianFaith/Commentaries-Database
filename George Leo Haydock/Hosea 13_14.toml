Hebrew ehi has been twice placed for aie, I will be instead of where? (Haydock) as the Greek, Arabic, and Syriac versions, as well as the context, evince. All the versions prove the same corruption to be ver. 10. Kennicott, Aquila, and the 5. edition read where? Symmachus I will be: (St. Jerome) so that the change probably took place between the year of the Lord 130 and 200. Septuagint, "Where is thy cause gained, (in a lawsuit, or thy justice; dike.; Haydock) O death? "

Because he shall flourish "If Ephraim would repent, this should not take place; but now, the Lord will bring Salmanasar, a burning wind, ver. 15. (Calmet)
