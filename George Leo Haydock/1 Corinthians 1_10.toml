That there is no schisms. Contentions To hinder these, was the chief design of this letter; one saying, I am of Paul each party bragging of their master by whom they had been baptized, and made Christians. I am of Apollo, the eloquent preacher, and I of Cephas, the head of the apostles, and of the whole Church; whilst others, the only party not to be blamed, contented themselves with saying, and I am of Christ. 
Is Christ divided? Is not your salvation, is not your justification in baptism, and all gifts from him? (Witham)
