Washed. The pagans never approached their mysteries, without divers purifications and washing. (St. Clement of Alexandria, strom. 5.) Exterior cleanliness was designed to signify the purity of the heart, with which we must appear before God. (Calmet) 
It is for this reason we take holy-water, when we go into our chapels, and we wash our fingers before and during Mass. (Haydock)
