Sadoc was to minister at Gabaon, with Heman, Idithun, while Abiathar, Asaph, officiated at Jerusalem. (Calmet) 
This regulation continued till towards the end of David's reign, (Haydock) when fresh orders were given, chap. xxiii. We find Abiathar and Sadoc were both at Jerusalem, when David was obliged to flee, 2 Kings xv. 24., and 3 Kings i. 7. The altar at Gabaon continued some time longer, 3 Kings iii. 3.
