Enoch Though the ancient writers mention an apocryphal book of Enoch's prophesies, yet St. Jude might know by tradition, or by the Spirit of God, what Enoch truly prophesied concerning God's coming with thousands of his saints, to judge, condemn, and punish the wicked for their impieties and blasphemies. (Witham) 
Prophesied. This prophecy was either known by tradition, or from some book that is since lost. (Challoner)
