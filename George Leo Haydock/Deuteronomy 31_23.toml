The Lord. Hebrew has not this word, so that it would seem as if Moses had given this charge to Josue; but the context shows (Calmet) that it was the Lord; (ver. 14.) for he swore to give the land of Israel. The Septuagint insert the words Moses and the Lord. "And Moses commanded Josue. The land which the Lord swore. "(Haydock) 
This is the first time that God addresses Josue, in order to confirm his authority. (Menochius)
