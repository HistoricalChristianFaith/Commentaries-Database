Samuel died. The Rabbins say four months before Saul. (Seder, olam 13.) (Tirinus) 
Others believe about two years; and suppose that he was 98 years old, twenty of which he had been judge: (Calmet) Salien says 38, and that he lived seventy-seven years. (Menochius) 
On all these points the learned are divided, chap. vii. 15. They are more unanimous in praising (Haydock) the conduct of this most holy statesman. Grotius compares him with Aristides. (Calmet) 
But he Holy Spirit gives Samuel a far more glorious character, Ecclesiasticus xlvi. 16. (Haydock) 
Both he and his mother are figures of the two testaments. Anna becomes fruitful 
Samuel is substituted in the place of Heli. The sterility of Anna represents the incapacity of the Synagogue, to produce living and virtuous children. She bears Samuel, the figure of Jesus Christ, who reunites in his person the royal and the sacerdotal dignity. But under another point of view, Samuel, how perfect soever, must give place to the more perfect David, the glorious type of Jesus Christ, and thus the Synagogue, notwithstanding all her prerogatives, must yield to the Church. See St. Augustine, de C. xvii. 1, 4. Many of the ancients have looked upon Samuel as the high priest: but the generality have acknowledged that he was only a Levite, (Calmet) or an extraordinary priest, like Moses. (Haydock) 
All Israel, or many from every tribe, assembled to attend his funeral; (Tirinus) and all mourned for him, as they had done for Moses and Aaron. (Salien) 
House, or among his kindred, (Tirinus) in a place which he had chosen for his tomb. This is called the house of the wicked for ever; but the just raise their hopes much higher, and await a more splendid palace above, and a glorious resurrection. (Haydock) 
They would not bury Samuel in his dwelling-house, as it could not then be entered without incurring an uncleanness. (Calmet) 
His bones were translated with great respect to Constantinople, and a noble mausoleum was built for them by the emperor Justinian. (Procop. v.; St. Jerome, contra Vigil.) (Tirinus)
