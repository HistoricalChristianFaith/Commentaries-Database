The evangelist praises Peter, and excuses the other apostles: all come to Christ; the former leaving his boat, his companions, his nets and prey, arrives more expeditiously; the latter with the impediments of the boat and nets arrive also, but not so readily; a just figure this of religious, who leave all to go directly to God, and of those who remain in the world, and have to navigate a treacherous element with imminent danger of shipwreck. (Maldonatus) 
The poet Sedulius writes thus on the nets: Pendula fluctivagam traxerunt retia prædam, Per typicam noscenda viam; nam retia dignis Lucida sunt præcepta Dei, quibus omnis in illa Dextra parte manens concluditur, ac simul ulnis Fertur apostolicis Domini ad vestigia Christi.
