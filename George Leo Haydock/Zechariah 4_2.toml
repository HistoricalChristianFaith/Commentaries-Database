A candlestick The temple of God that was then in building; and in a more sublime sense, the Church of Christ. (Challoner) 
Some, with the Jews, apply this to the synagogue: but most explain it of the Church, the lamp denoting Christ, and the seven lights all his pastors; the two olives, Enoch and Elias, Apocalypse xi. (Worthington) 
The angel explains the latter of Jesus and Zorobabel, ver. 14. The lights are the same with the angels, (ver. 10) and eyes, (chap. iii. 9.) subservient to these great men. Perhaps no candlestick of this description ever existed, though it alludes to that of Moses in some respects, Exodus xxxvii. (Calmet) 
Lamp. Hebrew gullah, (Haydock) a round vessel for oil. (Menochius) 
It was filled from the two olive-trees, and supplied the seven lights by tubes. (Haydock)
