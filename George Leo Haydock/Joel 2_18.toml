Zealous. Indignation is excited when a person perceives any thing contemned which he loves. So God resented the injuries done maliciously by the Gentiles towards his people; though he often punished them for their correction or greater merit. (Worthington) 
He will resent the blasphemies uttered by infidels against his holy name, and will restore fertility to the land. (Calmet)
