Beth samite, not the renowned general. (Calmet) 
Stone, which served instead of an altar. (Menochius) 
Lord. Some pretend that the lords of the Philistines followed so far, and offered this holocaust, as the cart belonged to them: but the Beth samites might suppose that they had abandoned their property, as well as the golden figures; and, as the city belonged to the priests, it is most probable that they would perform this office. Males indeed were to be offered in the tabernacle. But this was an extraordinary case; so that, if there were no priests, the sacrifice might be lawful (Calmet) by dispensation, as we see Samuel and Elias did the like. (Haydock) 
The kine and cart being consecrated to God, it was thought that they could not be turned to a more suitable purpose. (Calmet) 
The ark was also present, on account of which, sacrifices were offered in the tabernacle. The arguments of Abulensis, (q. 19,) who accuses the Beth samites of sin on this account, are not therefore satisfactory. (Menochius)
