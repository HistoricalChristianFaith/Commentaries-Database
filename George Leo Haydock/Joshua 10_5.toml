Amorrhites is a generical term, as well as Chanaanite, to denote the people of the country. The other kings did not come to the assistance (Calmet) of these five, ver. 40. (Haydock) 
Yet the people of Gabaon might suspect the worst, or exaggerate, in order to make Josue come with greater expedition. He was then at Galgal, above twenty miles distant, and set off the next night, coming unexpectedly upon the confederate kings early in the morning, ver. 9.
