Fall. I was very near falling. Hebrew, "pushing thou hast pushed me that "(Menochius) 
"My sin has strongly pushed me. "(Chaldean) (Calmet) 
Those who stick to the Hebrew suppose, that the psalmist addressed the chief of his enemies. But a letter or two may have been added, as St. Jerome, Felix, admit not the second person. Houbigant prefers, "they have pushed me. "(Berthier) 
By God's grace I was prevented from yielding to the force of temptation. (Worthington)
