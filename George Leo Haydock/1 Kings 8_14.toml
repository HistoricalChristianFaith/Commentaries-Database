He pronounced the blessing, (part of which is given, ver. 15-22) with his face turned towards the people, as he was also in the court of Israel. Then turning himself to the altar (Calmet) of holocausts, (Menochius) with his hands uplifted, he began to pray, ver. 23, to 54. See Exodus xxxix. 43., and 2 Kings vi. 18., where Moses and David blessed the people, on similar occasions. (Calmet)
