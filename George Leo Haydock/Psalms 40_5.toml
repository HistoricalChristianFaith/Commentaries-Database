Thoughts, or designs, "over us "as Hebrew adds. No one can fathom the counsels of the Lord. It is folly, therefore, to attack his mysteries. (Haydock) 
Like. Protestants, "and thy thoughts which are to usward, they cannot be reckoned up in order unto thee. "Literally, non ordinare apud te. (Montanus) (Haydock) 
But haroc means also Ã¦quiparare, which corresponds with the Vulgate. (Berthier) 
Syriac, "none is comparable to thee. "(Calmet) 
Number. Christ and his apostles preached, so that many followed their doctrine. (Worthington) 
David also had many witnesses of his gratitude. They crowded round him. Some would improperly make multiplicati sunt, agree with mirabilia, dialogismois, which is in the masculine. (Berthier) 
"I find no order before thee; if I would declare and number, they are more (wonders) than can be counted. "(St. Jerome) (Haydock) 
I am at a loss how to express myself, and must be content with the interior sentiments of gratitude. See Psalm lxx. 15. (Calmet)
