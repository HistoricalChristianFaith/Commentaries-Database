Satan entered into him, who presently went out with great anger and indignation. It was then night, likely about nine o'clock. (Witham) 
That which thou dost, do quickly. It is not a license, much less a command, to go about his treason: but a signification to him, that Christ would not hinder or resist what he was about, do it as soon as he pleased: but was both ready, and desirous to suffer for our redemption. (Challoner) 
Christ does not by these words exhort the traitor, much less command him, to perform his wicked deed; but he means to reprobate it, and at the same time testify that he would not hinder his being betrayed. (St. Chrysostom, hom. lxxi. in Joan.) 
It is the voice not of command, but of permission, not of a person in fear, but of one prepared for death. (St. Leo)
