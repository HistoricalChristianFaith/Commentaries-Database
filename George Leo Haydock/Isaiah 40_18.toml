Image. Catholics never pretend to represent the Deity, when they depict the Father as a venerable old man They do not adore pictures, as our adversaries would insinuate. If we were disposed to cavil, we might bring the same charge against them. For a few weeks ago, "a beautiful altar-piece, painted and presented by the lady of major general Cheney, was put in Horn sea church, representing Christ blessing the bread and wine. "But Protestants can confine such things to their proper use, and Catholic must adore them. (Haydock) 
"Such things the Jew, Apella, may believe: not I. "(Horace)
