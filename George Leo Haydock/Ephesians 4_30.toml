Grieve not the Holy Spirit: not that the Holy Spirit can be contristated. It is a metaphor; and the sense is, sin not against the Holy Spirit. (Witham) 
To contristate the Holy Spirit is a metaphorical expression, which signifies to offend God, or the Holy Spirit, who has sealed us by the sacraments of baptism and confirmation with particular marks, by which we shall be distinguished from others in the day of our retribution. (Sts. Chrysostom, Jerome, Ambrose)
