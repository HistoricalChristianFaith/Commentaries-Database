Jesus now as our Redeemer, and as man, sitteth on the right hand of God, (see Mark xvi. 19.; Colossians i.; Hebrews i. 3.) having swallowed up Ver. 22. Deglutiens mortem, ut vitæ æternæ hæredes efficeremur. These words, found in all Latin copies, and cited by the Latin Fathers, are scarce found in any Greek manuscript and so are omitted in the Protestant translation.
