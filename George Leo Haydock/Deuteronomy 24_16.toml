Sin. Judges have no right to punish any but those who have transgressed. (Calmet) 
God may for reasons known to himself, which cannot be unjust, visit the sins of the fathers upon their children; (Exodus xx. 5) and hence, (Josue vii.) he ordered the family of Achan to be involved in his punishment. Temporal sufferings, or death itself, are not however always a misfortune. They frequently prove a source of inconceivable blessings, Romans v. 3. (Haydock) 
The Rabbins understand, that fathers and children are not to be received as witnesses against each other, (Onkelos) which seems foreign to the sense of the present law. (Calmet)
