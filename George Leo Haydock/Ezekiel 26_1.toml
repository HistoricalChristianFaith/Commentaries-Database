Year of the prophet's captivity. (Haydock) 
He still dates from the transmigration of Joachin, chap. i. (Worthington) 
Some think he speaks of the first, fourth, or fifth month. Tyre was not besieged till after the ninth day of the fourth month, when Jerusalem was taken; nor could she express her joy for that event before, unless God allude to her dispositions, chap. xxv. 1. (Calmet)
