Lot. The Persians were much addicted to divination. The superstitious Aman, though he would appear a deity, was to be regulated by lots! Providence caused almost a whole year to intervene, before the cruel execution was to commence. (Calmet) 
Reason began to show the futility of divination, (Cicero) but the Christian religion alone has been able to counteract its baneful influence. (Calmet) 
India is still much infected with it. (Bernier.) 
Phur. Hebrew, "they cast Pur, that is the lot, before Aman. "(Haydock) 
The explanation intimates that Pur is a Persian word. (Du Hamel) 
Yet Pagnin maintains that it means in Hebrew, "to crush "a wine-press, or vessel; and the lot, which is thrown therein. (Menochius) 
Tickets, with the names of the twelve months, were probably drawn; and after the month was thus determined, Aman put in the urn as many tickets as it had days, and was directed to pitch upon the 13th. Septuagint have the 14th, both here and ver. 13. (Calmet) 
How preposterous was the (Haydock) fury of this man, thus to decide upon the day before he had the king's leave! (Worthington)
