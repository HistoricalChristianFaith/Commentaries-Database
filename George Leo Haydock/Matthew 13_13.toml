Because seeing they see not i.e. they see not as they might, and ought to do, by shutting their eyes against the lights given them. 
Therefore do I speak to them in parables: because seeing they see not This passage, by which the prophet Isaias (vi. 9.) was ordered to foretell the obstinate blindness of the Jews, in refusing to receive and believe in their Messias, is cited six times in the New Testament; to wit, here in St. Matthew, also Mark iv. 14) is grown gross . and their eyes they have shut The Jews therefore shut their own eyes, hardened their own hearts, which God only permitted. See Romans ix. 18. (Witham) 
If this blindness were natural, then indeed I would have opened their eyes to see and understand, but since this blindness is voluntary, he says, that seeing they see not, and hearing, they hear not; i.e. they have seen me cast out devils, and they said, in Beelzebub he casteth out devils; they heard I drew all to God, and they say, this man cometh not from God. Since, therefore, they assert the very contrary to what they both see and hear, the gift of seeing and hearing me shall be taken away from them.
