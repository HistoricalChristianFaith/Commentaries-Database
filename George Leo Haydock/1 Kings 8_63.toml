Sheep, and other small beasts, during the seven days, without counting the oblations of individuals. The law had not prescribed any particular rites for the dedication of places. But common sense dictated that sacred things should be distinguished from such as were common. Moses and David had set a pattern, which was followed by the Jews after the captivity, and by the Machabees, Exodus xl. 9., 1 Kings vi. 17., 1 Esdras iii. 10., and 1 Machabees iv. 56. (Calmet) 
The festival of the dedication was observed by our Saviour, John x. 22. (Haydock) 
Even private houses received a sort of dedication, Deuteronomy xx. 5. The pagans observed the like practice, with regard to statues and temples, lands and public places, Daniel iii. 1. Among the Romans, such ceremonies were performed by a general or consul, with his head covered, reciting some ancient prayers, at the suggestion of the pontiff, before a fire and an assembly of the people, called on purpose, while some person played upon the flute. (Cicero, pro Domo. Alex. Genial. vi. 14.)
