And a voice This is the voice of the Father from the cloud, as if he should say, "I call him not one of my sons, but my true and natural Son, to the resemblance of whom all others are adopted. (St. Cyril) 
Not Elias, not Moses, but he whom you see alone, is my beloved Son. (St. Ambrose) 
Therefore, it is added: and when the voice was heard, Jesus was alone, lest any one should imagine these words, This is my beloved Son, were addressed to Moses or Elias. "(Theophylactus)
