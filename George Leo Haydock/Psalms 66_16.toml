Heart. Being enslaved to any passion. (Haydock) 
Iniquity and dissimulation hinder the effect of our prayers; and in some sense, it is true, that God does not hear sinners: (John ix. 31., and 2 Timothy ii. 9.) though He regards favourably such as wish to repent, like the publican, Luke xviii. 14. (Calmet) 
Whosoever would be heard, must repent of his sins. (Worthington)
