All eat the same spiritual food, to wit, the manna, which seemed to come from heaven, and was a figure of the eucharist, the spiritual food of our souls. 
All drank the same spiritual drink, and.rock that followed them, by which is understood the stream of water, that came miraculously out of the rock struck by Moses, and which is said to have followed them, because it ran plentifully through their camp. 
And the rock was Christ, a figure of Christ; for all these things (ver. 11.) happened to them in figure. (Witham)
