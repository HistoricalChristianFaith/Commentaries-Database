Eliphaleth. Septuagint reckon twenty instead of eleven. (Calmet) 
The Vatican copy has twenty-four, as some of the names have been read differently, so as to make two persons, and thus frequently a double translation occurs in the Septuagint; the one being taken either from Aquila, or from some more early version, of which we know not the author. (Grabe) (Kennicott, Diss. ii. p. 404.)
