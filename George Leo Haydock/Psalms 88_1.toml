Maheleth. A musical instrument, or chorus of musicians, to answer one another, (Challoner) in doleful music. (Worthington) 
See Psalm xli., and lii. (Menochius) 
Hebrew may imply, "on infirmity, (Montanus) or sorrow "from ele. (Berthier) 
The subject is very mournful, and relates to the captives, and to Christ's suffering. (Calmet) 
Understanding. Or a psalm of instruction, composed by Eman, the Ezrahite, or by David, in his name. (Challoner) 
We read of Eman, a descendant of Juda by Zara, (1 Paralipomenon ii. 6.; Calmet) and if he composed this piece, as the Jews and Lightfoot improbably suppose, it must be the most ancient (Calmet) writing extant. (Haydock) 
There was a son of Joel, and a seer of king David, of the same name, 1 Paralipomenon vi. 33., and xxv. 1. But they are not styled Ezrahites. This person was probably the brother of Ethan, the Ezrahite, who might be young under David, and a man of consummate wisdom under his successor, 3 Kings iv. 31. The psalm may express the sentiments of David, or of any other under tribulation, as well as those of Jesus Christ, (Berthier) who speaks herein, (Houbigant) and who expects that we should answer him by an imitation of his virtues. (St. Augustine) (Worthington) 
The Ezrahite. Hebrew haezrachi. (Haydock) 
Septuagint, read incorrectly, "Israelite "(Calmet) and some copies have "Aitham "or Ethan, as in the following psalm, instead of Eman. (Haydock)

Thee. The psalm 21st is nearly similar to this. My prayer is continual. (Calmet)
