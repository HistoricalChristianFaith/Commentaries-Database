Moved. The ignorance, in application, and injustice of those in power overturn the state, which is supported by justice, Proverbs xiv. 34. They draw down God's curse upon the land, (St. Jerome; Calmet) and expose it to all the miseries of anarchy. This regards pastors also. (Berthier) 
By gross ignorance judges walk in darkness, and throw all into confusion.
