They received the Holy Spirit. Not but that they had received the grace of the Holy Spirit at their baptism; but not that plentitude of grace, and those gifts, which they received from bishops in the sacrament of confirmation. This sacrament, as St. Chrysostom observes, St. Philip, the deacon, had not power to give. (Witham)
