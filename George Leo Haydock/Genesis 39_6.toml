Bread. A proverbial expression, to show how entirely he reposed in Joseph's fidelity and prudence. (Menochius) 
He was so rich, that he knew not the extent of his wealth. So Petronius says, Nescit quid habeat, adeo Zaplutus est. It may also be understood as a commendation of Joseph's disinterestedness.
