It must be observed, however, that all the cities of the different tribes are not mentioned, and the Israelites might live along with those of the tribe of Levi, ver. 3. Moreover, these had only the cities, with 2000 cubits of land round them.

(Haydock) 
They farther remark, that they were buried in his tomb, chap. xxiv. 30.
