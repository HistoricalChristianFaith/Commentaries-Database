Remission; that is, a general release and discharge from debts and bondage, and a reinstating of every man in his former possessions. (Challoner) 
Jubilee: Hebrew jubol means "liberty "(Josephus); "re-establishment "(Philo); (Calmet) 
"deliverance "(Abenezra). The Rabbins falsely assert, that a ram's horn was used on this occasion: but Bo chart shows that it is solid and unfit for the purpose. (B. ii. 42.) They also maintain, that from the 1st of this sacred month, as it is called by Philo, till the 10th, the slaves spent their time in continual rejoicings in their master's house, and on the latter day they were set free. Cun√¶us (Rep., i. 6,) observes, that the jubilee was discontinued after the captivity, though the sabbatic year was still kept. (Calmet) 
Indeed the Jews were often very negligent in these respects, and God complained and punished them for it, chap. xxvii. 32.; The avarice of the great ones chiefly caused these wise regulations to be despised, though, from time to time, God enforced their observance, that it might be clearly known from what family the Messias sprung. After his birth they were abrogated, as no longer necessary. (Haydock) 
Something similar was instituted by Solon, and styled "the shaking off burdens "for the redemption both of men and goods. (Laertius) (Menochius) 
The Locrians could not alienate their patrimony. (Aristotle, polit. ii. 7, and vi. 4.) The Rabbins deviate from the spirit of their lawgiver, when they assert, that persons might sell their inheritance for a greater number of years than 50, if they specified how many (Selden, Succes. iii. 24.) In the Christian dispensation, the jubilee denotes a time of indulgence, in consequence of the power left by Jesus Christ, Matthew xvi. 19 and 2 Corinthians ii. 10.) The first was given by Pope Boniface VIII in 300; and others were granted every century, till Pope Clement VI reduced the space to 50 years, 1542. Pope Gregory XI would have them dispensed to the faithful every 33 years, and Pope Paul XI every 25th, that more might partake of so great a benefit. This has been done since his time, and the Popes often grant them when the Church is in great danger, and also in the year when they are consecrated. (Calmet) 
They are designed to promote the fervour of piety, and the remission of punishment due to sin. (Haydock) 
Family. Slaves shall obtain their liberty. This law set a restraint upon the rich, that they might not get possession of too much land, or oppress the poor. Lycurgus, with the same view, established an equality of lands among the Spartans, and Solon acknowledged the propriety of the regulation, which he probably saw practised in Egypt. (Diodorus i.) (Calmet) 
The Agrarian laws at Rome, were often proposed; but they caused nothing but confusion and riot. (Haydock)
