Thorns. The bridegroom enhances the praise of his spouse. The Church, surrounded by infidels and persecutors, maintains her beauty and station. Heretics, are no better than thorns. (Origen) (Calmet) 
The Church excels all other societies. In her communion the innocent are preferred before sinners, and among the former, the blessed Virgin surpasses all.
