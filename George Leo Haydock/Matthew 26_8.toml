Indignation. It was chiefly Judas, who blamed aloud this profusion. (Bible de Vence) 
St. Matthew and St. Mark mention the disciples. But such of them as spoke, were persuaded to what they said either by Judas's words, or by their feeling and affection for the poor; but the only motive of Judas was avarice. (St. Thomas Aquinas)
