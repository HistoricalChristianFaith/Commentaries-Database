From the heights or temple of Baal, or the god of Chamos, where a statue or pillar (Septuagint) was erected in his honour, (Calmet) on Mount Arabim, (Menochius) the soothsayer was enabled to take a distinct view of all the camp of Israel, (chap. xxiii. 13,) and not of a part only, as the Septuagint and Arabic versions would insinuate. It was deemed necessary to have those present upon whom people intended to vent their imprecations. (Calmet)
