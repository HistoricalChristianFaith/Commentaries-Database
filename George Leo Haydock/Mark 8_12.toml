Jesus Christ fetches a deep sigh on account of their obduracy, and says; why do these ask for a miracle to confirm their belief, when they resist the authority of so many miracles, which are daily performed under their eyes? (Bible de Vence) 
A sign shall not be given. But by a Hebrew form of speech, if divers times is put for a negative. (Witham)
