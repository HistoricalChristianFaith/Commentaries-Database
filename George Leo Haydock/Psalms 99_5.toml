Adore his foot-stool. The ark of the covenant was called, in the Old Testament, God's foot-stool: over which he was understood to sit, on his propitiatory, or mercy-seat, as on a throne, between the wings of the Cherubim, in the sanctuary: to which the children of Israel paid a great veneration. But as this psalm evidently relates to Christ, and the New Testament, where the ark has no place, the holy Fathers understand this text of the worship paid by the Church to the body and blood of Christ in the sacred mysteries: in as much as the humanity of Christ is, as it were, the foot-stool of the divinity. So St. Ambrose, l. 3. de Spiritu Sancto, c. 12., and St. Augustine upon this psalm. (Challoner) 
The last mentioned holy Doctor inculcates the obligation of adoring Jesus Christ in the blessed Eucharist, and refutes the Capharnaites, John vi. (Worthington) 
The Jews adored God, showing a relative honour, by prostrating themselves before the ark, in the same manner as Catholics do before holy images. (Berthier) 
It is. Septuagint and some psalters, "he is holy. "(Calmet) 
Hebrew is ambiguous. (Berthier) 
"I discover how I may adore the foot-stool. Without impiety. Christ took flesh of Mary.and give it us to eat for our salvation. But none eats that flesh, till he have first adored it. "(St. Augustine) Ver. 6. Moses and Aaron among his priests. By this it is evident, that Moses also was a priest, and indeed the chief priest, in as much as he consecrated Aaron, and offered sacrifice for him, Leviticus viii. So that his pre-eminence over Aaron makes nothing for lay church headship. (Challoner) (Worthington) 
Samuel is only mentioned as a Levite. See 1 Kings xxv. 1. (Calmet)
