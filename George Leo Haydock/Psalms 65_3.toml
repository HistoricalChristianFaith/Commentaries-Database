Transgressions. These are the words of the Christian converts, (Eusebius) or of the Jews, who acknowledge that they have been justly punished with drought, for neglecting the temple and first fruits, Aggeus i. 4., and Malachi as iii. 9. (Calmet) 
Hebrew, "thou wilt expiate our transgressions "which denotes Christ's satisfaction. (Berthier) 
Though the wicked threaten, we fear nothing, as long as thou wilt pardon our offences. (Worthington) 
These have been the occasion of our past sorrows. (Menochius)
