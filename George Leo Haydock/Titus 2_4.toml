Love their husbands. This is the first lesson he wishes to be given to young women; that they should always manifest a love, an attachment, respect and obedience to their husbands. But it must be a chaste love. Vult eas amare viros suos cast√®; vult inter virum et mulierem esse pudicam dilectionem. (St. Jerome)
