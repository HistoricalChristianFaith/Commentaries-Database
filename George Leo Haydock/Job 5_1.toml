Saints. This is a proof of the invocation of the saints (Calmet) and angels. (Haydock) 
The Jews often begged God to have mercy on them for the sake of the patriarchs, 2 Paralipomenon vi. 42. (Calmet) 
Eliphaz, therefore, exhorts Job, if he have any patron or angel, to bring him forward in his defence. (Menochius) 
Septuagint, "Invoke now if any one will hear thee, or if thou perceive any of the holy angels "(Haydock) as I have done. (Menochius) 
He extols himself, to correct the pretended presumption of his friend, (Calmet) and other defects, which none will dare to deny, as he supposes. See St. Gregory, v. 30. (Worthington)
