The elect. By the elect, we need not always understand those predestinated to eternal glory, but chosen or called to the true faith; and this must rather be the meaning of St. Paul in this place, who could not distinguish between those predestinated to glory and others. (Witham) 
Therefore I announce it with full liberty, suffering willingly all I have to endure for the sake of the elect.
