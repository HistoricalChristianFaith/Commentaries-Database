Counsel, among themselves. (Haydock) 
Solemnity. It is not known which is meant, as all the three great festivals occurred during the time that the vines were covered with leaves; (ver. 20) or this feast might be one peculiar to the city of Silo, in memory of the ark being transported thither. Vatable thinks that the description here given, regards the place where the dance was to be, as all must have known the situation of the city. Silo rather lies to the west than to the east, (Calmet) if we draw a line from Bethel to Sichem, but the road might be circuitous. (Haydock) 
St. Jerome places Silo ten miles west of Sichem. 
Lebona may be Chan Lebna, four miles to the south of it. (Calmet)
