Dwelt. Literally, "they dwelt. "But Hebrew and Septuagint, "in Gabaon, dwelt the father of Gaboan "(Haydock) who was called Jehiel, (chap. ix. 35.) or Abiel, 1 Kings ix. 1. (Calmet) 
The following verses are repeated in the next chapter, (Haydock) and seem to have been originally the same; though now many variations occur, which show that "every Hebrew letter "has not been preserved. (Kennicott)
