Phares. These words consist of three letters, mona, thokol, pros, as we add o merely for pronunciation. Being unconnected and almost destitute of vowels, (Haydock) it is not easy even for the learned to read these words, or to ascertain their meaning. Thus d b r being placed in a similar situation, it would be impossible to determine the sense; as it may have ten different meanings, according as it is pronounced, ver. 8. (Calmet) 
Mane is twice repeated, to show the certainty and exactitude of the numbering. (Menochius) 
Yet in the sequel each word occurs once and unconnected, as it is here in the Vulgate; not Mene, Mene, Tekel, Upharsin, (Protestants; Haydock) "He hath numbered, numbered, weighed, and the dividers or the Persians "are upon thee, (T.) as Dalila said to Samson. Only three words (Haydock) were written. (St. Jerome) 
The rest contain the prophet's explanation. The Chaldean empire had now attained its utmost height. Its king brought ruin upon himself by his wicked life. (Haydock) 
He would soon be divided with the sword, and his kingdom shared between the Medes and Persians. (St. Jerome)
