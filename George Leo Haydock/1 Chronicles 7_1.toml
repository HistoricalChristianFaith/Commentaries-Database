Jasub, or Job. See Genesis xlvi. 13., and Numbers xxvi. 23. (Calmet) 
Simeron, elsewhere Samron and Semran; (Menochius) which shews, either that the names have been differently pronounced, or that the transcribers have erred. (Haydock) Ver. 2. Chiefs. They were at the head of distinct families. (Menochius) 
David. We know that David took an account of his fighting men, 2 Kings xxiv. But it is not certain that this register was made at that time; as we read that Benjamin was not numbered, chap. xxi. 6. These lists were probably made when some expedition was intended by David. The author was not, perhaps, able to recover the accounts of Nephthali, Manasses, and Ephraim, no more that the genealogies of Dan (ver. 12) and Zabulon, which do not appear in this book. (Calmet) Ver. 3. Sons, for "the son. "(Du Hamel) 
Izrahia. He alone deserved to be mentioned. See ver. 6, where only three sons of Benjamin appear, though there were more, chap. viii. 2. (Tirinus) 
Five, comprizing Israhia, "all chiefs "(Haydock) men of note, (Du Hamel) or one name may be lost. (Calmet) Ver. 4. Children, who had numerous offspring; (Haydock) so that, in the days of David, these descendants of Thola, amounted to so many. (Menochius)
