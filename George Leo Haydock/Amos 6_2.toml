Chalane. Ctesiphon (Calmet) was built on its ruins, Genesis x. 10. (Haydock) 
Why do you imitate these cities? or, has their greatness protected them? Phul probably took Chalane, and Jeroboam II the other cities, ver. 15., and 4 Kings xiv. 25. At that time there was no appearance of the kingdom being destroyed; yet Amos composes a funeral canticle, to show the certainty of the event.
