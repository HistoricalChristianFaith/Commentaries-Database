Saints. The Assideans, who were the most esteemed for piety, 1 Machabees ii. 42. In the worst of times, there were always some pious Israelites, and the generality of them were less wicked than their enemies, who exercised a horrid barbarity in refusing them burial, after destroying vast numbers, 2 Paralipomenon xxxvi. 17. (Calmet) 
This was done at least under Epiphanes, 1 Machabees vii. 16. (Haydock) 
Persecutors have hung the bodies of martyrs on poles to be the food of birds, (Worthington) as the missionary priests were treated in England not long ago. Hebrew is here rather inaccurate, (Haydock) "to the wild beast of the earth itself "(Montanus) lechaitho arets, being put forth l√©ith, earts, (Houbigant) as Protestants themselves translate. (Haydock)

Asaph, who might live during the captivity. (Calmet) 
If the ancient (Haydock) Asaph, or David, composed this psalm, it must be considered as a prediction of the ruin caused by Nabuchodonosor, or by Epiphanes. (Berthier, T. v.) 
The author of 1 Machabees (vii. 17.) accommodates it to the sufferings of those (Calmet) whom Alcimus destroyed; or rather the prophet had them also in view as well as Christian martyrs. (Haydock) 
He cannot speak of the last ruin of Jerusalem, since it would have been improper to pray for its restoration. (St. Augustine) 
Fruit. A mean village, (Menochius) as Isaias (i. 8.) had threatened. Hebrew, "a heap of stones "(St. Jerome) in the field, Micheas i. 6. Such was the condition of Jerusalem under Nabuchodonosor (Calmet) and Ephiphanes, 1 Machabees i. (Berthier) 
Catholics have been persecuted in every country, and forced to use mean houses for divine worship. (Worthington)
