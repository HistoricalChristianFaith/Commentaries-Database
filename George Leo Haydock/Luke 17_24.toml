For as the lightning See Matthew xxiv. 27. (Witham) 
Christ here alludes to the glory with which he shall appear when he shall come to judge the world, surrounded by his angels when he will appear like lightning, that shall penetrate the inmost recesses of our souls, and shall suffer no crime, not even the slightest thought of our souls, to pass unnoticed. This is the time when he will manifest his glory, and not on his entry into Jerusalem, as the disciples imagined: for he informs them, that he will then have to suffer a cruel death. (Ven. Bede)
