Rain, which falls in Judea, chiefly about the vernal and the autumnal equinoxes, in March and October. 
The latter rain (Hebrew malkosh,) is that which falls when the seed is just sown, though the Rabbins pretend that yore has this signification, in opposition to the Septuagint. It fell at the beginning of the Jewish year, which commenced in September, Joel ii. 23., and Zacharias x. 1. (Calmet) 
Rain contributed to make the seeds take root, and to bring the fruit to maturity, and God promises to give what may be requisite, provided his people serve him with fidelity. (Haydock) 
His grace helps us to begin and to perfect every good work. (Worthington)
