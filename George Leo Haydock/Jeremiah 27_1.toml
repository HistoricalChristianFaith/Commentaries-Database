Joakim. This revelation was made to the prophet in the beginning of the reign of Joakim: but the bands were not sent, to the princes here named, before the reign of Sedecias, ver. 3. (Challoner) 
He wore them six or seven years. (Vatable) (Tirinus) 
But this is uncertain. Septuagint omit this title. Syriac, Arabic, read "Sedecias. "(Calmet) 
As far as Juda may belong to the last chapter. St. Jerome includes the whole verse. (Haydock) 
It seems to be rather a fresh prophecy, or the title may be spurious, like many in the Psalms. See chap. xxvi. 1., and xxviii. 1., and Isaias xxi. 13.
