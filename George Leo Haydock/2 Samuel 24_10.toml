David's heart struck him, after the people were numbered. That is, he was touched with a great remorse for the vanity and pride which had put him upon numbering the people. (Challoner) 
His sin must have been internal, and probably involved a secret confidence in his riches and power, without referring all to God, (Haydock) or trusting entirely in him. (St. Ambrose, poen. c. 9.; St. Augustine, contra Faust. xxii. 66.) 
There was otherwise no prohibition for David's taking this account, (Calmet) which is so natural for a prince, and may frequently prove of great service. (Haydock) 
Josephus ( vii. 13.) and others assert, that he neglected to require the payment of half a sicle. (Tirinus; Estius) 
But where does God complain of this neglect? and how do they know that the injunction which was once given to Moses, when the tabernacle was to be furnished, (Exodus xxx. 12.) was to remain in force afterwards? Oleaster (on Exodus) says David acted against God's intention, who had promised that the Israelites should be innumerable. But this reason seems childish; and did not the king abstain, on that very account, from numbering any but those who were fit for war? (1 Paralipomenon xxvii. 23.) (Calmet) 
Struck him. Contrition and confession are specified here, as satisfaction is, ver. 12. Temporal sufferings are inflicted, even after the sin has been remitted, ver. 16. (Worthington)
