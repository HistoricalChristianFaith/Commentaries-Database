See light, or the Holy Spirit. (St. Ambrose) (Theodoret) 
We shall see thee, Father of light, in thy Son. (Origen, Prin. i. 1.) (Calmet) 
The saints behold in the light of God all that they can desire to know; and of course they will not be unacquainted with our wants and petitions, though they have not the asses' ears of Calvin. (Haydock) 
Light and life denote all happiness. (Calmet) 
The psalmist might have a sublime idea of these pleasures. (Berthier) 
But none will presently understand their excellence till they are put in possession of them. (Haydock)
