Consumeth. Ecclesiastes ix. 2. (Haydock) 
This principle is incontrovertible. (Worthington) 
I do not retract it. (Menochius) 
The misery inflicted on the just, is not contrary to the goodness of the Almighty. Job perfectly discovered this truth, which puzzled his enlightened friends, and most of those who lived before Christ; (Psalm lxxii. 2., and Jeremias xii. 1.; Calmet) and even Job himself was not fully convinced of the motives of the Providence, till God had explained them. (Houbigant) (Chap. xlii.)
