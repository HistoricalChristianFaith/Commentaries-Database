Brethren. The sabbatical year happened in the 9th of Sedecias, when the Chaldeans approaching, caused him to show some signs of religion. But when they departed to meet the Egyptians, the people repented of what they had done well. (Calmet) 
Such a relapse offends God more than the former sins, as our Saviour shows by a parable, Matthew xviii. (Worthington)
