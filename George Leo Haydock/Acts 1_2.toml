Until the day on which, giving commandments by the Holy Spirit to the apostles whom he had chosen, he was taken up. As the Scripture was written without distinction of verses, and without any stops, or commas, which were added afterwards) the construction, and joining of the words in this verse, is ambiguous. The question is, with what part of the verse these words, by the Holy Spirit, are to be joined. The sense might be, 1. that he was taken up by the Holy Spirit: but this is generally rejected. 2. That he gave his commandments by the Holy Spirit to his apostles; that is, says St. Chrysostom, that he gave them spiritual commands, that came from the Holy Spirit, or from his holy Spirit. 3. The most probable exposition seems to be, that he gave his special commandments to his apostles, or to those whom he chose to be his apostles, by the Holy Spirit, or by his holy and divine spirit. (Witham) 
The power to preach, to baptize, to remit sins, and generally the whole commission and charge of the government of his Church after him in his name, and with his authority; which government was given them, together with the Holy Spirit, to assist them therein for ever. (Bristow)
