Ivory. Hebrew, "of the tooth "(or horn) of elephants: people do not agree of which the ivory is formed. See Pliny ( viii. 3.) for the former sentiment, and for the latter, Varro vi. Ezechiel (xxvii. 15.) seems to unite both sentiments, calling it, "horns of the tooth. "(Haydock) 
Ivory may, in effect, be wrought like horn. 
Finest. Hebrew, "gold of Up has. "This was the country whence it was brought; (Jeremias x. 9.) probably Colchis, where the river Phasis, or Phison, flows, Genesis ii. 11. (Calmet) 
The Chaldean calls Up has, (in Jeremias) Ophir; and Huet supposes that Paz and Parvaim designate the same place, chap. ix. 28., and Job xxviii. 17. (Du Hamel) 
In Paralipomenon, we only read, pure gold, which would suffer the ivory to appear in some places. (Calmet)
