Jerameel, the son of Esron, inhabited the most southern parts of Juda. 
Ceni, or the Cinites, descendants of Jethro, (Calmet) who dwelt at Arad and the environs. The words of David might signify that he attacked these people of Israel, as Achis understood him; or that he made inroads upon those who dwelt to the south of them, which was really the case. (Haydock) 
At his return, he passed by Siceleg, where he left the spoil, carrying some of the choicest things, as a present, to Achis. (Menochius) 
But he suffered none of the human race to be carried away captive, lest any of them might disclose the true state of affairs to the king, who might have apprehended that the injured nations would make an attack upon his dominions. (Salien)
