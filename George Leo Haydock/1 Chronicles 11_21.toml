Second and (Haydock) first occur not in Hebrew and Septuagint. (Calmet) 
Hebrew, "Of the three he was more honourable than two; therefore he was their captain: and yet he attained not unto the first three. "(Kennicott) 
First is indeed the sense, but it is not expressed in the original. We have here the exact order of these mighty men sufficiently marked out. Abisai is the first captain (Haydock) of the second ternary. (Tirinus)
