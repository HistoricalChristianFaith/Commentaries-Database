Speak. Our editions of the Septuagint omit this word, though St. Jerome found it in his copies, (Calmet) and in Theodotion, expressed by "death "while others rendered it, "speak "as the same letters dbr, may have both meanings, according as people may please to pronounce them. (St. Jerome) 
Grabe supplies, "by death. (22.) These things, says the Lord. "(Haydock)
