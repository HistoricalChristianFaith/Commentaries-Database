Midnight. Under tribulation, (St. Augustine) or to avoid the malice of those who pried into my conduct. I was so delighted with thy law, that I meditated on it both in the day-time, and at night. (Calmet) 
This pious custom was observed by St. Paul, (Acts xvi.) as it is still by many religious orders, ver. 164. (Worthington)
