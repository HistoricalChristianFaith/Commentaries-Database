With commandment. God's command will in a moment raise and bring all to judgment. 
And the dead, who are in Christ, in the grace of Christ, shall rise first, not as to time, but in dignity. (Witham) 
Shall rise first. Not in order of time, for all shall rise in the twinkling of an eye, but first in order of dignity. St. Chrysostom, however, thinks that the elect rise before the reprobate, to go before the Lord; whereas the latter shall come behind him, only to appear before the tribunal of justice. (St. Chrysostom)
