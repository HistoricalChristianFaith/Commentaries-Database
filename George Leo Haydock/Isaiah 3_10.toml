Well. Jeremias (xxxix. 11.) was treated by the enemy with great respect. Septuagint, "having said, let us bind the just man, for he is troublesome, (Haydock) or displeasing (Calmet) to us. Hence they "(Haydock) (Wisdom ii. 12.) Many of the Fathers quote it thus. But our version agrees very well with the original, as Isaias joins consoling predictions with those which are of a distressing nature. (Calmet) 
Yet the Septuagint seem to have thrown light on the Hebrew by supplying an omission from the book of Wisdom. (Houbigant) 
Thus all must be explained of the wicked, whose malice shall be punished. 
He shall. St. Jerome and all versions read, "they shall eat the fruit of their doings, or devices. "Fructum adinventionum suarum come dent. (Haydock) 
All who hear of this must applaud the just God for acting well in their punishment. According to the Septuagint, Christ and his adversaries are clearly pointed out. (Calmet)
