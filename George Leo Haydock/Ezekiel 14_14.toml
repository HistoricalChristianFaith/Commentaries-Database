Job. He and Noe were dead, yet undoubtedly interceded for the people, or their names would not here be mentioned, Jeremias xv. 1. (Worthington) 
When God is resolved to treat all with rigour, he will save only the just. They shall not be able to protect even their children. But Jerusalem shall not experience such severity, ver. 21. (Calmet) 
Noe could not avert the deluge, nor Job the death of his children, neither could Daniel rescue his people from captivity. (St. Jerome) 
The first denotes pastors, the second fathers of families, and Daniel such as live continent. (St. Augustine) 
All three had been very merciful. (St. Chrysostom, hom. xliii. 1. in Genesis) 
Job is placed for holy laymen, and Daniel for people of religious orders. (St. Gregory, Mor. i. 13.) (Worthington) 
Hence perhaps Job is placed last, though cotemporary with Moses, as most people suppose. He is not therefore a fabulous personage. (Haydock)
