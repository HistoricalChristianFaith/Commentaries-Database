Tempest. During the night, a tempest probably arose, which threw the enemy into confusion, who supposing that the Israelites had broken into the camp, fell upon each other in the dark. (Calmet) 
St. Paul reminds us of God's indignation, which Christians as well as Jews ought to dread, Hebrews xii. 25, 29., and Deuteronomy iv. 24. (Berthier)
