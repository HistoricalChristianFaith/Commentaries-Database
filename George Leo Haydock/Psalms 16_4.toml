Haste. Men who are convinced of their own infirmities, hasten to find a remedy. (Worthington) 
No sooner had fallen man been redeemed, that he strove to advance in the ways of perfection. (Berthier) 
The sins, to which the saints sometimes yield, tend to make them more cautious (Calmet) and grateful to their deliverer, like St. Peter. Persecutions likewise cause them to cling closer to God, and fill them with interior joy, Acts v. 41. (Haydock) 
If we explain it of the wicked, chastisement often makes them repent, Psalm lxxvii. 34. (Calmet) 
"Their idols have been multiplied after their followers, I will not join in their libations of blood. "(St. Jerome) 
David was continually exposed to such temptations, among the idolaters; but out of contempt, he would not even pronounce the name of the idols. (Calmet) 
Blood, or bloody. (Du Hamel) 
The pagan (Worthington) and Mosaic sacrifices shall cease. Christ will unite us (Berthier) by a more excellent oblation of his own body and blood. (Haydock) 
Christians shall be distinguished by a fresh appellation, being styled children of light and of God, in opposition to the sons of men, (St. Augustine; Calmet) and pagans.
