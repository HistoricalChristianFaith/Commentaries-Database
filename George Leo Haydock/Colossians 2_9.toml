For in him (in Christ) dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead (of the divinity) corporally. That is, in the person of Christ, the Son of God, really and substantially united to our human nature. Not inhabiting, as in a temple as the Nestorian heretics pretended, nor as by his grace in men's souls, but so as to be personally or hypostatically united to the soul and body of Christ. (Witham)
