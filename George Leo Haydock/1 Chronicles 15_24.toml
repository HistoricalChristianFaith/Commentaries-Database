Jehias is called Jehiel, ver. 18., and 21. He, Obededom, Barachias, and Elcana, (ver. 23.) were probably the four chief porters who attended the ark in arms; and others were, afterwards, stationed at the temple, chap. ix. 17. The two former took part also in the music, ver. 21. (Calmet) 
Perhaps two preceded and two went behind the ark, to keep off the crowd. (Menochius)
