In one hope of your vocation. The three great reasons that we have to love one another are contained in this verse, because we have but one body, of which Christ is the head. We are all animated by the same spirit, viz. the Holy Spirit, who is given to us all, and we all live in the same hope of eternal happiness. (Calmet)
