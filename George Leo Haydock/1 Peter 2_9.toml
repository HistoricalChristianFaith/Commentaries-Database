You are a purchased people, whom Christ purchased, bought and redeemed with the price of his precious blood. 
That you may declare his virtues; i.e. the excellencies and perfections of God, who hath called you, and now made you his people, which you were not, at least in this matter before, neither you that were Jews, nor especially you that were Gentiles. (Witham)
