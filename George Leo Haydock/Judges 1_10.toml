Hebron. This expedition against Hebron, is the same as is related Josue xv. 24. It is here repeated, to give the reader at once a short sketch of all the achievements of the tribe of Juda against the Chanaanites. (Challoner) 
Josue had taken Hebron before; (Josue x. 37,) and Caleb retakes it. (Calmet)
