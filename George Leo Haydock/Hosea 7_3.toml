Glad To please Jeroboam and their other kings, they have given themselves up to the worship of idols, which are mere falsehood and lies. (Challoner) 
We do not find one good king of Israel. (Calmet) 
But Jeroboam principally caused Israel to sin. (Haydock) 
His infernal policy changed the religion of his subjects.
