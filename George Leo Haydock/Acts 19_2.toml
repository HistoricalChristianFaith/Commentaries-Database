St. Paul first inquires of them, if they have received the Holy Spirit by confirmation. Their answer is probably not to be interpreted with rigour; since they must have heard something of the holy Spirit, so often mentioned in the Old Testament, by whom the prophets are said to speak They meant, they did not know there was in the Church, any means of communicating this Spirit to the faithful.
