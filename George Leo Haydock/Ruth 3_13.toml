"They say that Tob was the paternal uncle of MA halon: but it is not probable that his proper name should be only here mentioned, and not chap. iv. The Septuagint and Chaldean are conformable to the Vulgate and the opinion of the Jews is abandoned by most interpreters; (Calmet) and by the Protestants, "well, let him do the kinsman's part. "(Haydock)
