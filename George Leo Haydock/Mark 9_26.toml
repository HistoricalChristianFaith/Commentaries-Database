Him whom the devil had made like to the dead, the goodness of Christ, by his charitable touch, restored to life. Thus proving at once both his divinity and humanity; the former by his wonderful cure of healing, and the latter by performing this cure by a touch of the hand. (Ven. Bede) 
The devil could not inflict a real death on the child, on account of the dissent of the Author of life. (St. Chrysostom)
