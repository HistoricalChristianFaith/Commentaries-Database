The Egyptians made use of their pyramids for altars; and some suppose, that the high places of Juda were of a similar nature, and exposed the priests, who wore long robes without breeches, to the danger of being seen, chap. xxviii. 42.

Linen breeches, or girdles, were afterwards required, Leviticus xxxix. 27. and Exodus xxviii. 42. (Calmet)
