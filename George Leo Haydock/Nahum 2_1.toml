Face, O Juda. Septuagint, "who blows on thy face, (Genesis ii. 7.) freeing from misery. "Here St. Jerome's Greek copy ends the chapter. (Haydock) 
Watch. Behold Nabopolassar is about to attack thy enemies. Some think that Nahum addresses Ninive ironically. (Calmet) 
Nabuchodonosor wasted all the environs, and then took the city (Worthington) after his other conquests. (Calmet) 
But his father is here denoted. (Haydock)Ver. 2. Pride He hath punished Jacob for his pride; and therefore Ninive must not expect to escape. Or else, rendering the pride of Jacob means rewarding, that is, punishing Ninive for the pride they exercised against Jacob. (Challoner) 
After the Assyrians had seized the ten tribes, they became more insolent, and are therefore punished. (Worthington) 
The haughty Phul, had invaded the Israelites, and had taken them into captivity. This God will now resent, (Calmet) though he justly chastised his people by them. (Haydock)Ver. 3. Mighty men. He speaks of the Chaldeans and Medes sent to destroy the Ninivites. (Challoner) 
This is the common opinion. Yet it seems rather that the Ninivites are designated, as they were asleep and stumbled (Calmet) 
Stupified. That is, they drive on furiously, like men intoxicated with wine. (Challoner) 
Hebrew, "the fir-tree shall be shaken "or poisoned. Psalm cxix. 4. Septuagint read better, (Calmet) "their horsemen shall be in a hurry, or in confusion. "(Haydock) 
The armour was kept very shining, and the soldiers of Cyrus were clothed in purple, like himself. (Xen. iii.) 
Yet this availed nothing, while the men were asleep or confounded. (Calmet)Ver. 4. Streets. The Ninivites are disordered at the enemy's approach. (St. Jerome)Ver. 5. Muster. Literally,  "remember "(Haydock) the ancient heroes, Salmanasar (Calmet) 
Stumble, by running hastily on. (Challoner) 
Prepared to defend the city. (Haydock) 
All this represents a city surprised. It attempts to defend itself; but God renders all efforts vain. (Calmet)Ver. 6. Gates; floodgates or channel of the Tigris overflowing, chap. i. 8. 
Temple. Septuagint "palace. "Ver. 7. Soldier. Hebrew hut sab, (Haydock) "the station "or guard; the queen, or the statue of the idol, with the women (Calmet) who prostituted themselves in its honour. (Sanct. xxxi.) 
Ninive and its dependances are taken. (Grotius)Ver. 8. Waters: multitudes, (Apocalypse xvii. 15.) and riches; (Calmet) or the flood bursting upon them makes them flee. (Haydock) 
The citizens run away when the enemy had made a breach, as water does when the dam is broken down; and though some more valiant will exhort them to tarry, they will not succeed, nor save the city. (Worthington)Ver. 10. Kettle. In mourning they blacken their face. (Tav. Perse.)Ver. 11. Lions. The kings of Assyria had plundered various nations, (Haydock) and had brought the spoils to Ninive. But all shall be lost. (Worthington) 
These princes followed no law but their own will. 
The lion, Nabopolassar, or his son: though it seems rather to relate to the Assyrian monarchs. (Calmet)Ver. 13. Chariots. Septuagint, "multitude. "Some wild beasts were thus suffocated in their dens. (Theodoret)
