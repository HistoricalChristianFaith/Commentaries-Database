We know that we have passed from death to life; i.e. from the death of sin to the life of grace: we know it by a moral certainty, when we experience in our heart a love of our neighbour. 
He that loves not God and his neighbour, abides in death. He that hates his brother with a mortal hatred, or to a considerable degree, is a murderer.
