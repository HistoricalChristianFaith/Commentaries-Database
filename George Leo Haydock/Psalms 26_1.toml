David. Hebrew and the most correct copies of the Septuagint, have only "Of David. "(Haydock) 
The Complutensian and Aldine editions add indeed A psalm. But these form no rule, as the Vatican Septuagint is allowed to be the best. (Berthier) 
The others may, however, be consulted, as in some instances they may be preferable. (Haydock) 
This psalm might be composed to counteract the calumnies propagated against David, while he lived among the Philistines; (Theodoret; Flaminius) or it may contain the sentiments of the captives, as well as the two following canticles. (Calmet) 
The Church, (St. Augustine) or any afflicted soul, may thus appeal to the justice of God, (Berthier) and particularly the sacred ministers, when they are going to appear before him. 
Innocence. Only those whose conscience reproaches them with nothing, can hold this language. God is a just and unerring judge. (Calmet) 
Weakened. Hebrew also "slide "(Protestants) or "stagger. "(Symmachus) I am confident that my enemies will have no advantage over me. (Calmet)
