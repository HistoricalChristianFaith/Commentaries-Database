Prophet. It does not appear who this and the other prophets were who address Achab so boldly during these wars; if indeed they were different persons: Elias is never mentioned. Did Jezabel leave the rest alone? or did these wars break out before she began to persecute them? (Calmet) 
Many suppose that the prophet, who spoke on this occasion, was Micheas. (Menochius) 
But Achab complains that he always brought him evil tidings, chap. xxii. 8. (Salien)
