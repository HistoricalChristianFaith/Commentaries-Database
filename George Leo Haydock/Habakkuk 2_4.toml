Unbelieving. Protestants, "lifted up. "(Haydock) 
The king's vain projects shall fail. Roman Septuagint, "If he withdraw himself, my soul shall not have pleasure in him. But my just man shall live by my faith. "Others read with St. Paul, "my just man shall live by faith "Hebrews x. 38. (Calmet) 
The source of content arises from faith, (without which this life would be a sort of death, as the apostle and St. Augustine, Trinity xiv. 12., observe) because it is the beginning of life by grace, which the works of the law could not otherwise confer, Galatians iii. (Worthington) 
The Hebrew will admit the sense of the Septuagint and we ought rather to show this in passages which the authors of the New Testament quote, than to excuse them. Here their version seems preferable to that given by moderns, ecce elata est, non recta anima ejus in eo, the drift of which who can guess? Beza has acted unfairly, "at si quis se subduxerit non est gratum animo meo "whereas the text speaks of the "just man "as Theophylactus observes. "Hence all who know his theological opinions, may see how suspicious his translation must be accounted. "(Pearson, pref. Sept.) (Haydock)
