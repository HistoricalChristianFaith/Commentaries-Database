Solomon slept That is, died. He was then about fifty-eight years of age, having reigned forty years. (Challoner) 
St. Chrysostom, at different times, seems to have entertained opposite opinions on this head, (Haydock) which has been a matter of controversy among the Fathers, as it is at present with us. We ought to adore and imitate, with trembling, the silence of Scripture. (Calmet) 
Septuagint seem favourable to Solomon: (Proverbs xxiv. 32.) "At last I did penance, and looked forward, to embrace discipline. "(Haydock) 
But the Hebrew, Chaldean, and Vulgate have nothing similar. (Calmet) 
Some think that the Book of Proverbs, as well as that of Ecclesiastes, was composed by him after his repentance; and that he expresses his sentiments of affliction and self-condemnation, (Proverbs xxx. 2.) and his opinion of all earthly gratifications, Ecclesiastes i. 2. (Haydock) 
Yet this dreadful uncertainty may serve to keep us all in humble fear, and teach us to work out our salvation with trembling. (Calmet) 
If Solomon really repented, (Haydock) he might not have time or power to remove all the vestiges, and the very foundations of the idolatrous temples, which Ezechias also neglected in ruins, as no longer dangerous, and as so many monuments of the folly of Solomon. But Josias caused them to be entirely removed, 4 Kings xxiii. 13. (Salien, the year of the world 3059.) The daughter of Pharao would probably imitate her beloved husband. (Pineda) 
Sadoc seems to have departed this life about the same time with Solomon; as his son Achimaas, who had married Base math, the king's daughter, succeeded him in the pontificate, at the commencement of Roboam's reign. (Chron. Min. Heb. Salien)
