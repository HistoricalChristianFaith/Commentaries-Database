Amen, I say to you. St. Jerome remarks, that these words of our Saviour seem to contradict another part of Scripture, where it is said, Abraham desired to see my days; he saw them, and rejoiced. But St. Jerome answers his own objection thus: Abraham indeed saw my days, but only in a dark manner, in enigma, but not in reality, whilst you have your Lord with you; you speak to him, and interrogate him at pleasure. (St. Aquinas) 
Christ declares his disciples more blessed than the ancient patriarchs and prophets. They saw him only by faith, but the disciples with their corporal eyes. (St. Chrysostom)
