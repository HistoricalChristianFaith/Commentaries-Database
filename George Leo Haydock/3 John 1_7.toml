Taking nothing of the Gentiles. These ministers and preachers of the gospel, whom St. John recommends, took care, as St. Paul did, not to take any thing of the Gentiles, to whom they preached, lest they should be thought to preach to get money by it. But he puts Gaius in mind, that by assisting such men, he would become a fellow labourer in the gospel, and have a share in their reward. (Witham)
