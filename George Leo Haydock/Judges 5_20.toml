Stars, or angels, who are compared to the stars, and often fought for Israel, 2 Machabees x. 29. (Vales, Philos. chap. xxxi.) (Calmet)

Josephus ( v. 6.) informs us that a furious tempest of hail, met the enemy in the face, and rendered all their efforts useless. (Calmet) 
A similar instance of the divine protection was obtained by the prayers of the thundering legion, in the army of M. Aurelius; (Tertullian; Eusebius, Hist. v. 5.) and again, when Theodosius attacked the tyrant Eugenius, of which Claudian speaks, (in 3 Cons. Honor.) "Te propter gelid is Aquilo de monte procellis
Obruit adversas acies, revolutaque tela
Vertit in Auctores et turbine repulit hastas
O nimium dilecte Deo, cui fundit ab antris
Æolus armatas hiemes, cui militat æther
Et conjurati veniunt ad classica venti. "(Haydock)
