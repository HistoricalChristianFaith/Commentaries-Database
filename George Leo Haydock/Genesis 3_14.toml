Cursed. This curse falls upon the natural serpent, as the instrument of the devil; who is also cursed at the same time by the Holy Spirit. What was natural to the serpent and to man in a state of innocence, (as to creep to submit to the dominion of the husband) becomes a punishment after the fall. (St. Chrysostom) 
There was no enmity, before, between man and any of God's creatures; nor were they noxious to him. (Tirinus) 
The devil seems now to crawl, because he no longer aspires after God and heavenly things, but aims at wickedness and mean deceit. (Menochius)
