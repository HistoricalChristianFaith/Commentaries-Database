Lord. Hebrew may have different senses: "bless the Lord for having avenged Israel, the people willingly exposing themselves, or showing their concurrence. "Roman Septuagint, "What was hidden has been disclosed in Israel, when the people showed their good will, bless the Lord. "Porà, which the Vulgate has not expressed, commonly means to disclose, liberate; éthondob signifies to give freely, to expose one's self Septuagint and Theodotion together, (Calmet) and the Alexandrian copy have, "bless the Lord, for that leaders have risen up in Israel, and the people have shown their good will. "These two things were to be greatly desired, as a general can do but little without an obedient army, and the latter is, in a manner, useless, without a head. Both had been wanting in Israel for some time, and even still, some of the tribes seem to be blamed for not co-operating with zeal, ver. 15 This verse is repeated as a kind of chorus, ver. 9. The zeal and concord of the little troop, which had met the formidable army of Sisara, deserved the highest applause. (Haydock) 
Men bless God when they give him thanks; superiors bless by imparting some spiritual benefit. (Worthington)
