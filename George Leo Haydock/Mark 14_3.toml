Of precious spikenard. This was a perfume extracted and distilled from the leaves, tops, or stalks, of the plant or herb called nard. It was the custom of the eastern people to pour such precious perfumes on their own heads, or on the heads of their guests whom they had a mind to honour. (Witham) 
This happened six days previous to the pasch. The woman here mentioned was Mary, sister of Lazarus. (John xii. 3.)
