He is risen, as he said. This is to put them in mind of what they ought to have remembered, and believed. 
St. Luke is more particular; and tells us the angel said: remember how he spoke to you, when he was yet in Galilee, that the Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinners, and be crucified, and on the third day rise again. (Witham) 
By this the angel give them to understand, that if they would not believe him upon his own testimony, they should at least on the testimony of their Redeemer's promises, who had frequently assured them that on the third day he should rise again. (St. Chrysostom, hom. xc.)
