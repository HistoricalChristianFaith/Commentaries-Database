Zabulon. Aser and Nephthali lay more to the north. But they were also invited, as well as the few who might remain on the other side the Jordan, 1 Paralipomenon v. 26. At least, we find that some of Aser came, ver. 11. Thus those, who had been invited last, came first, while Ephraim continued more stubborn; (ver. 18) and the greatest part derided the messengers, as we still see too frequently verified in the days of the gospel.
