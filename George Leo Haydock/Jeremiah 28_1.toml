Juda. So far Sanctius joins with the former chapter, improperly. In the 4th year, seems rather an interpolation; though the Septuagint omit in the beginning, to reconcile the passage; and others date the 4th year from the last sabbatical one, which is quite unusual. See chap. xxvii. 1. (Calmet) 
Sedecias reigned 11 years, so that the 4th might be said to be the beginning. (Worthington) 
Prophet. Septuagint, "false prophet "to explain the meaning: the original denotes any prophet. (St. Jerome) (Haydock)
