David. This word alone occurs in Hebrew. Septuagint and St. Jerome add also Psalm. (Haydock) 
St. Augustine and Theod. agree with the Vulgate. (Calmet) 
These variations prove that we cannot depend much on the titles; and the learned do not look upon them as the word of God. The psalm may have been composed, when David was persecuted by his son, (Berthier) or by Saul. It may also allude to the captives. This is the first of the seven alphabetical psalms. The 33d, 35th, 110th, 111th, 118th, and 144th, are of the same description, being written in this manner (Calmet) on account of their importance, (Kimchi) or to help the memory, (Berthier) or for copies, to teach young people to write. (Grotius) 
Each verse forms a distinct sentence, not much connected with the rest. We perceive some derangement in the present Hebrew copies of this psalm, as the letters are not in proper order, though it might easily be restored by altering the divisions The Jews have been less attentive to preserve these divine canticles (Calmet) than their Thalmudical songs. (Pellican in Psalm lxxxv. 9.) 
The Septuagint and St. Jerome seem to have had better copies. Christ, the Church, (Calmet) or any pious soul, may address this fervent prayer to God under affliction. 
Lifted up in the true spirit of prayer, (Berthier) with fervour and confidence, Deuteronomy xxiv. 15., and Lamentations iii. 41. (Calmet) 
Attention is requisite to obtain a petition, (Worthington) as well as fervour (Haydock)
