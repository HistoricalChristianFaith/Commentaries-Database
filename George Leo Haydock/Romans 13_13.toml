quote='''
Let us walk honestly as in the day. As men are accustomed to do in the light, without being afraid that their works come to light. 
Not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering, not in beds and impurities, not in immodest disorders. (Witham) 
The night of the present life full of darkness, of ignorance, and of sin, is already far advanced; and the day of eternity approaches: let us therefore cast off the works of darkness. (Bible de Vence)
