The Lord. The Samaritan makes this a continuation of God's speech, "and I will give this people favour in the sight of the Egyptians, so that they shall give them what they ask. 
ver. 4. For, about midnight, I will go forth into the midst of the land of Egypt. 
ver. 5. And every first-born in the land of Egypt shall die (as in our fifth verse). 
ver. 6. And there 
ver. 7. But against any of the children of Israel shall not a dog move his tongue against man, nor even against beast, that thou mayest know that Jehovah doth put a difference between the Egyptians and Israel. 
ver. 8. And thou also shalt be greatly honoured in the land of Egypt, in the sight of Pharao's servants, and in the sight of the people. 
ver. 9. Then said Moses unto Pharao, Thus sayeth Jehovah: Israel is my son, my first-born; and I said unto thee, Let my son go, that he may serve me.

As, therefore, all had been once written in the Hebrew text, the transcribers might probably think themselves dispensed from repeating the same things; and thus they might change some passages, and still repel the accusation of any wilful corruption, which seems to be the meaning of Ben Chaim's preface to Bomberg's Hebrew Bible; where he acknowledges 13 such alterations made in the copies which were presented to King Ptolemy, and translated by the Septuagint. (Kennicott, Dis. 2 p. 310.) 
Moses. This exaltation of Moses and the people, took place only after the slaughter of the first-born, chap. xii. 36. Hence the Septuagint observes here, the Egyptians gave or lent them (echresan) all. (Haydock) 
The greatness and dignity of Moses, impressed the king with awe, and made the people more willing to assist the Hebrews. (Menochius)
