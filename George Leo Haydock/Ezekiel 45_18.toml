Take, or order the priests to do this annually, to prepare for the Passover, ver. 21. Moses mentions nothing of this, and it does not appear to have been put in execution. (Calmet) 
Yet it might be the first year after the dedication of the temple. The prophet does not say it was to be done every year. (Haydock)
