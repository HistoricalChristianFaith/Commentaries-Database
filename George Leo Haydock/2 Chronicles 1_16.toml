Coa may signify either some city, (Mariana) or an "emporium "where things are sold, as kuch means "a collection. "(Tirinus) (3 Kings x. 28.) Neglecting the points of the Masorets, we may well understand Coa, a city of Egypt, or an island of the Mediterranean. The Masorets read Mikve, instead of Micoa. (Du Hamel)
