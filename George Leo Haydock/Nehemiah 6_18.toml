Mosollam, one of the builders, chap. iii. 4. (Menochius) 
These two powerful men had consequently acted contrary to the laws of God, and the covenant of Esdras, with respect to marriages. They might fear the resentment of the zealous governor. Dangers from false brethren, (2 Corinthians xi. 26.) wars without, and fears within, generally assail the servants of God. (Haydock)
