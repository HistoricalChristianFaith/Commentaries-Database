St. Paul was even anxious to go and deliver the word to the Romans. Hence Mat. Polus, in his reflections on this verse, puts the following words into the mouth of the Apostle: Lucifuga non sum: ostendi id Antiochi√¶, Athenis, Ephesi et Corinthi: paratus sumin illa splendidissima urbe Roma Ostend ere.
