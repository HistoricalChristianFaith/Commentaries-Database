Christ coming is a high priest of the good things to come; of things which we hope for in heaven. 
He has entered by a more perfect tabernacle; i.e. not passing, like the priests of the former law, into a tabernacle made by human art and hands, but by the tabernacle of his own body or flesh, says St. Chrysostom, framed by the Holy Spirit. (Witham)
