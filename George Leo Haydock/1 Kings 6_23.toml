Olive. Hebrew, "trees full of oil or resin "distinguished from olive trees, 2 Esdras viii. 15. Vatable translates, "pine "others, "cypress-wood. "(Calmet) 
Height. Their gigantic stature served to denote the magnificence and greatness of God. They looked towards the east. (Menochius) 
Their wings extended equalled their height; so that the two cherubims occupied the whole space from north to south, (Haydock) covering the smaller cherubim of Moses. They only reached half the height of the sanctuary. Their form is not clearly ascertained. See Exodus xxv. 18. (Calmet) 
What will the Iconoclasts say to these images, which adorned not only the temple, which the people might behold, but also the most sacred place? (Haydock) 
Villalpand and Salien suppose, that a cherub resembled a young man in the higher parts, adorned with four wings of an eagle and a lion's skin, round his breast and shoulders, while his feet were like those of a calf. (Menochius) 
Ezechiel seems to insinuate that, in the temple, the cherubim had two faces, one of a man and another of a lion, each looking at palm-trees; as these were placed alternately with cherubim, round the walls, Ezechiel xli. 18, 19.
