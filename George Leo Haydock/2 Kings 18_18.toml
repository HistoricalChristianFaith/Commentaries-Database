House. Josephus says, "procurator of the palace or kingdom. "(Haydock) 
The house often refers to the temple, when placed without any explanation, Isaias xxii. 15. (Calmet) 
Eliacim was prefect of the pr√¶torium, (Salien) or grand master of the palace. He was richly dressed, and possessed a great authority over the people. 
Scribe. See Judges viii. 14. This Sobna, according to St. Jerome, is different from the one who was over the house in the days of Manasses, before Eliacim was restored to his office, (Calmet) unless he also was a different person. (Tirinus) 
The Jews say Sobna was deprived of his dignity, on account of his having betrayed the lower city to Sennacherib. See Isaias xxii. 21. 
Recorder, or chancellor, 2 Kings viii. 16. (Calmet)
