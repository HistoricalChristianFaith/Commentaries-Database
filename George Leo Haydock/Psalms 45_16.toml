Sons. Protestants, "shall be thy children. "(Haydock) 
This was the wish of those present. But it does not appear that the daughter of Pharao had any children, (Calmet) and thus it seems improbable, that she is here spoken of, as the psalmist foretells the establishment and glory (Berthier) of the Church, by means of the apostles, (St. Chrysostom) and their successors, who are made princes over all the world. Let those who are cut off acknowledge this, and come to the unity, that they may be introduced into the temple of the king. (St. Augustine) (Worthington) 
Innumerable saints of all ranks, kings and emperors, acknowledge the Church for their mother, and submit to her. (Calmet)
