Out, towards morning, (Calmet; Exodus xxvii. 20.) when some of the lamps were to be extinguished. (Worthington) 
Samuel slept. Some would transpose these words to the end of the verse, as they think it improbable that Samuel should be in the place where the high priest himself could enter only once a year. (Vatable) 
But this change seems harsh and unnecessary, as Heli and Samuel might be in apartments contiguous to the holy place. (Sanctius; Menochius; Calmet) 
During the night none of the priests would be in the sanctuary, so that Heli might form a judgment that none of them had called Samuel. (Tirinus)
