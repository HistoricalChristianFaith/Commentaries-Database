Girl in age, not 12; or, if more, at least not married, nor out of her father's house, ver. 17. For either of these conditions rendered a girl incapable of binding herself irrevocably. The father, or all who had the care of her, might rescind her vow, provided they did it as soon as it came to their knowledge, or on the same day, ver. 15. Boys under 13, were under similar restrictions. (Grotius) 
Wives, and, in general, all who are under subjection, could not dispose of themselves without the consent of their superiors, as their want of prudence, might have otherwise injured what belonged, in some measure, to another. (Haydock) 
The law, therefore, submits their case to the decision of their immediate judges. (Calmet) 
But if the thing, which a person vowed, was already of strict obligation, as to fast on the day of expiation, (Leviticus xxiii. 29,) no one could presume to hinder his wife from complying with this double duty. (Worthington)
