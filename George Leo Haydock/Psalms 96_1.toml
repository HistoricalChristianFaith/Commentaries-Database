Captivity. The greater canticle of David, (1 Paralipomenon xvi.) was probably divided, on that occasion, (Calmet) into three. This forms the second part, from ver. 23; as the psalm civ., to ver. 16., does the first. The three last verses of David's canticle, (ver. 34.) occur Psalm cv. 1, 47.

This perhaps relates to the establishment of the Church, though it might be also sung at the return from Babylon. (Berthier)
