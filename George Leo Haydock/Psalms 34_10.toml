Rich of this world, (1 Timothy vi. 17.; Menochius) are often poor in spiritual gifts. (Worthington) 
Those who are poor in both respects, are truly miserable, (Haydock) since they cannot satisfy their craving appetite. But the prophet admires those who are poor in spirit, whether they have many possessions or not. (Berthier) 
The fear of the Lord is his treasure, Isaias xxxiii. 6. The saint is content under every dispensation of Providence. (Haydock)

The same term, cephirim, is often applied to men in power, Ezechiel xix 2., and Job iv. 10. (Berthier) 
Good. If the saints be sometimes deprived of provisions, they know that it is better for them; as God directs all for their good. (Haydock)
