That perhaps this thought of thy heart may be forgiven thee. The word perhaps, as the interpreters commonly observe on this and other places, many times does not imply any doubt or uncertainty. There could be no doubt, says St. Chrysostom, only as to his repenting: if he repented, it is certain he would find remission of his sins. (Witham) 
St. Augustine (ep. cviii.) understands the text, metanoeson apo of penance done for heinous offences in the primitive Church, and teaches us to translate it thus, as it is in the Vulgate, both here and 2 Corinthians xii. 21, and Apocalypse ix. 21, and adds, that very good men do daily penance for venial sins, by fasting, prayer, and alms.
