Manasses, whether king Osee consented, or the people of Juda followed the dictates of their zeal, neglecting the regular order of things, which forbids the subjects of one kingdom to interfere thus with those of another. (Grotius) (St. Augustine, q. in Deut. vii., and 12.) 
If Ezechias gave orders, we may suppose that he was assured of his neighbour's consent. Josias (chap. xxxiv. 6.) followed his example after most part of Israel was led away captive, and the country obeyed the king of Assyria. (Calmet)
