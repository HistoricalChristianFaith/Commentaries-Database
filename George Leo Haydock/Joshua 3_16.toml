Sarthan. Hebrew, "rose up on a heap, very far from (or to) the city of Adom, that is beside Sarthan. "The situation of Adom can only be ascertained by that of Sarthan, which was near Bethsan, or Scythopolis, (3 Kings iv. 12,) in the vale of Jezrahel, on the Jordan. Many copies of the Septuagint read Cariathiarim, though it was six or seven leagues up the country, west of Jericho. (Calmet)

But it could not properly determine how far the waters rolled back. (Calmet) 
Failed. Hebrew, "and those that came down towards the sea of the plain, (or of Araba, which means a desert, fit only for pasturage) the salt sea, failed, were cut off "from the waters above Jericho. The Jordan after running three miles in the lake of Sodom, without mixing its waters, becomes at last reluctantly confounded with it. Velut invitus.postremo ebibitur, aquasque laudatas perdit, pestilent bus mixtus. (Pliny, v. 15.)
