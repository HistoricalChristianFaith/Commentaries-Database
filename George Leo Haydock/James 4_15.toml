For what is your life? it is a vapour. We frequently meet with three beautiful comparisons in holy writ. "Remember that my life is but wind. As a cloud is consumed, and passeth away; so he that shall go down to hell, shall not come up. "(Job vii. 7, 9.) "Man is like to vanity, his days pass away like a shadow. "(Psalm cxliii. 4.) Similar expressions also frequently occur in profane authors. Nemo tam Divos habuit faventes Crastinum ut possit sibi polliceri. (Seneca) With reason then did our Saviour say, "Be you then also ready, for at what hour you think not, the Son of Man will come. "(Luke xii. 40.) (Calmet) _
