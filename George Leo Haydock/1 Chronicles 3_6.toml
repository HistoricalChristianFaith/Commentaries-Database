Elisama, or Elisua, chap. xiv. 5. (Calmet) 
Hebrew substitutes Elishama and Eliphelet, and Nogah, the last name being "an evident corruption of Nepheg, and the two former being taken in too soon, and still repeated, "in their proper places. "The Vatican Septuagint is likewise interpolated, (2 Kings v. 14.) by the insertion of eleven names from another version, and two names are twice repeated, so that we have 24 sons of David instead of 11. (Kennicott)
