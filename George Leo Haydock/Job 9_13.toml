God. Protestants, "If God will not withdraw his anger, the proud helpers do stoop under him. "Septuagint, "For he is not turned aside by wrath "(or Roman edition) "God, whose anger cannot be averted "(Haydock) unless we repent: (Calmet) "under him the whales below heaven bend. "(Haydock) 
Perhaps they may have had some notions, like the Rabbins, respecting Leviathan; and St. Jerome may have alluded to the fable of the giants placed under mountains; (Virgil, Ã†neid iii., and ix.; Calmet) or to Atalas propping the skies. (Haydock) 
World. Great heroes, (Calmet) Kings, (Pineda) angels, (Menochius) who move the spheres, (Worthington) or devils, Ephesians vi. 12. (Cajetan)
