He only enjoyed the throne three months and ten days. (Tirinus) 
We must however observe, (Haydock) that the Alexandrian Septuagint, the Syriac, and Arabic read here, eighteen. (Calmet) 
"It is, in my opinion, a pity that the translators have not mended such apparent errata of the scribe of the present Hebrew out of 2 Kings xxiv. 8., or out of Septuagint, or out of common sense. "(Wall) (Kennicott) 
These eight years may be dated from the captivity, and not from the king's birth. (Usher) (Du Hamel)
