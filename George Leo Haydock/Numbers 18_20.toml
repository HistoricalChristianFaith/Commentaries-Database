Nothing. No portion of land, like the other tribes; but only some towns and suburbs, allotted to thy children in the midst of the Israelites. They might purchase land as well as others, and might obtain a property by the vows of their brethren, Leviticus xxvii. 14. Jeremias (xxxii. 7,) and St. Barnabas had land, Acts iv. 37. God had provided for his ministers abundantly, without exposing them to much trouble. The Levites enjoyed the tithes of all the produce of the country, besides the first-fruits of corn, dough, and some parts of each beast that was killed in the town, Deuteronomy xviii. 3. The priests, who were still fewer in number, enjoyed the 100th part of the revenue of all Israel, receiving tithes from the Levites, and innumerable accidental offerings of wine, which made Philo say (de pr√¶m. Sacerd.) that "the law of Moses gave the priests all the splendour of kings. "They might, therefore, be zealous to preserve religion for their own temporal advantages. 
I am God promises to reward those who serve him with fidelity, Deuteronomy xviii. 1., and Josue xiii. 14. The priests of the new law ought more particularly to serve him with disinterestedness, for his own sake. (Calmet) 
Of this they are reminded, when they take the first step towards holy orders. The bishop cuts off some of their hair in the form of a cross, while they recite, The Lord is the portion of my inheritance, and of my cup; it is Thou that wilt restore my inheritance to me, Psalm xv. 5. (Pontif. Rom.) (Haydock) 
"Some possess riches, while they serve Christ, who appeared in the garb of poverty. "(St. Jerome, ad Nepot.)
