Silence. Christ displayed the light of truth from Sion, at his first coming. But he would not judge any till the second, John iii. 17., and viii. 15. (St. Jerome) (Calmet) 
Before him, at the last day, (Haydock) or in hell. (St. Athanasius) 
Our Saviour appeared formerly with great mildness: but he will come with majesty and terror, after fire shall have destroyed all transitory things. (Worthington)
