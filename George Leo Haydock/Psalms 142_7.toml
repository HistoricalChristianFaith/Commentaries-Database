Prison. Or the cave. (Calmet) 
As David was never in prison, this is more applicable to Christ, seized by his enemies, and consigned to the tomb. (Houbigant) 
Name. God expects it from us, Psalm xlix. 15. The motive of David in praying to be delivered, was most disinterested, as he had in view God's glory, and the gratification of his just servants, who would join with him in returning thanks, and promoting the divine worship. 
Wait. Hebrew, "will crown. "(Symmachus) (St. Jerome) (Haydock) 
But Aquila adopts the Chaldean and Syriac sense of the word, with the Septuagint, (Calmet) and this may very well be the meaning, as David and his friends did not pretend to reign till the death of Saul. (Berthier) 
He wished to be at liberty in the country where God's worship was observed, (Worthington) and determined to promote religion with all his power; as, under Saul, the good were under great restraints, and the priests were even slain. (Haydock) 
All this happened to David, as the figure of Christ. He had then a clear understanding of what the latter would have to endure from the Jews, and how he would pray to his Father. In the first part, he complains of Judas, and in the second, he desires to be set free from hell, because the faith of all the saints depended on his resurrection. (Ven. Bede) (Worthington)
