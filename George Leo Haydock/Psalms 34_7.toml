Encamp: Literally, "send. "
This is explained of Jesus Christ, by St. Augustine and St. Jerome. Hebrew and Septuagint (parembalei) intimate that the angel himself shall encamp round God's servants, so that no evil shall come near them.
One angel is here represented as equal to a great army. A Protestant commentator observes, that David attributed his escape to the protection of an angel, and was very thankful for it. We see, therefore, what advantages we may derive from the blessed spirits? What then should hinder us from addressing our prayers to them?
