Tharsis. Bordering on "the sea "(Berthier) or in Cilicia, though we find not that Solomon ever claimed any authority there, or that the Mediterranean was under his control. He sent his fleet indeed to Tharsis; (3 Kings x. 22.) but Arabia and Saba brought presents, or tribute to him. Under the name of islands, the Hebrews comprise all places, to which they had to go by water, as Asia Minor, Isaias lxvi. 19. (Calmet) 
The three kings were the first who verified this prediction concerning our Saviour; and afterwards Constantine and other potentates embraced his religion. Among other islands, Britain, which is the greatest in Europe, was partly converted in the days of the apostles, (Theodoret in Timothy) and more under Eleutherius; though the English nation received the faith from St. Augustine of Canterbury and others, sent by Pope Gregory the Great, A.D. 596. (Worthington) 
Saba. Hebrew Seba. The preceding Arabia is sheba, (Haydock) and refers to some of those who peopled that country. 
Gifts, or tribute, 1 Paralipomenon xviii. (Calmet) 
If the former term, presents, (Hebrew mincha, "a sacrifice of flour"; Haydock) be taken in the strict sense, the text cannot be applicable to any but the true God, the Messias. (Berthier) 
The wise men, who came from this country, adored and offered presents to Christ, Matthew ii. (Menochius)
