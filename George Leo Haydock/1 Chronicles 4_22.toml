He, that made viz., Joazim, the meaning of whose name in Hebrew, is, he that made the sun to stand. In like manner the following names, Lying, (Cozeba) Secure, (Joash) and Burning, (Saraph) are substituted in place of the Hebrew names of the same signification. (Challoner) 
The first etymology is not perfectly accurate, as Jokim means simply, "he made to stand "Jachin, the pillar which Solomon erected, has the same import. (Haydock) 
Some injudicious person seems to have placed the sun in the margin, whence it has crept into the text. (Tirinus) 
It might be occasioned by the fable of the Rabbins, who assert (Haydock) that Elimelech wrought the like miracle as Josue, to convince the people of Bethlehem of the necessity of being converted; but, finding them incorrigible, denounced a famine, which forced him to retire with his family into the country of Moab. (St. Jerome, Trad.) 
Elimelech died in that country; but these four descendants of Sela retired, probably, along with him, and returned afterwards to Lehem, or Bethlehem, as it is customary to omit a part of a word. (Tirinus) 
This town was peopled by different branches of Juda's family, ver. 4., and chap. ii. 54. (Calmet) 
LA hem Septuagint seem to leave the original terms: "he made them return to Abedderim Athoukiim. "
Who returned, is also left as a proper name by the Protestants, (Haydock) "And Jasubi Lehem. "(Vatable) (Menochius) 
It is not easy to decide, when the Hebrew words should be translated. 
Old. Hebrew, "and ancient words "(Haydock) records, shewing where these families resided, (Calmet) unless this be also the name (Haydock) of a place. (Septuagint)
