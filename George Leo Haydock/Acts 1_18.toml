Possessed a field. Judas is here said to have done, what was done by others, with the thirty pieces of money, the reward of his iniquity. And being hanged, that is, as St. Matthew says, (chap. xxvii. 5.) having hanged himself, he burst asunder. The Greek has it, falling headlong, as perhaps he did, by the judgment of God, from the place or tree where he hanged himself. (Witham) 
Judas did not possess the potter's field, but he furnished the price to buy it, giving back the thirty pieces of silver. (Menochius) 
We often say in common, that we have done what happens in consequence of any action of ours, though it was not in our first intention. (Calmet)
