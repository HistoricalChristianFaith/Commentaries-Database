Earth. All who hear of the wonders of God, must praise him; and who can be ignorant of what He has done, (Calmet) in the defeat of the enemies of his people, (Haydock) of Sennacherib, Cambyses? Yet all the earth will be instructed only by the propagation of the Gospel. (Calmet) 
Justice, against thy enemies, (Haydock) though this word may here imply "mercy "in opposition to the judgments, ver. 12. (Calmet) 
These perfections are never at variance. (Worthington)
