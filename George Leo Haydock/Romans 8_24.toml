For we are saved by hope, as it is the will of God we should be, waiting and hoping with patience for the things which we have not seen, which neither the eye hath seen, nor the ear hath heard (1 Corinthians ii. 9.) 
And the spirit also helpeth our infirmity, asketh for us with unspeakable groanings. If we understand this according to the common exposition, of the divine spirit of the Holy Spirit, the sense is, says St. Augustine, that the Holy Spirit maketh us ask: but we may understand the Spirit of God and his grace, diffused in our souls, and in particular that gift of the Holy Spirit, called the spirit of prayer, given to the new Christians, which taught them what to ask, and how to pray. See St. Chrysostom. (Witham)
