Year of Artaxerxes, (Calmet) after he was associated with his father on the throne; (Tirinus) or rather the death of Xerxes. From this period the seventy weeks of Daniel are dated, (Du Hamel) or from the 23rd of Artaxerxes, and the 28th of Xerxes, (Tirinus) as above three years must have been consumed in making preparations for the walls (Josephus, xi. 5.) 
The name of Nehemias, "comforter of God "as well as his being sent by a king to build, prefigured Jesus Christ, sent by God to comfort and establish his Church. (Ven. Bede) (Worthington) (Haydock) 
Susa. Hebrew, "in Susa, the palace "where the kings of Persia resided in the months of winter, (Athen. xii. 1.) and of spring. (Xenophon) (Cyr. viii.) (Curt. v. 8.)

Came. Some Latin copies add, "to me "(Lyranus) as if a deputation had been sent; but of this the text is silent. (Calmet) Ver. 3. Province of Judea, subject to the Persians, as it was afterwards to the Romans; though, at present, they were allowed to have governors of their own nation. (Menochius)

Fire, recently; (Menochius. See 1 Esdras iv. 12., and ix. 9.) or rather by Nabuchodonosor; as the kings of Persia would not suffer the city to be fortified, for fear of a fresh rebellion. (Lyranus) (Tirinus) 
We find that little progress (chap. iii., and iv.; Calmet) had at least been made in the work, though the blame must rather be laid on the enemies of Israel, than on several of the kings of Persia, who seem to have authorized the undertaking, which Cambyses, or Smerdis, had for a time interrupted. They only specify, indeed, that leave was granted to build the temple. But they allowed them to erect houses for themselves, which could not have been done to any purpose, among so many enemies, unless they had been defended by some sort of fortifications. (Haydock) Ver. 4. Days; about four months, till Nisan. (Calmet) Ver. 6. They. Hebrew and Septuagint, "we have sinned. "(Menochius) Ver. 7. Vanity. Hebrew, "we have been corrupted.
