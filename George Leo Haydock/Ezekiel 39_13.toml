Day. It does not occur in the calendar. Yet Comestor and the Carthusian mentions Cambysa, the day when Bethulia was delivered, Judith xvi. 31. The history of Judith may perhaps relate to the defeat of this prince. The embellishments will not injure the truth. The Jews immediately after his death recommence the building of the temple, (1 Esdras iv.; Aggeus i. 14.) which they are forced to discontinue, till Hystaspes confirmed the decree of Cyrus. This was the grand object of their desires, and therefore the day when Cambyses fell was ever memorable to them. (Calmet, Diss.) 
So will that be for Christians, when Antichrist shall be no more. (Menochius)
