Christ According to the letter, is spoken of their king, who is called the Christ; that is, the anointed of the Lord. But it also relates, in the spiritual sense, to Christ our Lord, suffering for our sins. (Challoner) (Isaias liii. 5.) (St. Augustine, City of God xviii. 33.) 
It literally speaks of Josias, or of Sedecias. (Worthington) 
Josias was slain by the Egyptians. (St. Jerome, in Zacharias xii.) 
But Sedecias seems chiefly to be meant. The people were much attached to him, though he was wicked; and they expected that he would have rescued them from the power of the Chaldeans, as his league with the neighbouring Gentiles (Calmet) seemed to insure, (Haydock) if they had proved faithful. (Calmet) 
But all was useless against the Lord. (Haydock)
