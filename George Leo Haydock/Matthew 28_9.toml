Jesus met them. According to St. Mark, Christ appeared first to Mary Magdalene; and the particulars are related by St. John. She at first did not know him, but took him for the gardener: then he called her by her name Mary, and she knew him: he said to her, touch me not, for I have not yet ascended to my Father; i.e. according to the common exposition, I have not ascended, nor am yet going to ascend; thou mayest see me again before I ascend: this is not the last time. 
We also read here, (ver. 9,) that he appeared to some of the other women, as they were returning to Jerusalem from the sepulchre, and that they laid hold on his feet, and adored him; nor is it said that he hindered them. (Witham) 
They were then returning to carry the news to the disciples, when they laid hold of his feet. To touch the feet, was in the Scripture a species of veneration; (see Exodus iv. 25; 4 Kings iv. 27.) as among the Greeks, the touching of the knees. Thus Homer's Illiad, b. i., Kai ra paroith autoio Kathezeto, Kai labe gounon. (ver. 500.) And again, ver. 512, os epsato gounon.
