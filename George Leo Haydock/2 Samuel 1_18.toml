Bow. So this canticle was entitled, because it spoke in praise of the bow and arrows of Saul and Jonathan, ver. 22. So one of the works of Hesiod is called "a buckler "of Theocritus "a flute "of Simmias "a wing "Septuagint have neglected this word entirely (Calmet) in the Roman edition. But it is found in the Alexandrian copy, which reads "Israel "instead of Juda, perhaps properly. (Grabe, prol. iv. 2.) (Haydock) 
Chaldean, "to shoot with the bow. "Many suppose that David cautioned his men to exert themselves in that art, (Menochius) as they might soon expect to have to encounter the Philistines, (Tirinus) who were very expert bowmen. (Worthington) 
But the former interpretation seems preferable. (Calmet) 
The bow might be also the beginning of some favourite song, to the tune of which (Du Hamel) David would have his men to sing this canticle, (Haydock) particularly when they went to battle. (Grotius) 
Just. See Josue x. 3. (Menochius) 
It seems this was a more ancient record, to which the author of this book refers. (Calmet) 
He might have in view the canticle of Anna, (1 Kings ii. 4,) or some other. (Haydock) 
The custom of composing canticles, on such solemn occasions, is very ancient and frequent. See 3 Kings iii. 33., and xiii. 29., and Jeremias xlviii. 31. (Homer, Iliad psch) The style of this piece can hardly be equalled by the most polite writers. (Calmet) 
David is chiefly occupied with the praises of Jonathan. (Haydock) 
Consider. Places. This sentence is omitted in Hebrew, Chaldean, Septuagint, and in some copies of St. Jerome's version. (T. i. p. 365, Nov. edit. op.) It is a farther explication of the subsequent verse. (Calmet) 
Yet the Septuagint read, "Erect a pillar, O Israel, in honour of the slain, thy wounded soldiers. How are the mighty fallen? "The Hebrew seems to be different from what the Septuagint, Chaldean, read, as the Masora now adopts etsbi, instead of etsib, which has greatly puzzled interpreters. Hence Aquila translates akriboson, with the Septuagint of Ximenes, i.e., "Execute or consider with attention "this sepulchral monument on which you shall inscribe, "For the dead and for thy wounded. "It was to be placed on some "eminence "according to custom. The present Hebrew is very indeterminate, denoting "glory, a honey-comb", Ezechiel xx. 6., and Daniel xi. 16, 41. See Grabe, Prol. (Haydock)
