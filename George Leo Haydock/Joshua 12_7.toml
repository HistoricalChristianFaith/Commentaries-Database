Seir. The same expression occurs, chap xi. 17. Hebrew, "from Baal gad, in the vale of Libanus, even unto Mount Halak, that goeth up to Seir. "(Haydock) 
Halak means, "bald or naked. "It is not know what mountain it denotes. Josue, (Calmet) or the Israelites, (Haydock) conquered "all the country beyond the Jordan, on the north from Baal gad, at the foot of Libanus, and from Hermon, where these mountains meet, as far as the mountains of separation "which divide the country of Chanaan from that of Seir, on the south of Judea. (Calmet) 
Baal gad was situated on the north western borders of this territory, not of the Jordan. (Haydock)
