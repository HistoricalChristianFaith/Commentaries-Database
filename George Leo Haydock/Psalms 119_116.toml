Live. St. Augustine (tr. 124. in Joan.) beautifully describes the life of the just here and in heaven. (Berthier) 
We may thus pray for grace, and spiritual life with confidence, if we be resolved to keep the commandments. Yet we must not fail to entreat God not to suffer us to be confounded, which will not be the case, if we entertain hope, and charity be poured on our hearts, Romans v. 5. (Worthington)
