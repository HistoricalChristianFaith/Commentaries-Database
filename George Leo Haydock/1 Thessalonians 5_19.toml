Do not oppose either the interior gifts of the holy Spirit, which are his graces, nor his exterior gifts of prophecy. Take the regular precautions of prudence, that you be not deceived by those who pretend to be inspired; but when satisfied that the inspiration comes from heaven, do not despise it. Be like good bankers, take the good coin, and reject the counterfeit. (St. Cyril of Alexandria)
