Christ now no longer calls the belief in him, or the preaching of the gospel, the bread that he will give them; but he declares that it is his own flesh, and that flesh which shall be given for the life of the world. (Calmet) 
This bread Christ then gave, when he gave the mystery of his body and blood to his disciples. (Ven. Bede)
