Will. Literally, "souls. "(Haydock) 
Some ancient copies have, "the hands. "
Unjust. Hebrew, "false. "(Haydock)

Many find fault with the Septuagint and Vulgate in this place, but without reason; and they do not agree in their versions. Symmachus and St. Jerome come near to us. Puach means to breathe, or entangle; and our version intimates, that "iniquity has entangled itself: "vipheach chamas, "and open lying. "(St. Jerome) (Berthier) 
The accusers of Susanna, and of our Saviour, could not agree in their testimony. The Chaldeans continually calumniated the captives, Isaias lii. 4., and Jeremias l. 33. (Calmet) 
World lings still do the same, (Matthew v.) delighting in lies, which will prove their own ruin. (Worthington)
