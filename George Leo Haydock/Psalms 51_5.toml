Sins. Hebrew, "iniquity. And in sin did my mother warm or conceive me. "Original sin has a manifold deformity, and is the fatal root of other transgressions. See St. Augustine, Ench.; St. Thomas Aquinas, i. 2. q. 82. a. 2., est multiplex virtute. (Haydock) 
The prophet speaks here undoubtedly of original sin. (Amama) 
No text could be more express, as the Fathers and the Jews agree. Yet Grotius, whose opinions are almost always singular, and dangerous, maintains, that the expression is hyperbolical, and only implies, that David had been long subject to sin, even from his infancy, as Job was naturally of a merciful disposition, Job xxxi. 18.

The weakness of man is a motive for pity: (Menochius) David pleads for it, yet allows, that the fault was entirely his own, and that he had grace sufficient to have avoided it. (Calmet) 
The consideration of our sinful origin, ought to move us to beg, that we may be washed still more, and that we may not yield to our evil propensities. (Worthington) 
We may resist them, and therefore David would not make vain excuses in sin, as God loves the truth, and a sincere confession. (Menochius)
