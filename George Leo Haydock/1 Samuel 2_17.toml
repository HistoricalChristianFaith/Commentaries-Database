Lord. People, seeing that the law was not observed, refrained from presenting victims. (Menochius) 
They are but too apt to follow the bad example of their teachers. (Haydock) 
Hence God punishes the smallest faults of his ministers, with great severity, since they withdraw people from his service, by their scandalous behaviour, and are guilty of a more horrid sacrilege than those who laid violent hands on the Lord of majesty. (St. Bernard, ser. i.) Nothing brings a greater discredit on religion. (Calmet)
