Remembrance. This is all that occurs in Hebrew, or in many Greek copies, though the following words were perhaps extant in the copy of the Septuagint, or were added to complete the sentence. Several of the verses are found in Psalm xxxiv., and xxxix., and seem to have been used as a form of prayer in any danger. (Berthier) 
David foresaw that Christ would pray for the safety of his natural and mystical body, and would be heard. (Menochius) 
The following psalm is a sequel to this. (Calmet)
