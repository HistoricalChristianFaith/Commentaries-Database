Spoke. Septuagint subjoin some words, which seem to be lost in the original: ["when Jeroboam was standing, on the festival day, upon the altar. And turning, he lifted up his eyes towards the tomb of the man of God,} who spoke these words. "(Haydock) 
"The copies, from which this version was made, read differently from the modern copies "and often better. (Kennicott, diss. ii. p. 335.)
