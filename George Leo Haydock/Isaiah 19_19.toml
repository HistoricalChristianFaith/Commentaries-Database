Altar. If the Jews were forbidden to have any other than the one at Jerusalem, how can the prophet announce this as a blessing? Onias being excluded from the high priesthood, retired into Egypt, and obtained leave to build the temple Onion, in the Nome, though not in the city of Helipolis, above Bubaste, on the Nile, alleging that Isaias had foretold this event, and that one was already built at Leontopolis. (Josephus, Jewish Antiquities xii. 15., and xiii. 6.) 
But we must allow with the fathers and Jews in the days of St. Jerome, that this prediction regarded the Messias, when altars might be lawfully erected in every nation. See Misna, tr. Moneuth, xiii. 10. 
Monument. The cross is set up wherever Christ is adored. (Calmet) 
The Egyptians shall embrace Christianity, and St. Anthony of Thebes, shall live a holy (Worthington) and austere life. (Haydock)
