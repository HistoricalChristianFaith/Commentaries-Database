Where, or in which state, when we put on the new man by sanctity and grace, God makes no distinction betwixt Jew and Gentile (Witham) 
In the Church of Christ God makes no exception of persons; all are called to the marriage feast, whether Jews (formerly the most favoured people of God) or Greeks, (who were reckoned the most polite, or learned) or Barbarians, or Scythians: (who are esteemed the most cruel and ferocious of men) still these are called; Christ died for all. (Calmet) 
In St. Paul's epistles, by the Greeks are usually designated the Gentiles. (Bible de Vence)
