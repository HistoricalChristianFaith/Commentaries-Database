Dagon is the same as Derceto, Atergatis, Venus, and the moon, (Calmet) and was represented like a woman, (Tirinus) as far as the waist, and a fish below. (Haydock) (Judges xvi. 23.) 
The ark was placed near the idol, out of respect; (Calmet) or as a trophy of the victory, which they attributed to Dagon. (Menochius) 
Thus they hung up the arms of Saul in the temple of Asteroth; (chap. xxxi. 10,) and David placed the sword of Goliah in the tabernacle.
