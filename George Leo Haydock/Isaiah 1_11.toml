Victims. Without piety, they are useless. God tolerated bloody victims to withdraw the people from idolatry, but he often showed that they were not of much importance, in order that they might be brought to offer the sacrifice of the new law, which eminently includes all the rest. (St. Jerome) (Psalm xlix. 9., Amos v. 21., and Jeremias vi. 20.) (Theodoret)
