Onesiphorus. This person, also an inhabitant of Asia, seems to have supplied St. Paul with necessaries, as well at Rome during his confinement, as at Ephesus. Timothy being with St. Paul at the latter place, knew better the charities of Onesiphorus there than at Rome, at which place he was not eye witness of them. (Denis the Carthusian)
