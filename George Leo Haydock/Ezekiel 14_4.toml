According. Hebrew, "in (Calmet) the multitude of his idols. "(Haydock) 
I will still disclose the truth; (Chaldean) or a false prophet is here spoken of, whom God will suffer to deceive those who wish to be deluded. He will not have his own prophets speak an untruth. See 3 Kings xxii. 10. Christ evaded the insidious questions of his enemies, Matthew xxi. 23. (Calmet)
