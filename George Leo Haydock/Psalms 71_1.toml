Of the sons of Jonadab. The Rechabites, of whom see Jeremias xxxv. By this addition of the seventy-two interpreters , we gather that this psalm was usually sung in the synagogue, in the person of the Rechabites, and of those who were first carried away into captivity. (Challoner) 
This first captivity happened under Joakim, in the year of the world 3398, the second, under Jechonias, 3405, and the last, when the city was destroyed and Sedecias was taken, 3416. (Usher) 
The Rechabites entered Jerusalem a little before the first of these events, and set the people an example of obedience by submitting to Nabuchodonosor, as Jeremias directed. (Bellarmine) (Menochius) 
St. Jerome considers their being confined within the walls, as their first captivity. (E. ad Paul. and ad Rust.) 
But there is nothing in this title in Hebrew, Eusebius, and several copies of the Septuagint acknowledge the same; (Calmet) so that it is of no great authority. (Berthier) 
The psalm contains the sentiments of the captives, (Theodoret) or of David, persecuted by his son: and in a more sublime sense, of Jesus Christ, complaining of treason and cruelty. (Calmet) 
All the saints, under persecution, may adopt the same language. (Berthier)

Vain is the salvation of man. But hope confoundeth not, Psalm lix. 13., and Romans v. 5. (Calmet)
