Pacem habeamus. In the common Greek copies we read echo men, habemus. But in other manuscripts echo men, as St. Chrysostom must have read by his commentary, meke Ver. 19. See St. Chrysostom, hom. x. p. 73. Ed Savil. eis uiothesian echthemen . kai egenometha adelphoi tou monogenous

The apostle proceeds in this chapter to show how great a benefit it is to be truly justified by the coming of Christ. 
Let us have peace with God. That is, says St. Chrysostom, by laying aside all contentions. Or let us have peace with God by sinning no more. And this peace we may have under the greatest tribulations, which conduce to our greater good, to an increase in virtues, in patience, in hope, in the love of God (Witham)
