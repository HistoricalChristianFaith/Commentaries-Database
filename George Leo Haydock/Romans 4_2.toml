If Abraham were justified by works, or by his own works, he might have glory, and be commended by men, who judge only according to outward appearances; but not with God: that is, he could not be truly justified, so as to deserve a reward in heaven, without faith and the grace of God. (Witham) 
Not with God. Whatever glory or applause such works might procure from men, they would be of no value in the sight of God. (Challoner)
