A prudent provision is not prohibited, but that over-solicitude which draws the soul, the heart, and its affections from God, and his sweet all-ruling providence, to sink and degrade them in empty pursuits, which can never fill the soul. (Haydock) 
Be not solicitous; i.e. too solicitous with a trouble and anxiety of mind, as appears by the Greek. 
For your life; lit. for your soul, which many times is put for life. (Witham)
