And he saw a man This verse, which is by way of a parenthesis, contains the words of the historian, St. Luke, telling us what St. Paul saw in a vision, and what the Spirit at the same time revealed to Ananias. (Witham) 
This verse is a parenthesis. It contains not the words of Christ to Ananias, but St. Luke here relates what was shown to Paul, at the time Ananias entered. This vision was shown to him, that he might know Ananias was sent by God. (Menochius)
