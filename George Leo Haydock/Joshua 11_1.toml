Jabin, "the intelligent "was perhaps the common name of the kings of Asor, the most powerful city in the northern parts of the country, (ver. 10.; Calmet) not far from the CÃ¦sarea, (Menochius) which was built by Philip, where Lais stood before. (Haydock) 
Josue burnt Asor to the ground; but it was rebuilt by the Chanaanites, and a powerful king reigned here, and subjugated the Israelites, about 130 years after the death of Josue, Judges iv. 1. (Calmet) 
Being the most interested in this warfare, Jabin assembled all the petty kings of the country as far as Dor, to resist the common enemy. (Haydock) 
He was the generalissimo, (Grotius) and went to stop the progress of Josue, who had conquered the southern parts, and was making ready to march against the north.
