Judgment. How can we hope for redress from God, while he condemns his conduct? (Menochius) 
How can we bring Job to a sense of his duty, since he entertains such perverse notions? Hebrew, "Shall he hold dominion, who hates justice? "If God be unjust, does he deserve our adoration? (Calmet) or, "ought not the person to be put in prison, who resists judgment? "(Grotius) "If thou dost not think that He who hates crimes, and destroys the impious, is eternal and just? "(Septuagint) (Haydock)
