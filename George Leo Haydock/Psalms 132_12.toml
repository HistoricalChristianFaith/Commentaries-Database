If. The promises made to the carnal posterity of David were conditional, and seem to imply, that they would forfeit them. (St. Hilary) 
But those regarding the Messias are absolute. (Calmet) 
Yet heaven is only promised to his children in the Church, if they observe God's commandments, Romans viii. 17. (Worthington) 
The kings of Juda seem not to have believed these threats; and many Christians live as if heaven required no conditions on their part. God knew what would be the event; but he speaks thus to testify their free-will, and his desire to preserve the temporal throne of David, at least till the coming of the Messias, if the Jews had proven faithful. (Berthier)
