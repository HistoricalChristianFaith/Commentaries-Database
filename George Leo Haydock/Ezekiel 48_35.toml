The Lord is there. This name is here given to the city; that is, the Church of Christ; because the Lord is always with her till the end of the world, Matthew xxviii. 20. (Challoner) 
He always adorns the Church triumphant ; (Apocalypse xxii.) but has deserted the synagogue, Matthew xxiii. 38. (Worthington) 
Jerusalem certainly never bore this name, nor is it requisite that she should, if the prophecy had been literally understood. It would suffice, if she could justly claim such a prerogative. See Isaias vii. 14., and 2 Kings xii. 25. The Church of Christ possesses God for ever. (Calmet)
