Areuna. Hebrew styles him, Araniah, (ver. 18.; Calmet) i being substituted for u, and placed after n. He is called Ornan, 1 Paralipomenon xxi. 18, (Haydock) and has the title of Jebusite, as he was originally of that nation, and had been permitted to retain his effects, on his embracing the true religion. Moria was his property, and seems not to have been much inhabited. It was not yet enclosed within the city walls. Here David saw the angel, in the air, ready to strike the inhabitants, and heard the voice from heaven. (Calmet) 
He had already witnessed the death of many in the city, 1 Paralipomenon xxi. 14. The angel waited for God's orders how many to destroy. (Haydock) 
He did not sheath his sword till David had offered sacrifice to appease the Lord; (ver. 21) though others think that the sacrifice was to thank God for the deliverance. (Calmet)
