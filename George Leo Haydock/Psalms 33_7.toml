As in. This is agreeable to St. Augustine, and some ancient psalters; though the Septuagint have "like a bottle "made of leather, osei ask on. Moderns would translate, "like a heap. "But Symmachus and St. Jerome agree with us, (see Psalm lxxvii. 13.; Calmet) as well as the Chaldean and Houbigant. God has made the bed of the sea capable of containing such quantities of water, some of which evaporate and descend again from the clouds, to make the earth fruitful. Yet many take no notice of this admirable economy. (Berthier) 
Theodoret and St. Athanasius understand the clouds to be meant by this vessel; but the former sentiment seems better. These waters, as well as hail, are instruments of God's vengeance, Deuteronomy xxxii. 34. The depths have the same import. God calls them forth at pleasure, (Amos v. 8., and Genesis vii. 11.) and confines them within bounds, Job xxxviii. 11.
