As also our most dear brother, Paul.hath written to you. He seems to mean in his epistle to the Hebrews or converted Jews, (Chap. x. 37.) where he says: yet a little while. And he that is to come, will come, and will not delay. 
In which are some things hard to understand, especially by unlearned, ignorant people, unstable, inconstant, not well grounded in faith, and which they wrest, as they do also the other scriptures, by their private interpretations, to their own perdition. (Witham)
