Juda was in possession of the southern parts of the Jordan, as Nephthali had the northern, so that by means of navigation they might enjoy the riches (Calmet) of each other, and of the other tribes. (Haydock) (Deuteronomy xxxiii. 23.) 
Septuagint do not read Juda, which forms all the difficulty, as five tribes lay between these two. They have "and the Jordan is towards the rising sun. "(Calmet) 
Grabe inserts, with a star, "to Juda, the Jordan", intimating that to Juda, was not a part of the Septuagint version.
