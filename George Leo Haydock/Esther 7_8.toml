Apparel. Greek, "of byssus "which was very superb, chap. xv. 9. The king alone could wear the tiara upright. The nobles wore it hanging backwards. Cyrus allowed his nobility to appear in purple, but he would have only his own robes striped with white. (Cyrop. viii.; Curtius iii.) 
The kings often made presents of garments, to ambassadors, and to those who were styled "their relations. "
Horse: 200 such appeared in the train of Cyrus, with golden bits, which none were permitted to use without special leave. 
Head. Greek seems to refer this to the horse, which might indeed have a sort of crown. But the golden one was more probably worn by the person honoured, chap. viii. 15.
