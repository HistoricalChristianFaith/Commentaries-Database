An anathema. That is, a thing accursed and devoted to utter destruction. (Challoner) 
Only the metal that was found, was consecrated to the Lord, (ver. 19,) and the family of Rahab saved. In devoting things, the person who laid on the curse, might extend its operation as he pleased. On some occasions, all was to be destroyed; on others, some things were preserved, Deuteronomy ii. 34., and Leviticus xxvii. 21. (Calmet) 
This first city, which the Israelites attacked, was treated with peculiar severity, to terrify the rest.
