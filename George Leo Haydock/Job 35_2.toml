God. Eliu being greatly mortified at Job's silence, uses still more provoking expressions, and pretends to refute one of the holy man's assertions, which never escaped his lips, though he had complained that God treated him as an enemy, and with more severity than his sins deserved; (chap. vi. 2.; Calmet) or, that his affliction was greater than his sin, chap. xxiii. 7. Eliu therefore calumniates him. (Worthington)
