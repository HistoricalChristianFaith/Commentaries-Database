Counting the delights of the day to be pleasure; such is their impiety and their folly, that they have no regard to all the punishments they make themselves liable to, if they can but pass their days in this short life, or even one day, in shameful pleasures and delights. They may be called the stains and blemishes, the shame and disgrace of mankind, on account of the abominations they practise in their rioting and banquetings. See what St. Epiphanius relates of Gnostics. (Witham) 
Delights; that is, the short delights of this world, in which they place all their happiness. (Challoner)
