Born. Machir was the only son of Manasses. But the Scripture uses the word first-born for such, as it does for our Saviour, Matthew i. (Menochius) 
If Machir was living when Moses assigned the territory to the half tribe of Manasses, he must have been 180 years old. (Calmet) 
But he probably received the inheritance only in his posterity. (Haydock) 
Galaad did not give his name to the country, as it was called so in the days of Jacob. Perhaps he took his name from the land, as many noblemen do, though he is styled Galaad before the war against Sehon commenced, Numbers xxvi. 29. By giving Ephraim the preference before his elder brother, Jacob did not deprive the latter of his birth-right. (Calmet) 
In effect, Manasses was partly (Haydock) provided for before Ephraim received any portion. (Calmet) 
This, however, was a privilege, and not a right. He had also two allotments, because his numbers required so much land. (Haydock)
