Be ye all of one mind. These instructions are not only for man and wife, but for every one, to whom in general these virtues are recommended. And every one's duty is comprised in these few words of Psalm xxxiii., "Turn away from evil, and do good. The eyes of the Lord are upon the just. But the countenance of the Lord is against them that do evil things" Nothing can hurt you, and you need fear no menaces, no terrors, if with zeal you follow and adhere to what is good. (Witham)
