The Paraclete, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, as proceeding also from me: and therefore Christ saith, in the next chapter, (ver. 26) that he himself will send him from the Father. He will teach you all things He will give you a more perfect knowledge of all those truths, which I have taught you. (Witham) 
Teach you all things. Here the Holy Spirit is promised to the apostles, and their successors, particularly, in order to teach them all truth, and to preserve them from error. (Challoner) 
The Scripture, in different places, remarks, that the apostles did not understand the accomplishment of prophecies, as soon as they were fulfilled. (Luke xxiv. 27.) They could not draw the comparison between the actions of our Saviour, and the figures of the old law: but no sooner had the Holy Spirit descended upon them, than they explained the Scriptures, their hearts and eyes being opened and enlightened by the light of the Holy Spirit. (Calmet) 
See chap. xvi. ver. 12. and 13.
