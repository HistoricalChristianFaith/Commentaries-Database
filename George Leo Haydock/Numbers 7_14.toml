Mortar. Hebrew caph, which the Vulgate commonly renders phiala, "a cup "(Menochius) may signify a spoon for incense, as it generally accompanies the censer, 3 Kings vii. 20. It means literally "the palm of the hand. "The high priest took his hands full of incense on the day of expiation, Leviticus xvi. 12.
