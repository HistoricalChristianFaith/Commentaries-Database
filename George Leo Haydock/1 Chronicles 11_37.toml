Hesro ends with u in the Hebrew. Yet some read more properly with i, "Hetzrai "as all the ancient versions have it, except the Vulgate, (Kennicott) some copies of which read Asra. (Blanchini, Vind. 1740.) 
Carmelite. Septuagint Karmedi. The D might easily be mistaken for L, as the Greek bibles (Kennicott) for some ages after Origen were written in capital letters, without accents. (Montfaucon, Pref. to Hexap. p. 44.) 
Azbai seems preferable to Arbi, as the proper name seems also more correct than Pharai, 2 Kings. (Haydock) 
The Vatican Septuagint confounds both words in one "Ouraiverchi. "We may apply to many of the proper names that severe censure which St. Jerome has passed upon the transcribers of the book of Chronicles. Ita in GræcisLatinis cod: hic nominum liber vitiosus est, ut non tam Hebræa quam Barbara quædamSarmatica nomina conjecta arbitrandum eit (ep. ad Domn.) If this epistle be not genuine, the same doctor complains at least of the incorrect state of the Septuagint. (Pref. in Paral.)
