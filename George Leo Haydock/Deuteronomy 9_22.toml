Burning The places called in Hebrew, "Tab era, Masa, and Ki broth Hatta Avah. "(Haydock) 
At the first, the murmurers were burnt; (Numbers xi. 1) at the second, or at Raphidim, (Calmet) the people demanded water, and were supplied from Horeb; (Exodus xvii. 2, 7.; Menochius) though some confound this with the former place. It seems rather to refer to the temptation, or murmur of the people, on account of quails, Numbers xi. 34., and Psalm lxxvii. 18. (Calmet)
