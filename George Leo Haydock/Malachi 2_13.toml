With tears; viz., by occasion of your wives, whom you have put away, and who came to weep and lament before the altar. (Challoner) 
Though divorces were tolerated, (Matthew xix. 6.) the more virtuous did not approve of them, particularly when a wife was put away who had been married in youth. See ver. 10. Perhaps this corruption had crept in, like others, (Calmet) owing to the people's commerce with strangers. (Diod. in Photius.)
