In power. The sense is, I have preached the gospel to you, not only in words of persuasion, but have proved it by the power of miracles, in much fulness, or in great abundance. I have also taught you the gospel not by my words only, but by my actions; for you know what kind of a life I led among you. I had no interest but in gaining your souls. And I rejoice to hear you have received it in much power, by the Holy Spirit working within you. (Haydock) 
And in much fulness. Some would have the Greek word to signify in a full assurance; but in the style of the New Testament, it may as well signify a fulness, or plenitude. (Witham)
