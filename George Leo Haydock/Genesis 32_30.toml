Phanuel. This word signifies the face of God, or the sight, or seeing of God. (Challoner) 
Hebrew reads here Peni-el, though it has Phanuel in the next verse. Jacob thus returns thanks to God for the preservation of his life, after having seen God or his angel in a corporeal form, and not in a dream only. (Calmet)
