Will. God sincerely wishes that the sinner should be converted. If he refuse grace, it is only in punishment of former transgressions. (St. Augustine, ep. 217.) 
He wills antecedently their salvation, (1 Timothy ii. 4.) though he has a consequent will to punish them, as they speak in the schools, because they themselves will not be saved. (Sanctius) (Calmet) 
God's absolute will is always fulfilled, not that which is conditional. (St. John Damascene, Fide ii. 29.; St. Thomas Aquinas, Summa Theologiae p. 1. q. 19. a. 6.) 
He does enough by offering his graces and the death of Christ, to show that his will is sincere; though by a consequent will his justice punishes the impenitent. Thus a virtuous judge would have all to observe the laws and live: but finding some transgress, so as to become pernicious, he punishes them with death. (Worthington)
