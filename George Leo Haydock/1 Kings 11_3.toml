Concubines, or secondary wives. (Haydock) 
Those who have any sense of modesty, can hardly read this without blushing. (Salien) 
Solomon was guilty not only of intemperance, but also of a transgression of the precept. (Menochius) (Deuteronomy xvii. 17.) 
He shall not have many wives: though as that command is indefinite, and David had eighteen, without blame, (2 Kings iii. 3.) it is difficult to say how many a person might have, at that time, without exceeding the bounds of moderation. (Haydock) 
But a thousand wives for one man, is certainly too great a number. When Solomon wrote the Canticles, he had only sixty queens and eighty concubines, Canticle of Canticles vi. 8. The Rabbins allow the king eighteen wives. But it is probable that most of the kings indulged themselves in a greater latitude. Darius, of Persia, took along with him to the wars 350 concubines, when he was overcome by Alexander. (Atheneus xiii. 1.) Priam had also many wives, besides Hecuba, the queen. The inferior wives looked upon those who had this title with a degree of respect, bordering on adoration. (Calmet)
