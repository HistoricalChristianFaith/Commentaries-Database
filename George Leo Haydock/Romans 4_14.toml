For if they, who are of the law, be heirs: faith is made void, the promise is made of no effect. That is, if the Jews, who are under the law, are the only heirs of the blessings promised, it will follow that the faith which Abraham had before the circumcision, and before the law, was of no value, which I have shown to be false. And, secondly, it will follow that the promise made to him, that in him all nations should be blessed, is also null. (Witham)
