In her regard: words supplied also by the Septuagint conformably to the context. (Calmet) 
The indecency and impudence of the woman, left her no excuse; (Haydock) though the Rabbins falsely maintain, that she might transgress this law in case of necessity, and might cut off the hand of her husband's antagonist. (Grotius) (Calmet) 
She would thus put the man in danger of having no posterity. (Menochius) 
If even the imminent danger of her husband would not authorize her to act in this manner, when the person was stripped to fight, how severely will God punish all wanton liberties!
