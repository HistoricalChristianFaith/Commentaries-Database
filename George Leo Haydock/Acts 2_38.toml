Be baptized: believing and making profession to believe, and hope for salvation, by the merits of Jesus Christ. Thus you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit, the grace of God, and perhaps those other gifts of speaking with tongues, working miracles (Witham) 
The gift of the Holy Spirit. That is, justifying grace, which is infused in our hearts by the laver of regeneration. The exterior gifts of the Holy Spirit, the gift of tongues, of miracles, prophecy were, in the beginning of the Church, more regularly the consequences of confirmation or imposition of hands. (Calmet)
