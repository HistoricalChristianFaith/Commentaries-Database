Just. A true friend will make any sacrifice. (Calmet) 
"I am convinced that friendship can subsist only among the good "says Cicero. Hebrew, "the just hath more, (Calmet; Protestants) or is more excellent than his neighbour. "Septuagint, "the intelligent just is his own friend; (but the sentences of the impious are contrary to equity. Evils shall pursue sinners) but the way "(Grabe) (Haydock)
