Him. The great personage whom I have in view, whose coming is deferred yet for many ages. (Haydock) 
The whole prediction refers to the Messias, whom Balaam beheld by the eyes of his posterity, the wise men, (Calmet) or in the prophetic vision. (Menochius) 
Some modern Rabbins pretend that he speaks of David, who was indeed a figure of Christ, (Calmet) and defeated the Moabites, 2 Kings v. 8. But the prophecy was perfectly fulfilled only in our Saviour's person, who is called the bright and morning star, (Apocalypse xxii. 16,) to whom all nations were given for an inheritance, Psalm ii., and Acts i. 8. (Worthington) 
Hebrew also, "I see this thy ruin, but "Septuagint, "I will show to him, yet not now; I will make him happy, (Calmet); but (makarizo, I bless) it, or he does not approach. "God executed what he ever promised in favour of all Israel, when he sent them his beloved Son. 
A Star. Christ, the light of the world, the splendour of his Father's glory, whose birth was made known in the East, by a star, or meteor of unusual brightness. (Haydock) 
This material star is not the primary object of the prediction, since it did not rise out of Jacob, but it pointed out the orient from on high, and then disappeared. The ancient Jews understood this passage of the Messias. (Onkelos) Hence the impostor, Ben. Cusiba, took advantage of this general opinion, to draw the people after him, as the person designated; when he assumed the title of Bar-chocheba, "the son of the star "in the second age of the church. 
Of Seth. Though David, as the figure of the Messias, conquered the Moabites, he cannot be said to have subdued all nations, the descendants of Seth, by Noe, nor all the just of whom Seth was the father, in opposition to the children of Cain. But Christ will subject all the just to his empire, and will judge all mankind. Some, nevertheless, take the children of Seth to be the Moabites, who had been already mentioned; and Junius translates the Hebrew with allusion to the shameful origin of that people. The Samaritan may also signify, if we substitute d for r in korkor, as Jeremias also reads (chap. xlviii. 45,) kodkod. "He shall penetrate the ends of Moab, and shall overturn the walls of the children of elevation, or of pride. "There were many hills in the country of the Moabites, and the people were noted for haughtiness, Jeremias xlviii. 28, 29, 45. (Calmet) 
Some also assert, that Seth was the name of a king, (Grotius) and of a town of Moab. (Rabbi Nathan) 
But of this there is no proof. (Haydock)
