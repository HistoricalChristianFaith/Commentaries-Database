In the Greek of the seventy-two interpreters, for infirmities we have amartias, sins; but the evangelist refers this to our bodily infirmities, because, as St. Chrysostom observes, diseases are the punishment of sins, and frequently arrive from the diseases of the soul. (Menochius) 
The text of Isaias here quoted, regards the Messias literally. (Bible de Vence) 
He took our infirmities. The words signify both the distempers of the body and the infirmities of the soul, for Christ cured both. (Witham)
