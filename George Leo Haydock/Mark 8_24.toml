Men as trees walking. In the Latin text, walking may agree either with men, or with trees, but the Greek shows that walking must be referred to men. Perhaps Christ restored sight in this manner to the man by degrees, to make him more sensible of the benefit; or to teach us how difficult is a sinner's conversion; of which this was a figure. (Witham)
