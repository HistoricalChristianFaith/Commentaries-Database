Return here; or hither. The weak among the servants of God will be apt often to return to this thought, and will be shocked when they consider the full days, that is, the long and prosperous life of the wicked; and will be tempted to make the reflections against Providence which are set down in the following verses. (Challoner) 
Protestants, "his people return hither, and waters of a full cup are wrung out for them. "St. Jerome saw nothing of waters. "And who among them shall be found full? "He also reads my people (Haydock) better. It is difficult to understand the present Hebrew: whereas the Septuagint is plain; as they found imi, days, instead of ume, "and who "or "and waters. "(Berthier) 
We may explain this of the sentiments which the captives should entertain (Calmet) at their return. (Theodoret) 
Asaph, seeing the impiety of the Babylonians, concluded that they would surely be punished, and Israel, being converted, would be put again in possession of their delightful country. (Calmet) 
The prosperity of the former will cause some to fall away, and their days will be full of misery, (Worthington) or they will ponder whole days on these things. (Berthier)
