Ruth was the wife of MA halon; (chap. iv. 10,) and signifies one "well watered, (Menochius) or inebriated "(Haydock) 
The sons of Noemi were excused by necessity in marrying idolaters, though they ought to have done their best to convert them. The Chaldean greatly condemns their marriage, and thinks that their death was in punishment of their prevarication, Deuteronomy vii. 3. and xx. 11. (Calmet) 
Salien is of the same opinion. So various have always been the sentiments of people on this head! (Haydock) See Serarius, q. 11.
