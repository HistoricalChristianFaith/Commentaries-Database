Brethren. Thus people are degraded in the Christian Church, that they may suffer some confusion (Calmet) in this world, and repent. (Haydock) 
The priests, who had offered sacrifice unlawfully, where only permitted to perform the minor offices; but provision was made for their support, that they might not be tempted to relapse, Leviticus xxi. 17, 22., and Ezechiel xliv. 10. (Calmet) 
They were reduced to the rank of Levites. (Menochius)
