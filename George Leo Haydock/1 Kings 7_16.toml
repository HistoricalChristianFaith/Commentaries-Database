Five. Comprising all the ornaments. The body was only three cubits, 4 Kings xxv. 17. If we include the circles, which join it to the pillar, it would be four; ver. 19, and with the rose, and ornaments at the top, five cubits high. Atheneus distinguishes three parts in the Egyptian chapiters; (1) next to the pillar, was seen a circle or wreath of flowers; (2) the stalk, out of which proceeded (3) a rose beginning to open. (Calmet) 
In the passages, which seem to contradict this text, the omission of the cornice or architrave, may cause the difference. (Menochius)
