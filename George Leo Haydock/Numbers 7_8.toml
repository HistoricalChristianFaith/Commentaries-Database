Four. The sons of Merari were not very numerous, (chap. iv. 44,) and they had the heaviest parts of the tabernacle to carry. The metal alone would weigh 274,875 Roman pounds, of 12 ounces each; not to mention the pillars If 100 waggons carried each 3000 pounds, and every man 50, they would not carry one half; so that the people must have furnished them with many more waggons besides these four of the princes. (Jansenius) (Calmet) 
Abulensis thinks the Merarites carried all that was not laid on the four waggons. (Menochius)
