Dodo. In Latin, Patrui ejus, which is the interpretation of the Hebrew name Dodo. The same occurs in ver. 24, (Challoner) and signifies, "of his paternal uncle. "(Haydock) 
Septuagint read Dudia, (Calmet) "of his father's brother. "He, or his father, is styled Dudai, 1 Paralipomenon xxvii. 4. (Calmet) 
Septuagint (Alexandrian) translates both Dodo and Dodi, "the son of his father's brother "the son of Sousei, or (Vatican) Doudei. Dodi seems to be the more accurate here, as he is thus more distinguished from Dodo, ver. 24., and Chronicles v. 26. 
Defied. Hebrew is incorrect, and ought to be a proper name as is evident from the word there. Josephus calls it, arasamo, (perhaps originally, aphasdamo) Chronicles, Pasdammim, or Ephesdammim, 1 Kings xvii. 1. It is hardly probable that the Hebrews should defy or upbraid the Philistines, and immediately run away. We should therefore translate with 1 Paralipomenon men. "He was with David at Pasdammim. And when the Philistines were there gathered together to battle, and the men of Israel were gone away, he arose "(Kennicott)
