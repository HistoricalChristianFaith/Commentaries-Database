Three calves. Septuagint, "a calf three years old "such as Abraham sacrificed, Genesis xv. 9. We only find one offered up, ver. 25. 
Bushels. Hebrew epha, (Calmet) each of which contained three bushels or measures, Ruth ii. 17. (Haydock) 
Bottle. Hebrew nebel, a large measure containing above 87 pints. (Calmet)
