For Asaph. The preposition L is placed before his name, as it is before David's. (Haydock) 
Yet whether he was the author of the psalm, (Calmet) or only set it to music, (Worthington) is uncertain. (Menochius) 
The 72nd, and ten following psalms, bear his name, and it is observed, that the style is not so flowing as those which are attributed to the royal prophet . (Moller.) 
It is certain, that Asaph was a prophet, and chief musician in the days of David, 1 Paralipomenon vi. 39., xxv. 2., and 2 Paralipomenon xxix. 30. (Berthier) 
But the psalms that have this title relate to the captives, and may have been composed by some of his descendants. This and the following seem designed to shew, that something more than bloody victims is required by God; and thus the Israelites, who could not offer sacrifices at Babylon, were comforted; and the people taught by degrees, to look for something more excellent than the law of Moses. (Calmet) 
The first and second coming of Christ are here described. (Du Hamel) 
God's angels, just men, judges, (Calmet) idols (Worthington) 
Hebrew El Elohim, Yehova, "the mighty God, the Lord. "(Haydock) 
From these three titles, some of the Fathers have proved the blessed Trinity. (Estius) 
But this argument is not conclusive. (Berthier) 
They ought, however, to fill us with awe, when he shall come to judge the earth, his chosen people, (ver. 4.; Calmet) or all mankind. (Berthier) (Menochius) 
Christ will come, surrounded by many legions of angels. (Haydock)
