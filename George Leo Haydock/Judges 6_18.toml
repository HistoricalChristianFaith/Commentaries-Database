A sacrifice, or some provisions to present unto thee. Hebrew mincha, is taken for a present, particularly of flour and wine. It is used to denote those presents which were made by Jacob to Esau, and Joseph, and by Aod to the king of Moab, chap. iii. 15., and Genesis xliii. 14. (Calmet) 
To sacrifice, often means to kill things for a feast, Matthew xxii. 4. What Gedeon brought, was afterwards turned into a sacrifice by the angel, ver. 21. (Menochius) 
Gedeon was not a priest, nor was there any altar prepared for a sacrifice. If Gedeon had intended to offer one, he would not have boiled nor baked the food, which he presented before his guest. (Calmet)
