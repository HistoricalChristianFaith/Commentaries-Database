Sort. Septuagint and Syriac, "double "yet of less value. (Calmet) 
As no first sort had been mentioned, and some Latin manuscripts read 2410, agreeably to 3 Esdras ii. 12., and the truth, (Hallet) it may be inferred that "thousands were expressed anciently by single letters, with a dot. Over them. "Afterwards, when numbers were expressed by words at length, the b being thus reduced to signify "two "was, of course, written shnim; but this word making nonsense with the following, has been changed into mishnim, a word not very agreeable to the sense here, and which leaves the sum total, now specified in the Hebrew text, very deficient for want of the 2000, thus omitted. (Kennicott, Dis. ii.) 
Josephus has, "30 golden cups, 2400 of silver. "(Haydock)
