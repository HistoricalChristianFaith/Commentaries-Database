Prophecy. It is supposed that these daughters of St. Philip had made a vow of virginity, or at least remained in that state out of a motive of religion. St. Jerome thinks in reward of this they were gifted with a prophetic spirit. (Lib. i. chap. 24. cont. Jov.) 
Others think that by prophesying is meant interpreting the Scriptures, or singing the praises of God. (Estius)
