In Isaias, the prophet. That in the ancient copies was read Isaias, and not Malachi as, is confirmed by the Syriac version, and also by St. Iren us, Origen, St. Jerome It is also proved from an objection of Porphyrius, who says, St. Mark mistook Isaias for Malachi as. In the ordinary Greek copies at present, we read in the prophets, not naming either Isaias or Malachi as. The words seem taken partly out of one, and partly out of the other. These words, behold I send my angel before thy face, who shall prepare thy way before thee, are found Malachi as iii.
