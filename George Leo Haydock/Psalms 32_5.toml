Sin. Or as some psalters read, "of my heart "with the Septuagint, Cassiod. (Calmet) 
"I know that thou wilt readily forgive the sins which are fully laid open before thee. "(St. Jerome) 
David no sooner perceived that he was the unjust man (Haydock) whom Nathan had described, than he exclaimed, "I have sinned "and at the same moment God forgave him, 2 Kings xii. 7. (Calmet) 
If this psalm relate to his repentance, it seems he had already had recourse to God; but this is doubtful, as he appears to have entered into himself only after the prophet's reproach. Nothing can more effectually give peace to the soul than an humble confession, which costs human pride a great deal, when it must be made to our brethren. (Berthier) 
The Jews were sometimes obliged to confess to God's minister, Leviticus iv. 5., and Numbers v. 7. (Menochius)
