Ancient. The Son is born of the Father, and the Holy Spirit proceeds from both, yet all three are coeternal. (Worthington) 
Hence the Father is sometimes painted in this manner, though he be a pure spirit. His throne resembled that seen by Ezechiel, chap. i. (Haydock) 
He takes cognizance of all, and punishes accordingly. (Calmet)
