Behold the handmaid. With all modesty and humility of heart and mind, the blessed Virgin consented to the divine will: and from that moment in her was conceived the Saviour and Redeemer of the world. (Witham) 
Thus ought the virgin, who brought forth meekness and humility itself, to show forth an example of the most profound humility. (St. Ambrose)
