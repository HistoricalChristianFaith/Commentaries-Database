Revenger. St. Peter (Acts iii. 23,) reads, And it shall be that every soul which will not hear that prophet; (instead of Hebrew, "my words which he shall speak in my name, I will require it of him") or he shall be destroyed from among the people. (Tertullian, contra Mar. iv. 22.) (Haydock) 
God now chastises the faithless Jews. (Du Hamel)
