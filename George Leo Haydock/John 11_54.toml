Ephrem was a small city or town in the neighbourhood of Bethel. Some suppose it to be the same as Ephron, mentioned in 2 Paralipomenon xiii. 19., and 1 Machabees v., 2 Machabees xii. 17. Eusebius and St. Jerome say it was situated about 20 miles to the north of Jerusalem. (Calmet) 
Here he remained with his disciples till the time in which he had resolved to deliver himself up into the hands of his enemies. (Bible de Vence)
