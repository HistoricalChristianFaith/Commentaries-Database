Lord. This must be understood of Absalom, who offered sacrifices, (2 Kings xv. 12.; Berthier) or of Saul, who, receiving no answer, consulted a witch. The Philistines also brought their gods with them, so that they were taken and burnt; (2 Kings v. 21.) and the other pagans, finding no aid in their idols, might in time of danger, invoke the Lord. (Calmet) 
This is "the testimony of a soul naturally Christian "as Tertullian (Apol. xvii.) speaks, to have recourse to the great and only God, in the utmost distress. (Haydock) 
Deus ut subveniat oratur; ipsa veritas, cogente natura.erumpit. (Lac. Inst. ii. 1.)
