Put in the bars. Hebrew, "place the bars "upon the shoulders of the Levites; for they were never taken out of the sides of the ark, Exodus xxv. 15. Other bars, like hand-barrows, were used to carry the ark and the other different vessels, after they were folded up. Two Levites bore them on their shoulders. (Calmet) 
Perhaps the bars of the ark, after it was enveloped with the three curtains, might project, so that the bearers might take hold of them. (Menochius)
