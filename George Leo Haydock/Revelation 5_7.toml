He. Took the book. And when he had opened it, or was about to open it, (in the Greek is only, he took it: which was a sign that he would open it).the four and twenty ancients fell down before the Lamb, to adore him, as appears by what follows, ver. 13. 
Having every one of them harps to celebrate his praise, and golden vials full of odours, which are the prayers of the saints: which shows that the saints in heaven offer up before the throne of the Divine Majesty the prayers of the faithful. (Witham) 
Harps These harps are symbols of the praise which good men render to God; and the vials full of odours represent the prayers of the saints. In conformity with this idea, St. John wishes to represent these four and twenty ancients as so many senators, who present to the Almighty the prayers and homages of good men on earth. (Estius; Clement of Alexandria) 
This also is an imitation of what was practised in the temple, in which were always around the altar, in times of sacrifice, Levites with musical instruments, priests with vials to contain the wine and blood, and censers to hold the incense (Calmet) 
The prayers of the saints. Here we see that the saints in heaven offer up to Christ the prayers of the faithful upon earth. (Challoner)
