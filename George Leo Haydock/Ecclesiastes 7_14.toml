Despised. God never neglects first. (Council of Trent, Session vi. 11.) 
He detests sin, and at last abandons the obstinate, though he never fails to offer sufficient graces. A person who is of an unhealthy constitution, or involved in sin, cannot be cured by man alone. Yet we must not cease to preach, while we expect all from God, who gives the increase, 1 Corinthians iii. 7.
