Nabo. Probably the same as Nebo and Nobe. 
Baalmeon. This city had a variety of names, ver. 3, 35. Those who rebuilt these cities gave them their own names, ver. 42. (Hebrew Targum of Jerus.) Yet they were often known by their former appellations. (Calmet) 
The rebuilders chiefly objected to the names of idols, Baal, which were joined with these cities. (Menochius)
