A man that is Many ancient copies have this passage thus, Avoid a heretic after one reprehension. St. Iren us, Tertullian, St. Cyprian, St. Ambrose and many ancient Greek copies, omit a second reprehension. They thought once warning a heretic sufficient; a second correction only served to render him more insolent, and more obstinate in his false opinions.
