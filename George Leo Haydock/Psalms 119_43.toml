Mouth. Let those who preach the truth, live up to it. (St. Hilary and St. Ambrose) 
Though the psalmist may be under some fear, he prays that he may not omit to make open profession of his faith. (Worthington) 
God never hinders his servants from doing this, though he sometimes suffers them to fall. But the Church will never cease to proclaim the truth. She will not give up one article of faith, though all heretics would thus embrace every other part of her doctrine. She will never open her bosom to those who would alter one point, nor say that such can enter heaven. (Berthier)
