These words are most faithful. Here begins the conclusion and close of all these revelations. 
The Lord God of the spirits of the prophets sent his Angel to show and in the 16th verse it is said: I, Jesus, have sent my Angel to testify: from whence we may understand that Jesus, as to his person, is the same Lord God with the Father, though as man he is the root of the offspring of David, of the race of David, as the Messias was to be. (Witham)
