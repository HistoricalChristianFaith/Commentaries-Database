Libanus. So it was called, on account of the many cedar pillars brought from that mountain; or because many trees and shrubs were planted in the vicinity. (Calmet) 
Libanus might also be seen from it, and refreshing breezes be felt. (Ar.) 
The palace stood on the eastern part of Sion, and to the west of the temple. (Menochius) 
The vale between them had been filled up, at a vast expense, and a sort of bridge erected, which was called Mello. Thus the palace of David, on the west of Sion, and this of Solomon, served to protect the temple, and to keep the citizens in awe. (Salien) 
Sanchez declines giving the dimensions of this palace, as they are not satisfactory. (Menochius) 
Here Solomon resided, and was served in gold, (Calmet) adorning his palace with shields and targets of the same precious metal, chap. x. 16, 21. 
Cubits. The more sacred part of the temple was only 60, 20, and 30 cubits, chap. vi. 2. But there were various other appendages and towers. This palace must have been very extensive. 
And four. Hebrew, "upon four rows of cedar pillars, with cedar beams upon the pillars. "(Haydock) -- One row of these might be rather pilasters, against the wall; (ver. 3,) so that there would be three covered galleries, before the apartments, each supported on 15 pillars. (Calmet)
