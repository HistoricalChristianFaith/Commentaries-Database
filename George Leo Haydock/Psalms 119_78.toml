Ashamed. Literally, "confounded "not accomplishing their wicked designs. (Calmet) 
Thus may they be induced to entertain that shame for sin which bringeth life, (Haydock) and cease to offend. (Theodoret) 
Let them be converted: though it be also (Haydock) lawful to desire that obstinate sinners may undergo just punishment. (Worthington) 
The saints pray thus out of zeal for their good. It may also be a prediction, as the Hebrew word (Berthier) yebshu is in the future. (Haydock) 
Done. Hebrew, "falsely perverted "(Montanus) in desire; (Calmet) or "having wished to pervert me without cause. "(Pagnin)
