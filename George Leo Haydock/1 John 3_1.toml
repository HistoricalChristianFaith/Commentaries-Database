Behold what manner of charity (or of love) the Father has bestowed upon us. St. John had said in the last verse of the foregoing chapter that every one who does justice, is born of him; i.e. is the son of God by adoption. But the world knows us not, nor esteems and values us as such: and no wonder, because they have not known, nor acknowledged, nor reverenced God as they ought. We indeed are the sons of God; we believe it, because God has assured us of it; but it has not yet appeared what we shall be, (ver. 2) to what glory or happiness we shall thereby be exalted hereafter, for neither the eye has seen, nor the ear heard, nor has it entered into the heart of man, what things God has prepared for those who love him. (1 Corinthians ix. 2.) We only know this, that his elect shall be like to him, because they shall see him as he is, when they shall enjoy him in heaven.
