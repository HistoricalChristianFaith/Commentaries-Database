Merciful; literally, "appeased. "Hebrew and Septuagint, "healed. "St. Jerome (Trad.) says, "It was asserted that no unclean person could taste the Phase, but death presently ensued; and they understood that the Lord was appeased, because those who eat did not die. "(Haydock) 
Hebrew girpa may, however, denote that God "pardoned "or did not impute the uncleanness to the people. (Schindler, and chap. xxxvi. 16., and Isaias vi. 10.)
