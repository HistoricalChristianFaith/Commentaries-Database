Angels. Many seem to be assigned to the just, to whom St. Hilary, would restrain this privilege. But it is more generally believed, that each person has an angel guardian. This was the opinion even of the pagans. (Porphyrius, Ap. ii.; St. Clement of Alexandria, Strom. v.) (Calmet) 
To keep. Instead of this, the tempter substituted and, (Matthew iv. 6.) finding it would not answer his purpose, (Haydock) and showed that the question was about walking, and not about precipitating oneself. (St. Bernard, ser. xv. p. 90.) 
To attempt such unusual courses, is the way of Lucifer, (Worthington) and tempting God, as our Saviour replied. (Berthier) 
From the father of lies, heretics have learnt how to curtail and misapply the holy Scriptures. (Haydock) 
God has highly favoured man, by intrusting him to the care of these sublime ministers of his court, (St. Bernard) and surely it is lawful for us to implore their assistance, as we may apply to our fellow-creatures for redress in our temporal necessities. To refuse to do so, on the plea that we expect all immediately from God, would be going contrary to his appointment. Else why has God given them for our guardians, since He could have done all without them? In vain is it objected, that this invocation is a religious worship. It may be so styled, because they are blessed, and help us to obtain salvation. But we only honour in them the gifts of God. (Berthier) 
They protect us by his ordinance, (Worthington) and the very form of praying, shows in what light we regard them. Who durst say to God, pray for us? (Menochius)
