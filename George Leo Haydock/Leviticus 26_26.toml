Bread; or that which supports you. You shall be deprived of the necessaries of life. 
One oven shall be used by 10 families, so little bread shall be baked, and even that little shall be delivered out by weight. I will also deprive it of its nutritive qualities, so that it shall not satisfy your craving appetite. (Calmet) See Psalm civ. 16 and Isaias iii. 1.
