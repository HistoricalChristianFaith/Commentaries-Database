At. The Septuagint omit the 20 verses following. But Grabe's edition has them marked with asterisks, (Haydock) as being supplied from Theodotion The Vatican copy gives a great part, with some circumstances which occur no where else, chap. xii. 24. (Calmet) 
The wife of Jeroboam is there called Ano, (Menochius) the elder sister of the queen of Egypt, Thekemina. See chap. xi. 19; where Adad marries another sister. (Haydock) 
Time. This expression does not determine the year. (St. Chrysostom) 
The passage in the Vatican Septuagint seems to place this death before Jeroboam ascended the throne: but it took place rather at the end of his reign, ver. 14. Abia seems to have been his eldest son, and fit for command; so that the people mourn for him, which they would hardly have done for an infant. (Calmet)
