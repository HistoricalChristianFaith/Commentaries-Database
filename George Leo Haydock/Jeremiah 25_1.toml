The neighbouring nations were also involved in this calamity, and were to be sent back by Cyrus. (Calmet) 
Another period of 70 years is specified, (chap. xxix. 10.) during which the city and temple should remain in ruins, till the second of Hystaspes, the year of the world 3485. (Usher) 
This system is not without difficulties. The present prediction seems rather to refer to the desolation, (Vatable; Aggeus i. 2.) as appears from Zacharias i. 12., or the prophet speaks of the same event in both places, dating from the year preceding the capture of Jerusalem, (the year 3415), till Darius gave entire liberty to the Jews, the year 3485. We differ from Usher in the years allotted to Cyrus, who began to restore the Jews, 1 Esdras i. 5. (Calmet) 
These 70 years are dated from the 11th of Sedecias. (Worthington)

Babylon, when he was associated by Nabopolassar, three years before his death, the year of the world 3397. This year Joakim was taken to be conducted to Babylon, though he was afterwards permitted to remain on very hard conditions, while the sacred vessels, Daniel, were taken away, and the 70 years of captivity commenced. They ended in the first of Cyrus, the year 3468. (Usher) 
This chapter should be placed before the 24th and after the 26th. (Calmet) 
The prophets did not observe the order of time, chap. xxi. (Worthington)
