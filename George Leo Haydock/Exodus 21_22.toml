But Philo and the Septuagint have, "of a child unformed "and ver. 23, "But if the child be formed, (exeikonismenon, animated and organized) he shall give soul for soul "as if all were referred to the child, which the Vulgate explains of the mother. To destroy the life of either was punished with death. "She who first taught the art of expelling the tender foetus, deserved to perish by her own malice. "(Ovid) (Calmet)

Homicidii festinatio est prohibere nasci. (Tertullian, apol.) Onkelos says, that "if the mother should not die of the stroke, the offender was to satisfy the husband by paying a fine, to be awarded by the husband, or by the judges: but in case the mother died, he should render life for life: "(Calmet) in which decision he agrees with the Vulgate. (Haydock)
