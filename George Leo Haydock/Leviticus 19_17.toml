Openly, is not in the Hebrew or other versions. Instead of bearing malice at the heart, we are authorized to demand our right in a legal manner, or to correct in a fraternal matter, the person who may have injured us, lest we incur sin for our neglect, and the offender continue impenitent. Jesus Christ instructs us to do this with as little disturbance as possible, Matthew xviii. 15. Yet public sins must undergo a public correction, 1 Timothy v. 20. (St. Augustine, ser. 82.) Love should regulate our complaints. (St. Augustine, q. 70.)
