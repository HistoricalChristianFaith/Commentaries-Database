Eagle. It makes a noise like a trumpet. (Pliny, x. 3.) 
Osee denounces judgments on the house of Israel, which, though schismatical, was not entirely abandoned by the Lord. Salmanasar overturned the kingdom, and may be compared to an eagle, as Nabuchodonosor is frequently, Ezechiel xvii. 3. But he is not here meant. (Calmet) 
The temple shall be destroyed by him; (St. Jerome) yet not so soon. (Worthington) 
Septuagint, "In their bosom like earth appears, like an eagle "(Haydock)
