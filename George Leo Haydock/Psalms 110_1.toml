David. It is of faith that he wrote this psalm on the Messias. The Jews, in our Saviour's time, were convinced of it, (Matthew xxii. 42.) so that their posterity (Berthier) in vain attempts to explain it of Abraham, David, Solomon, Ezechias, or Zorobabel. (St. Chrysostom) 
Even some of them candidly own that it can relate to no other, (Thalmud) and Christians are universally of this belief. (Calmet) 
The Lord. Hebrew Jehova, (Haydock) the Father. (Menochius) 
To my Lord. Hebrew Ladoni, (Haydock) the Son incarnate, (Menochius) Lord of all, though the son of David. (Worthington) 
Who else could be David's superior? as Christ argues. (Haydock) 
The title Adonoi is given to God, (ver. 5.; Calmet) as my is never united with the ineffable name. 
Hand. In equal power (Berthier) as God, and in the highest dignity as man, after the ascension. (Calmet) 
This thought should encourage us to suffer patiently, (Colossians iii. 1.) as Christ was to suffer, and thus to enter into his glory. The saints did not strive to divide him. But we would suffer nothing, and yet be glorified at the hour of our death! (Berthier) 
Until. This word does not always mark the term of a thing. When all shall be subdued, then Christ will continue to sit with greater majesty, (1 Corinthians xv. 25.; Calmet) for ever. (Worthington) (Hebrews x. 13.) 
Footstool. As was customary with conquerors, Josue x. 24.
