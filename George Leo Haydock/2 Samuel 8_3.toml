Adarezer. He is styled Adadezer in Hebrew and this seems to have been his true name, though it is written Adarezer in Paralipomenon. Adad, or "the sun "was the chief idol of Syria, and the kings inserted the name with their own; as Benadad did. Josephus produces a fragment from Nicolaus of Damascus, in which he says that "Adad was king of Damascus, and of all Syria, except Phoenicia, and was defeated by David. His successors took his name, as the kings of Egypt did that of Ptolemy; and that the third in descent from this king, made an attack upon Samaria "and upon Achab. (Antiquities vii. 6.) 
Euphrates, which had been promised by God, Genesis xv. 18., and Numbers xxiv. 17. (Calmet) 
Adadezer was probably the aggressor. (Salien) (Menochius)
