Thou hast deceived The meaning of the prophet is not to charge God with any untruth; but what he calls deceiving, was only the concealing from him, when he accepted of the prophetical commission, the greatness of the evils which the execution of that commission was to bring upon him. (Challoner) 
Hebrew, "thou hast enticed me "when I declined the office. (Tirinus)

Hebrew, "If thou, Lord, hast deceived me, I am "(Tournemine)
