The hill of God. Gabaa, in which there was also at that time, a high place or altar. (Challoner) 
The prophets were not molested by the infidels, in performing their devotions, as people consecrated to the Lord, who do not meddle with war, are privileged by the consent of nations. (Grotius, Jur. iii. 11, 10) (Calmet) 
Prophets. These were men whose office it was to sing hymns and praises to God; for such in holy writ are called prophets, and their singing praises to God is called prophesying. See 1 Paralipomenon, alias 1 Chronicles xv. 22., and xxv. 1. Now there were in those days colleges, or schools for training up these prophets; and it seems there was one of these schools at this hill of God; and another at Naioth in Ramatha. See 1 Samuel xix 20, 21 (Challoner) 
The Jews say there were in every city of Judea congregations of this nature. They lived like monks, abstaining, for the most part, from marriage, though some had children, 4 Kings iv. 1. They had a superior at their head, to whom God frequently revealed future things. The rest were instructed how to explain the prophecies, to compose and sing canticles. Some of them were inspired, like Saul, only for a time. It is supposed that Samuel instituted these colleges, and this is the first time we find them mentioned. (Calmet) 
They were of infinite service in preserving the true religion. (Haydock)
