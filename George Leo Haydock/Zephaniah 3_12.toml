Poor in spirit. (Haydock) 
Hebrew, "meek and extenuated "who trust not in themselves. This is the character of true Christians. The few Jews who remained in the country, or who returned from Babylon, might well represent them, being poor and dependent. The disciples of Christ contemned riches, and were resolute only where virtue was at stake. (Calmet) 
They were instructed by poor fishermen taught by God. (Menochius)
