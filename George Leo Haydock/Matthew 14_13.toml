Which, when Jesus had heard. Our Saviour did not retire till he was informed of the death of the Baptist, by message; and this he did, not because he was ignorant of it before, but that he might show to the world, not only by his appearance, but also by his manner of acting, the reality of the mystery of his incarnation. (St. Chrysostom, hom. 1.) 
He did not retire through fear, as some may think. Hence the evangelist does not say, he fled, but he retired, to show us that he did not fear his enemies. (St. Jerome) 
The desert was called of Bethsaida, not because it was on the same side of the town, but opposite it. Wherefore those who wished to join Jesus, not able to pass the lake, went round by the northern extremity, which they passed either by means of a bridge or in boats, and made such haste as to arrive at the desert before Jesus Christ, as St. Mark relates; (vi. 33.) whilst others, not equally expeditious, followed after, according to Sts. Matthew, Luke, and John; so that there is no contradiction in the evangelists. (Bible de Vence)
