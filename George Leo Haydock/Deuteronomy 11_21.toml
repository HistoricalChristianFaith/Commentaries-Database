Earth, as long as the world shall endure. The psalmist (Psalm lxxxviii. 30,) expresses the duration of the reign of the Messias nearly in the same terms. See Baruch i. 2. (Calmet) 
If the Jews had continued faithful to God, and had submitted to the Messias, they might never have been banished from their country. (Haydock)
