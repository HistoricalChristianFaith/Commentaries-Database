In thee. Let the cry of my blood, which issues from my wounds, and the injury which my reputation has suffered, come before the throne of God. Calumny is a species of murder. See Genesis iv. 10. (Calmet) 
If I be really guilty, I am willing to remain unburied. Let the dogs lick up my blood. (Cajetan) 
Cry. Let the hills re-echo my sufferings. (Pineda) Et quodcumque meæ possunt narrare querelæ, Cogar ad argutas dicere solus aves. (Propertius)
