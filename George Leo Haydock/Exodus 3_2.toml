The Lord appeared. That is, and angel representing God, and speaking in his name. (Challoner) (Acts vii. 30; Galatians iii. 19.) 
The apparitions of God to the patriarchs are generally understood in this sense. (St. Augustine, de Trin. iii. 11.) (Worthington) 
Yet many of the Fathers suppose, that this angel was no other than the Son of God, the angel of the great council, (Malachi as iii. 1,) and St. Augustine (q. 2, in Ex.) does not disapprove of this opinion. (Calmet) 
Not burnt. Thus the Hebrews were afflicted, but not destroyed. (Menochius) 
God is styled a consuming fire, Deuteronomy iv. 24. He appeared in fire again, chap. xxiv. 17. (Calmet)
