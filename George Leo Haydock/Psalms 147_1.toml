Jerusalem. After the captivity, (Worthington) or at the beginning of David's reign, when he had taken Sion, and Israel acknowledged his dominion, 2 Kings v. It may also allude to the Church, (John xi. 51.) and to heaven, Hebrews xii. 22., and Apocalypse xxi. (Berthier)

Alleluia. In some editions of the Septuagint (Haydock) and in Syriac, Arabic, the same inscription occurs, as in the former psalms. Many ascribe this to the same authors, and to the same occasion. Hebrew and Chaldean have no title. Yet the psalm seems to be a thanksgiving (Calmet) for the permission to build the temple and walls of Jerusalem, (Origen) which had been neglected, till God visited the people with a famine, ver. 8., 2 Esdras v. 1., and Aggeus i. 6. (Bossuet) 
Zorobabel, urge the people to build. (Syriac) (Calmet) 
Still David might compose this psalm, as he was a prophet, (Berthier) and he may allude to the beginning of his reign, when the people were all united. (Jansenius) 
Good. Agreeable and advantageous for us. 
Praise. This consists in purity of life, rather than in the sweetest accents. (Calmet)
