That your faith Had we employed the subtleties, the reasonings, and eloquence of men, some might perhaps be induced to believe that you had been seduced by artifice. But none can reasonably say so; your faith is founded on the force and evidence of truth, and upon the virtue and power of the Holy Spirit, who has bestowed upon you both the light of knowledge, and the fire of love. (Theod.)
