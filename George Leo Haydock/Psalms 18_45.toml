Faded, (inveterati sunt) "are grown old. "(Haydock) 
The Jews had been long the objects of God's favours: yet they fall away. Thus we often see priests outdone in piety by simple laics. (Berthier) 
David continues in the comparison of a tree which bears no fruit; (Calmet) thus lying, as it were, and frustrating the just expectations of the owner. Subjects do the like, when they revolt; (Isaias xxx. 9.) and thus deserve the title of strange. Protestants, "the strangers shall fade away, and be afraid out of their close places "(St. Jerome) "shall flow away, and be contracted in their straits "while I shall be at large, ver. 37. The last verb gachregu, (Haydock) occurs no where else. It may signify "shall be withered "or burnt, from charar. (Calmet)
