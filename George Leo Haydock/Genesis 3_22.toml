Behold Adam This was spoken by way of reproaching him with his pride, in affecting a knowledge that might make him like to God. (Challoner) 
"These are the words of God, not insulting over man, but deterring others from an imitation of his pride. "(St. Augustine, de Gen. xi. 39.) 
For ever. The sentence is left imperfect: (Calmet) but by driving man from Paradise, God sufficiently showed how he would prevent him from eating of the tree of life, (Haydock) which Adam had not yet found. As he was now condemned to be miserable on earth, God, in mercy, prevented him from tasting of that fruit, which would have rendered his misery perpetual. (Menochius) 
He would suffer him to die, that, by death, he might come, after a life of 930 years, spent in sorrow and repentance, to the enjoyment of himself. (Haydock) 
Lest perhaps. God does not exercise his absolute power, or destroy free-will, but makes use of ordinary means and precautions, to effect his designs. (St. Augustine) (Worthington)
