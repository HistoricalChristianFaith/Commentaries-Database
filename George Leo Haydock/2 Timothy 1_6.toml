That thou stir up the grace of God. In the Greek is a metaphor for fire that is blown up again. 
Which is in thee by the imposition of my hands, when thou wast ordained bishop. (Witham) 
The grace, which St. Paul here exhorts Timothy to stir up in him, was the grace he had received by imposition of hands, either in his confirmation, or at receiving the sacrament of orders, being a bishop. This verse seems to show that the imposition of hands is used in these two sacraments, as the essential matter of the sacraments, being the instrumental cause of the grace therein conferred. (Denis the Carthusian)
