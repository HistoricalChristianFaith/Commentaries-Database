Edge. Those in captivity would not allow that they were punished for their own sins: God convinces them of the contrary. (Worthington) 
They knew that he often visited the sins of the fathers upon the children, (Exodus xx. 5., and xxiv. 5.; Calmet) when they also hated him, (Haydock) and that many had suffered for their parents' faults, like those of Saul, David (Calmet) 
But these were all guilty of original sin at least, and death is not always a real misfortune. (Haydock) 
God seems to allow that the complaints had hitherto had some grounds, (Jeremias xxxi.) but that they should be removed after the captivity, and still more effectually by the death of Christ, who came to redeem sinners, and rejected none. By baptism he cancels original sin, the sour grape, and those who cannot receive it are not innocent. (Calmet) 
God chastises the body, but not the soul of children, for their parents' faults: (Menochius) and this conduct is a trial for them, which may increase their glory. (Haydock)
