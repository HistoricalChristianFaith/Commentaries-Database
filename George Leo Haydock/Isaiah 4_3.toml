Life. Only the faithful shall be saved. (Worthington) 
The Jews, after the captivity, shall be more obedient. But converts to the faith of Christ are styled saints, (Romans i. 7.) such particularly as are predestined to glory, Romans viii. 30. (Calmet) 
Those who are called to life and the true faith, may forfeit this honour, by their own fault. (Menochius)
