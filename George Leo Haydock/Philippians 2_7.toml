But debased himself: divested himself of all the marks of greatness, for the love of mankind. The Greek text signifies, he made himself void; on which account Dr. Wells, instead of made himself of no reputation, as in the Protestant translation, has changed it into emptied himself; not but that the true Son of God must always remain truly God, as well as by his incarnation truly man, but that in him as man appeared no marks of his divine power and greatness.
