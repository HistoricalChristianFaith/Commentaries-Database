Mercury. The god of travellers, who were wont to throw a stone at the foot of his statue, as the Indians (Vincent. Bellor. xxiv.) and Arabs did. Mahomet would not disturb this superstitious custom. The Rabbins style these statues Mercolis. But Septuagint, give another sense, "as he that bindeth a stone (Calmet) in the boss of a ring, sphendone, (Menochius) or in a sling "can do no good, but only endanger himself or others, "so "Yet margema is never used elsewhere for a sling, and it means undoubtedly "a heap of stones "(Calmet) as Montanus substitutes instead of "the sling "in Pagnin. "As a small piece of precious stone in a heap of stones is lost, so "(Pole. Syn. Parkhurst in rogom.) (Haydock) 
Honour, or an office, in which he may do harm. (Calmet)
