One man. Perhaps Micheas alone resided at Samaria. Elias and his disciples were in the country. Josephus and some others think, (Calmet) that the son of Jemla had been cast into prison for what he had said to Achab, when he had dismissed the king of Syria, chap. xx. 43. (Haydock) 
Not so. Good advice should be followed, though it be not pleasant. (Menochius) 
Josaphat justly suspected the schismatical false prophets. (Worthington)
