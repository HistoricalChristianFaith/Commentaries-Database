And this God doubtless revealed to Moses, when he said to him: take heed "thou make all things according to the pattern which was shown thee on the mount. "(Witham) 
Earth That is, if he were not of a higher condition than the Levitical order of earthly priests, and had not another kind of sacrifice to offer, he should be excluded by them from the priesthood, and its functions, which by the law were appropriated to their tribe. (Challoner)
