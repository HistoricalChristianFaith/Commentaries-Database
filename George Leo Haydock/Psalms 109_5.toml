Set thou the sinner over him Give to the devil, that arch-sinner, power over him: let him enter into him, and possess him. The imprecations, contained in the thirty verses of this psalm, are opposed to the thirty pieces of silver for which Judas betrayed our Lord: and are to be taken as prophetic denunciations of the evils that should befall the traitor, and his accomplices, the Jews; and not properly as curses. (Challoner) 
The devil entered into Judas, (John xiii. 2.; Calmet) who hung himself in despair. (Worthington) 
The Jews were abandoned over to cruel masters, as Doeg and Achitophel presently perished, Psalm li. 5. It was customary at trials, for a satan, or "adversary "to be stationed at the right hand of the accused, Zacharias iii. 1. (Calmet)
