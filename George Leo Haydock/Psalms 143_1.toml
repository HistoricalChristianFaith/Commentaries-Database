Absalom is not specified in Roman Septuagint, (Calmet) though it be in other copies. (Haydock) 
The latter part of the title has been added by the Greeks. (St. Hilary) 
If David composed the psalm, on occasion of his son's revolt, he considered it as a punishment of his former transgression. The Fathers explain it of Jesus Christ, who suffered for our sins. (Berthier) 
It might also relate to the captives, (Ferrand) or to the same event as the preceding psalm, (Bossuet) though there is no reason for abandoning the title. (Calmet) 
Justice. Or mercy. (St. Chrysostom) 
Absalom had no just cause of complaint, (Haydock) and God had promised to protect David on the throne.
