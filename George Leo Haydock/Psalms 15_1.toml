David. The word psalm being appropriated to some, while others are styled hymns, does not hinder the latter from being also psalms or spiritual songs, to be set to music: so the insertion of David, "the beloved's name "in some of these divine canticles, is no proof that the rest were not written by him. (Worthington) 
The author describes the perfection of priests, contrasts the sanctity of those who shall inhabit Jerusalem with that of the wicked mentioned in the last psalm. Some copies have To the end in the title, while others omit it, with the Hebrew, St. Chrysostom 
Hill. The Jews comforted themselves with the hopes of seeing Jerusalem rebuilt, Psalm cxxxi. 1. The prophets describe those who should return from captivity, as holy people, (Isaias xxvi. 3., and Sophonias iii. 13.; Calmet) a figure of the Church. (Haydock) 
Heaven is also styled a tabernacle and mountain, (Apocalypse xv. 5., and Hebrews xii. 22.; Berthier) and is here chiefly (Haydock) meant. See ver. 5. (Worthington)
