When the fruit is brought forth: literally, when the fruit hath produced. By the fruit is here meant the seed; i.e. when the seed by degrees hath produced the blade, then the ear, and lastly the corn, which is become ripe. (Witham) 
This is a secondary sense of the text, when the fruit hath come to maturity, and by no means a forced interpretation.
