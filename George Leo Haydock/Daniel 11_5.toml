South: Ptolemeus, the son of Lagus, king of Egypt, which lies south of Jerusalem. (Challoner) 
St. Iren us (iv. 43.) observes, that all prophecies are obscure till they be fulfilled. History shows that this relates to Ptolemy. The kingdoms of Egypt and of Syria are more noticed, as they had much to do with the Jews. (Worthington) 
Ptolemy took Cyprus (Calmet) and Jerusalem. (Josephus, Jewish Antiquities xii. 12.) 
His princes (that is, one of Alexander's princes) shall prevail over him; that is, shall be stronger than the king of Egypt. He speaks of Seleucus Nicator, king of Asia and Syria, whose successors are here called the kings of the north, because their dominions lay to the north in respect to Jerusalem. (Challoner) 
Nicator means a "conqueror. "(Haydock) 
This king was master of all from Media and Babylonia to Jerusalem. (Appian; Calmet) 
Philadelphus was more powerful than his father. (Worthington) Ver. 6. South. Bernice, daughter of Ptolemeus Philadelphus, given in marriage to Antiochus Theos, grandson of Seleucus, (Challoner) and king of Syria. She brought a great "dowry "and was therefore styled Phernophoros. Antiochus agreed to repudiate Laodicea; but he soon took her back. Fearing his inconstancy, she poisoned him, and slew his son by Bernice. This lady in a rage mounted her chariot, and having knocked down the cruel minister of such barbarity, trampled upon his body. The rest pretended that the infant was still living, and delivered up a part of the palace to Bernice, yet slew her as soon as they had an opportunity. (St. Jerome; Usher, year of the world 3758; V. Max. ix. 10. &amp;c; Calmet) 
Young. Hebrew, "her conductors, her child, and he that "(Haydock) 
Her physician, Aristarchus, persuaded her to enter the palace. Her women and Egyptian guards defended her for some time. (Polyg√¶n. Strat. viii.; Calmet) Ver. 7. A plant Ptolemeus Evergetes, the son of Philadelphus. (Challoner) 
Three of Bernice's maids of honour (Haydock) covered her body, and pretended that she was only wounded, till her brother Evergetes came and seized almost all Asia, Callinicus not daring to give him battle. (St. Jerome; Vaillant. A. 79. Lagid.; Calmet) 
He laid waste Syria. (Worthington) Ver. 8. Gods. He took back what Cambyses had conveyed out of Egypt; and it was on this account that the people styled him "benefactor. "(St. Jerome; Calmet) 
North. Seleucus Callinicus. (Challoner) 
If Evergetes had not been recalled into Egypt by civil broils, he would have seized all the kingdom of Seleucus. (Just. xvii.) 
As he passed by Jerusalem (ver. 9.) he made great presents, and caused victims of thanksgiving to be offered up. (Josephus, contra Apion ii.) Ver. 10. His sons. Seleucus Ceraunius and Antiochus the great, the sons of Callinicus. (Challoner) 
The former was poisoned after three years' reign, as he marched against Attalus. (Just. xxix.) 
Antiochus the great reconquered many provinces from Egypt, but was beaten at Raphia, on the confines, and lost Coelo-syria. (Calmet) 
He shall Antiochus the great. (Challoner) 
He prosecuted the war, as his brother was prevented by death. (Worthington) Ver. 11. South. Ptolemeus Philopator, son of Evergetes. (Challoner) 
He was an indolent prince; but his generals gained the victory. (Calmet) Ver. 12. Prevail. Many fell on both sides. (Haydock) 
But Antiochus did not prevail; (Worthington) or rather Philopator neglected the opportunity of dethroning his rival, (Calmet) as he might have seized all his dominions, if he had not been too fond of ease. (Just. xxx.) 
He followed the suggestions of his proud heart, when he attempted to enter the most holy place of the temple; and though he was visibly chastised by God, he would have vented his resentment on the Jews, if Providence had not miraculously protected them. (3 Machabees; Calmet) See Ecclesiasticus l. (Haydock) Ver. 13. Times, seventeen years after the battle of Raphia. When Philopator was dead, and his son Epiphanes not above five years old, Antiochus and Philip of Macedon basely attempted to divide his dominions. Scopas engaged Antiochus, but lost the battle, and all that Philopator had recovered. (Calmet) 
Many revolted in Egypt on account of the arrogance of Agathocles, who ruled in the king's name, ver. 14. (St. Jerome) Ver. 14. Vision. Many Jews, deceived by Onias, erected a temple in Egypt, falsely asserting that they fulfilled the prophecy of Isaias, xix. 19. (Worthington) 
This Onias was the son of Onias III, who was slain at Antioch, chap. ix. 25. (Haydock) 
The temple of Onion was called after him. All allow that he transgressed the law, by offering sacrifice there after God had pitched upon Jerusalem. But this was done (Calmet) under Philometor, forty-seven years (Usher) or longer after those times, when Epiphanes fought against Antiochus. The rebellion of the Jews against Egypt may therefore be meant. It was decreed that they should be under Antiochus, that his son might cause them to fall, (Calmet) and punish them for their crimes. (Haydock) Ver. 15. Cities; Sidon, Gaza, and the citadel of Jerusalem (Calmet) Ver. 16. Upon him. Antiochus shall come upon the king of the south. 
Land: Judea. (Challoner) 
Consumed, or "perfected. "Antiochus was very favourable to the Jews; (Calmet) invited all to return to Jerusalem, and furnished what was requisite for the sacrifices. (Josephus, Jewish Antiquities xii. 3.) Ver. 17. Kingdom, viz. all the kingdom of Ptolemeus Epiphanes, son of Philopator. (Challoner) 
The Romans interrupted Antiochus, who resolved to lull the young prince asleep, till he had subdued these enemies. (Calmet) 
Of women. That is, a most beautiful woman, viz. his daughter Cleopatra. 
It, viz. the kingdom of Epiphanes; but his policy shall not succeed; for Cleopatra shall take more to heart the interest of her husband than that of her father. (Challoner) 
He came with her to Raphia, and gave her Judea for her dowry, reserving half of the revenues. Hebrew and Greek have, "to corrupt her "(Calmet) Vulgate eam; as he wished his daughter to act perfidiously, that he might seize the whole kingdom. (Haydock) 
Epiphanes and his generals were on their guard, and Cleopatra took part with her husband. (St. Jerome) Ver. 18. Islands, near Asia. He also went into Greece, and was master of that country when the Romans declared war against him. (Calmet) 
Of his reproach. Scipio, the Roman general, called the prince of his reproach, because he overthrew Antiochus, and obliged him to submit to very dishonourable terms, before he would cease from the war. (Challoner) 
Protestants, "for a prince for his own behalf shall cause the reproach offered by him to cease, without his own reproach he shall cause it to turn upon him. "(Haydock) 
Being defeated at Magnesia, he chose the wisest plan of avoiding fresh reproach, by making peace, though (Calmet) the terms were very hard. (Livy xxxvii.) 
He jokingly observed, that he was obliged to the Romans for contracting his dominions. (Cicero, pro Dejot.) Ver. 19. Found. Antiochus plundered the temple of the Elymaites to procure money; but they, (St. Jerome) or the neighbouring barbarous nations, rose up and slew him. (Just. xxxii.) Ver. 20. One more vile. Seleucus Philopator, who sent Heliodorus to plunder the temple; and was shortly after slain by the same Heliodorus. (Challoner) 
He reigned about twelve years; and had sent his own son, Demetrius, to be a hostage at Rome instead of Epiphanes, whom he designed to place at the head of an army to invade Egypt. Hebrew, "one who shall cause the exactor to pass over the glory of the kingdom "the temple, 2 Machabees iii. (Calmet) Ver. 21. One despised; viz. Antiochus Epiphanes, who at first was despised and not received for king. What is here said of this prince, is accommodated by St. Jerome and others to antichrist, of whom this Antiochus was a figure. (Challoner) 
He lived and died basely; as the origin and end of antichrist will be ignominious. (Worthington) 
All that follows, to the end of chap. xii., regards Epiphanes. He had no title to the crown, which he procured by cunning, and held in the most shameful manner. He canvassed for the lowest offices, so that many styled him Epimanes, :"the madman. "(Diod. in Valesius, p. 305.; Calmet) Ver. 22. Fighter. That is, of them that shall oppose him, and shall fight against him. (Challoner) 
Heliodorus, who had murdered his brother and usurped the throne, and Ptolemy Epiphanes, were discomfited. The latter was making preparations against Seleucus, and said that his riches were in the purses of his friends, upon which they poisoned him. (St. Jerome) (Calmet) 
Covenant, or of the league. The chief of them that conspired against him; or the king of Egypt, his most powerful adversary. (Challoner) 
This title belongs to antichrist, who will join the Jews, and be received as their Messias. (St. Iren us v. 25.; St. Jerome Jo. 543.) (Worthington) Ver. 23. People. Ephiphanes pretended to be tutor of Philometor. But the nobles of Egypt distrusted him; whereupon he came to a battle, near Pelusium, and the young king surrendered himself. His uncle thus took possession of Egypt with surprising facility. Yet the people of Alexandria crowned Evergetes, which occasioned a civil war. (Calmet) Ver. 24. Places. Theodotion reads, "Egypt "omitting the b, (Haydock) which gives a good sense. 
(Calmet) Ver. 25. The king. Ptolemeus Philometor. (Challoner) 
Epiphanes came under the pretext of restoring Philometor, and gained a victory over Evergetes; but returned in Syria, that the two brothers might weaken each other, (Calmet) while the Syrians formed designs against both. (Haydock) Ver. 26. Slain. This was the perfidious policy of Epiphanes, who expected that the two brothers would destroy each other, so that he might easily seize Egypt, of which he kept the key, retaining the city of Pelusium. They were however reconciled, and reigned together. The Scripture often represents that as done which is only intended. Ver. 27. Two kings: Epiphanes and Philometor. 
Time. Epiphanes, vexed that he should thus be duped, returned again into Egypt, ver. 21.(Calmet) Ver. 28. Riches, taken in Egypt (Calmet) and in Jerusalem. (Haydock) 
The people had refused to receive Jason; and Epiphanes treated them in the most barbarous manner, profaned the temple, 1 Machabees i. 23., and 2 Machabees v. 21. (Calmet) Ver. 30. Galleys. Hebrew, "ships of Chittim. "(Haydock) 
The ambassadors probably came in vessels belonging to Macedonia, (Calmet) which they found at Delos. (Livy xliv.) 
Romans. Popilius and the other Roman ambassadors, who came in galleys, and obliged him to depart from Egypt. (Challoner) 
He was only four or seven miles from Alexandria, and went to meet the ambassadors, who gave him the senate's letter, ordering him to desist from the war. He said he would consult his friends: but Popilius formed a circle round him with his wand, requiring an answer before he went out of it. Hereupon the king withdrew his forces. (Polyb. xcii.; V. Max. vi. 4.) 
Succeed. Apollonius massacred many Jews on the sabbath, 1 Machabees i. 30. 
Against. Hebrew, "respecting. "Protestant: "have intelligence with them "(Haydock) 
These wretches prompted him to make such edicts, for he was attached to no religion, 2 Machabees iv. 9. Ver. 31. Arms, (brachia) or strong men, Apollonius, Philip, (2 Machabees vi.) and likewise the senator from Antioch, who executed his decrees. (Calmet) 
Abomination. The idol of Jupiter Olympius, which Antiochus ordered to be set up in the sanctuary of the temple, which is here called the sanctuary of strength, from the Almighty that was worshipped there. (Challoner) 
Other idols were set up, and the people were compelled to sacrifice. (Calmet) 
Yet even in the hottest persecutions some remain faithful. (Worthington) Ver. 32. Dissemble. Thus acted the officers and apostate Jews. 
Know. Such were the Assideans, Eleazar, and the Machabees. Ver. 33. Learned; the priests, Matthathias, Malachi as ii. 7. Ver. 34. Help. The victories of the Machabees were miraculous. 
Deceitfully, like those who took the spoils of idols, and were slain. Hebrew may imply, "secretly. "(Calmet) Ver. 35. Fall, or become martyrs. (Haydock) 
Such were Eleazar (Calmet) 
Another time, after death; (Haydock) or the perfect deliverance shall take place later, ver. 27. Ver. 36. Every god. "He plundered many (Calmet or most; pleista.; Haydock) temples. "(Polyb. Athen. v. 6.) 
The Samaritans, and even the priests of the Lord, obeyed the impious decree; so that the king looked upon himself as a sort of god. 
Accomplished against the Jews, when Epiphanes shall be punished. Ver. 37. God. He laughed at religion, yet sometimes offered splendid presents and victims, which showed his inconstancy. (Calmet) 
Women. He kept many concubines, (Diod.) and committed the greatest obscenities publicly: mimis et scortis. (St. Jerome) 
Hebrew may have quite a different sense. He had no regard for the sex, (Calmet) killing all indiscriminately. (Grotius) Ver. 38. The god Maozim. That is, the god of forces or strong holds. (Challoner) 
Mahuzzim denotes "strong ones "(Haydock) guardians Dr. Newton (Diss.) explains, the king (ver. 36) of the Roman state; and supposes that here the guardian saints and angels are meant, whose worship he shows "began in the Roman empire, very soon after it became Christian. This exposition seems far preferable to that which interprets "Jupiter or the heavens, and understands the idol set up by Epiphanes. See Univ. Hist. x. Parkhurst. 
If these authors speak of the inferior veneration shown to saints and angels in the Catholic Church, it had a much earlier commencement, being coeval with religion itself. But only the blindest prejudice can represent this as idolatrous, and of course this system must fall to the ground. (Haydock) 
Others suppose that Mars, Hercules, Azizus, or Jupiter, may be designated. Hebrew, "He will rise up against all, (38) and against the strong God (of Israel, ver. 31., and chap. viii. 10.; Calmet) he will, in his place, worship a strange god,  "(Junius) 
None of the ancestors of Epiphanes had ever adored Jupiter on the altar of holocausts. (Calmet) 
He and antichrist adore either the great Jupiter or their own strength. (Worthington) Ver. 39. To. Hebrew, "in the most strong holds, with "(Haydock) 
He built a fortress near the temple, styled Maoz, (Ezechiel xxiv. 25.) on account of its strength. (Calmet) 
Glory. He shall bestow honours, riches, and lands, upon them that shall worship his god. (Challoner) 
He will entrust the strong places to them. Ver. 40. Fight. Epiphanes made war on Egypt, till the Romans forced him to desist. The prophet explains his preceding attempts, to which he only alluded, ver. 29, 30. Ver. 41. Land; Egypt, or rather Judea. (Calmet) 
Ammon. He will not divide his forces. (St. Jerome) Ver. 43. Ethiopia. Hebrew, "the Lubim and Cu shim shall be at his steps. "Theodotion reads, "in their fortresses. "He had troops form these nations, or Egypt was guarded by them. Ver. 44. North. Judas continued victorious. Armenia (Calmet) and Parthia rebelled. (Tacitus v. 8.) 
Many. Epiphanes left three generals and half his army to destroy the Jews. (Calmet) Ver. 45. Apadno. Some take it for the proper name of a place; others, from the Hebrew translate it, his palace. (Challoner) 
He fixed his royal tent between the Mediterranean and the Dead Sea. (Worthington) 
Porphyrius explains this of the march beyond the Euphrates, which St. Jerome does not disapprove. Apadno may denote Mesopotamia, which is styled Padan Aram. 
Glorious. Hebrew Zebi, (Calmet) or Tsebi, (Haydock) may allude to Mount Taba, where the king perished, without help, 1 Machabees vi. 11., and 2 Machabees ix. 9. St. Jerome and many others explain all this of antichrist, and no doubt he was prefigured. The like events will probably take place again towards the end of the world. But as the particulars cannot be ascertained, we have adhered to the history of Antiochus. (Calmet)
