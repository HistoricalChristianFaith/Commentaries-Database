Proud. So the Chaldeans are often styled in the Psalms. (Calmet) 
The prophet addresses Nabuchodonosor, or rather Baltassar, (Menochius) under whom the city was taken, (Josephus) by Darius and Cyrus. He may be the Nabonides of Berosus, the question is so much perplexed. Yet "we are convinced that Darius reigned at Babylon before Cyrus, and took the city after the death of Baltassar. "(Calmet) 
Most commentators are of a different opinion. (Haydock)
