Lais, four miles from Paneas, towards Tyre. It is called Lesem Dan; (Josue xix. 47.) both the ancient and the new name being joined together. 
Rich, Hebrew has almost as many different meanings as interpreters. De Dieu, "There was no one to put them to shame, no chief magistrate. "(Calmet) 
Protestants, "and there was no magistrate in the land that might put them to shame in any thing. "(Haydock) 
The citizens of Lais were perhaps a colony, and followed the manners and religion of Sidon, but were at a day's journey from their territory; (Josephus) so that the latter could not come to their assistance at a very short warning. The Danites were therefore encouraged to make the attack, (Calmet) particularly as this city was confident in its own strength and riches, and made no alliance with any other. (Haydock) 
Septuagint Alexandrian, read, Aram instead of Adam. "They had no commerce with Syria. "But the Roman edition (Calmet) has, "they are far off from the Sidonians, and have no (word or) commerce with man. "The edition of Grabe repeats a great part of this verse again; ver. 9, with an obelus.
