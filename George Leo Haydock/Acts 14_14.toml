We also are mortals. The enraptured people wished to pay divine homage, thoein, to the apostles, and therefore they indignantly reject the proffered honours. The Catholic Church has but one external sacrifice, and this she offereth to God only, and "neither to Peter nor to Paul, saith St. Augustine, though the priest that sacrificeth, standeth over their bodies, and offereth in their memories. "(lib. viii. de Civit. Dei. chap. 27.)
