Praise, offered to appease my wrath. (Haydock) 
This admirably shows the force of the saints' intercession, which God does not reject, but rather encourages by such declarations. Abraham and Moses did not leave off praying for the guilty, (Genesis xviii. 23., and Exodus xxxii. 10.) and the Lord complains that there was none to withhold him, Isaias lxiv. 7., and Ezechiel xxii. 30. (Calmet)
