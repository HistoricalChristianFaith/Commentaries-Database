Go up This was spoken ironically, and by way of jesting at the flattering speeches of the false prophets: and so the king understood it, as appears by his adjuring Micheas, in the following verse, to tell him the truth in the name of the Lord. (Challoner) 
Micheas had only repeated their words, and by his accent and gestures (Du Hamel) might easily explain his meaning. (Haydock) 
Similar examples of irony may be seen, chap. xviii. 27., and Genesis iii. 22. (Calmet) 
The prophet might also pray for success. But the king begged for a positive answer. (Worthington)
