David: or, Ozias slept. And they buried him in the field of the royal sepulchre, because he was a leper, and Joatham, 2 Paralipomenon xxvi. 23. (Haydock) 
Such an aversion had people for lepers, that they would not even bury them with others. (Calmet) 
Yet he was treated with some honour. (Worthington)
