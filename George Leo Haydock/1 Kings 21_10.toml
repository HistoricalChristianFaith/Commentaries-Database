Belial, without restraint or conscience. 
Blasphemed. Hebrew, "blessed. "
Elohim, (Haydock) or god, the gods, magistrates (Calmet) 
Blessing is equally put, to avoid the horrible sound of blaspheming. (Worthington) (Job i. 5., and ii. 9.) 
Martin de Roa (i. 9.) maintains, that the word implies to "bid adieu "or quit; as if Naboth had relinquished the service both of God and of the king. He was accused as a traitor. The law did not condemn the person to death who had spoken ill of the prince, Exodus xxii. 28. But the wicked judges complied with the intimation of Jezabel; (Calmet) as she pretended that he had also blasphemed God. (Haydock) 
Josephus introduces three witnesses, which was more conformable to the practice of the Jews. (Grotius) 
But the text specifies two; and that number would suffice. (Haydock) 
All Naboth's family were involved in his ruin; (4 Kings ix. 26.; Tirinus) as it was necessary for Achab's purpose. So Achan's children perished with him, Josue vii. 25. (Haydock) 
What a complication of crimes! (Tirinus) 
"They proclaim a fast, in order to commit murder. "(St. Chrysostom, ser. 68.) Hypocrisy, falsehoods, perjury, perversion of justice, all are employed to take away the life, honour, and property of the innocent. See St. Ambrose, Seneca Benef. ii. 27. (Tirinus)
