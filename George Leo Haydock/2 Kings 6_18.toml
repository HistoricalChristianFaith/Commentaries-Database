Blindness. The blindness here spoken of was of a particular kind, which hindered them from seeing the objects that were really before them; and represented other different objects to their imagination; so that they no longer perceived the city of Dothan, nor were able to know the person of Eliseus; but were easily led by him, whom they took to be another man, to Samaria. So that he truly told them; this is not the way, neither is this the city, because he spoke with relation to the way, and to the city which was represented to them. (Challoner) 
Stratagems in war are lawful. (St. Chrysostom) (Grotius, Jur. iii. 1, 17.) The words of the prophet might be merely ironical. 
Blindness, Septuagint aorasia, "not seeing "certain objects, while they could perceive others; as was the case of the men who sought Lot's door at Sodom; (Genesis xix. 11.; Calmet) and the eyes of the disciples were held, that they might not know our Saviour. Eliseus had left his house, going towards Samaria to meet the soldiers; and when they asked him where the prophet dwelt, he answered truly, This For he was then near the royal city, and his abode was at Dothan. (Salien) (Haydock) 
The reprobate will thus acknowledge their error, when it is too late, at the last day.
