If any other thinketh he may have confidence in the flesh, in being of the Jewish race and of their religion, I more; i.e. I have greater reasons to glory than they have, being circumcised of the stock of Israel 
But what things as soon as I was miraculously called to the knowledge and faith of Christ. (Witham)
