Are ended. By this it appears that this psalm, though placed here, was in order of time the last of those which David composed, (Challoner) as he died soon after. (Menochius) 
The subject which he has here treated, (Haydock) concentrated all his thoughts and desires. (Eusebius) 
"The prayers of David, son of Jesse, have been summed up. "(Theodotion and V Edition.) (Haydock) 
It is probable that the collections of the psalms were made at different times; (Berthier) and though many were found after this second book was completed, it was not judged expedient to make any alteration. The Syriac and Arabic pass over this sentence entirely, (Calmet) which might be added by Esdras. (Worthington) 
The following psalms have the name of Asaph, in the titles. (Flaminius) 
Yet it is certain that David composed some at least, which are place after this. See Psalm cix. (Haydock) 
The true David ceaseth not to sing new canticles in his Church. (St. Augustine) (Worthington)
