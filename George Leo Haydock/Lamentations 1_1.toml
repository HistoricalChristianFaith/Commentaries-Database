City. David had conquered many. Jerusalem was long considered as the finest city in those parts. 
Tributary. It had been so to the Assyrians, Egyptians, and Chaldeans, 4 Kings xxiv. 1. From this and similar passages, it would seem that the city was still existing: yet in others it appears to have been demolished. Here then the prophet declares what it had been: (Calmet) unless he wrote part after the death of Josias. (Haydock) 
The beholders are astonished at the change and misery of the city. (Worthington)
