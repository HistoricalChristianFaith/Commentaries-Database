Hear. Hebrew with points, "publish. "(Berthier) 
St. Jerome agrees with the Septuagint. 
Thy praise. The former word is not expressed in the Vulgate or Hebrew, (Haydock) but it is understood; and occurs in some editions of the Septuagint, as well as in the Syriac. (Houbigant) 
World lings come to the assemblies of the faithful, but often without piety or advantage. Priests themselves but too frequently dishonour the altar, which they serve. (Berthier) 
If they were careful to perform their sacred duties well, (Haydock) and had a sincere love for the spouse of Christ, many profanations would be avoided; (Calmet) as God suffers no greater injury from any, than from bad ministers. (St. Gregory) (Haydock) 
They ought to be recollected, and join mental with vocal prayer in their sacred offices. (Worthington)
