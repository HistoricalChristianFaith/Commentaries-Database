The reproach he makes the Scribes in this place, is similar to what he had objected against the Pharisees. (St. Matthew xxiii. 5.) Both these sects were filled with the same spirit of pride and vanity, which showed itself in their dress, in their exterior, and in every part of their conduct. If our Saviour here attacks them upon their long trains, or other affected forms of their dress, he does not pronounce an absolute condemnation of things, which in themselves are indifferent, but of their abuse of them, making them serve only the purpose of vanity and affectation. (Calmet)
