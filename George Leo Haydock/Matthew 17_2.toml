Transfigured. Let no one think that he changed his natural form, laying aside his corporeal, and assuming a spiritual form; but when the evangelist says his countenance shone like the sun, and describes the whiteness of his garments, he shows in what the transfiguration consisted. He added to his former appearance splendour and glory, but laid not aside his substance. The Lord was transfigured into that glory with which he will appear again at the day of judgment, and in his kingdom. (St. Jerome) 
Calvin translates metamorphous Thai, transformed, but contrary to the sentiment of the holy fathers. He did not show them his divinity, which cannot be seen by the eyes of the body, but a certain glimpse or sign of the same: hence the hymn: Quicunque Christum quæritis, Oculos in altum tollite; Illìc lice bit visere Signum perennis gloriæ.
