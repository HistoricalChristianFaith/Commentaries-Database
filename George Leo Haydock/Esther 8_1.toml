Drink. Wine was only used at great feasts, Ecclesiasticus xxxi. 17. Water was served up first, from the river Choaspes only. The king and his eldest son were allowed to drink of "the golden waters "of which they alone had 70 fountains. (Athen. xii. 2.) 
Their wine was brought from Chelbon, near Damascus. (Ibid. i. 22.) (Ezechiel xxvii. 18.) (Calmet)
