Darius, the Mede, chap. v. 31. If his reign had commenced at the same time with that of Cyrus, at Babylon, as it is commonly supposed, Daniel would have been under no anxiety respecting the people's liberation, as it took place that year, (Calmet) though perhaps not at the commencement. (Haydock) 
Cyrus had now ruled over the Persians above two years, so that the first of Darius at Babylon agrees with the third of his reign over his countrymen, chap. x. (Calmet) 
Assuerus, or Achasuerus, is not a proper name, but means "a great prince. "(Worthington)
