Things, sixty-eight years after the journey of Zorobabel. (Calmet) 
Salien adds ten years more. (Haydock) 
Artaxerxes Longimanus. (Menochius) (Tirinus) 
Son, or great grandson of Sarai as, who had been slain 121 years. Esdras was still living, in the days of Nehemias. Many persons are omitted in this genealogy. The immediate descendants of Azarias may be found, 1 Paralipomenon vi. Similarity of names has occasioned many mistakes. 3 Esdras viii. reckons only eleven persons between Aaron and Esdras; and 4 Esdras i. has eighteen; whereas here we behold sixteen generations, and 1 Paralipomenon, twenty-two. (Calmet)
