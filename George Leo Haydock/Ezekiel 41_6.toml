One by another, or one over another: literally, side to side, or side upon side. (Challoner) 
The word side is here equivocal, like Hebrew tsela, sometimes denoting the boards, and at other times the apartments round the temple, except on the west, over against the sanctuary, which seems to be the case here. It is true, we shall not easily find sixty-six chambers. But the Hebrew, have only thirty-three. (Calmet) 
Villalpand rightly translated ante rides, (ver. 5.) but here he substitutes trabes, "beams or thick planks "to make it agree with 3 Kings vi. 6., as if the same temple were meant. He also adopts the Vulgate bis. 
Twice. Hebrew pehamim. Yet he afterwards places in his commentary, pedes, "thirty-three feet, that is twenty-two cubits "though feet are never used at all as a measure in Scripture. (Houbigant)
