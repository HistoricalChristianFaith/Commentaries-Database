A little horn. Antiochus Epiphanes, a descendant of Seleucus. He grew against the south and the east, by his victories over the kings of Egypt and Armenia; and against the strength, that is, against Jerusalem and the people of God. (Challoner) 
He persecuted God's people, and set up the idol of Jupiter Olympius in the very temple. (Worthington)
