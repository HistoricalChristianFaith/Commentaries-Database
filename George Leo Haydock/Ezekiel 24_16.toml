Stroke; pestilence, or sudden death. This would make the loss of a dear wife still more afflicting. Yet such distress will fall upon the whole nation, (Calmet) and misery shall increase so much, that a private loss will be almost forgotten. (Haydock) 
Cur√¶ leves loquuntur, graviores silent. (Seneca, Troad.) 
When a loss is foreseen, it is more easily borne. Private calamities sink in public ones. (Worthington)
