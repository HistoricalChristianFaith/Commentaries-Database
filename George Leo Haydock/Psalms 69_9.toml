Upon me. The disciples remembered that this had been written concerning Christ, who drove out the profaners of his temple, (John ii. 17.) and will not be less severe on those who dishonour the Church by their scandalous lives, or by propagating erroneous opinions. (Calmet) 
St. Paul (Romans xv. 3.) doubted not but this passage was literally applicable to Christ, who has taught us to prefer the glory of God, and our neighbour's salvation before our own temporal advantages. (Berthier) 
Those who have less zeal, are not so much persecuted. (Worthington)
