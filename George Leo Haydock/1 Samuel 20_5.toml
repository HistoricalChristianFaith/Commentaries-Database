To-morrow is the new moon. The neomenia, or first day of the moon, kept according to the law, as a festival; and therefore Saul feasted on that day; and expected the attendance of his family. (Challoner) (Numbers x. 10.) 
Moon. Literally, "calends "a Greek word, intimating that the people were informed, or "called "together, on that occasion; as many nations follow the lunar system in the regulation of the year. (Haydock) 
The Rabbins say that people were stationed on the highest hills to observe the first appearance of the moon, and to give notice of it. But for fear of a mistake, two days were observed, as here we see that Saul gave a feast for such a length of time. This, however, is very uncertain. David speaks without any reference to the watchmen, as of a thing well known to all. The reason of Saul's feasting two days, was because one of them was the sabbath. The following work-day David came to Nobe, (ver. 19,) and partook of the loaves which had been changed on the sabbath day, chap. xxi. 6., and Leviticus xxiv. 8. 
Sit. The custom of sitting at table seems to have been more ancient than that of lying. The Persians chiefly introduced the latter. They had very low tables, so that one of them was placed under the feet of Alexander, when he sat upon the throne of Darius, which was too high for him. (Curtius v.) Both customs frequently prevailed at the same time, Ecclesiasticus ix. 12., and xxxi. 12. Women probably always sat, as the Chaldean says Esther did, Esther vii. 8. See Athen. i. 14. V. Max. ii. 1. 
Day. The second of the month, after the sabbath was ended. (Calmet) 
Pezron thinks that both the last and first days of the month were festivals. (Du Hamel)
