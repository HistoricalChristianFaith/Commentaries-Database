And. Hebrew and Septuagint, "And.the king. Came against him, and smote him. "Hebrew continues, "but strengthened him not "in the end; though he had been invited, (ver. 16.; Haydock) and had actually made a diversion in favour of Achaz. But not being satisfied, he afterwards returned, and made cruel havoc in the country, imposing tribute upon the king, ver. 21., 4 Kings xvi. 7., and xviii. 7. It is therefore unnecessary to correct the Hebrew, with Grotius, to make it agree with 4 Kings xvi. 7. Thus
he "came to his aid, and relieved him from his distress, (ver. 21,) and granted him assistance."
