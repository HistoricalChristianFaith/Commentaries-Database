Anger. Literally, "face "(vultus.; Haydock) which sometimes intimates favour, ver. 7. This passage may allude to the vengeance (Calmet) which David exercised upon the Ammonites, whom he burnt in kilns, (2 Kings xii. 31.; Geier.; Vat.) or to the destruction of Sodom, Genesis xix. 28., and Lamentations iv. 6. (Calmet) 
It is a terrible thing to fall into the hands of an angry God, who will punish his enemies in a fire; to which St. Paul (Hebrews x. 27.) attributes rage, (Haydock) or emulation, as it will seem to strive to surpass all others. O that we may meditate on this fire! that the love of God may consume all our defects! 
Trouble. Hebrew, "swallow up "which is more energetic.
