Priest, or pontiff, as no other would have dared to make this innovation. (Salien) 
He was guilty of a great weakness; as the altar of Solomon had been so solemnly consecrated by God's presence. All changes in religion are dangerous. The Machabees behaved with far greater respect, with regard to the altar which had been profaned, 1 Machabees iv. 45. (Calmet) 
Isaias (viii. 2.) calls this priest a faithful, or competent, witness, (Haydock) on account of his dignity, not approving his conduct. (Salien) 
But he had not erected this altar when the prophet spoke thus to him. (Du Hamel)
