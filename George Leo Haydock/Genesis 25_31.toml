Sell me. He had been informed by his mother, that God had transferred the birth-right to him; and, therefore, he takes this opportunity to obtain the consent of Esau quietly. The latter, who knew nothing of God's decree, showed his little regard for that privilege. (Haydock) 
He perhaps intended to assert his claim by force, notwithstanding this agreement. (Menochius) 
It is not probable that he could plead in earnest, that he was famishing in the midst of his father's house. (Du Hamel) 
The birth-right was a temporal honour; though some assert, that the office of priesthood belonged also to it. This, however, does not seem to be certain; for we find Abel, Abraham, and other younger children offering sacrifice. The first-born were entitled to a double portion, (Deuteronomy xxi. 17; 1 Paralipomenon v. 2, 5) and to their father's peculiar blessing, Ecclesiasticus iii. 12. To despise such advantages betrayed a bad disposition, for which Esau is condemned, Hebrews xii. 16; Romans ix. (Calmet) 
Jacob's conduct was perfectly innocent, whether we consider this transaction as serious or not. Isaac never ratified the bargain; nor do we find that Jacob rested his claim on it. (Haydock) 
But it is recorded by Moses, to show the disposition of these two young men. (Calmet)
