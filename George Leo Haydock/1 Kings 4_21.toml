The river. Euphrates. (Challoner) 
To, or "of the land "terr√¶. (Haydock) 
This river may denote the torrent Besor, as Solomon's dominions extended not only as far as Gaza, but also to the oriental branch of the Nile, ver. 24. Thus one verse explains the other. There were, indeed, no kingdoms (Calmet) in this portion of land, which is now quite barren: but formerly it had several cities, and they belonged to various kings of Egypt, Arabia, the Philistines (Haydock) 
Hebrew may be rendered "from the river, (Euphrates) the land of the Philistines, and to the border", (Calmet) agreeably to 2 Paralipomenon ix. 26. He exercised authority over all the kings from the river Euphrates to the land Hebrew, "the river even unto "Solomon had all the kings of Syria, Ammon, the Philistines, under him; so that his empire took in all that had been promised to Abraham. (Haydock) See St. Augustine, q. 21. (Josue)
