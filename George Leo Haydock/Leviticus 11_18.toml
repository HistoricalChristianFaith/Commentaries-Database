Bittern, onocrotalum. See ver. 17. Protestant version has "pelican and the gier-eagle "for porphyrion. (Haydock) 
Its beak and long legs are red. (Pliny, x. 46.) Bo chart understands the vulture, and the Samaritan version the pelican; both of which are remarkable for the care they take of their young. Réme may be derived from rém, "mercy."
