With him. Thus to avoid a little shame and temporal punishment, they rushed into those which are inconceivably geat and eternal. (Haydock) 
The Jews in vain attempt to excuse Saul, as they deem suicide in such cases lawful, though in others they deprive those of burial, who have been guilty of it. (Josephus, Antiquities vi. 14.) 
This author applauds the behaviour of Saul; and indeed, his courage called forth the praises of David. But even the pagans have deemed those no better than cowards, who have killed themselves to avoid misery. Rebus in adversis facile est contemn ere mortem: Fortiter ille facit, qui miser esse potest. (Martial) The civil laws deny suicides the rites of burial, as they are also guilty of a crime against the state, which they deprive of their labours. They unjustly abandon what God has only committed to their care. Saul seems to have been afraid of receiving any insult himself, rather than to have been desirous of preventing the blasphemies of the infidels against God, as the Jews pretend. He gave no signs of repentance, and the spirit of God pronounces his condemnation. So Saul died for his iniquities, because he transgressed; (Calmet; Hebrew and Septuagint, in his iniquities, by which he prevaricated. Tirinus).and moreover consulted also a witch, and trusted not in the Lord: therefore he slew him, 1 Paralipomenon x. 13, 14. Saul prefigured those, who having yielded to temptations, persist and die in their evil ways. (St. Gregory) (Worthington)
