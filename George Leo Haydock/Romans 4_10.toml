In effect, Abraham received circumcision a year only before the birth of Isaac; whereas he had received the promises and justification more than 25 years before, when the Almighty caused him to depart from Mesopotamia. (Calmet) 
Therefore he was justified by faith and grace, which is common both to the circumcised and uncircumcised. (Menochius)
