My sins In the Hebrew my wrath. He does not mean to compare his sufferings with his real sins; but with the imaginary crimes which his friends falsely imputed to him: and especially with his wrath or grief, expressed in the third chapter, which they so much accused. Though, as he tells them here, it bore no proportion with the greatness of his calamity. (Challoner) 
Job does not deny but he may have transgressed. (Calmet) See chap. vii. 20. 
But his is not conscious of any mortal offence; such as his friends insisted he must have committed, as he was so cruelly tormented. (Haydock) 
Some deny canonical authority to the words of Job, because God reprehended him. But St. Gregory (Mor. vii.) says, Ab Ã¦terno judice casurus laudari non potuit. (Du Hamel) 
"The man who was on the point of falling, could not be praised by the eternal Judge "(Haydock) and it seems to be a mistake that Job erred, (Houbigant) though asserted by many. See Calmet; Worthington 
Wrath. Hebrew, "O that my grief (Haydock; or complaints. Calmet) were thoroughly weighed, and my calamity laid in the balances together. "(Protestants) (Haydock) 
A just man confesses his own sins, but not those which are wrongfully laid to his charge. (Worthington)
