Accuse. Septuagint, "deliver not "to an idolater, Deuteronomy xxiii. 15. (Rabbins) 
Servant. Add not to his affliction. (Worthington) 
We must suppose that the accusation is frivolous or false. (Lyranus) 
A servant may do a person much injury: but this ought not to deter the other from performing what justice and charity require.
