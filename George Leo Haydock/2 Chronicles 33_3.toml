City. The torrent Cedron afforded the only good supply of water. It was often dry, and was only three steps across, when full of melted snow or rain. The waters of Siloe and Gihon were collected in it. Yet it was no very difficult enterprise for the king to turn the stream, and introduce the waters through the rock into a large reservoir, in the city, by the canal, which is mentioned 2 Esdras ii. 14., and Ecclesiasticus xlviii. 19. The besieged were more frequently deprived of water, Judith vii. 6. Babylon was taken by Semiramis, Cyrus, and Alexander, after they had turned aside the waters of the Euphrates; and CÃ¦sar obliged the town of Cahors to surrender, by intercepting the springs. (Frontin. iii. 7.) (Calmet)
