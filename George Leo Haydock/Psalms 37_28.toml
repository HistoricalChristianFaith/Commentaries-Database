Saints. Hebrew, "merciful ones. "He will free them from captivity. (Calmet) 
Punished. This sentence seems to be improperly omitted in Hebrew, which otherwise neglects the letter a, as the Chaldean, Syriac, and St. Jerome do as well as a few copies of the Septuagint. The Roman edition with the Arabic and Ethiopic, reads amomoi ekdikethesontai, "the innocent shall be avenged "(Calmet) or "punished "which is inaccurately put for anomoi ekdiochthesontai, the wicked shall be punished, or "expelled "(Berthier) though Grabe prefers the former verb. (Haydock) 
St. Cyril acknowledges both readings. (Calmet)
