Riddle. Samson must no longer be considered as a private man. He was authorized by the Spirit of the Lord, thus to punish the oppressors of Israel. (Calmet) 
Though these 30 men had done him no injury in person, (Haydock) they had sinned against God, and deserved to die. (Salien) 
He slew them publicly in the city (Menochius) though others believe that he did it in the neighbouring country, as it does not appear that the people knew of their death. (Calmet)
