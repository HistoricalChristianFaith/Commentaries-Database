This Melchisedech. If we look for the construction, Melchisedech may be joined with what follows, (ver. 3.) continueth a priest for ever. (Witham) 
The excellency of this personage was so transcendent, that some of the ancients took him to be an Angel, and some the Holy Spirit. This the Fathers condemn; for had he not been a man, a king, and a priest, he would not have been so worthy a type of our Saviour.
