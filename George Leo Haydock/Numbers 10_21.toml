Sanctuary, or holy vessels. They never set them down, till they arrived at the place where the tabernacle was to be fixed. Hebrew may be, "the sons of Caath set forward, bearing the vessels of the sanctuary, (Calmet) and they (the other Levites, ver. 17,) set up the boards and curtains of the tabernacle till they arrived "that so both the vessels and the ark might be placed in proper order. If the ark had to return into the middle of the camp from leading the way, as Salien insinuates; while it passed between the ranks of Juda, the Levites would have time to arrange every thing.
