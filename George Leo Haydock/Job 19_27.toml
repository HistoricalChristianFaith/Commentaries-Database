Myself. Hebrew, "for myself "and for my comfort; not like the reprobate, who shall see their judge to their eternal confusion. Job insists so much on this point, that he shows he is not speaking merely of the divine favour being restored to him, in the re-establishment of his health and affairs, but that he raises his mind to something more solid and desirable, of which the former was only a faint representation. (Calmet) 
"No one since Christ has spoken so plainly of the resurrection, as this man did before the coming of the Messias. "(St. Jerome, ad Pam.) 
This. Hebrew, "though my reins be consumed within me "(Protestants; Haydock) or, "my reins (desires and tender affections) are completed in my bosom. "(Calmet)
