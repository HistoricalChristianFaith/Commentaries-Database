Sworn. We read not of an express oath; (Calmet) but the denunciation of God was equivalent. (Haydock) 
Iniquity, or punishment. Nothing could withhold the indignation of the Lord, in correcting the sinner, though he would show mercy eternally to the penitent. But he saw the obstinacy of these priests, and their unhappy end. The sacrifices of the old law always presupposed suitable internal sentiments, to grant the remission of sin; and even for the avoiding of the legal punishments, they must have been offered in a true spirit of religion, which these abandoned wretches despised and neglected. (Calmet) 
God threatens that he will punish their crimes for ever, as he abominates the contempt of priests. (Tirinus)
