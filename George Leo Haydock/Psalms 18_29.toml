Temptation. David was almost continually assailed by enemies. (Calmet) 
Septuagint peieatesion, signifies "a place of pirates "denoting what crafty foes he had to encounter, (Berthier) or "a place or time to learn the military exercise "a warfare, Job vii. 1. But gedud, (Haydock) means "a troop "designed to make incursions, as those under Jephte and David. Hebrew, "In thee I will run armed "(St. Jerome) or, "at the head of my troops. "(Calmet) 
"I will break, (Pagnin) or, run through an army. "(Montanus) 
No fortification can hold out. (Haydock) 
He alludes particularly to the wall of the Jebusites, which Joab first mounted, though extremely high, 2 Kings v. 6. (Calmet) 
With God's help, every difficulty may be surmounted. (Worthington) 
Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation, as our Saviour admonishes.
