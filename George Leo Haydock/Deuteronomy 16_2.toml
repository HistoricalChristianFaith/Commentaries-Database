Phase. Hebrew and Septuagint, "the Phase (or lamb) to the Lord thy God, sheep and oxen "or "of the flock and the herd "(Protestants) offered on the same festival, (Haydock) or victims proper for the solemnity, besides the paschal lamb, Numbers xxviii. 19., and 2 Paralipomenon xxx. 15. Peace-offerings were also made; (Leviticus vi. 12., and 2 Paralipomenon xxxv. 7,) and of these free offerings, some explain the words of the Jews, (John xviii. 28,) as they suppose the lamb had been eaten the night before. (Menochius; Bo chart; Tirinus) 
They might, however, have refrained from eating of these on that day. (Calmet) 
But they perhaps did not choose to be debarred of that privilege. 
There. The place peculiarly consecrated to the worship of God, for length of days. (Haydock)
