In this we believe that thou camest forth from God; that is, we are more confirmed than ever, that thou art the Messias, the true Son of God. Yet St. Chrysostom, St. Cyril, and St. Augustine, take notice, that their faith was but imperfect, till after Christ's resurrection, and the coming of the Holy Spirit; and therefore Christ answered them, (ver. 31.) Now do you believe? the hour cometh, that you shall be dispersed (Witham)
