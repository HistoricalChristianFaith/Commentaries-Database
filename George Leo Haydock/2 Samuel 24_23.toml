As a king. Literally, king Areuna: "e may have been substituted for c, "like "though the latter word is often understood. (Haydock) 
Some suppose that he was formerly king of the Jebusites, (Vatable) or one of their descendants, (Grotius) or possessed of great riches But why is the title never given to him elsewhere? (Bo chart) 
The Septuagint, Syriac, and many Latin copies, do not recognize it; nor was it found in the Chaldean, in the 12th age . Yet without making any changes, we may translate, "O king, Areuna has given all these things to the king. "The Jews often speak of themselves in the third person, out of respect. (Le Clerc.) (Calmet)
