Die. Hebrew literally, "If I live, thou shalt not show me.and if I die, (15) thou shalt not "It seems there is a negation too much. Jonathan requests that David would show mercy to him and to his family; or he is willing that neither should partake of his kindness, if he prove a traitor to his friend. (Calmet) 
Protestants, "And thou shalt not only, while yet I live, show me the kindness of the Lord, that I die not: (15) But also thou shalt not cut off thy kindness from my house for ever, no not when the Lord hath cut off "(Haydock)
