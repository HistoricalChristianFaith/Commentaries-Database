Money. Avarice is like a dropsy, (Calmet) or poison, infecting all the person. (Sallust.) 
The miser is the slave, and not the possessor, of his riches, (St. Chrysostom) like Tantalus, who could not drink, though in the midst of waters. (Horace, i. Sat. 1.) 
Nescis quo valeat nummus, quem pr√¶beat usum.
