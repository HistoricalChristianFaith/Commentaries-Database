Confirmed. Gabriel assisted Michael to comply with God's orders, chap. x. 21. (Calmet) 
The angel continues his speech, and informs us that he had prayed for Darius after the fall of Babylon, seeing that he was well inclined towards the Jews, as his successor Cyrus (who liberated them) was also. (Worthington) Ver. 2. Three Cambyses, Smerdis magus, and Darius the son of Hystaspes. (Challoner; Worthington) 
Cyrus had been mentioned before, chap. x. 13, 20. Smerdis, or Artaxerxes, (1 Esdras iv. 7.) was the chief of the seven magi, and usurped the throne for six months after the death of Cambyses. (Calmet) 
He had been declared king before (Haydock) by Patizites, his own brother. The news excited the fury of Cambyses, who mounting on horseback gave himself a mortal wound in the thigh. (Herod. iii. 21.) See Ezechiel xxxviii. 21. (Haydock) 
Fourth: Xerxes. (Challoner) 
He invaded Greece with an immense army, forcing those on the road to join him. (Just. i. 10.; Herod. vii. and viii.; Calmet) Ver. 3. A strong king: Alexander. (Challoner) 
The sequel clearly points him out. Before fifteen years had elapsed, his mother, brother, and children were slain. Arideus, his brother, was declared regent till it should be seen what Roxana should bring forth. After the death of those who might be heirs of Alexander, four generals took the title of kings. Others governed in different places, but were destroyed by degrees. Ver. 4. These four; Ptolemy, Seleucus, Antigonus, and Antipater, kings of Egypt, Syria, Asia, and Greece, chap. vii. 6., and viii. 22. Besides the other generals, (Calmet) foreigners began to erect new kingdoms in what had formed the empire of Alexander. (St. Jerome; Livy xlv.; Calmet)
