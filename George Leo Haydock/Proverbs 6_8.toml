Harvest. The economy and diligence of this little republic is admirable. (Pliny, xxx. 11.) 
Some copies of the Septuagint add with St. Ambrose, (Hex. v. 1.; Calmet) "or go to the bee, and behold what a worker it is, and how beautiful is its work; whose labours kings and private people use for health. But it is desirable and glorious to all; and though it be weak in strength, by the love of wisdom it has got forward "(Haydock) in esteem. (Calmet) 
Nature has given the form of a monarchy in bees, and of a democracy in the regulations of the ant. (Tournemine)
