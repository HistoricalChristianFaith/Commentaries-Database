No son. The sons mentioned above, chap. xiv. 27, were dead when this pillar was erected; unless we suppose he raised this pillar before they were born: (Challoner) or meant this pillar to perpetuate his memory, when they should be no more. (Josephus, vii. 9.) 
This author says that it was a pillar of marble; so that it is different from that which Doubdan (15) mentions, observing , that all who pass throw a stone at it. Thus was his vanity chastised! 
Hand, work. So Martial (viii. 51.) says of a vial! Mentoris h√¶c manus est an, Polyclete, tua? (Menochius) 
The same word is translated, triumphal arch, 1 Kings xv. 12. (G.)
