These quails came from the banks of the southern ocean, or from the Red Sea, as the Israelites were still in Arabia, when they were furnished with them a second time, (Numbers xi. 31.) for a whole month, (Calmet) though there were about three million people. (Berthier) 
God changed the wind, so as to bring them into the camp, Exodus xvi. (Worthington) 
It was before blowing from the south-east. (Menochius)
