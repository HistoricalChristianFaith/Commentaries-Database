Hard. The Hebrew term is referred by some to the priests, "from the station of the priests, prepared, or standing firm "(chap. iii. 17,) by others to the stones, which were to be prepared, hard, or exactly twelve. (Calmet) 
The Septuagint have taken it in the latter sense, "twelve stones ready "or such as they might easily find, in the place where the priests had stood. They were of a flinty nature, (Haydock) that they might perpetuate the memory of this event. (Menochius)
