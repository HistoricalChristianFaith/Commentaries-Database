Thy own. Septuagint, "I will disguise myself, and go into the battle; and do thou put on my garment. "Hence the Syrians mistook Josaphat for Achab, (ver. 32.; Calmet) as "it had been agreed between them, that he should wear the robes of Achab, to elude more easily the prediction of Micheas. "(Josephus, viii. 15.) 
Vain and impious attempt! Providence found him out, though unadorned. (Haydock) 
Achab might pretend thus to honour the king of Juda! (Menochius) and perhaps he had been apprized of the order given to the Syrians, to single him out, ver. 31. What could prompt such an order, cannot be easily ascertained. Benadad might wish to revenge himself, for being brought out as a prisoner to Achab; or he might be informed of the prediction of Micheas.
