Month. The Rabbins pretend that the king intercalated the second Adar, contrary to the rule and advice of the wise, and the that he ought to have allowed those who were pure to celebrate the feast in due time. (Selden, Syn. ii. 1.) 
But the Caraite Jews deny this pretended leap-year; and we see that Ezechias acted according to the advice of the princes, and that the Scripture praises his conduct. (Calmet) 
Those who had a lawful impediment, were authorized to put off the feast till the second month, Numbers ix. 10. The nation was under this predicament, as they had not priests at hand, (Tirinus) nor were they assembled. (Du Hamel)
