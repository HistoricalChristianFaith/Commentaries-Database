Christ, who was incapable of sinning, did not revile Ver. 23. Judicanti se injustè. In the present Greek we read dikaios, justè, as also some Latin Fathers read. St. Augustine, (tract. 21. in Joan.) Commend bat autem judicanti justè; and so the sense is, that he commanded and committed his cause to God, the just judge of all.
