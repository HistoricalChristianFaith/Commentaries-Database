Happy, thrice happy the pastor, whose life, labours, zeal, and the testimony of his own conscience, embolden him to say with St. Paul, that he loves the flock of Jesus Christ, that he only loves them for Jesus Christ, and in Jesus Christ, by virtue of the Holy Spirit. _ , Epist. ad Marcellam. tom. ii. p. 706, and de no minibus Hebraicis. tom. iv. p. 78.
