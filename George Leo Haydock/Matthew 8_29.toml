Before the time which God has marked to drive us from the world, and to bury us for ever in the prison of hell. (Bible de Vence) 
What have we to do with thee? Or what hast thou to do with us? what harm have we done thee? Art thou come hither to torment us before the time? That is, before the time and day of judgment, after which the torments and punishments of the devils will be increased. (Witham)
