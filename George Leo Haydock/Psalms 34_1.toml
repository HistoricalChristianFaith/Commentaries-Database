Achimelech. So Clement VIII corrects what Sixtus V had printed Abimelech, conformably to the Hebrew Some editors have since preferred the latter word, (Calmet) which is retained in Berthier and Calmet, though we should think such changes improper, unless they were made by proper authority. (Haydock) 
Many of the ancients suppose that Achimelech (who is also styled Abimelech, the high priest at Nobe) is here meant, from whom David concealed his real design. (Eusebius; St. Athanasius; St. Jerome) 
Others rather think that the psalm was composed after David had escaped the great danger at the court of Achis, by counterfeiting madness, 1 Kings xxi. 13. (St. Augustine; Muis) 
Achis alone is styled king among the Satraps. Those who ruled over the Philistines, generally bore the title of Abimelech, as the Egyptian monarchs had that of Pharao. (Berthier) (Genesis xxi. 22.) (Calmet) (Worthington) 
This psalm is alphabetical. The last verse beginning with p, is supernumerary, and may belong to the next psalm. See Psalm xxiv. (Calmet) 
There seems also to be something wanting in ver. 6., (Houbigant) unless e and v have each only one hemistic. (Haydock) 
From the change of names, and of David's countenance, St. Augustine gathers the vocation of the Gentiles, the real presence (Worthington) See 1 Kings xxi. (Haydock) Ver. 2. Mouth. The just praise God in adversity, as well as in prosperity. (Worthington) 
David had lately been delivered in a wonderful manner. (Calmet)
