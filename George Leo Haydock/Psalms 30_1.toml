Dedication, when David sung after he had (Haydock) built a magnificent palace, 2 Kings v. (Worthington) 
David's, led avid, or "to David "which some rather join with Psalm, (Muis) and explain the house of the tabernacle or temple; though it seems more probably to relate to the altar, which David erected, after the pestilence (Calmet) had destroyed 70,000, 2 Kings xxiv. 25. There seems to be nothing respecting a dedication in the psalm; whence we may conjecture that the title is not very authentic. The Greeks (Berthier) prefixed "unto the end "in the Roman Septuagint, but not Grabe's (Haydock) 
The Rabbins inform us that this psalm was used when people brought their first fruits to the temple, and that it will be sung at the dedication of the temple, which the expect the Messias will erect. (Selden, Syn. iii. 13.) 
The Fathers explain it of Christ's resurrection. (Calmet) 
It may be put in the mouth of a just man leaving this world. (Berthier) 
the title of Psalm, most properly belongs to those which were played upon instruments; as a canticle refers to vocal music. When the instrument preceded, it was called A psalm of a canticle; as a canticle of a psalm intimated that man gave out the psalm, and instruments followed. (Worthington) 
These distinctions are given by St. Chrysostom (Menochius)

Though God can receive no increase of glory, we must show our gratitude. (Worthington) 
Me. Thou hast not suffered my people to be wholly destroyed, nor myself to perish in consequence of my vain curiosity. (Calmet)
