Gad, being girded It seems to allude to the tribe of Gad; when, after they had received for their lot the land of Galaad, they marched in arms before the rest of the Israelites, to the conquest of the land of Chanaan: from whence they afterwards returned loaded with spoils. See Josue i. and xxii. (Challoner) 
He alludes continually to the name of Gad, which signifies one "girded, or a troop."(Calmet)
