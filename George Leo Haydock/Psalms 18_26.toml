Perverted. No version can properly express this idea. God turns away from those who abandon him, treating every one according to his works. If we do not advance in piety, it is a sign that God perceives something amiss in us. (Berthier) 
He cannot but abhor duplicity, and resist the wicked, Leviticus xxvi. 23, 40., and Proverbs iii. 34. He will make the craft of men turn against themselves, as he evinced in the case of Laban, Joseph's brethren, Pharao, and Saul. Sinners complain of him without reason, Ezechiel xviii. 25. (Calmet) 
Some improperly use this text to show, that people will adopt the manners of those with whom they associate, (Haydock) though it means that God will treat the good liberally, and the wicked with severity, Leviticus xxvi. 23, 24. (Amama)
