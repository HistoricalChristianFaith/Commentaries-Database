Months. Hebrew, "days and four months. "The former expression denotes a year; though some would have it, that David remained "four months and a few days "in the country. He probably continued so many months at Geth, (ver. 9, 11,) and about a year at Siceleg. (Calmet) 
Septuagint have "days, four months "and Salien adopts that term. (Haydock) See chap. xxix. 3. (Du Hamel)
