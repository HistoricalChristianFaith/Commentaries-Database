Place. God having waited patiently a long time, at last displays the effects of his indignation, with a sort of contempt, Proverbs i. 26., and Ezechiel v. 13. (Calmet) (Psalm ii. 4.) (Menochius) (Pineda) 
Every passenger who shall witness his fall, and his now abandoned place, shall also testify his approbation. (Haydock)
