Christ here answers the apostles, by informing them that he should not always be with them, but would shortly leave them, as to his corporal presence, though he spiritually will remain with them, and their successors, to the end of time. (Matthew xxviii.) 
Behold I am He will not always be with them, so as to want their services. (Ven. Bede)
