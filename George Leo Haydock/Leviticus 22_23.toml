Ear. Cut. Hebrew saruang, which is translated a crooked nose, chap. xxi. 18. The Septuagint and Syriac agree here with the Vulgate: but the moderns generally adopt the interpretation of the Rabbins, who say the word is applied to those animals whose double members, feet, ears, are disproportionately long; as kolut, means too short. (Bo chart) (Calmet) 
Voluntarily, for the use of the priests, but not for any sacrifice, ver. 21. (Du Hamel)
