King. Hebrew, Malcam, "their king. "Moloc, "king "or the chief idol of the Ammonites. It was forbidden to use the ornaments of the idols on Chanaan, but not of other nations. This crown might be worth a talent, on account of the gold and precious stones; (1 Paralipomenon xx. 2.; Sanchez; Bo chart,) or it might weigh so much as almost 87 pounds, (Calmet) or above 113 pounds English. (Haydock) 
Such immence crowns were sometimes suspended for ornament, over the throne; as Benjamin of Tudela says was done by the emperor Commenes. Pliny describes one of nine pounds; and Athen√¶us (v. 8,) another of 80 cubits, or 40 yards (Haydock) in circumference. (Calmet) 
The idol, or the king of Ammon, (Menochius) might have one of the like nature, suspended. The Rabbins say David caused it to hand in the air by means of a load-stone; as if it would attract gold! (Calmet)
