Meroz. Where this land of Meroz was, which is here laid under a curse, we cannot find: nor is there mention of it any where else in holy writ. In the spiritual sense, they are cursed who refuse to assist the people of God in their warfare against their spiritual enemies. (Challoner) 
Eusebius seems to have thought that Merom, a body of water, and the village of Meroz (Haydock) were the same place, 12 miles from Sebaste. The inhabitants were surely under an obligation of assisting their brethren; and these, it appears, lived in the vicinity, and neglected their duty. Septuagint Alexandrian reads Mazor. Some stars are styled Mazzaroth, Job xxxviii. 32. 
Angel, Michael; or the high priest, or Barac, Debbora See chap. ii. 1. (Calmet) 
Protestants, "Curse ye Meroz, (said the angel of the Lord) curse ye bitterly the inhabitants thereof. "
To help. Protestants, "to the help of the Lord against the mighty. "Septuagint, "our helper is the Lord in the mighty warriors. "He assists their endeavours, which would otherwise prove unsuccessful. (Haydock) 
The Jews thin that Barac cursed Meroz, the star or the angel of the Chanaanites, who protected Sisara. (Chaldean) See Serarius, q. 15. Others say that he was an ally of that general, who was excommunicated by Barac, at the sound of 400 trumpets. But these opinions only deserve contempt. (Calmet)
