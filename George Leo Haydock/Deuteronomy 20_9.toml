Man. Hebrew and Septuagint, "when the officers have made an end of speaking to the people, they shall appoint captains of the armies to lead forth the people. "(Haydock) 
It seems rather late to have this to do, when the battle was ready to commence, unless perhaps the whole was arranged in a general assembly, when no one was at the head of the people, (Calmet) as was sometimes the case in the days of the judges. (Haydock) 
Hebrew of the Massorets implies, "The princes of the army shall make a review (or take down the numbers) at the head of the people."
