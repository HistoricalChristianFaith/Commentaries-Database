This is the second time the saint wishes to adore the Angel, but not with the supreme worship of latria, as he knew the object of his worship was only an Angel, and of course a mere creature; but the Angel, through respect for St. John, still refuses the proffered honour, (see Chap. xix. 10.) and to show the holy society that was hereafter to exist between Angels and men, who were to compose but one and the same family. (Bible de Vence)
