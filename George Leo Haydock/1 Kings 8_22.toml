Heaven, falling on his knees, ver. 54., and 2 Paralipomenon vi. 13. This is the first instance we find of people praying on their knees, which was common afterwards, 1 Esdras ix. 5., Isaias xlv. 24., Daniel vi. 10., and Acts ix. 40., and xx. 36. The Christian church generally adopts this custom. So did the pagans, (Et genibus pronus, supplex, similisque roganti.; Met am. iii.) as they also stretched for their hands. Sustulit exutas vinclis ad sidera palmas, says Virgil. (Ã†neid ii. 153.) This practice was very general, Psalm xxvii. 2., and 1 Timothy ii. 8.
