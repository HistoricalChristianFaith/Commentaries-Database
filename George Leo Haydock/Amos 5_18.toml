The day. Some imprudently laughed at the prophets, Isaias v. 19., and Jeremias xvii. 15. Others wished for the coming of the Lord, not reflecting that he would punish their guilt. (Calmet) 
Thus many, through impatience, desire to die. We must rather repent, and leave our lives at God's disposal. (St. Jerome)
