A gradual canticle. The following psalms, in number fifteen, are called gradual psalms or canticles, from the word gradus, signifying steps, ascensions, or degrees; either because they were appointed to be sung on the fifteen steps, by which the people ascended to the temple; or that in the singing of them the voice was to be raised by certain steps or ascensions: or that they were to be sung by the people returning from their captivity, and ascending to Jerusalem, which was seated amongst mountains. The holy Fathers, in a mystical sense, understand these steps, or ascensions, of the degrees by which Christians spiritually ascend to virtue and perfection; and to the true temple of God in the heavenly Jerusalem. (Challoner) 
Both these last interpretations seem more plausible and literal, as given by St. Chrysostom (Berthier) 
The allusion to the steps of the temple (Ezechiel xl.) is very uncertain, as well as the raising of the voice in higher notes during each psalm. (Calmet) 
They might be sung on a pulpit, 2 Esdras ix. 4., and 2 Paralipomenon xx. 19. (Menochius) 
The authors seem to have lived at the close of the captivity, (Calmet) though David might well compose these canticles during some of his trials, or foreseeing this event. (Berthier) 
They contain a consoling assurance of mankind's redemption, prefigured by the liberation of the Jews, and also that the power and fury of persecutors shall cease. (Worthington) 
Shir, hamahaloth, may denote a very excellent canticle. (Junius) (Muis) (Haydock) 
Trouble. No time is more proper for prayer. (St. Chrysostom) (Calmet) 
Heard. I am encouraged by past experience to hope for redress. (Worthington)
