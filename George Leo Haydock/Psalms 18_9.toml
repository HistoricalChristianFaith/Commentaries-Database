Feet. A violent storm of rain. Hence the Pagans borrowed: Jupiter et l√¶to descendit plurimus imbri. (Virgil, Ec. 7.) 
The prophets Isaias (xxix. 6.) and Nahum (i. 3.) speak in the same lofty strains; (Calmet) and shall any one despise the language of Scripture? Nothing can exceed its sublimity. Hebrew is rather more expressive, (ver. 9.) "a fire devoured "(ver. 11.) "on a cherub, and flew; he flew most swiftly "like an eagle. (Berthier) 
Hebrew vida. (Haydock)
