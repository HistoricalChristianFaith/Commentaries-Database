Leprosy. Do nothing which may expose you to the danger of being infected, and if you have the misfortune to contract it, obey the directions of the priests. (Calmet) 
It seems from this and the following verse that God frequently punished disobedience to his ministers, as he did Mary , (Numbers xii.,) by inflicting upon them this shameful disorder. (Haydock) 
So he punished king Ozias, 2 Paralipomenon xxvi. (Menochius) 
The design of this precept is, therefore, not so much to order people not to contract a disease, which they cannot perhaps always avoid, as to caution them against pride and rebellion. (Haydock)
