After having compared his second coming to lightning, in order to show how sudden it will be, he next compares it to the days of Noe and Lot, to show that it will come when men least expect it; when, entirely forgetting his coming, they are solely occupied in the affairs of this world, in buying and selling He only mentions those faults which appear trivial, or rather none at all, (passing over the crimes of murder, theft) purposely to shew, that if God thus punishes merely the immoderate use of what is lawful, how will his vengeance fall upon what is in itself unlawful. (Ven. Bede)
