And there abide That is, stay in the same house as long as you remain in the same city; remove not from house to house, as it is said Luke x. 7, but be content with what you meet with. (Witham) 
St. Chrysostom gives three reasons for this precept: 1st. that they might not afflict those whom they left; 2ndly. that the apostles might avoid the accusation of inconstancy; 3rdly. of gluttony also. (Baradicet.) Into whatsoever Lest the apostles should be induced to think, by what our Saviour had said in the preceding verse, viz. the workman is worthy that every door would be open for their entrance, he here tells them to inquire at their entry into any city, who amongst the inhabitants were worthy. (St. Chrysostom, hom. xxxiii.) 
And since they could not be expected to know who in every city were worthy, they were to be informed of this by the report and opinion of the people, that so their dignity and great character of apostles might not be defamed by the bad characters of any who might receive them. (St. Jerome, in St. Thomas Aquinas) 
But, if such was the rule given by Christ to the apostles, some one will perhaps ask, why did not Christ also follow the same maxim, since we read in Scripture, he entered into the house of Zacheus, the publican? St. Chrysostom answers, Zacheus was made worthy by his conversion to Christ. (St. Chrysostom, in St. Thomas Aquinas)
