He hath denied the faith, (not in words, but in his actions) and is worse than an infidel; nay, even than brutes, that take care of their young ones. (Witham) 
Faith may be renounced either by words or by actions, when our conduct shows that in our hearts we really do not believe what would otherwise influence our lives. (Calmet) 
We have a horror of the name of apostacy, and fear not its works. Is not this to be a Christian in appearance, and an infidel in heart?
