Sanctifieth. The altar is sanctified by our Lord's body thereon. Theophylactus, the close follower of St. Chrysostom, writeth thus upon this text: "In the old law, Christ will not allow the gift to be greater than the altar; but with us the altar is sanctified by the gift: for the bread, by the divine grace is converted into our Lord's body, and therefore the altar is sanctified by it."
