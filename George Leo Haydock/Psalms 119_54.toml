Song. Here on earth I am comforted with singing the praises of thy law, which makes the observers just. (Worthington) 
The captives would not give holy things to dogs: but, among themselves, they sung canticles, Psalm cxxxvi. (Calmet) (Colossians iii. 16., 1 Paralipomenon xxix. 15., and Hebrews xi. 16.) 
These pious exercises were opposed to the scandalous discourses of sinners. (Berthier)
