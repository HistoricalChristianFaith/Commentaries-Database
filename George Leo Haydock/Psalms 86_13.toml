Hell of the damned, (Worthington) according to the Fathers: or out of captivity and dangers. (Berthier) 
If it be understood of Christ, it must refer to limbo. (Bellarmine) (Menochius) 
It seems equivalent to the lower pit, Psalm lxxxvii. 7. (Haydock) 
The Jews admit seven regions in hell, (Genebrard) and our theologians four: 1. Of the damned; 2. of unbaptized infants; 3. of purgatory; and 4. of the saints in Abraham's bosom. St. Augustine mentions the first and last here: but he speaks clearly of purgatory in other places. (De Gen. contra Manch. ii. 17. in Psalm vi.) (Calmet) 
David was rescued from the most imminent dangers, and Christ came out of limbo, (Psalm xv. 10.; Du Hamel) by his own power. (Haydock)
