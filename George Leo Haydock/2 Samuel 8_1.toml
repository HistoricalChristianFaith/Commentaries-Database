Tribute. Aquila, and probably St. Jerome, translated, "cubit. "Others suppose that Amma, or Meteg-ama, is some unknown place, which David wrested from the hands of the Philistines. It is hardly probable that the Israelites would have paid the latter tribute till the 20th year of his reign, (Calmet) or even till the 12th. (Salien) 
He might now force them to pay tribute. (St. Jerome) (Haydock) 
Perhaps a letter may have been transposed, and instead of Meteg, we should read, "Geth, the mother "or metropolis, and its dependencies; (1 Paralipomenon xviii. 1.) or "he took Metec, (Numbers xxxiii. 28.) and its mother "Geth, which reconciles the two passages. Chaldean, "he deprived them of the advantage of the rivulet. "Septuagint, "David took the separated "place, (Serarius) or the city of Geth. (Menochius)
