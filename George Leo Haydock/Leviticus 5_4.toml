Lips. This is necessary before he can be punished by men; but every secret promise binds before God. (To stat)

Thus parents sometimes foolishly swear that they will chastise their children unmercifully; libertines that they will live in luxuries as long as they have any money; ill-natured people that they will never speak to such a one, that they will murder To execute such promises, even confirmed by an oath, would be a double crime. Let them ask pardon of God for their rash oath. (Philo)

As such hasty oaths are easily forgotten, when the guilty person recollected himself, he was bound to confess his fault to the priest in the following manner, according to the Rabbins: Placing his hands between the horns of his victim, he shall say, "I beseech you, Lord, I have sinned; I have committed iniquity and prevarication; I have committed such a fault. I repent, I am filled with sorrow and confusion for having done so; I will relapse no more. "These doctors teach, that without confession and sorrow no sacrifice will remit sin. (Calmet) 
To preserve the secret of confession, the priests were ordered to eat the victims alone. (Philo) (Tirinus)
