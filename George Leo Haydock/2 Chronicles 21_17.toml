Joachaz, alias Ochozias, (Challoner) or Azarias, in Hebrew, chap. xxii. 1., and 6. (Calmet) 
The variation of names seems to originate in the mistakes of transcribers, very frequently. If we found in some profane author, that Philip had only one son, Ander-alex, left, and that this son, Alex-ander, succeeded him, we should readily allow that the first syllables had been erroneously placed last, (Kennicott) as on this occasion aez-ieu stands for ieu-aez. Septuagint has here Ochozias; as the other versions have also Ochozias, (chap. xxii. 6.) instead of Azrieu, (Haydock) a name given to Ozias, king of Juda, when it belonged to the priests, as it here belongs to one of the captains, chap. xxiii. 1. Sometimes we find Aezie, 4 Kings ix. 16. Strange inconsistency! (Kennicott) See 4 Kings xiv. 21.
