John to the seven churches, afterwards named; and by them, to be understood of all churches, bishops, and people in the like dispositions. 
From him, who is, who was, and who is to come. As these words are only applied, and applicable to him, who is truly God and eternal, Alcazar (p. 176) applies them to God the Father. Others think them to be spoken of God, as the word God agrees to all the three divine persons, who are one and the same God. See Ribera. 
And from the seven spirits. Alcazar understands them of seven of God's attributes, or perfections, but, by the common exposition, are meant seven of the chief created spirits, who in a special manner assist at the throne of God, employed to execute God's commands, as Raphael saith, (Tobit. xii. 15.) I am one of the seven who stand before God. (Witham) 
Spirits Some understand this of the Holy Spirit, on account of his seven gifts; but the most literal interpretation is of the principal Angels, who always surround the throne of God, and are his ministering spirits. (Calmet) 
And from Jesus Christ, made man, and the Redeemer of mankind, whom St. John here names after the seven spirits, because he continues his discourse about Christ, who is the faithful witness; testified and approved of God by so many miracles, prophecies He is the chief of the martyrs or witnesses, as the Greek word signifies. 
The first begotten of the dead, both first in dignity, and first that rose to an immortal life. 
The prince of the kings of the earth, whose power is infinitely greater than all theirs; and this to put the suffering Christians in mind, that they needed not to fear the persecuting emperors, who have no power after this life. 
And Christ hath made us a kingdom, inasmuch as by his grace he has made us members of his true Church, called the kingdom of God, and promised us to reign with him in his glorious kingdom in heaven. 
And hath made us priests to God, and his Father, to offer up spiritual sacrifices. See 1 Peter ii. 9. 
To him be, or is due, glory and empire, for ever and ever. Amen. That is, to Jesus Christ. (Witham)
