O God, O Theos. The Septuagint thus mark the vocative case, (Psalm cxxxviii. 17.; Haydock) and it is clear, that the Messias is here styled God, (Hebrews i. 8.) though some of the Jews would evade this proof by saying, "God is thy throne "1 Paralipomenon xxix. 23. Even Munster translates, O Deus, and the Jew Agesila, o Thee. Elohim is never addressed to any one by the prophets, but to the true God, (Berthier) and this title alludes to the judicial character of Christ, (Acts x. 42.; Calmet) of whose kingdom there shall be no end, Luke i. 33. 
Calvin is very bold in asserting, that David spoke properly of Solomon, as if the apostle had applied the text to our Saviour only in the mystical sense; whereas many things cannot belong to the former, and the Chaldean and Fathers expound this psalm of Christ and his Church. 
Solomon did not persevere in wisdom, and his beauty was equalled by that of Absalom (Worthington) 
Crellius and Grotius in vain attempted to weaken this proof of Christ's divinity, as a Jew, who disputed with Origen, did. (Origen, contra Cels. i.) (Du Hamel) (Haydock)
