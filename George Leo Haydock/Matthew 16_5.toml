Forgotten to take bread. The disciples had just filled seven baskets with fragments, but had forgotten to take any with them into the ship; or, according to others, had distributed all among the poor. (Barrardius) 
They were so taken with the company of Christ, that they even forgot the necessities of life. (St. Anselm) 
The disciples, ever constant attendants on our Redeemer, were retained so strongly by the love of his company, that they would not be absent from him for one moment. We may also remark how far they were from an eager search after delicacies, when they even forgot the daily pittance requisite for their support. (St. Remigius) 
It was the custom of those times, and that country, for persons on a journey to carry their own bread. (Bible de Vence)
