Exalted. On the cross, or arrived at the years of manhood, (Berthier; Worthington) I have experienced the greatest contradictions. David was brought up in poverty, like our Saviour, and the exaltation of both was attended with great trials. (Berthier) 
The life of Christ was a continual martyrdom. (Menochius) 
He had all his sufferings in view from his first conception.
