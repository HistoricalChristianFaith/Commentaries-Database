Fight the good fight. Literally, strive a good strife. St. Paul oftentimes brings this comparison of men striving for a prize. 
And hast confessed a good confession before many witnesses, not only when baptized, not only when thou wast ordained a bishop, but by thy constancy and sufferings and persecutions, says St. Chrysostom, though we know not the particulars. (Witham) 
Timothy had made profession of his faith at his baptism, at his ordination, and during the whole course of a life which, through many labours and persecutions, had been dedicated entirely to promote the faith. (St. Thomas Aquinas) 
Like him let us also combat, if we aspire after the same triumph and prize.
