Sycamores, (Hebrew shikmim) which were formerly very common in Palestine, as they are still about Cairo, in Egypt. The fruit resembles figs, as the leaves do the mulberry tree; whence the name is a compound of sukon, "a fig "and moria, "a mulberry "though some would prefer moros, "a fool "to denote that the fruit is "insipid. "It is however sweeter than wild figs, and proceeds from the trunk of the tree. (Calmet)
