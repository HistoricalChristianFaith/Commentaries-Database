Saw Saul no more till the day of his death. That is, he went no more to see him: he visited him no more. (Challoner) 
He looked upon him as one who had lost the right to the kingdom, though he was suffered for a time to hold the reins of government, as a lieutenant to David. He might afterwards see Saul passing, but never to visit him, (Salien) or to consult with him about the affairs of state; (Menochius) nor perhaps did he even see him, when Saul came to Najoth, chap. xix. 19, 24. His spirit came to announce destruction to Saul, the night preceding the death of that unfortunate king, chap. xxxviii. (Haydock) 
Repented. God is said, improperly, to repent when he alters what he had appointed. (St. Ambrose de Noe, chap. iv.) (Worthington)
