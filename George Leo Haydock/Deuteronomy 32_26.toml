Men. Hebrew, "I said I will disperse or exterminate them. "Samaritan, "my fury shall consume them. "We may translate, "I had resolved to destroy them; 27. But", (Calmet) or Protestants, "I said I would scatter them into corners, and would. Were it not that I feared the wrath of the enemy "
Where are they? in the mouth of God, shows an utter destruction, so that no vestiges of them remain. Their memory is perished. (Haydock) 
God sometimes defers punishing the sinner for just reasons. (Worthington)
