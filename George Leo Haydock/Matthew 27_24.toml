Taken water. It was the custom of the ancients, when they wished to show themselves innocent of any alleged crime, to take water and wash their hands in public. (St. Remigius) 
Because the element of water naturally signifies purity. See Virgil, Æneid xi. ver. 718. Me bello è tanto digressum, et cæde recenti Attract are nefas, donec me flumine vivo Abluero.
