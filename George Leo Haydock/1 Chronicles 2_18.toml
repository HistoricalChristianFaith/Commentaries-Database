Caleb, alias Calubi, ver. 9. (Challoner) (Worthington) 
He is different from Caleb, the son of Jephone. 
Took Hebrew, "begot Azuba, Ischa, and Jerioth "or rather with the Septuagint, "took to wife Gazuba and Jerioth. "(Calmet) 
Syriac and Arabic, "Caleb had Jerioth by his wife Azuba. "We know that the latter was his wife, (ver. 19.) and this seems to be the true reading. As ath signifies "of or from "(Noldius) the Hebrew only requires a small correction. As it stands at present, it means, "Caleb begot Azuba, a woman, (or wife) and Jerioth. "Protestants supply, "begat children of Azuba, his wife, and of Jerioth. "(Kennicott) 
Her sons. The original determines us to read her, instead of "his "as ejus would as naturally be understood. If Jerioth was not the wife, she seems to have been the daughter of Caleb; as Jaser, were his sons. (Haydock)
