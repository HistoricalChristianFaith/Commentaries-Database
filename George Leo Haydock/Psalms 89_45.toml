Time. Hebrew, "youth. "(St. Jerome) (Haydock) 
Joachim was only seventeen years old when he came to the throne, which he occupied three months. (Amama) 
The four last kings of Juda reigned but a short while, and most of them came to an untimely end. Instead of chronou, the Roman Septuagint, St. Augustine, read thronou, "of his throne "or reign. (Calmet) 
The Vulgate seems more natural, as the throne of David had subsisted above 400 years, so that it was not overturned in "its youth "or commencement, though the number of ages, promised to it, seemed now to be abridged. (Berthier)
