Temple. The porch was of the same height as the temple, though we read that it wa 120 cubits high, 2 Paralipomenon iii. 4. But one word seems there to have been substituted for another, (Calmet) unless it might resemble a high tower. (Haydock) 
Before the porch were placed the two brazen pillars. The interior of it was highly adorned by Herod. (Josephus, Antiquities xv. 11.)
