Delivered up, to prison. (Berthier) 
The disciples abandoned our Saviour; St. Peter, with a curse, denied that he ever knew him, (Mark xiv. 71.; Haydock) and Judas betrayed him. It is not so easy to explain this of the captives in general, though it might refer to the psalmist. (Calmet) 
At Babylon, the Israelites were not imprisoned, but left to multiply, Jeremias xxix. 5. (Berthier)
