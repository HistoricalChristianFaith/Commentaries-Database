Time. So great shall be the abundance, that you will scarcely have time to get all the work done before you will be called off to something else. (Haydock) 
These promises would be so much the more agreeable to them, as in Egypt, they had been forced to keep in their houses two or three months together, on account of the overflowing of the Nile. In that country, as well as in Greece and Palestine, people sow both wheat and barley about October; while in other countries the latter is sown in spring. The harvest is ready in about six months, and that of wheat in seven. (Pliny, xviii. 18.; Hesiod, ep. ii.) (Calmet)
