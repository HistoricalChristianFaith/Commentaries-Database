A candlestick. This candlestick, with its seven lamps, which was always to give light in the house of God, was a figure of the light of the Holy Spirit, and his seven-fold grace, in the sanctuary of the church of Christ. (Challoner) 
It contained a talent of gold, or above 113 lb.; worth £5475 sterling, including the snuffers, (ver. 39,) and had seven branches, adorned alternately with cups, bowls, or knobs, and lilies; (Haydock) or with cups, pomegranates, and lilies. The shaft was adorned with 15, the branches with only 12 of these ornaments. All was of massive gold, mokssé. 
Bowls, sphærulas, globes, apples (Calmet) 
Thou shalt make. The Hebrew thiásse, has evidently the letter i redundant, and rejected by the best manuscripts. (Kennicott, Dis. i.) (Houbigant)
