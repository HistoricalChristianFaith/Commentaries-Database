Die. We no longer behold the genius of that David who would not hurt his persecutor. What a change does a shameful passion introduce in the whole conduct of a man! and how does one false step conduct from one abyss to another! Proprium humani in genii est odisse quem l√¶seris. (Tacitus) 
David could no longer bear the sight of a man whom he had injured so grievously. (Calmet)
