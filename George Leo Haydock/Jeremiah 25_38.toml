The dove. This is commonly understood of Nabuchodonosor, whose military standard, they say, was a dove. But the Hebrew word Jonah, which is here rendered a dove, may also signify a waster or oppressor, which name better agrees to that unmerciful prince; or by comparison, as a dove's flight is the swiftest, so would their destruction come upon them. (Challoner) 
Septuagint, "waste or impassible before the great sword, chap iv. 7. (Haydock) 
While God, like a lion, protected his people, none durst invade them. (Menochius) 
What is said respecting the Babylonian standards is very dubious, (Grotius; Calmet) as the same expression is applied to the Persians, (chap. l. 16.; Menochius) though it may there also be understood of the Chaldeans. (Haydock) 
God is like a dove, yet terrible. (Worthington)
