Let their table What here follows in the style of an imprecation, is a prophecy of the wretched state to which the Jews should be reduced, in punishment of their wilful obstinacy; (Challoner) or it may be a sentence pronounced on them by Jesus Christ. They are driven from their own country, and the sacred books (Calmet) being misunderstood, (Menochius) prove their ruin. Our Saviour and St. Paul confirm this prediction. The latter adheres to the Septuagint (Romans xi. 9.) though some would translate lishlomim, "for peace"-offerings, instead of recompenses, as it also means. (Berthier) 
"Let their sacrifices become a scandal to them "(Chaldean) or rather, May their table, the symbol of friendship, be a snare for them, that they may be destroyed, or betrayed by their dearest friends. (Calmet) 
The overthrow of the Jews, when they were assembled to eat the paschal lamb, is here foretold. (Worthington)
