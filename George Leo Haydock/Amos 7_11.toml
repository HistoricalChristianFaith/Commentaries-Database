Sword. The prophet did not say this, but that the Lord would rise up against the house of Jeroboam with the sword; which was verified when Zacharias, the son and successor of Jeroboam, was slain by the sword, 4 Kings xv. 10. (Challoner) 
The false prophet was therefore guilty of a lie. They accuse the preachers of truth as traitors. (Worthington) 
Thus many missionary priests have been traduced in England. (Haydock)
