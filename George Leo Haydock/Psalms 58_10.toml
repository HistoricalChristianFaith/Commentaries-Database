Shall wash his hands Shall applaud the justice of God, and take occasion, from the consideration of the punishment of the wicked, to wash and cleanse his hands from sin. (Challoner) 
Hands. Hebrew, "feet "(though this is not certain. Psalm lxxiii. 4.; Berthier) and all his body; the carnage shall be so great. The just approve of God's judgments, (Calmet) in or "over "epi, to testify that he has no connection with the wicked. (Theodoret) 
The just will purify himself still more at the sight of vengeance. This interpretation is good, but no so literal. (Berthier)
