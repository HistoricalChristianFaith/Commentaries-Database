God, who has already informed thee how to proceed in difficult emergencies, (chap. xvii. 8,) by having recourse to the council of priests, and will also, after any death, send in due time a succession of true prophets. Hebrew, "God hath not suffered thee "to imitate those nations; (Haydock) or those prophets, whom the Lord thy God will give thee, shall not resemble these (Calmet) soothsayers (or observers of times) and diviners. (Haydock) 
They shall be filled with my spirit. (Calmet)
