The trying of your faith worketh patience. St. Paul seems to assert the reverse: (Romans v. 3.) when he says, patience worketh a trial. They are easily reconciled. Here St. James teacheth us, that patience is occasionally obtained, and strengthened by sufferings, the meaning of St. Paul is, that patience worketh, showeth itself, and is found perfect in the sight of God by trials.
