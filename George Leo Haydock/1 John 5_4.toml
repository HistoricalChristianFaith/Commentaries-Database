This is the victory which overcometh the world, our faith. That is, a lively faith, working by charity, makes a man victorious over the greatest temptations, and over all the adversaries of his salvation. (Witham) 
Our faith; Not a bare speculative or dead faith, but a faith working by charity. (Galatians v. 6.) (Challoner)
