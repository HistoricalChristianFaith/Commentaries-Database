Deaf. The word Kophos, used by the Septuagint, means also the dumb, as these defects are generally found in the same person. Nothing can be more base, than to attack those who are unable to defend themselves. Solon forbids anyone "to speak ill of the dead "though he may receive an injury from his children. Those who undermine and ruin the reputation of the absent, are no less to be condemned.
