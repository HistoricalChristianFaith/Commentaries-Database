Altar, not that on which the ark was placed, (chap. vi. 20.; Calmet) though some are of that opinion; (Menochius) but perhaps the altar of incense. The one which Moses had made was probably too small, (Calmet) and reposited in the treasury. (Rabbins) 
Table. In 1 Paralipomenon iv. 8., we find ten specified, one between each candlestick, in the holy place. Josephus ( viii. 2.) mentions an incredible number of gold and silver utensils, which are not found in Scripture; and the Rabbins are not sparing in miracles, to promote a respect for the temple. No venomous creature, they say, was ever seen in Jerusalem; nor did man seek for lodgings in vain The priests were so numerous, that the same person had never to offer the perpetual sacrifice or incense twice in his life. No one durst spit in the temple, nor turn his back on the altar (Calmet)
