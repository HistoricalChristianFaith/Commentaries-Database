But God.hath raised us up together, both Gentiles and Jews, to life in Christ, remitting our sins by faith in him, and by the grace of our merciful Redeemer, by his pure mercy, not by any works of ours, nor merely by the works of the former law. 
Hath made us in a condition to sit together in heavenly places, to be hereafter crowned in heaven. (Witham)
