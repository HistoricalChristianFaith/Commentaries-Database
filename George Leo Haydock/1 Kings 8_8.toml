Out. In the days of Moses, these staves had touched the veil of the tabernacle: but now, as the place for the ark was twice as large, they were no longer perceived; though they remained in the holes prepared for them by Moses, till the author wrote; which must have been before the captivity. Unless we thus distinguish the times, the Hebrew contains a palpable contradiction. (Calmet) 
"They drew out (or lengthened) the staves, and the heads. Were seen out in the holy place. And they were not seen out. "(Haydock) 
To a person standing at a small distance, they were not visible, though they rather touched the veil, 2 Paralipomenon v. 9. (Menochius)
