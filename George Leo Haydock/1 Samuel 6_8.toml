Box. Hebrew argaz, (which the Septuagint retain; Haydock) means also "a purse or basket. "(Calmet) 
Josephus ( vi. 1,) says, "the box was placed upon the ark. "(Haydock) 
We do not read what became of these presents afterwards: but it is supposed that they were kept in the sanctuary till the time of the captivity. (Calmet)
