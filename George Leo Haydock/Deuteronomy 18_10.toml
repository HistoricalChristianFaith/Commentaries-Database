Fire. This impiety is not punished with death, (Leviticus xviii. 21,) as the burning of children was, Leviticus xx. 2. (Grotius) 
It was done in imitation of the latter, and became more common, as it was less cruel; the person who was thus expiated, being to pass between or to jump over fire. The council of Trullo (canon 65,) was forced to condemn this remnant of an abominable superstition. But the other inhuman worship of Moloc, and of other pagan divinities, was certainly very common, and chiefly brought down destruction upon the people of Chanaan. See Jeremias xix. 5., Ezechiel xxiii. 37., Psalm cv. 37., and 4 Kings xvii. 31. Ennius says, PÃ¦ni sunt soliti suos sacrificare puellos. See St. Augustine, City of God vii. 17.; St. Jerome in Jeremias vii. 31. (Calmet) 
Soothsayers. The original term may also signify, "that useth divination. "Both those who set up for diviners, and those who consult them, are condemned. (Haydock) 
Hiscuni explains it of a superstitious practice, by which a person measured a stick with his finger, saying first I will go; and then I will not; and if, when he came to the end of the stick, he had to say I will go, he determined to begin his journey. See Ezechial xxi. 21. 
Dreams. Hebrew mehonen, (Leviticus xix. 26,) may denote one who judges from the sight of the clouds, or feigns revelations. 
Wizard. Hebrew, "witch. "Septuagint, "poisoner "or one who gives things to do harm. (Rabbins)
