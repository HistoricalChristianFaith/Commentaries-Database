Scarlet twice dyed. Aquila and Symmachus have transparent. This colour is often confounded with purple, as our Saviour's robe is styled scarlet by St. Matthew xxvii. 28, and purple by St. John xix. 2. It was dyed with a worm called shani in Hebrew. (St. Jerome, ep. ad Fabiol.) 
Fine linen, byssus. Hebrew sh√©sh, "of six folds "or it may mean cotton, which was highly esteemed by the ancients; (Arabic version; Herodotus) and it is not probable that Moses would have passed over it unnoticed. (Calmet)
