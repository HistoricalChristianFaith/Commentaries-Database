Little hill of Sion. I hope that I shall soon again behold the fertile regions along the Jordan. (Calmet) 
But these hills of Hermon, are nothing when compared with heaven: They serve only to remind us of our banishment. (Berthier) 
The difficulties of our present abode, hemmed in on all sides, teach us to place our hopes in heaven. (Worthington)
