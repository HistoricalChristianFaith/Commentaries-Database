Sin. This is the common effect of evil example in kings. Plus exemplo qu√†m peccato no cent. (Cicero, Leg. iii.) "As it is esteemed a sort of service to imitate the customs and vices of the king; they laid aside all piety, lest they might seem to upbraid the king with his impiety, if they should live in a virtuous manner. "(Lactantius v. 6.) The crimes of kings are seldom confined to their own persons. (Calmet)
