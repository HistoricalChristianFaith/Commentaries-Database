Remnants. Many of the Israelites had been slain by Jabin, but the Lord enabled the valiant Barac to requite him. Hebrew, "Then he made him that remaineth have dominion over the nobles among the people. The Lord made me rule over the mighty. "Barac and Debbora were raised from an humble state to govern Israel; while the nobles were passed over. (Haydock) 
The people of God, which was reduced to such abjection and misery, is now become formidable to the greatest princes, who look upon themselves as something great, and are called beneficent, Luke xxii. 25. Septuagint, "Then his (Barac's) force was magnified: Lord, humble before me those who exceed me in strength. "Chaldean, "Then one of the army of Israel (Barac) crushed the power of these mighty nations "(Calmet)
