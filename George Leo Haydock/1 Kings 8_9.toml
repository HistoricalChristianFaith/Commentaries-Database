Nothing else There was nothing else but the tables of the law within the ark. But on the outside of the ark, or near the ark, were also the rod of Aaron, and a golden urn with manna, Hebrews ix. 4. (Challoner) (Worthington) 
These might have been in the ark while it was not fixed: but after the temple was built, all but the tables were placed in the treasury; where, we find, the book of the law was discovered, under Joas, Deuteronomy xxxi. 26., and 2 Paralipomenon xxxiv. 14. Others think that, in the days of St. Paul, the rod, might have been reposited in the ark, though they had not been admitted at the time when this book was written. (Bellarmine) 
But we have no assurance that the ark was ever placed in the second temple; and Josephus informs us, that when the Romans destroyed the temple, "there was nothing at all "in the sanctuary. (Calmet) 
In area might easily signify ad, or juxta arc am, "near the ark. "(Salien)
