Alleluia. This word is found at the end of the last psalm, in Hebrew. (Haydock) 
The captives invite all to thank God for their delivery, which was a most striking figure of the world's redemption, in which sense the apostle (Romans xv. 11.) quotes this psalm, with the holy Fathers, though Ven. Bede puts it in the mouth of Ezechias, after the retro gradation of the sun. Kimchi allows that it regards the times of the Messias. (Calmet) 
Praise him. St. Paul reads, magnify him, as the Hebrew means, "extol "by your praises. (Berthier) 
All are invited to praise, as the redemption is sufficient, (Worthington) and designed for all the posterity of Adam.
