The people use honey almost in every sauce and in every repast. Virgin assures us, that "bees dwell in holes under ground, in hollow stones, and trees. "(Georg. iv.) The Scripture frequently mentions honey flowing, Exodus ii. 8., Psalm lxx. 17., and Job xx. 17. Mella fluant illi, feratrubus asper amomum. (Virgil, Ec. iii.) Sanctius says, that in Spain, streams of honey may be seen on the ground; and Maldonet observes, that the countrymen get a livelihood by gathering it from the trees in Betica, or Andalusia.
