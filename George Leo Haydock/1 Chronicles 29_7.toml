Solids. Septuagint, "pieces of gold "chrusous. Hebrew adarcnim, which Protestants render "drachms "(Haydock) after the Syriac Others think that the Darics, used in Persia, are meant, though they did not exist in David's time. Esdras might reduce the money to correspond with the coin with which his countrymen were then acquainted, 2 Esdras vii. 70. (Pelletier) 
The Daric was equivalent to the golden sicle, which was only half the weight of one of silver, though this is not certain. (Calmet) 
A solid was only the sixth part of an ounce, whereas the sicle weighed half an ounce, or four drachms. 
Talents were always of the same weight, 125 Roman pounds. (Menochius)
