Understood that it was Samuel. It is the more common opinion of the holy fathers, and interpreters, that the soul of Samuel appeared indeed; and not, as some have imagined, an evil spirit in his shape. Not that the power of her magic could bring him thither, but that God was pleased for the punishment of Saul, that Samuel himself should denounce unto him the evils that were falling upon him. See Ecclesiasticus xlvi. 23. (Challoner) 
The passage is decisive; (Tirinus) he slept and he made known to the king, and showed him the end of his life, and he lifted up his voice from the earth, in prophecy Those who have called in question the reality of Samuel's apparition, seem not to have remembered this passage. (Haydock) 
Yet his soul was not united to his body, (Salien) nor was he adduced by the power of the devil, but (Du Hamel) by a just judgment of God, to denounce destruction to the wicked king. (St. Augustine) (Tirinus) 
The woman, beholding Samuel, fled out of the place, to Saul's companions, and left him alone with the king, ver. 21. 
Adored Samuel with an inferior honour, as the friend of God, exalted in glory. (Salien) 
That Samuel really appeared, is the more common opinion of the fathers. (St. Augustine, Cura. xv.) (Worthington)
