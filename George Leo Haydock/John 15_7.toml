On account of our being in this world, we sometimes ask for that, which is not expedient for us. But these things will not be granted us, if we remain in Christ, who never grants us any thing, unless it be profitable to us. (St. Augustine, tract. 81. in Joan.) 
If we abide in Christ, by a lively faith, and his words abide in us by a lively, ardent charity, which can make us produce the fruits of good works, all that we ask, will be granted us. (Bible de Vence) 
These conditional expressions, if you remain in the vine, if you keep my commandments give us to understand, that our perseverance and salvation are upon conditions, to be fulfilled by us. 
(St. Augustine, de cor.gra. chap. 13.)
