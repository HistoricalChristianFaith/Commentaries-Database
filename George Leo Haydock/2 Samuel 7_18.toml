Lord. "More in soul, than by this posture of the body, remaining quiet in meditation and prayer. "(Cajetan) 
Vatable says only kings were allowed to pray sitting, (Sa; Menochius) and they must be of the house of Juda. (Maimonides) 
They say the priests always stood in the temple. But Josephus mentions seats of lead for them. (Jewish Wars vii. 11.) The Hebrew expression may denote no more, than that David continued for a long time in fervent prayer; Josephus says, prostrate on the ground before the ark. It is not so much the posture of the body as the fervour of the soul, which God regards. See St. Augustine, ad Simp. ii. q. 4.) Pythagoras ordered his disciples to pray sitting; and Homer represents Thetis in that attitude. (Calmet) 
Far, in power and glory. (Haydock)
