Alleluia, in Hebrew, is at the end of the last psalm. (Haydock) 
It is omitted entirely in St. Augustine Origen thinks that the captives sung this psalm at their return, as it greatly resembles the 106th, 134th (Calmet) 
We read, (2 Paralipomenon vii. 6.) the priests stood in their offices, and the Levites, with the instruments of music of the Lord, which king David made to praise the Lord, "because his mercy endureth for ever "This chorus is found only in this psalm, which seems therefore to have been sung at the dedication of the temple. (Berthier) 
The first part of the verse was sung by the priests, or cantors, (Haydock) and the second was repeated perhaps by the people, (Calmet) or by other musicians, as we now answer at the litanies, and often repeat the Rosary, Glory, (Worthington) which surely may be done without any superstition, though Leigh, in his Battologeo, and Casaubon (Exer. 14.) be pleased to ridicule the Jesus psalter, on this account. 
Praise. Literally, "confess "(Haydock) your sins, and praise God. (St. Hilary) 
For ever. Or is unbounded. His heart overflows at this thought. (Berthier)
