Ye young men, not only younger in age, but employed in offices inferior to those of the bishops and priests, be subject to the ancients. But even all of you by your carriage insinuate, practise, and give examples of humility one to another: for God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble. St. James (Chap. iv. 6.) repeats the same doctrine and the same words. See also James ii. 12. (Witham)
