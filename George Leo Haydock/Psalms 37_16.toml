Wicked. Hebrew, "of many wicked "or "of the impious great ones. "(Haydock) 
What the just man hath, is preferable to the immense riches of sinners, acquired by injustice. In this sense Hesiod and Psittacus said, "half is more than all. "The wicked are never satisfied, Ecclesiastes iv. 6., and Proverbs xiii. 25. Riches are a dangerous temptation, (Calmet) and the sentence is generally true, "every rich person is either unjust or the heir of one who has been such "(Haydock) aut h√¶res injusti. (St. Jerome) 
It is difficult for the rich to enter heaven; and the unjust are certainly excluded. Yet if we confined our views to this world, it is evident that the rich may better procure the sweets of life. (Berthier)
