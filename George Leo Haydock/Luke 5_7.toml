The other ship was probably at such a distance from them, that they could not be heard, had they called out to them; and this also is another proof of the greatness of the miracle, that though the other ship was fishing in the same place, though a little removed, they could catch nothing. (Maldonatus) 
This also shows that Peter was to call in other co-labourers, and that all were to come into Peter's ship. (St. Ambrose, in Luc.)
