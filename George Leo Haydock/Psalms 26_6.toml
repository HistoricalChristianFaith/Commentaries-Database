Innocent. Hebrew, "in innocence "avoiding every thing which may defile and render me unfit to approach thy holy altar. Many things (Calmet) of themselves innocent, (Haydock) excluded the priests of the old law from officiating, and if they had partaken of any idolatrous sacrifices, they lost their dignity for ever, Ezechiel xliv. 12. How much greater ought to be the sanctity of Christian priests! The Jews carefully abstained from eating what the law forbade, Daniel i. 8., and Tobias i. 12. David would not sit down to a feast with the proud, Psalm c. 5. It was customary to wash before meat (Matthew xv. 2., and Mark vii. 3.) and prayer. Aristeas informs us that the Septuagint washed their hands every morning, before they began to translate the Bible, to show what purity of soul was requisite. Pilate used the like ceremony, when he would have no hand in the condemnation of our Saviour; (Matthew xxvii. 24.; Calmet) and thus people declared their innocence, Deuteronomy xxi. 6. (Menochius) 
People entering the house of God, and priests at the altar, adopt the same symbols of interior purity, and ought to be penetrated with the like sentiments. (Haydock) 
David opposes the society of the good to that of the wicked, knowing that the former is a great inducement to virtue, and he declares that he will wash or converse with such. (Berthier) 
These words are recited by the priest, to put him in mind of the purity required, Leviticus xvi. 4. (Worthington)
