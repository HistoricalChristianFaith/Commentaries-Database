Phadaia, called also Sala Thiel, (Matthew i. 12.) or these two brothers had each a son named Zorobabel. The grandson of Sala Thiel was called Abiud, and that of Phadaia, Mosollam, (Menochius) unless these were the same person. (Sa) 
Phadaia, son of Sala Thiel, and father of Zorobabel, left his son to the care of his brother Sala Thiel, who was therefore accounted the father of Zorobabel too. (Calmet)
