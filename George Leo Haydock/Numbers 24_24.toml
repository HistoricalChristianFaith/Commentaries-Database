Italy. Hebrew, "Cittim "which Bo chart endeavours to prove with great erudition to mean Italy; while Grotius contends it means Macedon, and Calmet doubts not but this is the import of the present text. The Macedonians, under Alexander and his successors, conquered the countries of Assyria, Palestine Antiochus Epiphanes raised a cruel persecution against the Jews. But many suppose that the Hebrews here mentioned, are the nations beyond the Euphrates. (Calmet) 
Hebrew, "ships. Shall afflict Heber, and he also shall perish for ever "which seems to refer to Heber alone, and not to those who shall oppress them, as the Vulgate, Septuagint, express it. (Haydock) 
Indeed, we do not find that the Scripture mentions the end of the Roman empire, of which many explain this passage. (Calmet) 
Grotius (Jur. ii. 9) maintained that it still subsisted in the German empire. Others think it will be destroyed only in the days of Antichrist. (Tirinus) (Daniel ii. 40.) 
But many have asserted that it was overturned by the Goths, and that the Romans are the people who would reduce the Hebrews to the greatest misery, under Titus. (Menochius) 
The kings of Macedon are, however, styled kings of Cethim, (1 Machabees i. 1., viii. 5) and they were the immediate subverters of the Persian empire, as theirs fell a prey to the Romans. (Theodoret, q. 44.) (Calmet)
