Write this man barren. That is childless: not that he had no children, but that his children should never sit on the throne of Juda, (Challoner) ver. 28., Matthew i. 12., and Ezechiel xvii. 24. Zorobabel was of his seed, yet he never obtained the title or sovereign power of a king. The Machabees were of a different family. (St. Jerome) 
Joachin, or Jechonias, was restored indeed to some favour, (4 Kings xxv. 27.) but not to the kingdom, no more than any of his posterity, till Christ. (Worthington)
