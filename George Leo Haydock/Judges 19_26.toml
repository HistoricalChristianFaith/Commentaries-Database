Lord. So wives styled their husbands, 1 Peter iii. 5. 
Down dead through fatigue, (Menochius) shame, and grief. (Josephus)

Though the former misconduct of this unhappy woman might call for punishment, yet, after she was reconciled to her husband, we cannot but think he used her ill, though he acted through a sort of constraint and ignorance. (Haydock) 
Instances of women dying under a similar treatment, may be found in Herodotus, and in the Russian and Turkish historians. (Calmet)
