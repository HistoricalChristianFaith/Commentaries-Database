Oxen. St. Jerome and Protestants, "the cattle upon a thousand hills. "But our version is very good, and adopted by the Syriac, Ferrand (Calmet) 
Aleph means an ox as well as a thousand; and i may have been added to the preceding word, instead of u, at the beginning of this. (Berthier) 
We find u here improperly in either, "beast. "(Houbigant) 
No mention is made of fishes, because they were not used as victims. (Calmet)
