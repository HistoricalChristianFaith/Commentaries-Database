Seeth thee. Some have thought that God now manifested himself from the cloud. But all now agree that he only enlightened his understanding, and made known his designs more clearly. 
Job now perceived that he had spoken too boldly, in saying, Hear, and I will speak, ver. 4. The rest of this book is in prose.
