Caleb, or Calubi, ver. 9. Ziph, Maresa, and Hebron, are the names of towns, as well as of men. The descendants of Mesa inhabited Ziph, and those of Maresa dwelt at Hebron. The same remark will hold good in other places, where the names of places are put for those who occupied them. (Calmet) 
And the sons. Hebrew, "and of the sons of Maresa. "(Vatable) 
But it may be as well explained in the sense of the Vulgate. Septuagint, "Marisa, his first-born. He was the father of Ziph, and the sons of Marisa, of the father of Hebron. "
Father. Literally, "of the father "patris Hebron. (Haydock)
