Light. That is, your early rising, your labour and worldly solicitude, will be vain, that is, will avail you nothing, without the light, grace, and blessing of God. (Challoner) 
Nehemias divided the people into companies, to prevent their being too much fatigued. (Calmet) 
Without light it is impossible for man to work, John ix. 4. (Haydock) 
The labours of those who live by the robbery of the distressed, are vain. (Chaldean) 
Rise ye, is not in Hebrew. (Haydock) 
Sitten. Allow yourselves proper time for rest, after your labours and sorrows: for his beloved, whom he favours with his grace, shall sleep and rest under his wing, and yet abound with offspring, and all blessings. (Challoner) 
Sorrow. St. Jerome, "of idols. "This worship of God is odious. 
Beloved. Solomon. (Houbigant) 
Yet some explain the Hebrew in the plural, as it is applicable to all the people. The Jews were under great alarms: but were encouraged to hope that God would protect them, and give them a numerous progeny; though, as the country was probably never so well peopled as under Solomon, this may rather refer to the elect, who after the sleep of death (Berthier) shall behold those whom Christ shall acknowledge for his children, (Haydock) and obtain an eternal reward. (St. Hilary) 
Whatever people may think they have done well, without God's grace, is all useless, and they must begin again; whereas those who are guided by it, perform all with as much ease as they would sleep, and yet merit a reward, which is promised in heaven to the true children who are born to God in the Catholic Church. (Worthington)
