But if thou art called a Jew. In the common Greek copies, we read, behold, thou art a Jew St. Paul here turns his discourse particularly to the Jews, who valued themselves so much upon their law, their temple, and their ceremonies; and therefore are said to rest on the law, as if it were enough to be by profession a Jew. (Witham)
