The perpetual fire. This fire came from heaven, (chap. ix. 24,) and was always kept burning on the altar: as a figure of the heavenly fire of divine love, which ought to be always burning in the heart of a Christian. (Challoner) 
It must be fed by assiduous meditation on the Scripture and holy things. (Du Hamel)
