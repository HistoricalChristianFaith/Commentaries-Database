I know a man He speaks of himself, as it were of a third person. 
Whether in the body, I know not. If St. Paul himself knew not, how can we pretend to decide, whether his soul was for some moments separated from his body, or in what manner he saw God. (Witham) 
It appears that this took place about the period when the Holy Spirit commanded that he should be separated for the work whereunto he was called. (Acts xiii. 2.)
