Blasphemy. It may here signify either the sin of blasphemy against God, or speaking ill of our neighbour by detraction, calumnies, affronts See St. Chrysostom. (Witham) 
Now that you live in God, with Jesus Christ, quit not only the above shameful crimes, but also these sins, which, although they excite less horror, will separate you no less from the Author of all sanctity.
