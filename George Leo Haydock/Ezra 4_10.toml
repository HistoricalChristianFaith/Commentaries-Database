Asenaphar, commonly supposed to be the Asarhaddon, though we know not that he caused any of these nations to remove thither, as Salmanasar certainly did. (Calmet) 
The name of the latter occurs in some copies. (Lyranus) 
River, Euphrates. 
In peace. (Haydock) 
The original, ceheneth, is neglected by the Septuagint and Arabic. The Syriac reads, "Acheeneth. "Others translate, "at that time "as if the date had been lost. (Junius) 
Protestants, "and at such a time. "(Haydock) 
Others suppose the writers lived "at Kineeth. "(Pagnin) 
But who ever heard of such a place? Le Clerc takes it to mean "and the rest "as if the title were curtailed. But it is more probable that the text ought to be Ceheth, as ver. 17, and that we should translate, "beyond the river, (Calmet) as now, (11) unless this word ought to be here omitted, (Haydock) to Artaxerxes, the king, peace (and prosperity) as at present. "(Calmet) 
Chaldean sslum ucath, "peace even now. "(Haydock) 
So Horace says, suaviter ut nunc est, wishing a continuation of happiness. 3 Esdras (ii. 17.) joins the last word with ver. 12, "And now be it "Canoth may have this sense, (Calmet) and consequently no change is necessary. (Haydock)
