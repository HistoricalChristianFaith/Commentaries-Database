Bed. I will think on thee both when I retire to rest, and when I get up. (Berthier) 
Thou art my first beginning, and last end. (Haydock) 
At all times I will meditate on thy mercies (Calmet) in bed, and much more, when I arise, (Worthington) as I shall not then be so much oppressed with drowsiness. (Menochius)
