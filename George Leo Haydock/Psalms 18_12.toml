Clouds. 2 Kings, The coals (Hebrew, "flames") of fire were kindled. Two words, habaw haberu, his clouds removed, (Haydock) omitted in this passage, are here supplied, as the former word is found in Syriac and Arabic. But then hail and coals of fire seem improper for "they kindled into coals of fire "and in the next verse they are redundant; being therefore omitted in 2 Kings xxii., in the best editions of the Septuagint and in the old Italic of Blanchini. Capel supposes they have been inserted from the preceding verse, which is rendered more probable by the Hebrew manuscript 5. (Kennicott, Dis. 1.) 
They have been inserted in some editions of Septuagint from the Hebrew of Theodotion, (Calmet) or Symmachus. (Mont falcon) 
This unusual third hemistic occurs in a smaller type in Brett Inger's (Kennicott) and Grabe's Septuagint, but they indicate thereby that it was not in the Alexandrian manuscript, as it is not in that of the Vatican. If it were in its proper place, we should read at least grandinem This magnificent description of a thunder-storm (Haydock) may allude to that which routed the Philistines, 2 Kings v. 24., and Isaias xxviii. 21. (Calmet) 
The lightning seemed to dispel the gloom. (Theodoret; Flaminius) 
Though man is overpowered with God's majesty, yet he is instructed how to act by those whom God has commissioned to teach. (Worthington)
