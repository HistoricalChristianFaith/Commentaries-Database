Years, not complete; as the first is comprized in the reign of Achab, and the last in that of Joram, 4 Kings iii. 1. (Usher, the year of the world 3108.) 
Yet, his very short reign was memorable for many disasters; the revolt of the dependant king of Moab, the ruin of his navy, that he might thus be reclaimed from his evil ways. (Salien, the year before Christ 915.) 
Houbigant allows this king two full years; and rejects the notion of his being associated by his father, as he does on other similar occasions, where the Scripture is silent. He makes Ochozias commence in the 19th, and end in the 22d of Josaphat, and not in the second of Joram, 4 Kings i. 17. The Hebrew and Greek copies vary. (Haydock)
