Withhold not. The prophet now speaks in the name of Christ's mystical body, the Church, praying to be made a partaker of mercy, and to be delivered from evils, (Worthington) or Christ speaks as the victim for our sins. (Haydock) 
Uphold me. This might be also rendered as a prayer, "May thy", with the Hebrew and some copies of the Septuagint. (Berthier)
