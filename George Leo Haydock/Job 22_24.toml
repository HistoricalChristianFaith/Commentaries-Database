Gold, to build and adorn thy habitation, ver. 23. Hebrew, "He will give thee gold instead of dust; (or more abundant) yea, gold of the torrents of Ophir. "The Phasis is said to roll gold dust, which is of the purest kind, Genesis ii. 11. (Calmet) 
"Thou shalt lay up gold as dust, and the gold of Ophir, as the stones of the brooks. "(Protestants) (Haydock) 
This is an exaggeration, (3 Kings x. 27.; Calmet) and a sort of proverb, intimating that strength and plenty should succeed to infirmity. The foundations should be the hard rock, instead of earth
