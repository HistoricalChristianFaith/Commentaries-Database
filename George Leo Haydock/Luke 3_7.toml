This saint of the desert, seeing all the inhabitants of Palestine surrounding and admiring him, was not elated with the honour, but openly and severely rebuked them. (St. Chrysostom, hom. xi. on S. Matt) 
According to St. Matthew, the Baptist addressed these words principally to the Pharisees and Sadducees, there and then present.
