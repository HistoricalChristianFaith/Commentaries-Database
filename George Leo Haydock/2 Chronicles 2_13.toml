Father. Hebrew Abi, is considered by some as the surname of Hiram. (Pagnin) 
But he might have that title in consideration of his great skill, as Solomon gives it him, chap. iv. 16. We use master in the same sense. Septuagint have, "servant "(Greek: paida) except the Roman edition, which agrees with the Hebrew and reads, Greek: patera. (Calmet) 
Protestants, "of Huram, my father's "(Haydock) supply servant, or architect. (Tirinus)
