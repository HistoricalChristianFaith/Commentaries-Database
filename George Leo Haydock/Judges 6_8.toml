A prophet. The people no sooner repent, than God shows them mercy. (Haydock) 
The name of this prophet is unknown. The Jews say it was Phinees; others think it was an angel in human shape: but he might be one divinely commissioned on this occasion, to make an exhortation to the people, assembled on some of the great festivals, (see chap. ii. 1.; Calmet) though he might continue to exercise his authority afterwards. (Menochius) 
St. Augustine (q. 31,) thinks that the angel (ver. 11,) is here called a prophet, because he appeared in human form. (Worthington)
