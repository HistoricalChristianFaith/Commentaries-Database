Let us here take notice, that, as the apostles confirmed their words by the signs that followed, so also in us must our words be confirmed by works. "Grant, O Jesus! that the discourse we deliver, concerning virtue, may be confirmed by works and actions; that thus, by thy co-operation, we may become perfect in word and work; for to Thee is due the glory of our discourses and actions. "(Theophylactus) _ Ep. ad Hebidiam, q. 3, tom. 4, part 1, p. 172: omnibus Græcis Libris penè hoc capitulum non habentibus.
