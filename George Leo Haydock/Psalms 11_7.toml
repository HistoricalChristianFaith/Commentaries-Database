Righteousness. As, on the other hand, (Haydock) the upright shall behold God, (Matthew v. 8.) while the wicked shall be driven into darkness (Calmet) for all eternity. In vain do modern sophists pretend that hell will not last for ever because God is incapable of revenge, or of delighting in the torture of his creatures. They use the word revenge in a wrong sense. (Berthier) 
God is not subject to any passion; but his justice requires that those should be eternally punished, whose will is always impious. (Haydock) 
Can they show that there will be room for repentance in the other world? (Berthier) or that the wicked would make use of it, if granted, since they would not repent as long as they lived? By the same arguments, they might as well prove that God could not punish at all. (Haydock) (Daniel iii. 27.)
