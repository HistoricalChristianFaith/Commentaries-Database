Elam. A part of Persia. (Challoner) 
The Elamites had besieged Jerusalem, under Manasses, (Calmet) and are therefore punished. (Worthington) 
They were subject to As radon: Nabuchodonosor subdued them after the other nations, ver. 36. Cyrus set his countrymen at liberty, (Calmet) and thus began his conquests. (Haydock) 
Pagan historians assert, at random, that they were before subject to the Medes.
