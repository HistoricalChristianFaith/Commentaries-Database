People. A hypocrite denotes one infected with all sorts of crimes. (St. Iren us v. 24.) Such a king is sometimes given to punish a wicked people, Osee xiii. 11., and Isaias iii. 4. This sense is beautiful, and followed by the Chaldean, Septuagint We may explain the Hebrew in like manner, by neglecting the Masoretic points. (Calmet) 
Protestants, "That the hypocrite reign not, lest the people be ensnared. "(Haydock) 
Hebrew, "He overturns the throne of hypocrites, on account of the scandal of the people "or "he delivers the people from servitude. "The sense of the Vulgate seems preferable. (Calmet) 
Eliu insinuates that Job had been a hypocrite and an oppressor; but God exculpates him. (Worthington)
