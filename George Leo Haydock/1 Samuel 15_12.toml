Arch. Here we behold what a change prosperity makes in the manners of those who before showed the greatest humility. Saul erects a monument to his own vanity. Hebrew, "he has set him up a hand "(as Absalom did, 2 Kings xviii. 18.) or "a place "to divide the booty, (Jonathan) or "a garrison "to keep the country in subjection. (Calmet) 
Perhaps he erected the figure of "a hand "as an emblem of strength, and in honour of Benjamin, "the son of the right hand "of whose tribe he was. (Haydock)
