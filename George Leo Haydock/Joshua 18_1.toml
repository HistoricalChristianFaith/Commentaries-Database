Silo was delightfully situated, about the midst of the country, 12 miles south of Sichem.

But there seems to be no reason for these assertions. David informs us that the ark of the Lord was covered with skins, 2 Kings vii. 2. If any repairs were found necessary for the tabernacle erected by Moses, they might be made. The ark was certainly in it till the Israelites unfortunately sent it into the camp, where it was taken by the Philistines. When they sent back the ark, it was deposited at Gabaa, and not in the tabernacle, which was at Silo. Then it was sent to Nobe. We find the tabernacle was at Gabaon some time after the ark was translated to Jerusalem. (Calmet)
