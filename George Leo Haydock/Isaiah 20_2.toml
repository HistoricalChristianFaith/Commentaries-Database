Sackcloth. The prophets lived in poverty, Zacharias xiii. 4. Their persons were prophetic. It is not agreed whether Isaias went quite naked, or only without his upper garment. The former supposition would represent better the condition of slaves, (ver. 4.) and is adopted by St. Jerome (Calmet) 
People are said to be naked when they are almost so, 2 Kings vi., and John xxi. (Haydock) 
Yet "nothing is more honest than to obey God. "(St. Jerome) (Worthington)
