Prince of the host of the Lord St. Michael, who is called prince of the people of Israel, Daniel x. 21. (Challoner) 
Some of the Fathers explain it of the Son of God. (Origen, hom. 6.) But St. Augustine, City of God xi. 13., St. Jerome in Galatians iii., and interpreters in general agree, that the person who here appeared to Josue, was the archangel Michael. He came, in the name of God, to assure Josue of success, as the angel had appeared to Moses in the burning bush, as if to denote the distress of the Hebrews, and to encourage Moses to undertake their liberation. (Calmet) 
Chaldean, "I am the angel sent by God. "In that character he is called the Lord. (Haydock)
