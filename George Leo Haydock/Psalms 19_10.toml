Stones. So St. Jerome renders the Hebrew. Protestants, "than gold; yea, than much fine gold. "Paz (Haydock) denotes the finest gold of Uphan, or of the Phison; which is probably the river Phasis, Genesis ii. 11. (Calmet) 
Yet many explain this word of the topaz or chrysolite, which is of a golden colour. The Vulgate expresses topaz, (Psalm cxviii. 127.) where the Septuagint have, "a precious stone. "
Honeycomb, as the English and German versions have it, though the Hebrew signify, "the dropping of the honeycombs "which is the most excellent honey. (Berthier) 
This interpretation is inserted in the Protestant margin, and answers to St. Jerome's favum redundantem. Nothing can be more delicious, or more magnificent. (Haydock)
