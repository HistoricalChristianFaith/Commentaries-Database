Flies. Hebrew heharob. Septuagint, "dog-flies. "Some include under this plague all sorts of wild beasts. (Josephus, ii. 13; Wisdom xi. 9, 16, 18.) Insects are very troublesome, and the pagans honoured Jupiter with the title of Apomuios, because he delivered them from flies. Beelzebub, "the god-fly "got his name for the same reason, 4 Kings i. 1. (Calmet)
