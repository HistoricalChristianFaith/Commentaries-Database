Remembered; not as if God had ever forgotten Noe, but he now shows his remembrance of him by the effects. (Menochius) 
A wind, literally a spirit, which St. Ambrose and Theodoret understood of the Holy Spirit, that as he moved over the waters at first, (Chap. i. 2.) to give them fecundity, and to exercise his power in establishing order, so he may show the same care and providence for this new world, emerging, like the former, from the waters. (Haydock) 
Most interpreters, however, understand this of a violent wind; (Proverbs xxv. 23; Exodus xiv. 21.) a strong blast, such as was sent to divide the Red sea. (Menochius)
