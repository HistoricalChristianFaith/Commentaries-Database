My angel, viz., John the Baptist, the messenger of God, and forerunner of Christ. (Challoner) 
His purity and office procure him this title. (Worthington) 
Afterwards Christ himself shall come, for the ruin and for the resurrection of many, Luke ii. 34. Hence threats and promises are intermixed. The evangelists read his face, making the Father speak, whereas the Son is introduced by the prophet, who however presently changes the person. It is all the same which person of the blessed Trinity speaks, as all act together. (Calmet) 
Testament. The Messias, the mediator of the covenant with mankind, (Worthington) with Abraham, and Moses. The latter calls him the prophet; (Deuteronomy xviii. 18.) and Zacharias, alluding to this text, explains angel in the same sense, Luke i. 76. 
Temple. The ancient Jews were convinced that the Messias would come to the temple of Zorobabel, and be its chief glory, Aggeus ii. 8. (Calmet) 
Their descendants put off the coming for some long time, though the prophet says presently, or on a sudden. (St. Jerome; Basnage vi. 26.) 
Some take this temple to be the womb of the bless Virgin . (St. Cyril; St. Augustine, City of God xviii. 35.) (Calmet) 
The Baptist was conceived, born, and preached first; and shortly after Christ appeared. (Worthington)
