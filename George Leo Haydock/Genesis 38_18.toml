Staff. These were all marks of dignity. "Kings made use of spears, or sceptres, before they wore a diadem. "(Trogus. 43.) (Calmet) 
Juda might blame himself for exposing these valuable things, and divesting himself of all his dignity, to gratify his unjustifiable passion. If some have excused both the parties concerned, the Scripture at least sufficiently shows in what light we ought to consider their conduct.

She was guilty of a sort of adultery, being engaged to Sela; and also of incest; whereas the fault of Juda, through ignorance of her person, was simply fornication; which is, however, always contrary to the law of nature, as the pagans themselves confessed. (Grotius in Matthew v.) (Calmet) 
From Christ's choosing to be born of such progenitors, we may learn to adore his humility and tender regard for sinners. (Haydock)
