Prepareth. Hebrew, "delivereth "as a midwife (St. Jerome, 5 Edition, Aquila) "maketh the hinds to calve "(Protestants; Haydock) or "to leap, (from eul; Berthier) or frighteneth. "Hinds are supposed to bring forth with great difficulty. But the reverse seems to be the case. (St. Chrysostom in Job xxxix. 3.) (Calmet) 
They are very swift, and trample serpents under their feet, nature having given them this power. (St. Jerome) (Pliny, vii. 32.) The text may be understood of the last sacrament, which prepares us for our passage; (Berthier) or of matrimony, by means of which the world is peopled with rational beings, whose duty it is to glorify God in his temple. (Haydock) 
This is also the effect of grace, and of the preaching of the gospel, (Berthier) which inspires people with a desire of running on in the way of perfection. Christ explains to them hidden mysteries in his Church, to which he bring multitudes, like the waters, ruling over them, and enabling them to overcome all temptations, till he crown his elect with eternal peace. (Worthington) 
Glory. Running thither through fear, or to thank God for rain after a drought.
