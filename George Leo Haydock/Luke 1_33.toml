Those are here called of the house of Jacob, who out of the multitude of the Jews believed in Christ. This is conformable to that text of St. Paul: All are not Israelites that are of Israel, but the children of the promise are accounted for the seed. (Romans ix. 6, 8.) (St. Chrysostom, hom. vii. on S. Matt.) 
And of his kingdom there shall be no end: which clearly shows it was not to be a temporal, but a spiritual and an eternal kingdom. (Witham)
