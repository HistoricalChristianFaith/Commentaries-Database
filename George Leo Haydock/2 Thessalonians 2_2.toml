St. Augustine, writing to Hesychium, declareth that no one from the Scripture can be assured of the day, year, or age and Elias, and that great, very great, will be the apostacy, is the general belief. Oh! God, preserve us with thy grace, and do not permit us to lose sight of the dreadful danger that threatens even the elect.
