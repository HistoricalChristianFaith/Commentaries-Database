Shut-up, with mounds of earth, or in the banks of rivers. The army of Xerxes is said to have drunk whole rivers dry. We might also translate, "I have dried up the waters, which served as ramparts for cities. "Thus Cyrus diverted the streams of the Gnidus, and of the Euphrates. Hebrew also, perhaps most literally, "I will dry up the rivulets of Egypt. "See Isaias xix. 6., and xxxvii. 25. (Calmet) 
Protestants, "all the rivers of besieged places. "(Haydock)
