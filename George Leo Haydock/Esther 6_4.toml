Prepared. It was not prudent to declare her request, when many improper persons were present; and Aman was not there. (Menochius)

If the prudence of this world suggest much address, why may not virtue employ the same arts for good purposes? Esther had to obtain two great points; to make the king retract his edict, and to abandon his favourite. She is afraid therefore of being too hasty, (Calmet) and invites the king again, to increase by this delay his desire of knowing her request, and that he might bind himself to grant it more effectually. (Worthington) 
She invites Aman alone, who would thus be more envied by the other courtiers; (Lyranus) while she manifested an open dispostion, and disdained to accuse the absent. (Tirinus)
