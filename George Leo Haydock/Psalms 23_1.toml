David. This psalm most beautifully describes the consolation which the just find in God's protection. (Haydock) 
It may be applied to the Israelites in the desert, (Chaldean) to David persecuted by Saul, or rather (Calmet) settled quietly upon the throne, (Muis) or to the Jews returned from Babylon. (St. Athanasius) (Calmet) 
The Fathers explain it mystically of Jesus Christ, the Shepherd of our souls. (Didymus, St. Augustine) The allegories of a shepherd and of a person giving a feast to his guests, are well supported. (Calmet) 
Ruleth, in Hebrew. Is my shepherd; viz., to feed, guide, and govern me. (Challoner) 
Septuagint poimainei, pascit, as St. Augustine and St. Jerome read. St. Gregory Thaumaturgus understands this of the angel guardian. (Paneg. in Orig.) 
Jesus Christ conducts us into the pastures of his Church, and feeds us (Worthington) with his own body (Calmet) 
The saints never complain of want. (Berthier)
