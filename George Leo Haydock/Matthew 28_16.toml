The eleven disciples went into Galilee, yet not till above eight days after. As to the order of Christ's apparitions, in the gospels: He appeared first to Mary Magdalene, and to other devout women; then to St. Peter; next to two disciples going to Emmaus; after that to the apostles that were all together, except only St. Thomas. These apparitions were all on the very day he rose from the dead. We find also (John xx,) that eight days after he appeared to all the eleven apostles, Thomas being then present, to whom he said, put in thy finger hither This is generally thought to have happened at Jerusalem. When the apostles and disciples were gone into Galilee, he showed himself to seven of them, as they were fishing on the lake of Tiberias. (John xxi. 4.) We read also in this chap. (ver. 16,) that he appeared to them on a mountain in Galilee: what mountain is was we know not. It may be of this apparition that St. Paul says, (1 Corinthians xv. 6,) Then was he seen by more than five hundred brethren at once. He also tells us he appeared to St. James. See ver. 7. But when or where this was, is not mentioned. In fine, Christ till his ascension frequently appeared to them, and conversed with them. He taught them to understand the holy Scriptures, and all that belonged to their ministry: he gave them power to forgive sins: He sent his apostles as his heavenly Father had sent him. He gave in particular to St. Peter the charge over his whole flock: He promised to send down upon them the Holy Spirit; and to remain with them himself to the end of the world, i.e. with his Church. (Witham) 
It is supposed that then and there took place what St. Paul mentions, that Jesus Christ showed himself to more than 500 of the brethren together. (Bible de Vence)
