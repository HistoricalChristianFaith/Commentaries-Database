Pharan. Habacuc iii. 3, mentions this apparition. See also Psalm lxvii. 9. 
Saints. God was accompanied by legions of angels, when he delivered the law to the Israelites, who are styled a nation of saints, Numbers xvi. 3. Septuagint, "he hastened from Mount Pharan, with ten thousands to Cades. At his right hand are his angels attending. "(Haydock) 
Kodesh does not mean saints, but holiness, or the city of Cades; and the preceding word, which Protestants translate, with ten thousands, more probably refers to another title of the city, as it is specified Meriba-Cadesh, chap. xxxii. 51., and Ezechiel xlviii. 28. (Kennicott) 
Law. Chaldean, "from the midst of the fire he has given us a law, written with his own hand. "We may translate, "He hath shone from Mount Pharan, and multitudes accompanied him. The Holy One, who hath in his hand fire and the law. "See Isaias vi. 3. God conducted his people, like a victorious general, through the wilderness, frequently appearing to them to strike terror into the rebellious. (Calmet) 
When he first descended upon Sinai, his glory shone on Pharan and Seir, as it were in its progress thither. (Menochius)

"His brightness was as the sun, horns, or rather splendours (issuing forth) from his hand "(Kennicott)
