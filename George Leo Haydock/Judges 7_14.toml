Sword and loaf are both derived from the same Hebrew word, which signifies "to make war. "See Numbers xiv. 9. But if there had been no connection or reason in the discourse of the soldier, (which was not the case, as Providence put it into his mouth,) the end would be equally obtained, which was to encourage Gedeon, and to inform him that the enemy was not without some apprehensions. (Calmet) 
Gedeon was not of the richest family, but came with great expedition, as the rolling of the barley-loaf might designate. (Menochius) 
He was also encamped upon an eminence, and presently threw the affairs of Madian into confusion. (Haydock) 
He understands the language of the Madianites, as it was not very different from the Hebrew.
