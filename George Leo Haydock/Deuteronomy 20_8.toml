Fear. Such often occasion the loss of battles. Alexander sent away all who had not courage to follow him in his expeditions. (Curt. x.) The Rabbins condemn these faint-hearted soldiers to carry water, for the army, to prepare the roads and places for encampments. (Calmet) 
But this seems contrary to the intention of the lawgiver, who sends them back to their houses.
