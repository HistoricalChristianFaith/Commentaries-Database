Bethel. Garizim was not then honoured with the temple, as the Samaritans would pretend. (Chronicles) They wished to join in building that at Jerusalem, under Esdras. (Calmet) 
Lord. Collins would make us believe, that the Samaritans continued "for a long time "without the Pentateuch, and all "heathens for many ages. "But the first supposition "is to me incredible "says Kennicott; and Hottinger himself allows, that the priests did bring back a copy of the law "exactly corresponding with the autograph of Moses. "(Exert. p. 8.) And as for the Samaritans being heathens, Prideaux, whom this infidel writer quotes, (Haydock) says, "consistently with his Bible, that they continued in that gross idolatry of worshipping other gods in conjunction with the True; which last words are very unfairly omitted. "(Kennicott, Diss. ii. p. 115.) 
This was the true origin and state of this mixture of nations, who were sent to cultivate the lands of Samaria. (Haydock)
