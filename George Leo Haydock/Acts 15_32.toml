Judas and Silas, being prophets, that is, preachers, as the word prophet, is divers times taken. (Witham) 
Not only such were called prophets, as had the gift of predicting future events, but such moreover as had the gift of interpreting Scripture, and of speaking of the things of God. (Bible de Vence)
