More and more he added daily to the Church, as it is clearly expressed in the Greek, prosetithei te ekklesia, that we may see the visible propagation and increase of the same. We may here, and throughout the whole book, observe a visible society of men joined in Christ, which visible society may be traced through ecclesiastical history, down to our days, and which will continue, in virtue of Christ's promise, to the end of time, as the point of union, by which the true disciples of Jesus Christ are to be connected together in one body, and one spirit; "one Lord, one faith, one baptism. "(Ephesians iv. 5.) This book can show the true Church ever visible, and ever speaking with authority to all that do not willingly shut their eyes, as plainly as the gospel doth show the true Christ. "Every where the Church proclaims the truth; she is the candlestick, with the seven lamps (Exodus xxv.); bearing the light of Christ, eptamukos "says St. Iren us; which light nothing can obscure. Hence St. Chrysostom says, "sooner shall the sun be extinguished, than the Church be obscured "eukolioteron ton elion sbesthenai, e ten ekklesian aphanisthenai. _
