Hell. The hardened sinner will not praise thee, (St. Augustine) much less will the damned, who are confirmed in evil. (Berthier) 
Even those who are in "the grave "though just, cannot sound forth thy praises; and consequently, if I be cut off, the number of thy adorers will be diminished. This motive is often urged, as if God was forgotten in the rest of the world, Psalm xxix. 10., and Isaias xxxviii. 18. (Calmet) 
This life is the time for repentance. After death there is no conversion, but eternal blasphemies in hell. I will strive to prevent this misery, by continuing to do penance, till I am watered with thy grace. (Worthington)
