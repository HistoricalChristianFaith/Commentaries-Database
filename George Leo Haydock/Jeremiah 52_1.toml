Sedecias. This is purely historical, taken from 4 Kings xxiv. 18. Many doubt with reason the Jeremias inserted it, as he could not well be alive at the time when Joakim was honoured, ver. 31. If he had written both this and the Book of Kings, the variations which we here discover would not be seen. It seems, therefore, that Esdras or some other has inserted it, to explain the fall of Jerusalem and the lamentations; as a similar addition has been made to Isaias, chap. xxxvi. See Grotius. (Calmet) 
The history occurs more at large, Paralipomenon ultra. (Worthington)
