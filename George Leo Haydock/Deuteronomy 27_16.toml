Honoureth not. Hebrew, "curseth. "Septuagint, "despiseth. "See Leviticus xx. 9. 
"Exodus xxi. 17., Moses proclaimed, He that curseth his father or (Hebrew and) mother, shall die the death. "But here he goes still farther, and denounces a curse on those who make light of (Hebrew makle, vilipend it) their parents; or, as Denis the Carthusian expresses it not amiss, on him "who does not honour, by showing them obedience in due time, or by not relieving their wants as far as possible; and chiefly, if instead of honouring, he curses and uses opprobrious language towards them. ""I have made this remark, says Amama, (p. 376,) in order to admonish the Germans and the Dutch that this passage has been translated by Luther with too great carelessness, curseth, as if the same Hebrew word, kalal, were here used as in the text of Exodus. But those who are not too brazen, will confess that the Hebrew text, and the more accurate versions, require greater reverence to be shown to parents. Etiam illi judicabunt qui nondum Ã¦re lavantur. "This author, in his animadversions upon the Vulgate, often takes occasion to mention the blunders "of B. Luther "as well as of the Septuagint and other interpreters; for he seems to be satisfied with no version which has hitherto been published. (Haydock)
