Liars. They are so vain and light, that if they are put into the scales, they will be found to be of no weight; and to be mere lies, deceit, and vanity. Or, they are liars in their balances, by weighing thing by false weights, and preferring the temporal before the eternal. (Challoner) (Proverbs xi. 1., and xx. 10.) 
They give false judgments; be not concerned; God is our protector. (Calmet) 
God's servants strive to draw others to the practice of virtue. (Worthington) 
All sinners (Haydock) will not outweigh vanity itself. (Menochius)
