When any one heareth. This seed falleth upon four different kinds of soil, which represent four different sorts of persons. The 1st, such as continue obdurate in vice; the 2d, such as are unsteady and inconstant in their good resolutions; the 3d, such as are absorbed in the cares and pleasures of life; the 4th, such as have every proper disposition for receiving the word of God with fruit. 
There cometh the wicked one, o poneros, the devil, and taketh away the word that was sown in their hearts, lest believing they should be saved. (Haydock)
