The law. As the sun gives light to the world, so the law serves to direct mankind, and is another most powerful motive for us to praise God. This raises our hearts and minds still more perfectly to him, recalling us from our wanderings, and confirming our knowledge. Light is necessary for the body, and the law for the soul. The prophet admires eight characteristics of this divine law, which he designates by different names; as in the 118th psalm, some things relate only to the evangelical law, which converts souls, (Berthier) and lasts for ever, ver. 10. (Haydock) 
The law of nature and of Moses are nevertheless also commended, (Theodoret) inasmuch as the morality is always the same; and some faith in Christ, to come, or already past, is requisite under every dispensation. Hence he is called the Lamb slain from the beginning. (Haydock) 
Unspotted. Hebrew and Septuagint, "irreprehensible. "(Calmet) 
Who indeed could pretend to find any fault with it, since it comes from God? (Haydock) 
The laws of men are imperfect, and liable to change. Those of Draco were too sanguinary, and gave place to Solon's, which were deemed too mild How happy would all be if they would embrace the law of the gospel! (Berthier) 
Converting. Hebrew, "tranquillizing souls "(Menochius) by keeping the passions under. (Haydock) 
Testimony, declaring the will of God to men. 
Little ones. The simple, and the wicked; as both are so called. (Calmet) 
Pethi, "easily persuaded. "(Menochius) 
It directs the former, and keeps the latter in awe by punishment. (Calmet) 
All, in general, must confess their ignorance, and want of the divine law, to reap any benefit from it. (Haydock) 
This is the first lesson which it imparts. (Berthier) 
The law is most pure in itself, whether we understand that given to Moses, or the gospel. But the latter makes the observers unspotted, by the grace which the Holy Spirit communicates to them, though all who barely read and know the law, have no share in this happiness. God is the author of salvation, sweetly inviting all by the perfections of his law, which confers light and gladness, to co-operate with grace, that they may obtain the promised reward, ver. 12., and 2 Timothy iv. 6. (Worthington) 
The like grace was offered from the beginning, so that none will ever be punished who has not deserved it, having had the means to perform his duty. (Haydock)
