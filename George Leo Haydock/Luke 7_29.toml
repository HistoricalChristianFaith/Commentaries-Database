Justified God; i.e. feared and worshipped God, as just, merciful (Witham) 
There are only two different sets of men, who glorified God for the baptism of John, and these seemed the most remote from works of piety; viz. the ignorant multitude, who scarcely knew the law; and the publicans, who were in general the most avaricious of mortals, and were looked upon as public sinners. If the preaching of John the Baptist had such an effect upon these men; what kind of hearts must not the Scribes have had, who, with all the advantage of the knowledge of the law, still refused to believe? This verifies the saying of our Lord, in St. Matthew chap. xxi. 31: Amen, I say unto you, that the publicans and harlots shall go into the kingdom of heaven before you. (Maldonatus) 
God has hidden these things from the wise and prudent, and has revealed them to little ones; (St. Luke, x. 21.) for so it hath seemed good in his sight (Luke, x. 21.)
