Years, from the ruin of the temple till the fourth of Darius. 
Unto me? Did you grieve for the injury done to me; or was your sorrow caused by your own losses? The prophet gives not a direct answer; but sufficiently shows that exterior works of themselves are of little value. Whether the Jews entered into his sentiments or not, they still observe these fasts, though he said they should be changed into days of rejoicing, chap. viii. 19. (Calmet) 
The fast was good, but imperfect, wanting works of charity. (St. Gregory) (Worthington)
