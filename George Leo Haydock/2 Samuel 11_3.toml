"This son of Achitophel (chap. xxiii. 34,) was one of David's valiant men, as well as Urias, who is styled the Hethite, being born at Eth; (St. Jerome; Salien) or on account of his extraction, or because he or his ancestors (Haydock) had performed some great exploit against that nation; as Germanicus, Africanus, received those titles among the Romans, for conquering the Germans (Calmet) 
Eth was a place near Hebron. (Adrichomius 128.) (Menochius) 
The name of Bethsabee is also different in Paralipomenon; the last b in Hebrew being changed into v. Both-shua, both-al-i-ám; instead of Both-shobá, both-ám-i-al. (Haydock) (Kennicott) 
The grandfather of Bethsabee is supposed to have revolted against David, to revenge the wrong done to her. (Tirinus; Cornelius a Lap ide) "Let the weak tremble at the fall of the strong. "(St. Augustine, in Psalm l.)
