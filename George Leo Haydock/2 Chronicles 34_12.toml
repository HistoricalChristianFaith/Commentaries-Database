Distress. "When he had been conducted to Babylon, and cast into a brazen vessel full of holes, over a fire, he called upon all the names of the idols, which he was accustomed to adore; and, as he was not heard, nor set free by them, he recollected what he had often heard repeated by his father: When thou shalt call upon me in tribulation, and shalt be converted, I will hear thee graciously; as it is written in Deuteronomy, (see chap. iv. 29.; Haydock) and his prayer was thus heard by the Lord, and he was delivered and brought back to his kingdom, like Habacuc. "(St. Jerome, Trad.) 
The author of the imperfect work on St. Matthew, (among the works of St. Chrysostom, hom. 1.; Haydock) says, that Manasses was barely allowed as much barley bread, and water mixed with vinegar, as would keep him alive. Whereupon, remembering the Lord, he had recourse to his clemency, and a miraculous flame surrounded him, and dissolving his chains, set him at liberty. Saos-duchin, the successor of Azarhaddon, probably restored him to his throne, some years after his captivity, or perhaps that very year, so that his repentance continued thirty-three years. (Calmet) 
Prayed, a proof of the efficacy of sincere repentance. (Worthington)
