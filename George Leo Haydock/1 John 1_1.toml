Et vita manifesta est. This corresponds to, in ipso vita erat Ver. 8. St. Augustine, lib. de Nat. et Gra. chap. xxxvii. Exceptâ S. V. Mariâ, de quâ propter honorem Domini, null am prorsus, cum de peccato agitur, haberi volo mentionem.

The first two verses and part of the third have a great conformity with the beginning of St. John's gospel. The construction is somewhat obscure, unless we observe that the second verse is to be taken by way of a parenthesis, and the sense is not complete till these words, we declare to you The whole may be expressed in this literal paraphrase: We declare and preach to you the eternal and always living word, which was from the and manifested himself to us, when he took upon him our human nature, and was made flesh). This word I say, incarnate, we have seen with our eyes, we have heard him preach his gospel, we have touched his true body with our hands, as we witness and declare to you, that you may have fellowship with us, and be made partakers of the graces which God came from heaven to bestow upon mankind, to make us his adoptive sons and heirs of heaven. (Witham)
