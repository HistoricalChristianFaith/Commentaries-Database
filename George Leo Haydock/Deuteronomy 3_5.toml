Walls. Tacitus remarks, that "a great part of Judea is covered with villages, though towns may likewise be found in the country. (Hist. v. 8.) See 3 Kings iv. 13. Septuagint, "besides the towns of the Pherezites, which were very numerous. "(Calmet) 
The spies had not travelled in this county, when they gave an account of the walled towns being as high as heaven. But Moses here informs us, that the cities on the east side of the Jordan were not much inferior to those on the west, and the land was infested also with giants, ver. 13. (Haydock)
