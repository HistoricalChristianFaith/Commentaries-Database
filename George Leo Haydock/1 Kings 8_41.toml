Stranger. God watches over all mankind; and oblations were received from all sorts of people, even from idolaters. The kings of Persia and Egypt, the Roman emperors, made great presents, 1 Esdras iii. 7., and vii. 21. (Josephus, xi., and xii. 2.) It seems the court of the Gentiles was only made after the captivity. Some of these adored the true God, like Cornelius, Acts viii. 27., and x. 1. Some were drawn by curiosity; others desired to be converted. To thee, kings shall offer presents, Psalm lxxi. 10. (Calmet) 
Unbelievers are still invited to attend the chapels of the true God, that they may receive information, and deserve to obtain the blessing of faith. (Haydock)
