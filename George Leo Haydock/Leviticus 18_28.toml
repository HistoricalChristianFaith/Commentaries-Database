Vomited. Moses speaks of what would shortly happen, as if it had already come to pass, which is familiar with the prophets. (Calmet) 
He represents the earth as sick and disgusted with the crimes of its inhabitants, in the same manner as the Book of Wisdom (v. 23,) says, the water of the sea shall rage (or foam, excandescet) against them. The strong expression used by Moses, shows to what a length the Chanaanites had carried their abominations; so that God, justly irritated, orders them all to be exterminated.
