Three years' famine; which joined with the three foregoing years of famine, mentioned 2 Kings xxi., and the seventh year of the land's resting, would make up the seven years proposed by the prophet, 2 Kings xxiv. 13. (Challoner) 
Perhaps it would be as well to acknowledge a mistake, (2 Kings; Haydock) on account of the similitude of the Hebrew words signifying three and seven: (Tirinus) unless the prophet reduced the time from seven to three years; as in Ezechiel (iv. 15.) God mitigates the severity of his first threat. (Sanctius)
