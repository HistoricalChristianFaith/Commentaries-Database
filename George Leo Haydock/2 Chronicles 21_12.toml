Elias. Le Clerc would read Eliseus. Grotius supposes that all passed in a dream. Others think that Elias had written the letter before his removal from the conversation of men, some years before, foreseeing the impiety of Joram, and leaving the letter with Eliseus, to be delivered unto him.

Thus the saints in heaven interest themselves in our defence, 2 Machabees xv. 11. (Haydock) 
Prophet. Hebrew, "And there came in him a writing of "(Calmet)
