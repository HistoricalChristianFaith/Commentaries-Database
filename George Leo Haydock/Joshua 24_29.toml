And after If Josue wrote this book, as is commonly believed, these last verses were added by Samuel, or some other prophet. (Challoner) 
Scholastic History. (Worthington) 
Josue had governed Israel 17 years with the greatest prudence and fidelity. (Calmet) 
Some extend his administration to a longer period. (Haydock) 
He paid the debt of nature probably not long after the ratification of the covenant. It does not appear that he was ever married. (St. Jerome, contra Jov. 1.; St Chrysostom) 
The Scripture does not mention that the people mourned for him, as they had done for Moses Yet we cannot doubt but they would show this mark of respect to his memory, on account of the many benefits which they had received from him. The Holy Spirit has vouchsafed to be his panegyrist, Numbers xxvii. 12., and Ecclesiasticus xlvi. 1. Josephus ( v. 1,) represents him as a most universal character, equally perfect in every thing that he took in hand. His greatest honour is to have been so striking a figure of Jesus, whose name he bore, (Calmet) and whose sacred office in administering a second circumcision after he had caused the people to cross the Jordan, he so well described. Like him he introduces the faithful into the land of promise, overthrows their enemies, and establishes them in peace, taking care both at the beginning and at the end of his administration, to set before their eyes the will of the heavenly Father, the God who is both holy and jealous, ver. 19. Under Josue the Israelites are invincible, only as long as they continue faithful, chap. vii. But Jesus secures his Church both from infidelity and from the attacks of all her enemies, by his all-powerful grace. (Haydock) 
The Jews have attributed to Josue ten regulations, which are too trifling to have been made by him. (Selden, Jur. vi. 2.) 
The Samaritan chronicle embellishes the account of this great man with many surprising and puerile fictions, as if the true history were not sufficient to excite our attention. See Basnage and Serarius. (Calmet) 
The Jews say Josue died on the 26th of Nisan, unmarried. The Roman martyr ology honours his memory on the 1st of September. (Salien, in the year before Christ 1453.) It is probable that the Egyptian or Tyrean Hercules, who encountered so many giants and difficulties, was no other than Josue, whose history the pagans have obscured with fables. (Vossius.) (Haydock)
