Resemblance. The king of Tyre, by his dignity and his natural perfections, bore in himself a certain resemblance to God, by reason of which he might be called the seal of resemblance But what is here said to him is commonly understood of Lucifer, the king over all the children of pride. (Challoner) 
A seal is perfect when it represents things exactly. The prophet speaks ironically, to repress the king's vanity.
