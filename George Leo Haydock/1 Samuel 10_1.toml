Vial, in the form of a lentil. (Pliny, xviii. 12.) 
Oil. This anointing seems to have been peculiar to the kings, priests, and prophets of the Hebrews, who prefigured Jesus, the great anointed of God. (St. Augustine in Psalm xliv.) The custom was very ancient, Judges ix. 8. It is thought that those kings, who succeeded their fathers by their birth-right, and without opposition, did not receive any unction. (Calmet) 
But the silence of Scripture is no proof on this head; and the Fathers seem to be convinced that the custom subsisted till Christ appeared. (St. Justin Martyr, Dialogue with Trypho, etc.) (Haydock) 
The Rabbins pretend that the sacred ointment was used for the kings of Juda, but not for those of Israel. It is not probable that it was used for either, Exodus xxx. 32., and 3 Kings i. 39. We read that Jehu was anointed king of Israel; (4 Kings ix. 6,) and we may suppose that common oil was used, in his regard, as well as for the other kings. The perfume or balm of Judea, does not spot the garments on which it may fall. (Pliny, xii. 25.) It was poured on the head; the Rabbins say in the form of a crown, (Calmet) or cross. (Haydock) 
But this is uncertain. The ceremony has been preserved, with respect to Christian kings, who, according to Innocent I, should be anointed on the shoulders and arms, while prelates receive the unction on the head. 
Kissed him, out of respect, Psalm ii. 12. (Calmet) 
Behold. Hebrew, "Is it not because? "(Haydock) 
And thou.prince. All this is wanting in the Hebrew But it is conformable to the Vatican Septuagint; (Calmet) the Alexandrian has "to be prince over his people, over Israel? and thou shalt rule over the people of the Lord, and shalt save it from its enemies around "as we have explained, chap. ix. 16. (Haydock) 
Saul was anointed with a small vessel, to signify that his kingdom should not subsist long; and with oil, to remind him of mercy, light, and health to his people. (St. Gregory) (Worthington)
