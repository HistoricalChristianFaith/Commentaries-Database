Agreed? As they cannot do this well, so neither can man be acceptable to God, unless he keep his laws. (Worthington) 
The prophet here proves his mission, intimating that if he were not inspired, he would soon be open to detection. He had been banished from Bethel, chap. vii. By many similes, he shows that the event will prove the sincerity of his character, and that he cannot resist the holy spirit which is in him.
