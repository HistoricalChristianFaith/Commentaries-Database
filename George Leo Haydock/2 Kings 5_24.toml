Evening. Septuagint, Syriac, seems to have read aupol, instead of the present Hebrew hopel, eminence "(Calmet) Protestants, "tower "(Haydock) at or near Samaria; when Giezi thought proper to take the burden himself to prevent detection. Eliseus would hardly dismiss the Syrians, when the night was so near at hand. (Calmet) 
It might however be found more eligible to travel in the evening, (Haydock) as it was now the spring or summer season, (Tirinus) or at least warm, ver. 10. (Haydock)
