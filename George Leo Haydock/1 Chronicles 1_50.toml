Mezaab. It is unusual for the Scripture to mark so particularly the genealogy of a woman. We might translate the Hebrew, "a native, or who was a native of Mezaab "which is probably the same with Dizahab, "abundance of gold "Deuteronomy i. 1. Mezaab signifies, "waters of gold "(Calmet) or "whose is gold "whence some infer that the woman was very rich, (Lyranus) or had discovered the art of drawing gold thread. (Abulensis) 
It is more probably a proper name. (Menochius)
