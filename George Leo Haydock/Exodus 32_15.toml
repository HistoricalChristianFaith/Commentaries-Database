Both sides. The ten commandments were written twice over, or on both sides, that all who stood round Moses, might be able to read them. (Menochius) 
On one side, appeared the laws regarding God; on the other, those which relate to man. (Haydock) 
They were like two originals. The common way of writing was only on one side. (Calmet)
