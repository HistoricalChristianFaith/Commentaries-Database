Sin. Septuagint, "propitiation "which the pagans deemed requisite; (Horace, i. ode 2.) or worship (Haydock) of Baal, (4 Kings xvii. 16.; Calmet) and all the other superstitions. (Haydock) 
Way. Septuagint, "thy God "or religion, (Acts ix. 2.) or pilgrimage to Bersabee, chap. v. 5. Perhaps the true God was here adored; but it was in a manner which he condemned. (Calmet) 
In vain do those pretend to honour Him, who follow the traditions of unbelieving men. (Haydock)
