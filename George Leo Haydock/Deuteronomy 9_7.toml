Strove. Hebrew, "irritated. "(Calmet) 
Septuagint, "continually disbelieved the Lord. "Moses hence takes occasion to lay before the people their frequent and most heinous offences, on account of which they might justly have feared being destroyed, as much as the infamous nations whom they were about to supplant. They might thus be convinced that they had been chosen gratuitously. (Haydock) 
For God hates nothing more than ingratitude and presumption. (Calmet)
