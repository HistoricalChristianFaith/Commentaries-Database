Ecstacy. This word is not in Hebrew nor in some of the best Greek copies. (Theodoret) 
It seems to be taken from ver. 23., (Calmet) and intimates that the just may recite this psalm in the latter times, (Worthington) when they shall be in the greatest perplexity. (Haydock) 
David composed it when he was obliged to flee from court, (1 Kings xix. 1., and xxvii. 1.; Calmet) or in the desert of Moan, seeing himself in the most imminent danger; (1 Kings xxiii. 25.; Kimchi; Du Pin) though some refer this psalm to the conspiracy of Absalom, (Theodoret; Menochius) or to the unpremeditated fall of David, (Eusebius) or to the captives. (St. Chrysostom) 
Our Saviour repeated part of ver. 6., upon the cross; and he may perhaps be the object of the whole psalm. The Church prescribes only the six first verses to be recited at Complin. (Berthier)
