Please, complacebam, "treat lovingly. "(Haydock) 
Vulgate follows the regimen of the Septuagint euerestoun, which may govern an accusative case. Hebrew is plainer, "I walked "(Berthier) or "behaved myself as though he had been my friend or brother. "(Protestants) (Haydock) 
So. Septuagint seem to have explained am, "truly "instead of mother; as the points would determine the Hebrew, "like one who bewails his mother "(Berthier) or, "like a mother mourning, I bowed down in grief. "(St. Jerome) 
An ancient Greek interpreter has, "like one mourning for a brother born of the same mother. "I felt the affliction of my enemies and sympathized with them, endeavouring to alleviate their distress as much as possible. (Calmet) 
Such was the conduct of David, the figure of the Messias; so that the expressions which seem too strong, must not be taken for imprecations. (Berthier) 
Christ was the good Samaritan who relieved the wounded man, Luke x. (Worthington) 
St. Paul admonishes us to weep with those who weep, Romans xii. 15. (Menochius)
