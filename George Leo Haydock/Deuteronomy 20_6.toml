Common. Hebrew, "hath not profaned it. "(Menochius) 
During the three first years, the fruit was not eaten. In the fourth it was sacred to the Lord, and given to the priests, so that the owner could not partake of the fruit till the fifth year, when it ceased to be in a manner sacred. Jonathan translates, "and has not redeemed it "by paying the first-fruits of the fifth year. Septuagint, "has not rejoiced in it "by feasting, as was probably the custom at the first vintage. Other fruit-trees entitled the owner to the like privilege. (Schikard., Jus. reg. 5.) 
Whereof all may eat, is added by the Vulgate to explain what is meant by common. (Calmet)
