Gezonite. We know not the meaning of this epithet. (Calmet) 
In 2 Kings, we read of the sons of Jassen, Jonathan, and Semma; (K.) but both seem to be incorrect; instead of Septuagint, "the son "or supposing m to be lost, at the beginning, "of the sons of Assem, Gouni "as Septuagint read, instead of Gezonite, which would leave this hero without any name. See chap. v. 15. E is prefixed to this name, as it is to that of Manasses, Josue i. 12. 
Sage, should be Shamha, (Kennicott) or Jonathan, the son of Samaa, the brother of David. He slew the monstrous giant, (chap. xx. 7.) as Saba chai did another. Jonathan is mentioned also along with Asahel (2 Kings xxi.) so that he deserves a place here among David's heroes.
