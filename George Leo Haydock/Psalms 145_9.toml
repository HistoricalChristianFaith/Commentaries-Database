Works. The people of Israel (ver. 10., and Psalm lxxxix. 18.; Ferrand) and all mankind, who are all invited to embrace the true faith, and the mercy of God. (Calmet) 
The effects of mercy shine forth above all his other works, in the redemption, and in the recalling of sinners, when they have gone astray. (Worthington) 
This sense is good, but not literal. His mercy extends to all. (Berthier) 
Yet he punishes the reprobate for ever, chastising their works. (St. Augustine)
