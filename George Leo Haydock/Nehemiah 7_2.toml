House: "the citadel "(Tigurin) "palace. "(Vatable) 
The Septuagint retain the original, Beira, (Haydock) which signifies a palace, (Pagnin) concerning which Nehemias had spoken, chap. ii. 8. (Menochius) 
But as it was not yet built, the house, being placed alone, more properly signifies the temple. We read of Zacharias and Jehiel, who occupied the same post (Calmet) as Hananias, 2 Paralipomenon xxxv. 8. (Haydock) He was next to Eliasib, the high priest. (Calmet)
