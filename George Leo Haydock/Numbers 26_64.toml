Sinai, if we except the Levites. (Menochius) See chap. xiv. 23. 
Origen (hom. 21.) makes a very good remark on this subject. This circumcised, but rebellious people, conducted by Moses into the desert, clearly points out the Hebrews, who come to the frontiers of the promised land, but are not suffered to cross the Jordan. The uncircumcised are introduced into the land flowing with milk and honey, not by Moses, but by Josue, the figure of our Saviour, who opens heaven to true believers. "The first people is rejected, which had received circumcision, and the second is introduced, which is gathered from the Gentiles; and it is this people which obtains its father's inheritance. If Moses give any inheritance, it is not within the Jordan.it is a land fit for cattle. He does not distribute it by lot. Nor can he know the merits of each. This is done by Jesus only, to whom his Father has given all judgment. "(Haydock)
