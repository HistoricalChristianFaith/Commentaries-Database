You have no need You want not to be taught by any of these men, who, under pretence of imparting more knowledge to you, seek to seduce you, (ver. 26) since you are sufficiently taught already, and have all knowledge and grace in the Church, with the unction of the Holy Spirit, which these new teachers have no share in. (Challoner) 
His unction teacheth you concerning all things. Unction here signifies the doctrine which they received together with the Holy Spirit or Spirit of God; in which he exhorts them to remain, as being sufficient for their instruction, and to make them avoid the new teachers of false doctrine. (Witham)
