The queen of heaven; the moon, which they worshipped under this name, (Challoner) as also under that of the Celestial Venus, (Theodoret) Diana, and Isis. It seems the Jews had engaged by vow (ver. 27.) to restore her worship. (Calmet) 
The women more particularly adored the moon: yet all were guilty, chap. vii. 18., and 4 Kings xxiii. 5. (Worthington)
