Astaroth. The like custom was observed by the Hebrew, (chap. xxi. 9,) and by the Greeks and Romans, (Calmet) to acknowledge that victory was granted by God.

He only avoided the mortification of hearing them while he was forced to attend to the furies below. 
Body, with those of his three sons, ver. 12. (Haydock) 
Saul's head was hung up in the temple of Dagon, at Azotus; (1 Paralipomenon x. 10,) his body was suspended on the wall or street of Bethsan; (2 Kings xxi. 12,) or in the most public place, near the gate of the city.
