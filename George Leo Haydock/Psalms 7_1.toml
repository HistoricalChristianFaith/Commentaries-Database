] Shiggaion (Haydock) is a word which has greatly puzzled interpreters. See Robertson in shoge. Protestants have, "Shiggaion of David. "The Rabbins confess that they know not its meaning, and it is of no service for the explanation of the psalm. (Berthier) 
St. Jerome follows the Septuagint, (Haydock) which may suit very well. Others have, "ignorance. "(Menochius) 
"Perplexity. "(Calmet) 
"Secret. "(Vatable) 
"Song of wanderings. "(Parkhurst) 
Chusi is scarcely less difficult to understand. The person who has inserted this historical title, and many others, without much judgment, had probably in view the wars of Absalom, and the curses of Semei. But the psalm seems rather to refer to the persecutions of Saul, (Calmet; 1 Kings xxii. 8.; Menochius) who was of the tribe of Benjamin. (Haydock) 
Sts. Augustine, Basil, and Chrysostom explain it of Chusi, (Worthington) the Arachite, from a town of Benjamin, (Calmet) who defeated the counsel of Achitophel, (Worthington) as it is supposed that David was given to understand that his friend had betrayed him, and in consequence speaks of him in such harsh terms. But if that had been the case, he would have suppressed what was founded on error; (Calmet) and the supposition is contrary to the idea which we have of inspiration. Yet there is nothing in the psalm which requires the harsh expressions to be applied to Chusi. They may as well refer to Achitophel, who spoke in answer to him.

My God. This title is prompted by love and confidence. (Haydock) 
All. David had only few followers, while he was pursued by Saul (Calmet) and Absalom. (Haydock)
