To know. This is the design of these parables. (Calmet) 
They tend to instruct both the unexperienced and the wise, ver. 5. There are three sorts of wisdom: the divine, which is God himself; (chap. iii. 16.) the supernatural, which is his gift, to lead us into all virtue; and the worldly, which is mixed with error (Worthington) (Wisdom vii. 25.)
