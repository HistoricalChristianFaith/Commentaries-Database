Majesty, viz., of God. For to search into that incomprehensible Majesty, and to pretend to sound the depths of the wisdom of God, is exposing our weak understanding to be blinded with an excess of light and glory, which it cannot comprehend. (Challoner) 
When the Church proposes to us any mystery, we have only to believe. Hebrew, "but it is glorious to sound their glory "and see where the wicked end, that we may not envy them, chap. iii. 31., and Psalm xxxvi. 7. (Calmet) 
Protestants, "so for men to search their own glory, is not glory "but a sin. (Haydock) 
"It is not good to eat too much honey "(Chaldean) or to sound the glorious words of God and wisdom, or the mysteries of religion. Septuagint, "But it is right to reverence glorious speeches "(Calmet) with esteem and humility. (Cat. Gr√¶c.)
