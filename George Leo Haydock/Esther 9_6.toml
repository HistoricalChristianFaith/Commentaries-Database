Sons. It seems as if they had been slain with their father, ver. 10. See chap. vii. 9. (Calmet) 
Yet, as the contrary would appear from chap. xvi. 18, we may suppose that they were at least (Haydock) imprisoned till this time, for a more exemplary punishment, while all the rest of the family perished with Aman. (Serarius) (Salien) (Menochius) 
These are the kindred, specified nine months before, chap. xvi. (Tirinus) 
Some Masorets childishly (Haydock) write these ten names one over another, and with greater and less letters, to show that they were hung one above another, and that the guilt of all was not the same, but the youngest son was the most malicious. (Kennicott)
