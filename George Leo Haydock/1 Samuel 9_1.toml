Choice, is taken in the same sense as goodly, and does not intimate that Saul was one of the elect. (Denis the Carthusian) Ver. 3. Asses. The greatest noblemen rode upon such, Judges v. 10. A prince of Esau fed asses, Genesis xxx. 24. Agriculture, and keeping sheep, were the employment of men of the first eminence in the heroic ages, as hunting and other equally laborious exercises are now in fashion. (Calmet) Ver. 4.

What. Were they uninformed of the disinterestedness of Samuel? or did they think that he would sell his oracles? By no means. But the manners of the ancients were very different from ours, and people chose to show their respect for God, the king, prophets, by making them some present. People still never go to visit one another in Syria without something of the kind, as it would be deemed uncivil or cruel to act otherwise. See 3 Kings xiv. 1., and Micheas iii. 11. 
Bread. They would have made a present of some. Saul received two loaves, chap. x. 4. See chap. xvi. 20. Hence we may form some idea of the beautiful simplicity of those ages. People were then forced to carry their own provisions, as there were no inns which supplied any. (Calmet)

A sacrifice. The law did not allow of sacrifices in any other place, but at the tabernacle, or temple, in which the ark of the covenant was kept; but Samuel, by divine dispensation, offered sacrifices in other places. For which dispensation this reason may be alleged, that the house of God in Silo, having lost the ark, was now cast off; as a figure of the reprobation of the Jews, Psalm lxxvii. 60, 67. And in Cariathiarim, where the ark was, there was neither tabernacle, nor altar. (Challoner)

On one of these, at Ramatha, Samuel was going to offer a peace-offering, and to feast with the heads of the city, (Calmet) or perhaps of the nation, who were expecting the result of his consultation of the Lord, respecting their petition of a king. (Haydock) Ver. 13. The victim, begging the blessing, which was the office of the most honourable person at table, as he also gave thanks for all. (Calmet) Ver. 14. Midst.

Heart, or desirest to know. (Menochius) Ver. 20. Best. The regal power, which all desired. Hebrew, "to or on whom is all the desire of Israel? "Any great felicity is called a desire, as the Messias, the spouse in the Canticle , v. 16. (Aggeus ii. 8.) Septuagint, "to whom the beautiful things of Israel? "Ver. 21. Jemini, or Benjamin, which was always one of the smallest tribes, and, since the unfortunate war, still more reduced; so that none of the other tribes could well take umbrage, or be filled with jealousy, when they saw a king selected from it. 
Last. Though all were equally noble, yet some families were more numerous, possessed greater riches, or had filled the posts of honour more frequently than others. Nothing can be more charming than the modesty of Saul on this occasion. (Calmet)

It was the left, (Menochius) as the right shoulder belonged to the priest, and laymen were not allowed to taste of it after it had been offered in sacrifice, Leviticus vii. 32. Some suppose that Samuel had this right shoulder for his portion. But he was not a priest. (Calmet) 
This part was assigned to the most eminent man at table; and Josephus calls it "the royal portion. "(Menochius)
