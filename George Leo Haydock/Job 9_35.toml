Fear him. Septuagint, "and I shall not fear, but speak. For I am not conscious to myself of injustice. "(Haydock) 
The dread of incurring God's displeasure makes me prefer to be silent; and if I had no other reason, this fear would suffice, as I should not be master of myself under such anxiety and pain. (Calmet)
