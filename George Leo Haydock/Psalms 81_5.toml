Joseph. Who represents all the family of Israel, as he took care of it. (Calmet) (Psalm lxxix. 2.) (Worthington) 
Not. The Israelites heard the voice of God at Sinai, (St. Jerome; Calmet) and for the last time, where forced to hear the insults of the Egyptians at their heels; (Haydock) whose language was barbarous to them, (Psalm cxiii. 1.; Menochius) and not well understood by all, as they had very little society together. Joseph spoke to his brethren by an interpreter. (Haydock) 
Some explain this of Joseph himself, when he first came into Egypt, (Chaldean. Bossuet) or of the Israelites, at their arrival there. (Vatable) 
But this agrees not with the Vulgate or Hebrew, (Haydock) the latter of which is very confused and incorrect, though it be adopted (Calmet) by St. Jerome: "I heard a tongue which I knew not, I withdrew", (Haydock) or, making a small alteration, "God hast established this festival in Joseph, when He appeared in the land of Egypt to rescue his people: then said the Lord, I made him hear a language which he knew not, that I was the protector of my people, I will remove "(Calmet) 
The authors of the Pin. disc. take this liberty, which would make the sense pretty clear. But the Hebrew means, "I heard "Some not being able to understand this, have substituted, "He heard "with the German version. (Berthier) 
The ancient Greek interpreters seem to have read the same, as no variation is noticed. (Calmet) 
If, however, we must explain the Hebrew of St. Jerome, we must suppose that, "I knew not, means I condemned, as it often does; and God certainly reprobated the harsh language of the Egyptian task-masters, and came to deliver his people from oppression, Exodus ii. 25., and iii. 8., and v. 14. (Haydock) Ver. 7. Baskets. Hebrew, "brazen. "(Montanus) 
"His hands shall pass from the pots. "(Protestants) 
Dud, means also, "basket. "(Haydock) 
The Hebrews were thus forced to carry mortar, (Menochius) straw (Worthington)
