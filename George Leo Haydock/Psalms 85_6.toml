Turn, conversus. The ancient psalters read convertens. "Converting, O God, thou wilt bring us to life "free us from captivity, and redeem us from sin by Jesus Christ, the conqueror of death. (Calmet) 
Before their conversion sinners lie dead in guilt. (Worthington) 
O God, thou wilt again restore us to life. (Du Hamel)
