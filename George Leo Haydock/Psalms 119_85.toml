Fables. Idle tales, not agreeable to God's law. (Worthington) 
Such were the theology and histories of the pagans. (Calmet) 
Such are still the false maxims of the world, and many books designed to corrupt the morals of the age. (Haydock) 
The Jews confined themselves to their own divine books. Hebrew, Chaldean, "The proud have dug pits for me, which is not conformable to thy law "(Calmet) but forbidden expressly. (Haydock) 
The Septuagint seem to have followed a better reading. (Calmet) 
Houbigant rejects the word pits, and in effect, we may understand the Hebrew in the sense of the Vulgate, "They have prepared (or told me) vain discourses. "(Berthier)
