Ennom. Hebrew, Ge-ben-Hinnom, or simply Ge-ennom, whence Gehenan has probably been formed. In this vale, children were immolated to Moloc: the beating of drums, to hinder their lamentations from being heard, caused it perhaps to be called Tophet. It was to the east of Jerusalem, (Calmet) inclining to the south. (Haydock) 
Northward. The valley extends south to Bethlehem. (Josephus, vii. 10.) Here David gained a great victory, 2 Kings v. 23. (Calmet) 
Woods. This explanation is added by St. Jerome. (Haydock) 
The ark remained at this city for some time, 1 Kings xv. 6. It was 10 miles north of Jerusalem.
