A covenant of salt. That is, a firm and perpetual covenant. See Numbers xviii. 19. (Challoner) (Worthington) 
It seemed this covenant was to be inviolable; and it had its effect, notwithstanding the crimes of many of the kings. The Arabs still regard the partaking of bread and salt as the most sacred covenant. (Calmet) 
"The ancients prayed when they placed salt before their guests, that, as salt partook of two natures, so they might be cemented together in concord. "(Tzetzez on Lycoph.) (Haydock) 
Abia speaks with much prudence, and with an air of piety, though his heart was corrupt, 3 Kings xv. 3. That of his adversary was still more so; and God granted victory to the former, to reward even the appearance of virtue in the king, and the sincere piety of some of his followers.
