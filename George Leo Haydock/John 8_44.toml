You are of your father, the devil, and have made yourselves his slaves. 
He was a murderer from the beginning of the world, having brought both a corporal and a spiritual death by sin, upon all mankind. 
He abode not in the truth, in the ways of truth and obedience to God. 
He is a liar, and the father thereof: that is, the father of lies. I speak truth, being truth itself. (Witham) -- St. Augustine compares heretics, who drive Christians out of the Church, to the devil, who was the cause of our first parents' banishment from paradise. (Cont. lit. Petil. lib. ii. chap. 13.)
