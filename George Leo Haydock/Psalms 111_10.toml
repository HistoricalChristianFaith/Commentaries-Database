Fear. Hebrew, "is the chief part of wisdom. "(Jansenius) 
This fear intimates the virtue of religion, to which the Israelites gave the preference over prudence (Josephus, contra App. 2.) 
This distinguished them from other nations, Deuteronomy iv. 8. (Calmet) 
Fear is the beginning, charity the end of wisdom. (Eusebius) 
Beginning with fear, we ascend to true wisdom, which are the first and last of the gifts of the Holy Spirit. (Worthington) 
Do it. Act conformably to this fear. (Haydock) 
Speculative wisdom is good, but not sufficient, Romans xi. 13. (St. Chrysostom) 
Many read ea, "those things "with the Hebrew, while the Septuagint have eam, this wisdom. But Houbigant adheres to the Vulgate. (Berthier) 
His. God's, (St. Chrysostom) though some would refer ejus to intellectus. (Berthier) 
He shall be praised for ever who has been so well informed as to adopt the fear or wisdom of the Lord for his guide. (Haydock)
