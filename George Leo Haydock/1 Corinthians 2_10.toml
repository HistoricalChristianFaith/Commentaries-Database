But to us God hath revealed them by his Spirit; these mysteries, and secrets of the divine wisdom. 
For the Spirit searcheth all things: the divine Spirit, the Holy Spirit, searcheth all things, and none but this Spirit of God, that is, this Spirit, which is God, knoweth the things that are of God, as none but the spirit that is in man, knoweth the things of man, knoweth his thoughts and interior affections. But by the Spirit of God, we may understand the spirit of grace, of knowledge, of prophecy, which God hath given to his faithful, and particularly to his apostles, to raise them to a higher knowledge of the divine mysteries. (Witham)
