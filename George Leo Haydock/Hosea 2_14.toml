I will allure her After her disloyalties, I will still allure her by my grace, and send her vine-dressers, viz., the apostles, originally her own children, who shall open to her the gates of hope; as heretofore, at her coming into the land of promise, she had all good success after she had satisfied the divine justice by the execution of Achan, in the valley of Achor, Josue vii. (Challoner) 
Septuagint, "I will seduce or make her stray "plano. (Haydock) 
I will permit her to yield to error, in captivity; (Theodoret) or will cause her hopes to be frustrated yet in exile I will comfort her. The Jews were not changed till they had seen the vanity of idols, and suffered much. (Calmet) 
God's grace prevents sinners, that they may be converted. (Worthington)
