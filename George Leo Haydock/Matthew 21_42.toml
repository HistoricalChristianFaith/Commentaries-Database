The head of the corner. By these words, (Psalm cxvii,) which the Jews themselves expounded of their Messias, Christ showed them, that although they, who should have been the architects, had rejected him, yet he should be the chief corner-stone to unite the Jews and the Gentiles, converted into one Christian Church, militant on earth and triumphant in heaven. See Acts iv. 11. (Witham) 
St. Augustine remarks, that this parable was addressed not only to the opponents of Christ's authority, but likewise to the people.
