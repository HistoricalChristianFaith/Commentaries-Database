Hesebon in the north, to Dibon in the southern extremity of the conquered country, near the Arnon, where Moses places the station of Dibon-gad. The yoke, or dominion of the Moabites, was ruined in all those parts. (Calmet) 
Hebrew, "We have shot at them; or their lamp, (children or power,) from Hesebon as far as Dibon is extinguished; and their wives (or we have destroyed them) even unto Nophe and Medaba. "Septuagint, "Their women have still kindled a fire against Moab. "Nophe is probably the Nabo of Isaias, (xv. 2,) in the environs of Medaba, where the fainting Moabites had time to breathe. The fire, which the Septuagint say the women enkindled against Moab, might seem to indicate that the war was commenced on their account, like that which brought on the destruction of Troy. They entailed a still heavier destruction upon their country, when, by alluring the Hebrews to sin, they enkindled God's indignation, chap xxv. With this verse the quotation, from the Amorrhite proverbial writers, concludes, ver. 27. (Haydock)
