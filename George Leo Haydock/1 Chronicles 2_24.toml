Hesron. Perhaps it ought to be Azuba, ver. 19. Hebrew, "and after Hesron was dead, in Caleb-ephrata, then Abia, the wife of Hesron, bore him a (posthumous) son, Ashur, the father of those who dwelt at Thecua. "He could not reside there himself no more than Caleb did at Bethlehem, which some, without proof, pretend was called Caleb-ephrata. The Septuagint agree with the Vulgate. They may signify that Caleb went to the town of Ephrata. But the son of Hebron certainly never resided at Bethlehem. (Calmet)
