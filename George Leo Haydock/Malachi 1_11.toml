Sacrifice. Protestant, "incense. "(Haydock) 
Clean oblation. The precious body and blood of Christ in the eucharistic sacrifice. (Challoner) 
This is denoted by the very word mincha, the offering of flour and wine. (Calmet) See St. Justin Martyr, Dialogue with Trypho; St. Iren us, Against Heresies iv. 32.; St. Augustine, City of God xviii. 35.) 
"We pollute this bread, that is the body of Christ, when we approach the altar unworthily. "(St. Jerome v. 7.) 
This sacrifice is always pure, though the priest or receiver be otherwise. (Calmet) 
Hence it is always clean. (Council of Trent, session xxii. chap. i.) (Menochius) 
It is offered daily throughout the world. The Jews see the completion of this prediction, and are vexed; they strive to elude its force. Though enemies, they bear about these proofs of our faith, and of their own condemnation. (Calmet) 
God not only changed his people, but instituted a better sacrifice. Instead of the former needy elements, (Galatians iv.) which were often defiled by the sins of the offerers, He instituted the sacrifice of his own Body and Blood, under the appearance of bread and wine, as St. Chrysostom (in Psalm xcv.), Theodoret, prove against all opponents. A sacrifice different from any offered by the Jews, who could offer only at Jerusalem, (Deuteronomy xvi.) is clearly specified, as many have demonstrated. (Worthington) 
Christ's bloody sacrifice on the cross was performed on Calvary, and not among the Gentiles. What sacrifice can Protestants now produce? (Haydock)
