Idol. That is, if Galaad, with all its idols and sacrifices, be like a mere idol itself, being brought to nothing by Theglathphalassar, how vain is it to expect that the idols worshipped in Galgal shall be of any service to the tribes that remain. (Challoner) 
Will these idols be more powerful? Septuagint copies vary. Roman edition has Galaad, and Comp. Galgal in both places. But that of St. Jerome and of Theodoret is better. 
Heaps of stones. They are in ruins, or very numerous: (Calmet) yet have not secured the country. (Haydock)
