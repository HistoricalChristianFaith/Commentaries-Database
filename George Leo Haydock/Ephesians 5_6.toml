The apostle here puts them in mind of the general judgment, when the angel of God will, on account of their crimes of avarice, fornication fall on the children of unbelief; by which are meant the wicked. He had before assured them that the perpetrators of such crimes would be excluded from the kingdom of heaven; and now he moreover informs them, that the severest punishments will be inflicted on such wicked persons. (Estius)
