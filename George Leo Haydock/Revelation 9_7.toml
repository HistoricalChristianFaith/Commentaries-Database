And the shapes of the locusts. We now come to the description of these locusts, which expresses the spirit of sedition and rebellion that animated the reformers and their proselytes. Luther proclaimed himself the leader in this as well as in other articles of the new discipline: see his works, particularly Contra statem Ecclesiæ et falsò nominatum ordinem Episcoporum, lib. contra Sylvest. Prieras, De Sæculari potestate et Contra Rusticos Erasmus thus describes the effects of the inflammatory doctrine of these ministers of evangelical liberty: "I saw them (the people) come forth from their sermons with fierce looks and threatening countenances "like men "that just come from hearing bloody invectives and seditious speeches. "Accordingly, we found "these evangelical people always ready to rise up in arms, and equally as good at fighting as at disputing. "The learned Protestant historian, Dr. Heylin, in his Cosmography, (B. i.) says of the Calvinists: "Rather than their discipline should not be admitted, and the episcopal government destroyed in all the Churches of Christ, they were resolved to depose kings, ruin kingdoms, and to subvert the fundamental constitutions of all civil states. "
