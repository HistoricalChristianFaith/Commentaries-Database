That no man overreach, nor deceive his brother in business. The Protestant and Mr. N. even in their translations, add, in any matter, because some expound it of frauds and circumventions in any kind of business. But this addition of any, should be left out, seeing the best interpreters expound it of a prohibition of adultery, and the injury thereby done to another, and of sins of that kind only, which is confirmed by what follows and what goes before. See St. Jerome in chap. iv. ad Ephes. tom. 4. p. 369.; St. Chrysostom serm. 3 on this place. Here, says he, he speaks of adultery, as before of fornication See Theodoret, Theophylactus, Estius, Menochius, Cornelius a Lap ide (Witham)
