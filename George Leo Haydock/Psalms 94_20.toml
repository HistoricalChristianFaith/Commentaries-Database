Doth the seat of iniquity stick to thee? That is, wilt thou, O God, who art always just, admit of the seat of iniquity; that is, of injustice, or unjust judges, to have any partnership with thee? Thou, who framest, or makest labour in commandment; that is, thou who obligest us to labour with all diligence to keep thy commandments; (Challoner) as faith alone is not sufficient, (Worthington) and who art pleased that we should find therein some difficulty or repugnance of nature, that we may be the more entitled to consolation, ver. 19. (Haydock) 
Commandment, or "instruction. "St. Augustine observes, that the sufferings of this life are for our instruction, to admonish us of future punishments and rewards. This idea is very luminous. (Berthier) 
Christ was first to suffer, and so to enter into his glory, Luke xxiv. 26. (Haydock) 
Nemo dormiens coronatur. (St. Jerome) 
Yet the yoke of Christ is really sweet. The devil tempts us to look upon it as insupportable. (St. Bernard) 
Framest, fingis. 
Septuagint, St. Augustine, Fingit, which may refer to the seat, or to unjust judges, who tyrannize over others, as the Babylonians did, (Calmet) and as the Jews conspired against the soul of the just. "Should the tribunal of perversity have any commerce with thee, which, under the name of law, forms impious machinations? "(Houbigant)
