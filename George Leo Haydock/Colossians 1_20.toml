To reconcile all things unto himself. Through the blood of his cross, (i.e. which Christ shed on the cross) both as to the things on earth, and.in heaven: not that Christ died for the Angels, but, says St. Chrysostom, the Angels were in a manner at war with men, with sinners, as they stood for the cause and glory of God; but Christ put an end to this enmity, by restoring men to his favour. (Witham) 
In heaven. Not by pardoning the wicked angels did Christ reconcile the things in heaven, but by reconciling good Angels to man, who were enemies to him before the birth of Christ. (St. Augustine)
