Strong. Hebrew el, means also "God threatening every day "(Haydock) which must be a proof of his patience, as the Septuagint have intimated, since he could destroy at once. Thus numquid, must be rendered "is he not? "(Isaias xxvii. 7.) (Berthier) 
God cannot but be displeased at every sin. He threatens the offender daily by secret remorse, or by his preachers and good books. (Haydock) 
But he often defers punishment (Worthington) till death, when the measure of crimes is full. (St. Augustine) 
This silence or delay is one of the most terrible of his judgments, (Haydock) and a mark of his great indignation. If he were, however, to strike every one as soon as he had committed sin, where should we be? "He would soon be alone "as a pagan observed of "Jupiter, if he were presently to hurl his thunderbolts against every offender. "(Calmet) See Val. Max. i. 2. (Ecclesiasticus v. 4.)
