Of sacrifice. Hebrew mincha, which is applied to inanimate things, particularly to flour, "a present of wheat. "(Vatable) 
As the other sacrifices have peculiar names, this is barely called sacrifice by the Vulgate. It was instituted, 1. for the poor; 2. to support the ministers of religion; 3. to show that God was to be honoured with the fruits of the earth; 4. sacrifice being intended as a sort of feast, bread, salt, wine, and oil accompany it; and also incense, which was almost solely reserved for God. (Menochius) 
The person who offered the sacrifice, had to furnish all things belonging to it. The Samaritan and Septuagint add at the end of this verse, "Behold what is the offering of the Lord. "Similar words occur, (ver. 6. and 16,) in Hebrew. Sacrifices of flour were the most ancient of all. Ovid (Fast. ii.) says, Farra tamen veteres jaciebant, farra metebant "Numa taught the people to worship the gods with fruits and flour, and to make supplication with a salted cake. "(Pliny, xviii. 2.) Fruge deos colere,molâ salsâ supplicare. (Calmet)
