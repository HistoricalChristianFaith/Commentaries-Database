Buzite, a descendant of Buz, the son of Nachor, Genesis xxii. 21. (Calmet) 
Of Septuagint, "of the country of Hus. "
Ram. Chaldean, "Abraham "(Menochius) or rather (Haydock) this is put for Aram. Symmachus, "Syria "2 Paralipomenon xxii. 5. Some suppose that Eliu sprung from Aram, the son of Esron, of the tribe of Juda. Others think that (Calmet) he was the same with Balaam. (St. Jerome; Ven. Bede) 
He is never ranked among the friends of Job, as he perhaps did not come from a distance. His speech, or good intention, is not condemned by God; and Job seems to have acquiesced in what he said. (Calmet) 
This silence of the latter might rather proceed from a just (Haydock) contempt, as Eliu said nothing to the purpose; many of his observations being palpably false, and others not at all controverted. Yet with his private spirit he comes forth, not much unlike Protestants and Puritans, who pretend that they will overturn the Catholic faith by arguments which have escaped the sagacity of all preceding ages! (Worthington) 
God also did not let Eliu pass entirely unnoticed; but, in one line, showed his displeasure: (chap. xxxviii. 2.; Houbigant) as Job perhaps did likewise, by repeating the same decision, chap. xlii. 3. (Haydock) 
Eliu vainly explains why he had not spoken before. He arraigns Job for asserting his own innocence, though the holy man only maintained that he was not punished thus for his crimes, according to the laws of vindictive justice; (chap. xxvii. 2.) much less did he pretend that he was juster than God, (chap. xxxv. 2.) as his adversary asserts; taking thence occasion to praise the divine wisdom and power, as if Job had called them in question. (Calmet) 
God, whose eyes behold the smallest faults. (Menochius) 
Hebrew, "rather on, or (Haydock) above God. "(Calmet) 
This young man, who was learned and proud, is the pattern of those hot disputants who set themselves above their elders. (St. Gregory xxiii. 2.) (Worthington)
