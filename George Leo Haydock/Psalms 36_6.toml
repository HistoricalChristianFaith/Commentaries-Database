Of God. A title which is often given to things of superior excellence. So divina condimenta of Plautus, (Pseudol.) denote ragouts or sauces of the best quality; (Haydock) and sacra fames of Virgil, means great hunger. See Jonas iii. 3., Canticle of Canticles viii. 6. 
Deep. After praising the mercy of God, the psalmist expresses his admiration of his inscrutable justice, Romans xi. 33. (Calmet) 
Preserve, salvabis. The latter are designed only for man's benefit, and will end with time. (Haydock) 
But man is destined for eternal happiness, ver. 9. (Calmet) 
God wishes the salvation of both the learned and of the stupid, (St. Jerome; Worthington) of the Jew and Gentile, (Arnob.; 1 Timothy iv. 10.) of good and bad. He makes his sun to shine on both, Matthew v. 45. (Eusebius) (Piscator) (Calmet)
