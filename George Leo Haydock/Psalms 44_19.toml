Affliction. Hebrew, or "dragons "(St. Jerome; Menochius) alluding to the deserts, to which the Jews retired, when the Assyrians invaded them. The text may be more applicable to the first Christians, who might truly say, that they had not transgressed. (Houbigant) -- To the martyrs, death was but like a shadow. (St. Gregory) (Mark iv. 17.) 
Here it denotes great darkness and misery. (Menochius)
