Us. Christ, who comes in the name of the Lord, "is himself God "our instructor. (St. Augustine) (Titus ii. 11.) (Berthier) 
Day. The feast of tabernacles, for which this psalm was probably composed. The Jews dwelt under tents. (Calmet) (Leviticus xxiii. 40., and 2 Esdras vii. 15.) 
Altar. Hebrew, "Bind a festival with cords unto the horns "To make sense, the Chaldean inserts, bind the lamb for the festival. But this Houbigant ridicules, and he believes that the solemn entrance of Jesus Christ into Jerusalem is here foretold. Scarcely any prediction in the Old Testament is more clearly verified in the new, Matthew xxi. 8. Hebrew Bahabothim certainly means, "in ramis opacis "and St. Jerome translates, "frequent the solemnity in shady boughs. "(Berthier) 
The victims were never tied to the altar, but slain in the porch of the northern gate, Ezechiel xl. 39. (Calmet)
