Sacrifice, not simply kill, as the Protestants would have it. (Worthington) 
Evening. Hebrew, "between the two evenings "or "suns "according to the Chaldee, alluding to the sun when it declines and when it sets, including about the space of two hours. This time belonged to the evening of the 14th , at which time the lamb was to be sacrificed, though it was to be eaten in the night, which pertained to the 15th. (Menochius) 
The Jews began the day at sun-set, and some began the first evening soon after mid-day. (Matthew xiv. 15, and seq.) (Calmet)
