Fears. Hunters used to place loose feathers round the wood, except where the gin was laid, in order to frighten the prey into it. Puniceæque agitant form dine pennæ. (Georg. iii.) (Jeremias xlviii. 44.) "Like timid stags, while you avoid the moving feathers, you are entrapped in the strongest nets. "(St. Jerome, contra Lucif.) 
Every thing tends to fill the poor beast with alarm. So the devil, conscience, and enemies on all sides, beset the wicked. (Calmet)
