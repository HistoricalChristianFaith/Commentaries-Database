Ser. The Septuagint seem to have read rather differently. "And the fortified, or walled cities of the Tyrians, Tyre and Emath, (and) Bekkath "(Haydock) 
Assedim may be the name of a people. The situation of Ser is also unknown. 
Emath is the famous Emesa, Numbers xiii. 22. (Calmet) 
Tyre, belong to Aser, and not to Nephthali, as the Septuagint might insinuate. But Emesa would be within the borders of the latter. (Haydock) 
Cenereth, the lake of that name, as St. Jerome says that the city of Cenereth was Tiberias, on the southern extremity of the lake whereas Nephthali possessed only the northern part. (Calmet) 
Bonfrere supposes that Caphernaum, or some adjacent city, is meant; and indeed the first words of the verse indicate that a list is given of the strong cities, unless that should be restricted to those of the Assedim, which are not specified. (Haydock)
