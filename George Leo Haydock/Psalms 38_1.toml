Wrath. God is incapable of passion: but man deserves to be treated with the utmost rigour; and this David deprecates, begging that God would act rather like a physician in his regard. (Theodoret) (Calmet) 
The same petition occurs in psalm vi.; and this ought to caution people not to make imprecations, since God's judgments are so terrible. (Berthier) 
St. Augustine and St. Gregory explain this text of the fire of hell, and of purgatory, 1 Corinthians iii. 15. (Haydock) 
Though some be saved by the latter, "yet is that fire more grievous than whatever man can suffer in this life. "(St. Augustine) 
"I esteem that transitory fire more intolerable than all present tribulation. "(St. Gregory) (Worthington) 
We may therefore pray, "Here burn", with the same St. Augustine who assures us, (Gen. con. Man. ii. 20.) that "he who cultivates not the field of his soul, will, after this life, experience either the fire of purgatory or eternal punishment. "(Haydock)

For a remembrance, viz., of our miseries and sins; and to be sung on the sabbath-day. (Challoner) 
This sabbath might also allude to the indolent rest which occasioned the fall of David, 2 Kings xi. 1. (Haydock) 
Hebrew mentions not the sabbath; and it is not known (Calmet) why the Septuagint made this addition. The prophet may have Christ suffering for our sins in view, (Berthier) though he probably composed this psalm, when he was afflicted with an illness after this fall. (Rab. Muis) (Calmet) 
It contains an excellent model for penitents, (Calmet) to enable them to regain peace of conscience, (St. Gregory) and paradise, from which they are banished by sin. (St. Augustine) 
This remembrance (Worthington) is most essential. (Haydock)
