Food. Tertullian reads "drink "which agrees better with gall. Yet it might be mixed with food, (Calmet) with wine and myrrh, which were given to our Saviour, when he arrived at Calvary, as vinegar was offered to him on the cross, Matthew xxvii. 34., and John xix. 28. This was the last prophecy which regarded our Saviour, while living; and was the last instance of the Jewish malice, by which they requited him for the thirst which he had for the salvation of mankind. (Gregory of Nazianzus) (Berthier) 
Jeremias (viii. 14., and xxiii. 15., and Lamentations iii. 15.) uses the same expressions, in a metaphorical sense, to describe the afflictions of the captives. (Calmet)
