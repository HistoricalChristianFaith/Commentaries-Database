Though there were other holy women standing by the cross, he takes notice of none but his mother, teaching us, by this, what we owe to our parents. For although it is our duty to disown them, when they place obstacles in our way to salvation; yet when they do not thus impede us, we owe every thing to them, and must prefer them to all. (S. Chrysostom, hom. lxxxiv. in Joan.) 
We learn also here, what should be our respect and confidence in this Virgin Mother, so highly honoured by her divine Son. Ver. 27. The disciple took her to his own home, or into his own are, not for his mother, by the Greek expression. See St. Chrysostom and St. Augustine. (Witham)
