Gods. The people look upon you as such, and treat you with respect. But entertain not sentiments of pride on that account. (Calmet) 
If judges, even those whom God condemns, may be styled gods without blasphemy, how much more might Jesus Christ, who was holy and did the works of God? He uses this argument to make the fury of the people abate: but then he continues to prove that he was God in a very different and proper sense, insomuch that the Jews, clearly perceiving his meaning, which Socinians would now mistake, took up stones to throw at him, John x. 34. (Haydock) 
If he had not been God, He would surely have told them plainly, as St. Paul did when people would have offered sacrifice to him, and as St. John the Baptist confessed that he was not the Christ. The sons of Seth, priests, the just, and all the Israelites, were styled sons of God, as well as the angels and judges, Genesis vi. 2., Psalm xxviii. 1., Wisdom v. 5., and Job i. 6. But no individual is called the Son, except Jesus Christ the true God. (Berthier) 
This passage may be understood of all the faithful, (St. Augustine) particularly of bishops: and Constantine the Great was hence deterred from judging them (St. Gregory i. dec. Grat. p. 2. c. 11. q. 1.) or the clergy; (St. Melchiades c. 12. q. 1.) though this name seems inaccurate, as he died before (Glossa) the council of Nice. Amama restrains the text to men in power. (Haydock) 
Their elevated station makes their ignorance and misconduct less excusable. (Menochius)
