They have imitated, or gone in the way of Cain, who murdered his brother; and they have a mortal hatred against the faithful. They have imitated Balaam and his covetousness, (see 2 Peter ii. 15.) and Core, (Numbers xvi.) who with others opposed Moses; and as these sinners perished, so will they. (Witham) 
Way Heretics follow the way of Cain, by murdering the souls of their brethren; the way of Balaam by putting a scandal before the people of God, for their own private ends; and the way of Core or Korah, by their opposition to the church governors of divine appointment. (Challoner)
