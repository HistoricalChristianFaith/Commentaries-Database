Precious. Is expressed in Hebrew. The name of Aaron would sufficiently denote that it was of this nature. (Berthier) See Exodus xxx. 23. 
Moses poured it on his head, with such profusion that it ran upon all his beard, and even be the skirt, or neck, as the Septuagint insinuate, though the Hebrew means "the mouth "or orifice, through which the head entered, (Calmet) as the robes resembled our sacred vestments. (Haydock) 
The union of priests is no less sweet. (Calmet) 
Of this we need no other proof than to behold the advantages of concord in every community, and especially in the Church of God. The unction of Aaron denoted grace and unity descending from the head of the Church, to the other priests, and to the meanest of the faithful; (Worthington) or that which Hebrew, "of Hermon descending on the mountains of Sion "Tsiyon. (Haydock) 
There is a hill written Ssiyon at the foot of Hermon, Exodus iv. 48., and Ecclesiasticus xxiv. 17. It is not probable that dew should flow 50 leagues across the Jordan. (Calmet) 
Unity is equally desirable, as moisture to a thirsty soil. (Haydock) 
Sion may here denote any "dry "mountain. (Muis) 
There was also a Hermon in the tribe of Issachar, and the dews in that country resembled showers of rain. Such copiousness would be very refreshing, like fraternal concord. The enemies of Christianity observed how the disciples loved each other, being of one heart and soul, (Berthier) as their divine master had taught them to be thus distinguished. (Haydock) 
As the snow or dew which descends from Hermon, causes fruitfulness, so does concord promote piety. (Worthington) 
There, in concord, or in the temple. (Calmet) 
The holy Spirit came upon the disciples when they were together, Acts ii., and iv. 32. (Worthington) 
Life everlasting. Jonathan was not preserved from dying young, though he was so faithful to his friend, and the possession (Berthier) of temporal prosperity cannot satisfy the heart.
