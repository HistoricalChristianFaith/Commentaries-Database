With me. Grotius thinks that Jeremias had given the order; and the author of Hebrew Traditions, supposes that he forbade Josias to oppose Pharao, who, it seems, was assured of victory. (Calmet)

The augurs of the latter might declare the truth, (Menochius) though they could not dive into futurity. (Haydock) 
Herodotus (i.) informs us, that Nechos fought against the Syrians, (or Israelites) in Magdelum, and took Cad this, a city as large as Sardis, of Lydia; probably Jerusalem, (Du Hamel) or Cades. (Calmet)
