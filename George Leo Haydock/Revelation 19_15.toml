Wine press This painting corresponds to the triumph of Jesus Christ. (Calmet) 
Some of the attributes here mentioned are also ascribed to Christ, by the prophet Isaiah, (Isaias lxiii. 2, 3.) "Why then is thy apparel red, and thy garments like theirs that tread in the wine press? I have trodden the wine-press alone, and of the Gentiles there is not a man with me: I have trampled on them in my indignation, and have trodden them down in my wrath, and their blood is sprinkled upon my garments, and I have stained all my apparel. "(Pastorini)
