A stout hunter. Not of beasts, but of men; whom by violence and tyranny he brought under his dominion. And such he was, not only in the opinion of men, but before the Lord; that is, in his sight who cannot be deceived. (Challoner) 
The Septuagint call him a giant; that is, a violent man. According to Josephus, he stirred up men to rebel against the Lord, maintaining that all their happiness must come from themselves, Antiquities i. 4. Thus he broached the first heresy after the deluge. (Worthington) 
He seems to have been the same as Bel, father of Ninus, and the author of idolatry. (Menochius)
