A veil. Abulensis places it between the court and the holy: but Jansenius would have it before the holy of holies. It seems rather that there was a veil in both places, (Barad. t. ii. b. iii. 23.; Menochius) as Josephus ( viii. 2., and xii. 10.) clearly intimates; and St. Paul speaks of the second veil, Hebrews ix. 3. It is not certain which of them was torn at the death of Jesus Christ, Matthew xxvii. 51. Cherubims; extraordinary figures. (Calmet)
