See Matthew iii. 11. That baptism cannot be valid, in which the name of the Holy Spirit only is invoked. For, the tradition concerning life-giving grace, must be preserved entire. To add or to omit any thing, may exclude from life everlasting. For, as we believe, so also are we baptized, in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. (St. Basil, lib. de Spirit. Sanc. chap. xxii.) 
Fire. This is a metaphor, to signify the Holy Spirit and his gifts, particularly the fire of divine love to the expiation of sins, and is very common in Scripture. Sometimes also he is represented by water, as in St. John iv. 10, et dein. and vii. 38.-39; Isaias xliv. Hence, in the hymn to the Holy Spirit, the Church uses both figures. Thou who art call'd the Paraclete, Best gift of God above, The living Spring, the living Fire, Sweet unction and love.
