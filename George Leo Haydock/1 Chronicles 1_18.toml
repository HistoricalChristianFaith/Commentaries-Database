Sale. The Roman Septuagint omits ver. 11 to 17, and ver. 18 to 24, having only, (17) "The sons of Sem, Ail am and Assur; (24) and Arphaxad, Sala. "(Haydock) 
But the other copies here insert Cainan, as the father of Sale. See Genesis x. 24. (Calmet) 
It is a matter of great doubt whether he ought not to be inserted, Luke iii. (Haydock)
