Jehu was different from one of the same name and parentage, who came to Josaphat; (2 Paralipomenon xix. 2.; Du Hamel; Tirinus) though, if Baasa did not put him to death, as there is some reason to doubt, he might be the same, ver. 7. (Calmet) 
Hanani had been sent to Asa, 2 Paralipomenon xvi. 7. (Abulensis, q. 3.)
