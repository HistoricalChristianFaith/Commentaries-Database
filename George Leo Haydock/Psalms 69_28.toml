Living. Let them die. (Grotius) 
If we understand the book of the predestinate to life eternal, and not merely to present and mutable justice, (Tirinus) God never blots any out. But though they fall, he brings them to repentance. (St. Augustine; Estius; Bellarmine) 
The reprobation of the obstinate Babylonians (Calmet) and Jews, is predicted. (Haydock) 
The latter were effaced from the book of the living of the Old Testament, and were never written in that of the just, belonging to the New. (St. Jerome) 
At death, the unbelieving Jews (Haydock) shall not find their expectations well founded. (Worthington) 
Only the faithful are truly just. (Menochius)
