A law. Custom, (Calmet) and a particular injunction, had long before made way for it, Numbers xxxi. 27, (Haydock) and Josue xxii. 8. 
We might translate the Hebrew, "And this law had been observed in Israel from that day and before. "David restored to its full vigour this ancient regulation. The Hebrews have no compound verbs, such as re-establish, re-build, instead of which, they say, to establish, (Calmet) and build again. Thus, by the addition of adverbs, they can explain the same things. Protestants, "from that day forward he made it a statute "(Haydock) 
It is not, therefore, unlawful to make new laws, provided they be conformable to those of God, Deuteronomy iv., and xii. (Worthington)
