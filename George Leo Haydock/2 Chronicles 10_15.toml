Will of God: not that the king should act foolishly, or the people rebel, but to effect what he had promised. (Haydock) 
Syriac has well expressed the sense: "because this rebellion happened by the divine permission, that they might behold the truth of the prediction of Ahias "(Calmet) and that the fault of Solomon might be punished. (Du Hamel)
