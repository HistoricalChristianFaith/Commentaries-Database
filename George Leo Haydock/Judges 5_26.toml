Sisara. Hebrew says with the hammer; (Protestants,) "she smote off his head, when she had pierced and stricken (the nail) through his temples. "But we may rather translate, (Haydock) "she pierced his head, she struck it, and pierced through his temples. "(Calmet) 
For we cannot suppose that she severed his head from his body with the hammer; but she fastened it to the ground with the nail, chap. iv. 21.
