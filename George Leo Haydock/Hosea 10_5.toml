The kine of Bet haven. The golden calves of Jeroboam, (Challoner) one of which (Haydock) was set up at Bethel. (Worthington) 
The feminine cows, is spoken in ridicule; as (Calmet) O vere Phrygiæ, (Virgil) Æneid ix. Isis was represented with a cow's head. (Herodotus ii. 41.) 
Rejoiced. To avoid this apparent contradiction, the Jews relate that the priests had sent a brazen calf to the Assyrian, and secreted the golden one. While they rejoiced at their success, Salmanasar, (Seder. Olam.) or Sennacherib, discovered the cheat, and came to destroy the kingdom. (St. Jerome) 
This has the air of a fable. If (Calmet) we substitute é for g, in yagilu, (Haydock) we may give a good sense to the Hebrew. "The people shouting, or in black, (cemaraiv) have been in sorrow, because their glory is taken from them: so the idol is called, Psalm cv. 20. (Calmet) Ver. 6. Itself also is carried One of the golden calves was given by king Mana hem to Phul, king of the Assyrians, to engage him to stand by him. (Challoner) 
Avenging. Chap. v. 13. 
Will, or expectation of aid. (Calmet) 
He had recourse to this nation, without consulting God. (Haydock) Ver. 7. Pass. Hebrew, "As for Samaria, it is undone. Its king is like froth, or a bubble", chap. xi. 1. The calf; (ver. 3.) Zacharias or Osee may be meant. Ver. 8. Us, as the Jews would do at the last siege, and sinners before the day of judgment, Luke xxiii. 30., and Apocalypse vi. 16. Too happy, if they could by a speedy death escape eternal torments! (Calmet) 
People shall be in the utmost consternation at the approach of the Assyrians. (Haydock) 
They will not think themselves secure enough in their caverns. Ver. 9. Gabaa. Septuagint, "high places "or he alludes to the brutality of the citizens, Judges xx. 13. 
Stood. Those of Gabaa were speedily punished by the other tribes. Now, all are perverse. At that time one tribe was guilty, and yet some were spared; but all Israel shall be now led into captivity. (Calmet) 
From the time that Dan adored Micha's idol, (Judges xviii. 14.) the evil has spread among the rest of the tribes, which did not punish this transgression. Hence all shall at last suffer. (Worthington) Ver. 10. Their two iniquities. Their two calves; (Challoner) or because they have abandoned God, and followed idols, Jeremias ii. 13. Many render, "when I shall have tied them, like oxen, in their two furrows. "But the Vulgate is plainer, and adopted by most. Ver. 11. Neck. I will confine her to harder labour. While the oxen tred out corn, they may eat, Deuteronomy xxv. 4. 
Himself. Juda shall be chastised after the ten tribes; so that none of my people shall escape. Ver. 12. Mouth. Hebrew, "in proportion to (Calmet) your piety. "Septuagint, "gather a vintage of the fruit of life. "(Haydock) 
Ground. Reform your conduct. (Calmet) 
Justice, when Christ shall appear, the source of all our grace and justice. (St. Jerome) (Calmet) 
Septuagint, "Light up for yourselves the light of knowledge, for it is time; seek the Lord, till ye obtain the fruit of justice. "Ver. 13. Ploughed. Septuagint, "Why have you concealed impiety "refusing to confess? (Haydock) 
Iniquity, or punishment. 
Lying. Your hopes are frustrated, and no fruit is seen. (Calmet) 
Ways: idols. (St. Jerome) Ver. 14. Tumult. Hebrew shaon; the din of war, (Haydock) or cry of soldiers. (Calmet) 
Salmana, king of the Madianites, was destroyed by the house; that is, by the followers of him that judgeth Baal; that is, of Gideon, who threw down the altar of Baal, and was therefore called Jerobaal. See Judges vi. and viii. (Challoner) 
Of him. Roman Septuagint, "of Jeroboam. "But St. Jerome, have, Jerobaal. Theodoret, "in the house of Arbeel. "Hebrew, "as Salmana ruined the house of Arbela. "There were many places of this name; but none of great note, taken by Salmanasar. Some think that he took it before he was king. Yet this is all uncertain, and the Hebrew seems rather changed, so that we should read with the Alexandrian manuscript. St. Jerome, Jerobaal, who defeated the Madianites, and treated Succoth with great severity, Judges viii. 15. (Calmet) Ver. 15. Bethel. This place, defiled by an idol, shall be the scene of your misery. Septuagint, "So I will treat you, O house of Israel", (Haydock) which is not in Hebrew (St. Jerome) but seems as good. (Haydock) 
Hebrew adds here properly, (Calmet) "Presently, or in the morning, shall the king of Israel be utterly cut off "which we have in the next chapter.
