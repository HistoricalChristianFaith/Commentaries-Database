For Hebrew, "and so it was when the cloud was days of number upon the tabernacle; by the mouth of the Lord they staid in their tents "Days of number, yamim mispar, most probably means a few days; (see Deuteronomy iv. 27,) though Louis de Dieu would translate "a full year "as yamim, according to him, signifies, ver. 22. It is understood, however, by others, to denote a week, a month, a year, or an indeterminate number of days, Genesis xxiv. 55.
