Man. Hebrew n√°har, a man in the prime of life. He had the care of all in the field, during the absence of his master; whence Josephus styles him agrocomos, or agronomos. (Menochius) 
Homer mentions an officer or king, standing with his sceptre in the midst of the reapers, and silently rejoicing at the rich profusion of the field. (Iliad) 
Thus we see the taste of the ancients, while agriculture was honourable. Ver. 7. Moment. Hebrew, "her tarrying in the house is but small, or till now, that she remains a little in the house. "She entered the house with the reapers, during the excessive heat of the day, and to avoid the suspicion of taking more than was allowed, during their absence. (Calmet) 
Septuagint, "she hath not discontinued to work in the field even a little. "Her diligence and modesty attracted the notice of Booz. (Haydock). Ver. 9. Thee. The men tied the corn after the female reapers, (Calmet) and Ruth was authorized to follow, close at their heels, without fear. (Haydock) 
The waters. This is not expressed in Hebrew but it is in the Septuagint and the Chaldean. (Calmet) 
The privilege of having water in those countries was very considerable. (Menochius) Ver. 10. Country. St. Elizabeth was impressed with similar sentiments, when she was visited by the blessed Virgin; (Haydock) and so was David, when he considered the wonderful condescension of God, Psalm viii. 5., cxliii. 3., and Job vii. 17.

Frequent instances occur in Scripture of people worshipping, or shewing their gratitude to their fellow creatures, by this posture of the body. (Menochius) 
Yet no suspicion of idolatry attaches to them, Genesis xxiii. 7. (Haydock) Ver. 11. Heretofore, to embrace the same religion. (Menochius) Ver. 12. Work. Booz doubted not but a full and eternal reward was due to good works. (Worthington) 
Fled. This similitude frequently occurs, (Psalm xxxv. 8., and Matthew xxiii. 37,) to denote protection. (Calmet). 
Chaldean, "Thou art come to be a proselyte, and to hide thyself under the shade of the majesty of his glory. "(Menochius) Ver. 13. Heart. This has the same meaning as the former part of the sentence. (Calmet) See Osee ii. 14. (Haydock) 
Maids, but more lowly and mean. (Menochius) Ver. 14. Vinegar, or small wine, made on purpose for working people. Some think that such was presented to our Saviour. Yet vinegar was very frequently mixed with other things, and was esteemed particularly refreshing. (Pliny, xxiii. 1.) (Calmet)

The leavings, to Noemi. "Learn, says Seneca, (ep. 110,) to be content with a little. "Septuagint, "and Booz heaped up food before her, and she ate and was filled, and left a part. "(Haydock) 
But it appears that she afterwards took it home, ver. 18. (Menochius) 
The vinegar and corn which were given to Ruth were very refreshing. The Spaniards still drink posca, or water and vinegar. (Tirinus) Ver. 15. Reap. Hebrew, "if she will glean, even among the sheaves, do not cover her with confusion "(Haydock) or hinder her, Psalm xliii. 10. (Calmet) Ver. 17. Rod, as Gedeon had done, Judges vi. 11.

Kinsman. Hebrew adds, "one of our redeemers, (Calmet) or next kinsmen. "(Haydock) 
To such the right of avenging the slain, of marrying the widow of the deceased, and entering upon his property, belonged. The best interpreters suppose that Booz was the nephew of Elimelech. (Calmet) (Leviticus xxv. 25., and Deuteronomy xxv. 5.) (Menochius) Ver. 23. And the wheat.
