The dwelling Hebrew, "the singers, like people dancing, (for joy) all my fountains are in thee. "St. Jerome reads, "strong ones "and (Haydock) others, "my thoughts "instead of "fountains "which shows that they have read differently. Vesharim, may signify and princes, taken form the line above, though of this we ought to have some proofs from manuscripts (Berthier) 
The authority of the Septuagint may perhaps suffice, (Haydock) as they have read more correctly mauni, "habitation "rather than mahyanai, as we have at present. (Berthier) 
If we adopt this sense, (Haydock) the fountains may denote the nations which shall spring from Sion, Psalm lxvii. 27. (Hammond) 
All the inhabitants shall be filled with joy in the heavenly Jerusalem, Apocalypse xvii. 15. (Calmet) 
This short, but difficult psalm, allegorically describes the mystery of Christ, and of the Church. (Berthier) 
Catholics may taste pure delights, having peace of conscience But the blessed enjoy the most perfect content in the Church triumphant. (Worthington) (Menochius)
