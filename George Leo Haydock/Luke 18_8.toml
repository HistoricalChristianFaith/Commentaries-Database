In the Greek, although he suffer for the present the elect to be oppressed. (Bible de Vence) 
Our divine Redeemer adds, this, to show that faith must necessarily accompany our prayers. For whosoever prays for what he does not believe he shall obtain, will pray in vain; let us, therefore, entreat the Father of mercies to grant us the grace of prayer, and firmness in faith; for faith produces prayer, and prayer produces firmness of faith. (St. Augustine, de verb. Dom. Serm 36.) 
But of this there is little left on the earth, and there will be still less at the second coming of the Son of God.
