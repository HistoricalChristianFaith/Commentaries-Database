Ancients; the commanders of the respective tribes. Heli was not able to lead on the people to battle, on account of his blindness and great age. 
Enemies. All nations attribute much to the exterior marks of religion. The Israelites had witnessed the victories which had been obtained while the ark was present, Josue vi. 4. See Numbers xiv. 45. But they ought to have considered, that their infidelity rendered them unworthy of the divine protection; and that God was more displeased at their profanations, than at the indignity to which the sacred vessels would be exposed. He would know how to vindicate his own honour and glory. The symbols of religion were thus carried in the army, by the Persians (Herodotus vii.) 
The Romans regarded their standards as so many deities. (Hali car. vi.) See 2 Kings vi. 21., and 2 Paralipomenon xiii. 8. (Calmet) 
The confidence which the Israelites placed in the ark was commendable, but their sins deserved to be punished. (Worthington) (Numbers x. 35.)
