The prayer This title is not in Hebrew, Septuagint Theodoret has passed over the chapter, as if he doubted of its authenticity. It does not follow the order of Hebrew letters like the preceding, and seems to be a form of prayer for those who retired into Egypt. (Calmet) 
Jeremias foresees what would happen, and prays as the people would do. (Worthington)
