Fathers, the ancient patriarchs, who were not favoured in such a signal manner. (Menochius) 
Though many of those who had heard the words of God at Horeb, were dead, and had not enjoyed the full benefit of the covenant, some still remained, and the children of the deceased were about to enter the land which had been there promised. (Haydock) 
God did not make a covenant with the Patriarchs only, but also with their posterity at Horeb. (Du Hamel)
