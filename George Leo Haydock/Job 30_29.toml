Brother of dragons Imitating these creatures in their lamentable noise. (Challoner) -- I was like those beasts which retire in order to lament. (Worthington) 
The dragons hiss dreadfully, when crushed by the elephant; (St. Jerome) and the young ostriches, being abandoned, make great lamentations. (Menochius) (Delrio, t. ii. adag. 18.) 
This comparison occurs, Micheas i. 8. Natural history does not, however, represent these animals as very plaintive. The former term may denote sea monsters, or crocodiles; thannim: (Septuagint, syrens) and "the daughters of the yahana "signify "swans "(Isaias xiii. 21.) though commonly rendered ostriches, as they are by the Septuagint (Calmet) 
Protestants have, "owls. "But we may adhere to the Vulgate. (Haydock)
