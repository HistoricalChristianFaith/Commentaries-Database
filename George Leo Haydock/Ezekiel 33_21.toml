Twelfth. Roman Septuagint, "tenth. "Syriac, "eleventh year.in the twelfth month "which Theodoret thinks more probable, as the city was taken in the ninth of the fourth month of that year.

Captivity. Here it is evident that the prophet dates from that event, chap. i. (Haydock) 
As he prophesied on the very day when the city was besieged, (chap. xxiv. 2.) so ( ver. 26.) he foretold that one should come three years after to inform him of the capture. (Worthington) 
Then the people would believe him, (ibid. ver. 27.; Calmet) and he would open his mouth boldly, ver. 22. (Haydock)
