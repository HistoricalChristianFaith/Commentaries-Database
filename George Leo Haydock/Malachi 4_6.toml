Heart By bringing over the Jews to the faith of Christ, he shall reconcile them to their fathers, viz., the patriarchs and prophets, whose hearts for many ages have been turned away from them, because of their refusing to believe in Christ. (Calmet) 
The antipathy of Jews and Gentiles shall cease. Both shall enter the Church of Christ, Isaias xi. 13. John the Baptist strove to ameliorate the manners of the people, and to bring all to Christ, who reconciles all seeming contradictions in the Scriptures. He came to put an end to all dissensions. (Calmet) 
Yet the wicked will still have war, Matthew x. 35. (Haydock) 
Christ will convert those Jews at last, (Romans xi. 26.; Calmet) who have not yet opened their eyes. Their fathers, the apostles and first converts, have long ago shown them the example. (Haydock) 
Anathema. In the Hebrew, cherem, that is, utter destruction. (Challoner) 
Septuagint, "entirely "(Calmet) or "suddenly "arden. (St. Jerome) (Deuteronomy vii. 26.) 
This passage intimates that the ruin of Jerusalem is threatened. If people should be converted, would that stop the general conflagration? (Calmet) 
Some of our crafty adversaries have inferred from the above explanation of anathema, that the Church means heretics to be destroyed: but her kingdom is not of this world: she speaks only of the soul, and exercises a spiritual power. (Haydock)
