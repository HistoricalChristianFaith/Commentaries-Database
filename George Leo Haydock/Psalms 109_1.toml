Praise. Hebrew, "God of my praise "(Calmet) 
whom I always adore, under every dispensation of Providence. (Haydock) 
Yet the original may agree with the Vulgate, and Christ desires to be glorified, (John xii. 23., and xvii. 5.; Berthier) and styles his passion, his praise. (Theodoret) 
David appeals to God's judgment. (Calmet) 
Man. The Pharisees, endeavoured to entangle Christ, Matthew xxii. (Worthington) 
Saul's courtiers strove, by calumnies, to excite his rage against David. (Calmet) Ver. 3. Cause. Or provocation. (Haydock) 
So Catiline gratuito potius malus quam crudelis erat. (Sallust.) 
The sanctity of Jesus Christ could not be overwhelmed, or hidden, (Haydock) even with the torrent of abuse thrown upon him.

David. St. Peter attributes it to him, and gives us the key to this psalm, by applying (ver. 8.) to the traitor Judas, Acts i. 16, 20. (Berthier, T. vii.) 
Our Saviour seems to allude to it, when he styles Judas, the son of perdition, John xvii. 8. It may also have a reference to Doeg, or Achitophel, who were his forerunners. Ven. Bede thinks it was composed by the Machabees, against apostates. The Church used it in the deposition of bishops, and against the usurpers of ecclesiastical goods: (Grotius) and, in times of ignorance, some thought hereby to discover thieves. The style is very vehement, (Calmet) containing the sentence pronounced by the sovereign judge against the reprobate. (Haydock)
