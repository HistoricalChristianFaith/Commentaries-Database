With a loud voice. In this our Redeemer confirms what he had said to Pilate; I have the power to lay down my life, and I have the power to take it up again: for he cried with a loud voice, and at the very hour of the evening sacrifice, to show that it was by the effect of his own will that he died. (St. John Chrysostom, hom. lxxxix.)
