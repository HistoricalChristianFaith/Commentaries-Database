Indignation. Literally, "fury. "(Haydock) 
Such strong expressions were requisite to make the carnal Jews fear God's judgments, though a being of infinite perfection can have no passion. (St. Chrysostom) 
David does not beg to be free from suffering, (Haydock) but he requests that God would chastise him with moderation, Jeremias x. 24., and xlvi. 28. (Calmet) 
Justice without mercy is reserved for the last day. (St. Gregory) 
Wrath. This regards those who have built wood, on the foundation. They shall be purified by fire. (St. Augustine) Purgatory was then believed in the 4th Century. (Berthier) 
Let me not be condemned either to it, or hell. (St. Gregory, hic. and Psalm xxxvii.)

For the octave. That is, to be sung on an instrument of eight strings. St. Augustine understands it mystically, of the last resurrection, and the world to come; which is, as it were, the octave, or eighth day, after the seven days of this mortal life; and for this octave, sinners must dispose themselves, like David, by bewailing their sins, whilst they are here upon the earth. (Challoner) (Worthington) 
It may also signify, that this psalm was to be sung by "the eighth "of the 24 bands, 1 Paralipomenon xv. 21. David might compose it after sickness, with which he had been punished for his adultery; (Calmet) or under any distress: he expresses the sentiments of a true penitent, (Berthier) with which he was ever after impressed. (Haydock) 
It is applicable to penitents of the new law. (Worthington)
