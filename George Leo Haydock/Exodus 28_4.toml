Rational and ephod. See chap. xxv. 7. 
Tunic, long robe or cloak of blue wool. 
Garment, next the body, and woven very close and thick. 
Mitre, like a tiara or turban of linen, or rather of byssus, or fine cotton. This was never laid aside in the temple; as, to appear uncovered was then esteemed a mark of insolence. Eneas introduced the Phrygian custom into Italy, of sacrificing with a cap on the head. 
Girdle, for his under-garment, besides that which formed a part of the ephod. (Calmet) 
By these vestments, we are admonished to exercise the virtues of discretion (St. Jerome, ep. ad Fab.)
