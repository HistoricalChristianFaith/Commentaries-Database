Wood. 1 Paralipomenon x. 12., under the oak. 
Days, at their own option. David fasted one day, (Calmet) as he did for Abner. (Salien) 
There was no obligation of mourning for the kings, though it is probable that those near the royal city, would show this mark of attention to the deceased monarch. See Jeremias xxxiv. 5., and 2 Paralipomenon xxxv. 25. The usual term of mourning was seven days, Ecclesiasticus xxii. 13. (Calmet) 
It is very difficult to ascertain the length of Saul's reign. Sanctius and Tirinus allow him only 2 years; Petau 12; Calvisius 15; Salien 18; Bucholeer, and probably Josephus 20, though most copies of the latter have 38; St. Augustine, Serarius, Usher, 40, which is the term mentioned Acts xiii. 20. But most chronologers suppose that the time of Samuel's administration is there also included. (Haydock) 
Sulpitius thinks that Saul only "reigned a very short time "as "the ark was brought to Cariathiarim before he appeared on the throne, and was removed by David, after it had been there twenty years. "
