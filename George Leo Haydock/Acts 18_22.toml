He went up. To Jerusalem is most probably understood, that being the chief object of St. Paul's journey. It seems rather extraordinary that St. Luke should have omitted the express mention of the city. But having told us his object was to be at Jerusalem, he perhaps thought it was enough to say, he went up. (Calmet) 
In Palestine, the expression, to go up, was sometimes taken for going up to Jerusalem. (John vii. 8. 10; John xii. 20; Acts xxiv. 11) And reciprocally in Acts chap. xxiv. 1. to go down, is taken for going down from Jerusalem to Cæsarea. (Bible de Vence) 
He went up. In the Scripture, when Antioch and Cæsarea are simply mentioned, Antioch, in Syria, and Cæsarea, in Palestine, are uniformly designated. 
To Cæsarea, not in Cappadocia, but in Palestine, from whence he went up to Jerusalem, and then down to Antioch, in Syria. (Witham)
