A he-goat. The empire of the Greeks, or Macedonians. 
He touched not the ground. He conquered all before him with so much rapidity, that he seemed rather to fly than to walk upon the earth. 
A notable horn. Alexander the great. (Challoner) 
He succeeded his father when only twenty years old, and the next year was chosen generalissimo of the Greeks against Persia, which he invaded at the head of 30,000 foot and 4,000 horses, having only seventy talents of silver and provisions for one month. With this he attacked the most flourishing empire, and conquered it in less than four years' time, when Darius was slain in the year of the world 3674 . Alexander survived only six years and ten months, yet subdued so many nations that it is almost incredible that he should have travelled over them. He is the belly of brass and the leopard, chap. ii. 39., and vii. 6. (Calmet) 
He died in the midst of his prosperity, (Haydock) when not quite thirty-three years old, (Worthington) and left no heirs to succeed him. This conqueror would be painted with two horns, to intimate that he was the son of Jupiter Ammon. (Calmet)
