Destroy not. Suffer me not to be destroyed, (Challoner; Menochius) or I will not allow my men to destroy an implacable foe, (Haydock) as they entreat me to do. This conduct is worthy of eternal memory. (Worthington) 
The words may also be an admonition to the reader, not to alter this piece, Apocalypse xxii. 18. (Calmet) 
Al tashcheth, (or thoss√©th.; Haydock) is supposed to be an instrument, or a favourite song, such as that of Moses, (Deuteronomy ix. 26.) which begins thus. But the point is uncertain. The same words occur, Psalm lviii., lix., (Berthier) and lxxiv. They are put in the mouth of Christ suffering, by St. Hilary 
Cave of Odollam, or rather of Engaddi. (Calmet) Ver. 2. In thee. This obliges God to take pity, Psalm xlvi. 11. 
Wings, as a chicken retires to the hen, Ruth ii. 12., and Matthew xxiii. 37. Ver. 4. Sent his mercy, (Calmet) above the power of man. (Worthington) 
Reproach. Saul was forced to entreat David to preserve his family, as he had just spared his own life; which would, no doubt, mortify his pride, (1 Kings xxiv. 18, 22.; Calmet) and seem a reproach to him. (Worthington)
