Anointed. Hebrew has only, David. The rest of the title occurs only in some copies of the Septuagint, (Eusebius; Calmet) and is not of divine authority. Yet if any attention be paid to it, we must suppose that David composed this psalm before his second anointing, as he speaks of great dangers. But this is all uncertain. (Berthier) 
For dangers threatened David even after he had been declared king. (Haydock) 
Before Samuel anointed him, he was not endued with the spirit of prophecy. See 1 Kings xvi. 13., and 2 Kings ii. 4., and v. 3. (Calmet) 
Some suppose that he alludes to the entertainment given him by Abimelech , (ver. 5 and 12.; Theodoret) or to that night when, fearless of danger, he took away Saul's cup; (Ferrand) while Abenezra and De Muis rather believe, that he composed this psalm when his people dissuaded him from going out to battle, 2 Kings xxi 17. It expresses the sentiments of the Levites in captivity, (Calmet) and most beautifully consoles the just in distress. David did not write this for himself alone, but for all future generations. Hence it is not necessary to discover the particular circumstance of his life, to which this and many other psalms allude; nor is there any difficulty in explaining away the various imprecations, as they are not directed against any individual, but relate to all the enemies of the soul; while they foretell what the wicked shall suffer. (Berthier) 
Afraid. "Find one more powerful, and then fear. "(St. Augustine) 
God both giveth light and strength, so that no enemy can hurt his servants, Luke xxi. 15. (Worthington)
