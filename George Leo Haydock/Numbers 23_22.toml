Rhinoceros. Hebrew ream, which is sometimes rendered unicorn. Bo chart thinks it means the oryx, or the strong Arabian goat. The animal, of which the Scripture so often speaks, was remarkable for its strength, (Calmet) and could not easily be tamed, Job xxxix. 9. (Haydock) 
The Septuagint generally translate monoceros, which is a fish, with a horn proceeding from its upper jaw. This is often shown in cabinets for the horn of the unicorn. There are various animals which have only one horn. Pliny and Aristotle instance the oryx Various authors of credit specify likewise the rhinoceros, which has "a horn upon its nose "and is found in Ethiopia. The emperor of that country sent one to the court of Persia, which Chardin saw and describes. It is as large as an elephant, and the people have learnt the method of taming both these huge beasts. (Calmet) 
It seems the art was unknown in the days of Job, if this be the animal of which he speaks. (Haydock) 
Moses (Deuteronomy xxxiii. 17,) seems to attribute two horns to the ream; and Pausanius allows a greater and a less one to the rhinoceros; the latter is very strong and erect. It is of a brownish colour. (Calmet) 
Whatever may be the precise meaning of ream, it certainly denotes an animal of superior strength, and very formidable. Balaam represents God, or the people of Israel, in this light. God had given repeated instances of his dominion over all nature, in delivering the Hebrews out of Egypt. They were also capable of striking the Moabites with terror, on account of their known prowess, and surprising numbers, ver. 24. (Haydock)
