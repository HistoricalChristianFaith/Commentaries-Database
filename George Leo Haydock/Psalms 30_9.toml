Profit. The wicked on his death bed, cannot pray thus, as the justice of God is interested to punish his crimes, and to prevent their continuance. After death there is no merit; so that we ought to make good use of our time. (Berthier) 
Corruption. The Fathers explain this of Jesus Christ. What good will my death procure, if I do not rise again? (Origen; St. Jerome) 
Truth. See Psalm lxxxvii. 11., and Baruch ii. 17. (Calmet) 
The dead cannot make their voice heard in this world, though they may praise God in the other. (Menochius)
