Asaph. David composed this, to declare the rights of Juda to the throne, in preference to the tribe of Ephraim, (Lyranus) which had kept possession of the ark a long time; which was henceforth to be on Mount Sion. (Haydock) 
It seems to relate to the times of Asa, who reunited several of the other tribes to his dominion, (2 Paralipomenon xv. 8.; Calmet) and contains a moral instruction, delivered in the person of Christ, (ver. 2.; Eusebius; Berthier) and submitted to the attentive consideration of the faithful. (Worthington) 
Law. Given to Moses, (Berthier) and sanctioned by the divine authority. (Haydock) 
The law, and the people were not David's, but God's, in whose name he speaks. (St. Gregory in Job ii.) (Worthington)
