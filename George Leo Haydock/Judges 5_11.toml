Choaked in the waters of the Cison, and of Mageddo, ver. 19, 21. Hebrew is very obscure: "from the noise of archers, in the places of drawing water, there shall they relate the justices of the Lord, the righteous acts of his villages, (or brave men) then shall the people of the Lord go down to the gates "where the courts of judicature are held. The peaceful inhabitants shall be no more disturbed with the shouts of archers, but rehearsing what obligations they are under to the Lord, the warriors of Barac, they shall pursue their usual employments without fear. (Haydock) 
Septuagint, You shall make your voices heard, playing on instruments, Calmet. (anacrouomen√≥n, pulsantium.) 
Among those who rejoice, there shall they give righteous deeds to the Lord: they have wrought justice in Israel (Haydock) 
If we neglect the points, we may render the Hebrew more agreeably to the Vulgate. "At the voice of those who are pierced with arrows in the midst of those who draw water (or are drowned) there they shall publish "(Calmet) 
And obtained. This is not in Hebrew expressly; but it is added to show that the people could now act as a free nation, having cleared their country of its enemies. (Haydock)
