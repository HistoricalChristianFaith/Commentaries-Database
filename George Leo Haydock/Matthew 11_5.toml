The blind see Christ shows them who he was by the miracles, which were foretold concerning the Messias. 
The poor have the gospel preached to them. This is the sense held forth by the prophet Isaias. (Chap. lxi. ver. 1) (Witham) 
That is, they are declared to have the kingdom of heaven, and are styled blessed. Here also he fulfils the prophecy of Isaias, (Chap. lxi.) which in the Septuagint version is rendered, He sent me to preach the gospel to the poor. (Nicholas of Lyra.)
