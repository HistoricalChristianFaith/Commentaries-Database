So reward The meaning is, that according to his disposition with regard to humility, so he expected a reward in his soul to return to him, and stick as close to him as the child just weaned, which would willingly never be separated from the mother. (Challoner) 
If I was not humble, may my soul be treated like an infant Hebrew, "If I did not render (or humble and silence) my soul, like an infant weaned from his mother, let my soul be to me as a weaned child. "I willingly submit to all thy rigours, if I did not adore thy ways in silence and in humiliation. (Calmet) 
The text may be differently rendered. (Berthier) 
As children come willingly to their mother, so the child of God approaches to Him, though he may not always find the same sweetness; and he expects that he will be rewarded accordingly. (Worthington) 
Gemul means, "a weaned infant, or a reward. "(Du Hamel)
