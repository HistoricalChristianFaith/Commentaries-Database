Porch. Septuagint seem to retain the original word ulam, as they read ailam; whence our hall, and the Latin aula, may be derived. (Haydock) 
It was a court surrounded by pillars and galleries, in front of the palace. (Calmet) 
Another. Hebrew, "the porch before them, (pillars) and the pillars, and the thick beam before them."
