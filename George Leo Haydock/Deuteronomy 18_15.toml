Prophet. This passage plainly proves, that the Scripture may have many literal senses: for the context insinuates that God would supply the wants of his people, so that they should not need to go far in order to consult diviners, since they should have leaders and prophets, after the death of Moses, who might explain to them God's will, as they had desired; but at the same time, it clearly refers to the Messias, as it is explained by St. Peter, (Acts iii. 22.; Worthington) and by St. Stephen, Acts vii. 37. The Jews, at that time, were convinced of the truth of this application: but they only denied that Christ was the Messias. They have since gone a step farther, and deny that it regards the Messias, some referring it to Josue, others to Jeremias (Ap. Munster and Fag.) But surely what other prophet could be compared with Moses? (Chap. xxxiv. 10.) What other man reunited in his person the qualifications of lawgiver, chief of God's people, mediator, or who was like him? Hence prophet is written in the singular, to denote his eminent dignity. (St. Augustine, contra Faustus) 
St. Philip recognized the claim of Jesus, as did the people after the multiplication of bread, John i. 45., and vi. 14. God the Father seems to allude to this passage, according to the remark of Tertullian, (contra Mar. iv. 22,) when he says hear ye him, (Luke ix. 35,) as St. Cyprian believes our Saviour does also, John v. 46. St. Athanasius (contra Arianos 2) condemns the error of the Jews, who would apply this passage to any other prophet but to the Messias. If they could be excused for denying him this latter claim, they surely cannot in calling in question that Jesus was a true prophet, since he has all the marks of one; (Grotius) and if they would once acknowledge this, they must soon confess that he is also the Messias, and the Son of God, as these truths are so necessarily connected. (Calmet) 
The miracles of Moses were far exceeded by those of Jesus Christ, and the latter conversed more intimately with his eternal Father (Menochius)
