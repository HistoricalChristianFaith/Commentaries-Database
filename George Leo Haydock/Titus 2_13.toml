Waiting for the blessed hope; for the happiness of the blessed in heaven, promised and hoped for. 
And coming of the glory of the great God, and our Saviour Jesus Christ. The title of great God, says Dr. Wells, is here referred to our Saviour Jesus Christ, by Clement of Alexandria in protreptico, chap. vi. He might have added, and by the general consent of the Greek and Latin Fathers. St. Chrysostom cries out: "where are now they who say that the Son is less than the Father? "St. Jerome in like manner: "where is the serpent Arius? where is the snake Eunomius? "And that this title of great God is here given to Jesus Christ, may be shown from the text itself, especially in the Greek; for the glorious coming, and appearance, in other places of St. Paul, is always used to signify Christ's coming to judge the world. Secondly, inasmuch as one and the same Greek article falls upon the great God, and our Saviour Christ; so that even M. Simon, in a note on these words, says the construction is, and the coming of Jesus Christ, the great God, our Saviour, and blames Erasmus and Grotius for pretending that this place is not a confutation of the Arians.
