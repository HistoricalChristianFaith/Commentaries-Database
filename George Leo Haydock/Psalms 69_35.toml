Sion. The Catholic Church. The cities of Juda, her places of worship, which shall be established throughout the world. And there, viz., in this Church of Christ, shall his servants dwell (Challoner) (Worthington) 
It matters not whether a person live in the Church of God, which is at Corinth, or at Philippi, provided he be a member of the Catholic Church. But those who adhere to separate congregations, and style themselves "the Church of England "or "the Kirk of Scotland", cannot be written with the just, (ver. 29.) nor have any part in this prediction. (Haydock) 
It alludes to the restoration of the captives, (Calmet) or rather to the propagation of the gospel, (Haydock) of which the former was a figure, (Eusebius; St. Augustine) as the Jews were never quietly settled again in their country, and were expelled by Titus; whereas the Church of Christ remains to the end of the world. (Berthier)
