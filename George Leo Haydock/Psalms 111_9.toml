Redemption. Under Moses, Cyrus, and Jesus Christ, of whose redemption the former were figures. (Calmet) 
Christ redeemed man, in order that he might be able to observe the law. (Worthington) 
Terrible. Holy to the just, and terrible to sinners. (St. Jerome) 
Most are lost by too much security. (St. Chrysostom, hom. xix.) 
The Hebrews treat the name of God with a respect, which might appear superstitious, (Calmet) as they will not blot it out, or lean upon the book where it is written (Schikard, Jus. ii.) (Theor. v. 6.)
