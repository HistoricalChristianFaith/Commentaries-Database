The constancy of Peter and John, surprised the council very much. They admired their knowledge of the Scriptures, seeing them men without learning or letters, and (as they are called idiots) they could not find how to contradict the fact, the man that was healed, being there present. (Witham) 
Here, with the Jewish people, you may admire the constancy, wisdom, and learning of the apostles, after the coming of the Holy Spirit, who, before that event, were simple, unlettered, and timorous men. See ver. 19; and again, Chap. v. 29.
