St. Paul here styles his own sufferings, the suffering of Christ, to show that Christ takes part, and suffers in all his members. (St. Chrysostom) 
Though it is generally understood to signify the sufferings undergone for Christ. (Estius) 
If we consider the very intimate union that exists between Jesus Christ, who is the head, and every one of the living members of his body, that is, the Church, that whatever any one suffers, for the cause of truth, Christ is said to suffer, as the Lord said to Saul, why persecutest thou me? and that whatever is given to any indigent brother in the name of a disciple, Christ receives as given to himself, can we want any further proof of the excellence and power of good works, which begin and terminate in charity? (Haydock)
