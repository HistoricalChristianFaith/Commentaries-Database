Asir, means a "prisoner "so that we might translate, Hebrew "and the sons of Jechonias, the prisoner, (at Babylon, 4 Kings xxiv. 15.) were Sala Thiel. "(Calmet) 
Protestants, "Assir, Sala Thiel his son. "(Haydock) 
Some think that the following were the adopted children, or successors of Jechonias; as St. Luke (iii. 24.) insinuates that Neri was the father of Sala Thiel, and Jeremias (xxii. 30.) seems to declare that Jechonias should have no children. But he means such as should sit on the throne, as he explains himself, and St. Matthew (i. 12.) expressly says, Jechonias begot Sala Thiel.
