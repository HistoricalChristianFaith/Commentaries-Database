The first-fruits. Pr√¶putia, literally their fore-skins: it alludes to circumcision, and signifies that for the first three years the trees were to be as uncircumcised, and their fruit unclean; till the fourth year their increase was sanctified and given to the Lord, that is, to the priests. (Challoner) 
In some countries, people take off the buds to strengthen the tree. (Calmet) 
The fruit, during the three first years, is not esteemed so good or wholesome; and therefore, it could not with propriety be presented to God. (Philo de Creatione.) 
Unclean. Hebrew, "three years shall it be as uncircumcised unto you; it shall not be eaten. "(Haydock)
