Though the Scriptures be of the Holy Spirit, the proper book of Christ's doctrine is in the hearts of the faithful, the true mansions of the Holy Spirit. Hence St. Irenus says: "If the apostles had left no writings, ought we not to follow the order of tradition they delivered to the persons to whom they committed the Churches? How many barbarous nations have received and practised the faith without any thing written in ink and paper? (lib. iii. chap. 4.)
