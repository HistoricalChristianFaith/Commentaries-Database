Eagle's. Which get fresh feathers every year, like other birds, Isaias xl. 31. (Calmet) 
The eagle retains its vigour for a long time, (Haydock) though many fabulous accounts have been given of its renovation. (Berthier) 
The new birth in baptism, (Theodoret) or by faith, (Eusebius) or the resurrection of Christ are thus insinuated, (St. Leo, ser. i.) as well as (Haydock) our resurrection and state of grace. The one is necessarily connected with the other, and both senses are good. (Worthington)
