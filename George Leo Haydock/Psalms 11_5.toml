Trieth, interrogat, which is rendered by examine, ver. 5. (Haydock) 
God juridically questions all, (Calmet) and makes them give an exact account of themselves, even of every idle word. (Haydock) 
The word also means that he punishes, or chastises. (Calmet) 
Hebrew, "the Lord trieth the just, but his soul hateth the wicked, and the lover of iniquity. "(St. Jerome) (Haydock) 
Yet the original may be explained in the sense of the Septuagint which is more beautiful and instructive; as the sinner will hardly believe that he is his own greatest enemy. (Berthier) 
By continuing in sin he brings damnation on his soul. (Worthington)
