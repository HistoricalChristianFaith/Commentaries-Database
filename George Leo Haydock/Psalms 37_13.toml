Laugh. This expression is often used to denote the triumph of divine justice, whose day will set all right: that day (2 Timothy iv. 8.) which ought to be constantly before our eyes. (Berthier) 
God cannot indeed mock at any one. (Calmet) 
But the wicked "deserve scorn and vengeance. "(Haydock) 
Digni sunt ut irrideantur in vindict√¢ . (St. Jerome) 
The day of their judgment or condemnation is at hand, (Ezechiel xxi. 25., and 1 Kings xxvi. 10.; Haydock) when they will be sought for in vain (ver. 10.; Calmet) by their foolish admirers. They will seek to hide themselves from the indignation of the Lamb.
