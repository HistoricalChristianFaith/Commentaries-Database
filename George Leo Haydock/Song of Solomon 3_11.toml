Go. All are invited to come to Christ, who, in his sacred humanity, which he took of his mother, was crowned in heaven, after his passion. (Worthington) (St. Gregory) (Alcuin) 
The synagogue crowned him with thorns, and gave him the hard bed of the cross. (St. Bernard; St. Anselm) 
Bethsabee might live to see the marriage of her son, who owed the crown to her, 3 Kings i. 18., and Proverbs iv. 3. Both the parties were crowned, (Isaias lxi. 10.) and no doubt Solomon would display his usual magnificence. The diadem was a bandage, adorned with embroidery, and precious stones. (Calmet)
