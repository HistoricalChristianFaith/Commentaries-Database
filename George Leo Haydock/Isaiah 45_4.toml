Likeness of Christ. 
Known me. Before the Jews had shown Cyrus the prophecies, he did not attribute his success to the Lord, and even afterwards he seems not to have left the superstitions of his country, as his sacrifices to idols are described. He resembled Nabuchodonosor and the philosophers, who did not glorify God according to their knowledge, Daniel ii. 47., and Romans i. 21. Cyrus even revoked the decree for building the temple, 1 Esdras iv. 5. (Calmet) 
He believed there was one God; (1 Esdras i.) yet he did not embrace the truth entirely. (Worthington)
