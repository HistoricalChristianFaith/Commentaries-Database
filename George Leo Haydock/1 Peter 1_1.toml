The Greek manuscripts and copies at present have eis a, in qu√¶, which is commonly expounded to agree with the mysteries revealed to the prophets, and which the Angels rejoiced and were delighted to see fulfilled by the coming of Christ. It seems as if the ancient interpreter had read eis o, agreeing with pneuma, spiritum; or perhaps eis on, to agree with theon, understood. These changes of a letter might easily happen. It appears that not only divers Latin interpreters, but also some of the Greek Fathers brought these words to show the divinity of the Holy Spirit, as St. Athanasius, Epist. i. ad Serap. p. 653. Edit. Ben.

Electis, eklektois. It is certain this word does not only signify those who are predestinated to eternal glory, but those who are chosen or called to believe; as John vi. Christ says, that he had elected or chosen his twelve apostles, and yet one of them (Judas) was a devil. The Jews were called the elect people of God, as now are all Christians; nor can we think that all to whom St. Peter wrote, were predestinated to glory.

Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the strangers dispersed. Literally, of the dispersion; i.e. to the Jews or Gentiles now converted, who lived dispersed in those countries, chosen or elected according to the foreknowledge and eternal decrees of God unto the sanctification of the spirit. (Witham) 
Asia is taken for one of the four quarters of the globe, or for Asia Minor, or for that province of Asia Minor of which Ephesus is the capital. It is in this latter sense it appears here to be understood, since Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, and Bithynia are also contained in the provinces of Asia Minor. (Bible de Vence)
