Himself. Hebrew has simply, "for David "(Calmet) as well as the Greek of the Vatican. "It is a mistake in Bell anger to say in general that the Greek adds "a psalm "since this is true only with respect to the edition of Aldus and Complutensian, says Berthier. But he is not quite accurate, as Erasmus inserts "a psalm "in his edition of St. Jerome's Septuagint; and the Alexandrian copy, which is equally famous with that of the Vatican, has for David. Grabe has indeed marked all but the last word as a peculiarity, or not to be found in Origen's copy. But he has published his edition with such accuracy, that we may distinguish what his manuscript contained from other interpolations. It were to be wished that the same attention had been paid to the Vatican copy. But hitherto all the editors have taken the liberty to make alterations without specifying where; so that we can have no security that we ever quote the real manuscript of the Vatican. The learned prefect, Zac Agni, gives abundant proof of this in his letter to Grabe, which has been published by Kennicott, Diss. 2. Yet any of these editions may be quoted as the Greek or Septuagint, as we have yet no copy perfectly authentic: and the learned are not even agreed which standard ought to be followed. If that which presents the greatest number of Origen's corrections be preferable, the Alexandrians manuscript must bear away the psalm . If the reverse, the glory must be given to its rival in the Vatican, which approaches the nearest to the koine, or to the edition of St. Lucian. See Kennicott. These remarks may be of service, as Berthier often seems inclined to place the Vatican edition on the same level with the Latin Vulgate. (Haydock) 
This psalm is alphabetical. The Syriac, Septuagint, read, (ver. 28) the unjust, avilim; a word which seems now to be deficient in the Hebrew, which has no verse beginning with a. (Calmet) 
Some other derangement has taken place. (Houbigant) 
The verses might be so divided as to begin every second verse with a fresh letter, and so to retain 42 verses. See ver. 7., and 20. The matter is of no great importance. The prophet has comprised several duties in alphabetical order, to help the memory, (Berthier) and to excite attention. (Worthington) 
He may predict the death of Saul, (Rabbins) or hint at the rebellion of Absalom in his old age; (ver. 25.; Ferrand) or rather he may comfort the captives at Babylon, promising them liberty, and denouncing the fall of their oppressors, above ten times. He admonishes them not to be scandalized at the distress of the just, and the prosperity of the wicked. (Calmet) 
Emulous. Hebrew, "Fret not thyself. "(Protestants) "Mingle not with "(Berthier; Pagnin) "contend not. "(St. Jerome) (Haydock) 
Envy. Their splendour is deceitful. (Calmet) 
Be not, therefore, seduced (Haydock) to imitate the wicked (Menochius) nor offended, that they should prosper here. (Worthington)

Reflect on God's will. (Haydock) 
Laboras; sed in vi√¢ Dei. (St. Augustine) 
Hebrew, "be not angry nevertheless (ac, a word which Houbigant deems useless) to do evil "(Montanus) or "against the wicked "(Prin. dis.) as lehareah may be perhaps signified; though it is more usually taken for a verb, as the points decide. (Berthier)
