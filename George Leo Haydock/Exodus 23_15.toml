Presents were to be made to God, in testimony of their submission to him; as they were to the kings of the east, by their subjects. (Tavernier, Perse. iv. 16.) See 1 Kings x. 27. and 1 Paralipomenon xviii. 2.

(Calmet) 
God. Here the Septuagint add, "For when I shall have cast the Gentiles from before thy face, and extended thy limits."
