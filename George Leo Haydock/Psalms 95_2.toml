Come. Earlier than usual, (Menochius) before the day be far spent; pr√¶occupemus, to show our diligence in prayer, (Haydock) and to obtain God's favour, as Aman was first at the palace of Assuerus, Esther vi. 4. 
This sentence has probably determined the Church to place it at the beginning of matins. (Calmet) 
Let not others get before us in performing this duty. (Haydock) 
We cannot prevent God's grace by an good works, since without it we can do nothing (Worthington) as we ought. (Council of Trent) 
Thanksgiving. St. Jerome literally, "in confession. "(Haydock) 
The same word, exomologesei, is used for sacramental confession; (Berthier) and this, or at least contrition, (Haydock) ought to go before our expressions of praise, Ecclesiasticus xv. 9. (Theodoret) (St. Jerome) 
The prophet exhorts us both to lament and to praise. (St. Augustine) (Berthier) 
Psalms and music. (Worthington)
