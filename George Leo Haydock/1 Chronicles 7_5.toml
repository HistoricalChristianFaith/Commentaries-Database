Aher, in Hebrew means, "another "son, called Hazim: or more probably Aher ought to be Dan, the father of Husim, (Genesis xlvi. 23.) as Dan and Nephthali had both the same mother, Bala, ver. 13. (Calmet) Ver. 14. Son. Hebrew, "sons.Ezriel, whom she bare. "This seems imperfect. The Hebrews seldom name the mother. (Calmet)

Galaad, whose posterity enjoyed the country of the same name, (Numbers xxii. 29., and xxxii. 41.) only Machir in mentioned as the son of Manasses. Ver. 15. And Saphan. St. Jerome seems to have taken them for women. If they were the sons of Hir, (ver. 12) Machir probably adopted them. Hebrew, "Machir took a wife from Hap him "But does one woman marry two men?

Badan, perhaps the same with Jair; (Judges x. 3., and 1 Kings xii. 11.; Calmet) or rather in this last place, the Syriac, read more correctly Barac, and Samson instead of Samuel, who was then speaking. See Hebrews xi. 32. There was no such deliverer as Badan, but the word has been corrupted from Barac. (Septuagint) (Kennicott) Ver. 18. Queen. Hebrew, "Moleceth bore Ishehod. "St. Jerome and the Latin Church translate these names. (Worthington) 
Protestants, "Hammoleketh bore I shod. "(Haydock)

(Haydock) 
The dreadful slaughter made of them, is perhaps the reason why only three are mentioned in Numbers, and none in Genesis. Ver. 21. Son, Ezer. Hebrew, "and Ezer and Elad. "His son, after each, seems to be twice omitted, as these were in the same degree as the rest. Septuagint agree with the Vulgate. (Haydock)

Bri√°e, "in howling. "(Menochius) Ver. 24. Daughter, or great grand-daughter, repaired these three cities. (Calmet)

But its situation is unknown. (Calmet) Ver. 25. Thale. Hebrew, "and Thale, his son, and Thaan, his son. "These seem to have been the sons of Ephraim. The following were their descendants. (Haydock) 
At least Elisama was prince in the wilderness, (Calmet) under Moses; (Numbers i. 10.; Haydock) and Josue, the sixth from Ephraim, was 54 years old, when the Israelites left Egypt. (Calmet) Ver. 29. Daughters. Septuagint, "villages. "
