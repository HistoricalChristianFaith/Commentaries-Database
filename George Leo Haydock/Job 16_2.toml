Comforters. "Job's friends or comforters "are become proverbial, to denote people who do the contrary to what they seem to promise. (Haydock) 
Never did men sustain worse the character of comforters. They all magnify their knowledge and piety, and make the most absurd application of their principles to Job's condition. (Calmet) 
He was not ignorant that tyrants and wicked men were often, nay generally till the age in which he lived, visited with visible judgments. (Haydock)
