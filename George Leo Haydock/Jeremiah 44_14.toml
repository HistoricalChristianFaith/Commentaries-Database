Desire and expectation, chap. xxii. 27. They meant to return as soon as the Chaldeans had left the country: but their hopes were vain. The enemy would fall upon Egypt, after he had taken Tyre and the neighbouring provinces; and those who had not abandoned that country in time, would perish, ver. 12, 26. (Calmet)
