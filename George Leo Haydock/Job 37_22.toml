Gold. Septuagint, "from the north, gold-coloured clouds. Above these, great is the praise and honour of the Almighty. "(Haydock) 
When the wind blows, the clouds are dispersed, and the sky appears serene. Each country has its peculiar advantages. In the north, Ophir, may boast of gold: but what ought to be most conspicuous in the praises given to God, is an humble fear. Pindar begins his Olympic Odes somewhat in the same style. (Calmet) 
"Water is excellent, and gold. But if, dear heart, thou wilt sing of games, regard no other star.as brighter than the sun. Nor shall we celebrate any game more excellent than that of Olympia. "(Haydock) 
God disposes of all things as he pleases. He makes the golden day succeed a tempest. But it is our duty to praise him with awe, whatever he may ordain. This is the epilogue. (Pineda) 
Man must praise God with fear, as he cannot do it sufficiently. (Worthington)
