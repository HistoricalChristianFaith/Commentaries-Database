If. This proves free will. To become truly wise, we must desire it with the same avidity as a miser seeks for riches. (Worthington) 
We must also pray, (ver. 3.) with humility (ver. 2.) to God, the giver of wisdom, ver. 6. Every science which has not Him for the beginning and end, is vain and dangerous. (Calmet)
