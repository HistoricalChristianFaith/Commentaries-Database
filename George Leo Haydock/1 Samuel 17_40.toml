Smooth. Louis de Dieu translates broken "pieces of stones "as he pretends, contrary to the common opinion, that rough stones are more suitable for the sling. (Calmet) 
The learned Jew, whom we have cited above, (ver. 12,) and several others, have inferred from this verse, that David seems to have just come from the flock. But Kennicott justly observes, that slingers were of great service in the army; and the "vessel of shepherds "the bag or scrip, might well be used to obtain the stones; as the staff, makel, denotes a military weapon. (Taylor, Conc.) (Diss. ii. p. 555.) David was very expert in using these weapons, and the ordinary armour was encumbering to him. (Haydock) 
"Valour depends more on its own efforts than on armour "tegumentis. (St. Ambrose, Off. i.)
