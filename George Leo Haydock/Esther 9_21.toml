Receive. Protestants, "establish this among them, that they should keep the 14th.yearly "2 Machabees xv. 37. (Haydock) 
None were obliged to keep more than one of these days, according to their respective dwellings. The 14th was for the provinces, the 15th for the Jews of Susan, ver. 18. (Tirinus) (Calmet) (Worthington) 
Yet it would seem that both days were enjoined, ver. 27, 28. (Haydock) 
The Jews still observe, them, as they gratify their vanity and vindictive spirit. The 13th is kept a rigid fast, for all above sixteen, for twenty-four hours, during which they eat nothing. (Calmet) 
If that day should be a sabbath, or its eve, they fast on the 11th or 12th. (Drusius) 
The day before the festival they give alms to their poor brethren, enjoining them to consume the whole in making good cheer. Each person must then contribute the half sicle, (Exodus xxx. 13.) which is bestowed on those who undertake a pilgrimage to the land of promise. At night, when the feast commences, they light the lamps, and begin to read the Book of Esther, as soon as the stars appear. They use an old parchment manuscript roll, and, in five places, the reader shouts with all his might, running over the names of the ten sons of Aman with all haste, to show that they all died in a moment. Whenever Aman is mentioned, the children beat the benches with mallets; and formerly they used to strike at a stone, on which his name was cut, till it broke, ver. 31. After the lecture, they take a repast at home. Early the next morning they return to the synagogue, and read the account of Amalec from the Pentateuch, and repeat the Book of Esther, with the aforesaid ceremonies. The rest of the day they spend in merriment. Their teachers allow them to drink till they are unable to distinguish the name of Aman from that of Mardochai. (Basnage, vi. 15.) 
They also change clothes, in contradiction to the law; (Deuteronomy xxii. 5.) and were formerly accustomed to crucify a man of straw, which they burnt with the cross, till Christian emperors put a stop to them; as it was concluded, from their curses, that they had an eye to our Saviour. (Calmet) See chap. v. 14. (Haydock)
