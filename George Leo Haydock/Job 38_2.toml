Words. Many explain this as a condemnation (Calmet) of the last speaker, (Du Hamel) who would otherwise pass without any reproach, (Haydock) though he had spoken with less reserve than the rest. (Calmet) 
Pineda allows that this opinion is very plausible; but he thinks that Job himself is reprehended, not for any grievous offence, but for indiscreet expressions, chap. xli. The context also seems to require this, as Job takes it to himself, chap. xxxix. 33. (Calmet) 
The change of persons might rather imply the contrary: Who is this? Eliu. 3. Gird up thy loins. Job. (Haydock) 
Can we admit that the devil got the victory; or, that God falsely declared that Job had spoken right? chap. xlii. (Houbigant) 
Did not the latter maintain the truth with greatest zeal, while his friends certainly mixed unskilful words or inferences with sentences of the greatest consequence? His face I will accept, that your folly be not imputed to you; for you have not spoken right things before me, as my servant Job hath, chap. xlii. 8. Hebrew, "Who is this that darkeneth counsel, by words without knowledge? "(Protestants) "Who is the who concealeth counsel from me, keeping words in his heart, and thinketh to hide from me? "(Septuagint) Eliu pretended to explain the counsels of God, and perhaps did not utter all that he had in his mind; but God condemns the very harbouring of thoughts, which are contrary to truth and justice. (Haydock) 
Job's friends laboured under great prejudices, and condemned him without cause, (Calmet) thinking that they were doing a service to God, like those who put the apostles to death, and persecuted Catholics on account of their religion. But this plea will not excuse them. Here one line suffices to refute the long harangue (Haydock) of Eliu; (St. Gregory; Ven. Bede; Tirinus) though we have observed, (Haydock) some understand the words to be addressed to Job, as a rebuke for his too warm expressions. (St. Chrysostom; St. Augustine) (Calmet) 
The remainder of the discourse is designed for Job's instruction. (Haydock) 
Hoc (Eliu) despecto ad erudiendum Job verba vertuntur. (St. Gregory)
