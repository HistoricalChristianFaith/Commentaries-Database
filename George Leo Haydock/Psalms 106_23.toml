Breach. Like a valiant captain, (Calmet) or pastor. (Haydock) 
God complains of those who neglected this duty, Ezechiel xiii. 5., and xxii. 30. The psalmist alluded to the conduct of Moses, after the people had adored the calf, (Exodus xxxii. 10.) or when they had joined with Core, Numbers xvi. 44. (Calmet) 
The intercession of the saints is useful, (St. Augustine) still more after their victories. (St. Jerome ad Vig. ii.) (2 Machabees xv. 14.) (Berthier) 
God spared the people for the sake of Moses. (Worthington)
