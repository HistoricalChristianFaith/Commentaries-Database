Heart. Septuagint have read differently from the present . (Berthier) 
Hebrew, "I recollected my canticle in the night, and communed with my own heart, and my spirit sought to the bottom "or, "I swept, (or directed, scope bam) my spirit "(St. Jerome) from all things unbecoming. Septuagint Eskallon. "I dug and harrowed "it by earnest meditation, to extract the weeds, and make it fit to receive the divine seed, (St. Jerome, here and ep. ad Sun.) and to bring forth fruit; (Haydock) or I swept to discover the precious jewel (Berthier) of salvation. (Haydock) 
Scope bam, is not deemed a good Latin word; but seems to be derived from skopeo, "I consider or direct my aim "though some think it means rather "I swept "Isaias xiv. 23. Hugo reads scopa bam. (Calmet) 
I diligently examined my conscience, (Worthington) and left nothing unturned, like the woman in the gospel who sought the groat. (Menochius) 
Hebrew yechapes, may also mean, "my spirit is set free "to say what might seem too bold, Will God (Calmet)
