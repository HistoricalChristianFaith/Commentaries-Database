Communicate.in all good things: by this communication, is understood an assisting of others in their wants. (Witham) 
Such as are blessed with the goods of this world, should gladly communicate a share of their efforts to the preachers and teachers of the true faith; and this not merely as a return for what they have received, but also that they may be made thereby partakers of their merit. (St. Augustine, lib. 2. evang. qu√¶st. q. 8.)
