Reputed by God, who cannot judge wrong; so that Abram increased in justice by this act of faith, believing that his wife, now advanced in years, would have a child; from whom others should spring, more numerous than the stars of heaven. (Haydock) 
This faith was accompanied and followed by many other acts of virtue, St. James ii. 22. (Worthington)
