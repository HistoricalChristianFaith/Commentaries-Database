Live in grace and glory. To serve God, it was not requisite that one should be at Jerusalem. Daniel, Tobias, were saints elsewhere. (Berthier) 
Yet it was more easy to worship God in his temple, where every thing moved to piety; (Haydock) and this the psalmist desires, deeming it a new life. (Calmet)
