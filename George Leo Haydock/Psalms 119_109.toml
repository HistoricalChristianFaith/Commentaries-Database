My hands. In danger of being thrown by, or of falling, (Worthington) ready to appear before God's tribunal. I watch over myself, and strive to keep my soul tranquil. The prophet might have all this in view. (Berthier) 
Most of the fathers read, "in thy hands "under God's protection. This is denied by St. Jerome (ad Sun.) though the commentary which goes under his name, and was written in the same age, has thy. The other reading is, however, more correct. The Greeks made use of a similar expression, to show the danger of losing a treasure. (Athen. xiii. 4.) (Calmet) 
Such is our soul, which we must fear to lose. (St. Gregory, Mor. vii. 6.) (Berthier)
