The law and the prophets Not that the law was made void by the coming of John , but that what the law and the prophets had taught, had been suited to the very imperfect dispositions of the Jews, who as yet were incapable of relishing perfect virtue. At the coming of John, the gospel began to be preached, and this called men to a life of perfect sanctity. (St. Thomas Aquinas) 
Our Saviour came not to destroy, but to fulfil the law and the prophets. (Matthew v. 17.)
