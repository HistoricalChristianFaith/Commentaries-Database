Destroy, as a thing accursed. (Haydock) 
Child. The great master of life and death (who cuts off one half of mankind whilst they are children) has been pleased sometimes to ordain that children should be put to the sword, in detestation of the crimes of their parents, and that they might not live to follow the same wicked ways. But without such ordinance of God, it is not allowable in any wars, how just soever, to kill children. (Challoner) 
The Israelites were now to execute God's orders with blind obedience, as he cannot be guilty of injustice. 
Nor covet. His, is omitted in Hebrew (Calmet) 
Amalec is stricken when the flesh is chastised
He is destroyed when we repress evil thoughts. (St. Gregory) (Worthington)
