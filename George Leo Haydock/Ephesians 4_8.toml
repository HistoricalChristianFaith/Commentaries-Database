He led captivity captive. 
He gave gifts to men. Having delivered men from the captivity of sin, he bestowed upon them his gifts and graces. (Witham) 
Wherefore he, David, in Psalm lxvii., makes use of these words, in order to show that these gifts were gratuitous, and that no person had a right to complain that another had received more: after this the apostle proceeds to show that Christ even descended to the lower parts of the earth, in order to teach us humility; whence he concludes that we ought to be humble and live in union with our brethren, which is the chief subject of the present chapter. (Tirinus)
