We live. That is, we live in joy and comfort, if you stand firm in the faith of Christ, as you ought. (Witham) 
The news that you stand steadfast in the Lord, reanimates me under all my sufferings, and as it were raises me to life again from the shadow of death, under which I am placed. O that I could see you, to complete the work of instructing you in the faith, which I have begun.
