Right. You cannot complain of having been first abandoned by God. All his works and proceedings are entitled to praise. Hebrew, "This rock, (hatsur) his works are perfect. "(Calmet) 
Septuagint, "God, his works are true. "(Haydock) 
God is often styled a rock, to denote this strength, ver. 18., and Psalm lxii. 8.
