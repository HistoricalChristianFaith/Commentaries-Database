Forthwith. Hebrew pirchach seems to be translated (Haydock) by three terms, rising, calamities, and forthwith, as it denotes "a bud "which suddenly appears. (Calmet) 
Septuagint Blast on, "On the right hand of the bud they rose up. "(Haydock) 
Hebrew, "Youth stood up on the right "to accuse me; (Psalm cviii. 6.) or, "Scarcely had I begun to flourish, when they rose up "The days of prosperity soon vanished, (Calmet) and young men were ready to insult the distressed, and, as it were, to trip them up. (Menochius) 
Septuagint, "they stretched out their feet and trampled upon me, that they might destroy me. "(Haydock) 
They seem to have read (Calmet) regliem, "their feet "though the two last letters are now omitted in Hebrew. (Haydock)
