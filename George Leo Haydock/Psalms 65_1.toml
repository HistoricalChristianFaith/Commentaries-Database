Perhaps the former might have put this psalm of David into the hands of the people, when they were going to Babylon, and Ezechiel might have exhorted them to recite it at their return. (Haydock) 
It seems to have been composed by David, in thanksgiving for rain; (Psalm xxviii.; Muis) or some of the Levites wrote it, after God had removed the scourge of drought, with which he had afflicted the people, in consequence of their neglecting to finish the temple, Aggeus i. 4., and Malachi as iii. 9. (Calmet) 
David predicts the return from captivity, (Berthier) and the vocation of the Gentiles, (St. Hilary; Menochius) which the prophets Jeremias, had insinuated, by the coming of the nations from Babylon, so as to forsake idolatry. (St. Augustine) (Worthington)
