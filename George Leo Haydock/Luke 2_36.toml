Anna, a prophetess. She was another witness that Jesus was the Messias, venerable for age, and more for her piety. 
And had lived with her husband seven years from her virginity; i.e. had been seven years a wife: and from the death of her husband, had remained always a widow: now 84 years of age: who departed not from the temple, but was constantly there at the times of prayer, with fastings and prayers, serving God day and night. (Witham)
