Beera, This tribe continued to have princes of their own, after the division of the kingdom. Beera was in power when Thelgathphalnasar, or Theglathphalasar, took five tribes into captivity, 4 Kings xv. 29. Only twelve generations are mentioned to fill up about 750 years, from the leaving of Egypt. (Calmet) 
But Enoch must have lived much sooner, as the Israelites continued in that country at least 215 years. The princes are probably not all specified, as on other occasions. (Haydock)
