Hearken. The seventh morning is come, and I must depart to the mountains, chap. ii. 17., and iv. 6. Christ, before his ascension, exhorts his Church to present her petitions. He is always ready to hear her, and to grant her aid, in every emergency. See St. Ambrose, de Virg. xvi. 99. 
The virtuous pray that her requests may be granted, (Haydock) and are eager to know what they are. (Menochius)
