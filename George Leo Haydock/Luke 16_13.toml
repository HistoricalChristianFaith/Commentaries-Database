No servant can serve two masters This is added to show us, that to dispose of our riches according to the will of the Almighty, it is necessary to keep our minds free from all attachment to them. (Theophylactus) 
Let the avaricious man here learn, that to be a lover of riches, is to be an enemy of Christ. (Ven. Bede)
