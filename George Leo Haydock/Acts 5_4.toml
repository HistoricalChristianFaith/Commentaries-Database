Did it not remain to thee? That is, no one forced thee to make such a promise. 
And being sold, was it not in thy power, and at thy free disposal, before such a promise? but promises and vows must be kept. Thou hast not lied to men, but to God, by lying to the Holy Spirit. (Witham) 
Thou hast not lied to men, only and principally, but to God also; for he had also lied to Peter, and the other apostles. (Menochius) 
"If it displeased God "says St. Augustine, "to withdraw part of the money they had vowed to God, how is he angry, when chastity is vowed and not performed! . let not such persons think to be condemned to corporal death, but to everlasting fire. "(Serm. x. de divers is.) 
St. Gregory, on this same subject, says: "Ananias had vowed money to God, which afterwards, overcome by diabolical persuasion, he withdrew; but with what death he was punished, thou knowest. See, then, what judgment thou art to expect, for withdrawing, not money, but thyself, from Almighty God. "(lib. i. ep. 33.)
