Shepherd. Christ makes use of the same comparison, John x. 1. Kings are often styled shepherds in Homer. Moses begs that his successor may be enabled to conduct the multitude in both peace and war. 
To go in and out, means to govern, (3 Kings iii. 7,) and includes all the occurrences of life, Acts i. 21., and Psalm cxx. 8. (Calmet) 
Thus, temporal princes are the shepherds of the people. But they are not, on that account, supreme in spiritual causes. For here Josue only receives part of the glory of Moses, while Eleazar is appointed to consult the Lord for him, and to direct him in all matters of importance, ver. 20, 21. (Worthington)
