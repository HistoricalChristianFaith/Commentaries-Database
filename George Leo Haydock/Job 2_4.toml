Skin: a proverbial expression, denoting that a man will part with any thing sooner than his life, (Calmet) or health. (Haydock) 
Satan hints, that if those inestimable blessings should be endangered, (Calmet) Job would show his real sentiments. (Haydock) 
Skin was formerly used instead of money, at Sparta. (Senec. Ben. v. 14.) Yet perhaps not in the time of Job.
