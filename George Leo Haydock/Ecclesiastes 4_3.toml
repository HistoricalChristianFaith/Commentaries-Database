Born. It is better to have no existence than to be in eternal misery, Matthew xxvi. 24. But the affliction of the just procureth glory for them. (Worthington) 
The pagan sages observed, that it was "best for mortals not to be born; and if they were, to die very soon. "(Chalcid. and Theognis.) 
But they considered only temporal inconveniences. Religion has in view the danger of sin, and the desire of eternal happiness, Romans vii. 24.
