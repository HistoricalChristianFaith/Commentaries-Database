Angry. My soldiers, do not resent this offence too much, kill not the boy; (2 Kings xviii. 5.) or (Haydock) you, my deluded subjects, enter into yourselves. St. Paul (Ephesians iv. 26.) cites this as a moral sentence. (Calmet) 
It is more difficult to moderate anger than to deny access to it entirely. (St. Francis de Sales) (Haydock) 
Beds. Repent for the most secret evil thoughts, before you fall asleep. (Worthington)
