He. My friend. (Calmet) 
Hebrew, "speaketh flattery "(Haydock) or promiseth to caress me, while he neglects his own children. But the sense of the Vulgate and Chaldean seem preferable. My friends speak as if they could do any thing, and as if no trial would stagger their resolution. But they durst not be in my situation for a short time. (Calmet) 
Like hunters, who have promised their children some prey, my friends will not, however, gain the victory over me. (Menochius)
