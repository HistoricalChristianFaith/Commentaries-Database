Words, or transactions. (Haydock) 
Book. This book is lost, with divers others mentioned in holy writ. (Challoner) 
Nathan, Ahias, and Addo, composed these journals, 2 Paralipomenon ix. 29. (Haydock) 
Similar works were kept at the courts of Persia and of Babylon, Esther vi. 1., and 1 Esdras vi. 2. Plutarch quotes the journal of Alexander; and Tacitus (An. iii.) informs us, that the smallest occurrences were specified in journals, at Rome, while things of greater importance were recorded in the annals. The books of days, are cited in the Paralipomenon, so that we cannot suppose that these journals are the same with that work. (Calmet) 
God was pleased that those writings should not come down to us; so that we can only speak from conjecture of the repentance of Solomon. (Salien, the year of the world 3058.)
