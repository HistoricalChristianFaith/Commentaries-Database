Strange. Idolatress, (Grotius) or rather the abandoned woman, whether married or not. (Calmet) 
This description, as well as the former, guards us against heretics, who leave the right way of the Catholic Church, (ver. 13.) and devise perverse doctrines of rebellion against princes, as if faith alone were sufficient. By this faith, Protestants do not mean any article which all must believe, but only that each one must be convinced that he himself is just, and will be saved. Like the strange woman, they preach a comfortable doctrine, and use sweet speeches, Romans xvi. 18. Their conversion is a very difficult matter, (ver. 19.) because they are condemned by their own judgment, (Titus iii. 11.) and will not admit of the ordinary means of instruction in the Church. (Worthington)
