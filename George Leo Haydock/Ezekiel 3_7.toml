Hard. Literally, "rubbed "like a stone, or brass; attrita. (Haydock) 
God's ambassadors (Ephesians vi. 20.; Calmet) must do their utmost. (Haydock) 
The success must not puff them up, nor the failure too much depressed them, as all regards God, (Matthew x. 40.) who will know how to make things conduce to his own glory. They must only bewail the blindness of sinners. (Calmet) 
The care of them, and not the cure, will be required at their hands, ver. 19. (Haydock)
