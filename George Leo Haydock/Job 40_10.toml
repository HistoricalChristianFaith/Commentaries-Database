Behemoth; the elephant, (Challoner) "as some think. "(Protestants' marginal note) (Haydock) 
This is the most common opinion, though Sanchez explains it of the bull; and Bo chart, after Beza and Diodati, declares in favour of the hippopotamus, (Calmet) or "river horse. "Parkhurst even thinks Bo chart has proved this "to a demonstration. "The sea or river horse, (Haydock) is an amphibious animal, (Calmet) found in the Nile and Indus, and said to have the feet of an ox and the teeth of a boar, but not quite so sharp, while the neighing, back, mane, and tail, resemble those of a horse. Its hide, when dry, is said to resist even a musket-ball. (Button; Dict.) 
We find a good description of this animal in Watson, p. 91. But the plural Be moth, female (Haydock) "beasts "seems more applicable to the elephant, on account of its great size, as it is designated by theria, or Bellua, by the Greek and Roman authors. (Suidas.) (1 Machabees vi. 35.) (Pliny, viii. 3.) 
It may have received the name of elephant from (Calmet) alp, "to lead or teach "(Haydock) on account of its great sagacity and strength. All that Job says of behemoth, may be well explained of it. The Fathers have supposed, that the devil is meant: but we stick to the literal sense. (Calmet) 
He may, however, (Haydock) have been hinted at by this name, (Worthington) as well as by that of leviathan. (Houbigant) 
With thee, on the same day, or as well as thee. (Amama) 
Grass. The elephant does so, and is by no means savage. (Calmet) 
Septuagint, "Yet, behold, near thee wild beasts, equal to oxen, eat grass. "(Haydock) 
The spontaneous productions of the earth, and branches of trees, afford the principal sustenance to satisfy the prodigious stomach of the elephant; which is frequently twelve feet high, and of a dark colour. A sword can scarcely pierce it in the back or sides. It has small eyes, eight teeth, and two tusks; which last are sometimes above a hundred weight each, and being cast every tenth year, (Button) afford ivory. The proboscis serves it instead of hands to collect the smallest grain, or to defend itself. (Haydock) 
The female goes with young a whole year, and the duration of its life is generally supposed to be above a hundred. Elephants inhabit warm climates, and were formerly much used in war, to carry wooden towers, from which twenty, or even thirty, men might throw darts, 1 Machabees vi. 37. (Button.) 
If this greatest and most temperate of all beasts be overcome by the unicorn, or led by the nose, how much more will God enable man to overcome the devil? (Worthington)
