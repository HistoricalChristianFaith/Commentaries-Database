Necks. Hebrew, "the spoils of various colours, the embroidery of divers colours, on both sides, for the necks (of the captors) of the spoil. "(Haydock) 
Or more simply, "for the neck (general) of the army "(Vatable) or "the necks of the soldiers "who will be laden with the abundance of spoils. (Calmet) 
The ladies dwell with great delight on the thought of possessing rich embroidery or needle work. How dreadfully would their hopes be blasted, when a few hours after they saw Barac at their gates, and their city in flames! (Haydock)
