Way. By the torrent Cedron, the passion of Christ is insinuated. (Houbigant) 
During life, he and his faithful servants shall be exposed to many sufferings, for which they will be amply rewarded. (Worthington) (Philippians ii. 9.) 
A torrent often denotes affliction, Psalm xvii. 5., and Isaias xxx. 28. Yet here it may signify, that Christ will supply every thing requisite to establish his Church. To find water for an army was of the greatest consequence, Jeremias xxxi. 9., Psalm lxxvii. 20., and 4 Kings iii. 9. (Calmet) 
Like a valiant conqueror, Christ seeks for no delicacies. (Muis) (Calmet) 
Those who come nearest to this divine pattern, will obtain the highest place in heaven. (Berthier)
