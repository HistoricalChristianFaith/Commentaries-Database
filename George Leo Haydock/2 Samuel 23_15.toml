Gate. David had been educated in that town. (Menochius) 
He expresses his wish to see his native place delivered from the hands of the enemy, more than for water; (Sanctius; Kennicott) or being very thirsty, he speaks his sentiments without designing that any should attempt to procure him the water. (Calmet) 
The three valiant men considered his desire as a law. (Menochius) 
They were not to be condemned of rashness, though it would have been such in ordinary men. (Salien) 
David only intended to try the valour of his soldiers. When they brought the water he would not drink, judging that precious things should be offered to God. (Worthington)
