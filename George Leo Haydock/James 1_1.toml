James, a servant of God, and of our Lord Jesus Christ. Some have doubted whether the author of this epistle was St. James, the apostle, because he does not call himself an apostle. By the same weak argument we might reject all the three epistles of St. John and his Apocalypse, and the epistle of St. Jude. Nor does St. Paul give himself this title in those to the Thessalonians, to the Philippians, to Philemon, or to the Hebrews. 
To the twelve tribes, which are dispersed. Literally, which are in the dispersion. That is, to the Jews converted in all nations. 
Greetings. Literally, salvation. Which comprehendeth much the same as, when St. Paul says, grace, peace, mercy (Witham)
