According to the course of this world, (i.e. the customs of this wicked corrupt world) according to the prince of the power of this air, of the spirit meaning the devils, who are permitted to exercise their power upon the earth, or in the air. See John xii. 10.; xiv. 30.; xvi. 11. (Witham) 
Secundum soeculum mundi hujus: according to the custom of this world. You were dead to the eyes of God, but you live in the eyes of the world: and how do you live? according to the maxims of the world, in idolatry, in crime, in corruption of manners. Corrumpi et corrumpere s√¶culum est. (Tacitus) (Calmet)
