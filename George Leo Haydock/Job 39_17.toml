Understanding. This bird has a head disproportionately small; insomuch, that Heliogabalus served up the brains of 600 at one supper. It greedily eats iron, which may help its digestion, as sand does that of other birds. (Calmet) 
When it is hunted, it hides its head only, as if this would be a sufficient defence, (Pliny, x. 1.) and is taken alive by a man, clothed in the skin of an ostrich, who moves the head with his hand. (Strabo xvi.) 
All which proves its stupidity. (Calmet)
