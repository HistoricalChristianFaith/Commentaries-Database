Curse. Hebrew, "you are cursed, and there shall be none of you freed from being bondmen "(Haydock) you are a part of those nations which are under an anathema, and you deserve to be severely punished. (Calmet) 
But we shall fulfil our engagements with you, only in punishment for your craftiness: (Haydock) you must submit to change your religion, (Calmet) which will be your greatest blessing, (Haydock) and to perform the meanest offices, which may be considered as a sort of curse. It is thought that some recompense was allowed the Gabaonites for their labour. (Serarius, q. 17.) 
This sentence was probably pronounced at Galgal, (Calmet) though we might as well conclude that Josue would wait till he came to Gabaon, before he arraigned the people, as no doubt they would make the best of their way out of the camp, as soon as they had obtained their request. (Haydock) 
Water. Slaves of the meanest condition were employed in these offices, Deuteronomy xxix. 11. (Athen. x. 22.)
