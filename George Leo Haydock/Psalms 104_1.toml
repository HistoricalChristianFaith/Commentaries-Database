Himself. Complutensian Septuagint adds, "a psalm on the creation "(Haydock) as this is the subject; but there is no title in the original. (Berthier) The psalm contains "a divine and natural philosophy "(Eusebius) respecting the creation and providence. Plato has written something similar in his Tim√¶us, (Calmet) though this comparison is indecent. (Berthier) 
The imitation is no disparagement, however, to this divine word, and we may surely notice the concord between the inspired and profane writers. (Haydock) 
This psalm seems to be a continuation of the preceding one. (Calmet) 
Great. Literally, "magnified "in the same sense as we say, hallowed be thy name, praying that God may be honoured by all his creatures; (Haydock) though He cannot increase in holiness (St. Augustine) 
We become acquainted with his greatness, by considering his works. (Calmet) 
Praise. Literally, "confession "(Haydock) Hebrew, "glory. "(Calmet) 
Thou art entitled to all praise. (Worthington)
