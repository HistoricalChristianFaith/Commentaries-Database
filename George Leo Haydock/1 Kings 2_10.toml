David. Thus died this perfect model of princes, and this great saint, whose only fault, of consequence, was occasioned by Bethsabee: (2 Kings xi. 4.) and this served to display his repentance. (St. Chrysostom, hom. lxxvii.) 
He prefigured Jesus Christ in a wonderful manner; in his birth, at the same city; his election, in preference to his brethren; his persecutions, and subsequent glory. Jesus was, in like manner, betrayed by a false friend, and obliged to go out of Jerusalem, laden with his cross. But he acquired fresh splendour by his sufferings, and purchased a more faithful people. The tomb of David remained for many ages, Acts ii. 29. Josephus says that it contained vast riches: but this seems to be fabulous. St. Jerome often went to pray at this tomb. (Ep. ad Marcel.) 
If it be now unknown, the Holy Spirit has left us a more illustrious monument to the honour of this great man, in the Psalms, and Ecclesiasticus xlvii. 2. (Calmet) 
We have now only an abridgment of his history, 1 Paralipomenon xxix. 29.
