Let death This, and such like imprecations, which occur in the psalms, are delivered prophetically; that is, by way of foretelling the punishments which shall fall upon the wicked from divine justice, and approving the righteous ways of God: but not by way of ill-will, or uncharitable curses, which the law of God disallows. (Challoner) 
David showed even too much tenderness towards the rebels, in the opinion of Joab He would not hurt Saul. His predictions were verified; as Achitophel became a suicide, Absalom perished miserably, suspended between heaven and earth, as an object of horror to both, while many of his accomplices were either slain, or fell into precipices, 2 Kings xvii. 23., and xviii. 8. (Haydock) 
Hell, by a sudden death, like Antiochus, Core, Numbers xvi. 30. The just are already dead to this world. (Berthier) 
Those who sin on purpose, descend, as it were, alive into hell. (Worthington)
