He that shall receive: To receive, in the style of the Scriptures, is to honour and favour, to be charitable, and kind to any one. (Witham) 
Who does not admire here the great goodness of God! Jesus, knowing that he was soon to leave the world, and that his disciples would no longer have it in their power to manifest their charity for him by their kind services, substitutes the poor in his place, declaring, that if they receive or honour them, they received Christ himself. (Denis the Carthusian) 
What greater proof can we wish for the merit of good works!!!
