Meat. The more religious, at least, had hitherto abstained from flesh, being content with herbs: which had been expressly granted. Now, the salt waters of the deluge had vitiated the earth, its plants were no longer so nutritive. (Menochius) 
God gives leave to eat flesh meat, but with some restriction, that we may still learn to obey. (Worthington)
