Bread. This characterizes the traitor, who had recieved the holy Communion, and had been intrusted with the purse by our Saviour, yet betrayed him with the sign of peace. (Calmet) 
To violate the laws of hospitality was greatly resented by the very pagans. (Plutarch, Symp. vii. 4.) 
Supplanted me, or kicked like a wild colt, as Plato complained that Aristotle had done, when he set up another school. (Haydock) Emas apelaktise. (Laertius, Elian iv. 9.) 
David might allude to Absalom, though the Holy Spirit speaks of Judas. (Calmet) 
Our Saviour himself says, (Worthington) that the Scriptures may be fulfilled, he that eateth bread with me, shall lift up his heel against me: Qui man ducat mecum panem leva bit contra me calcaneum suum: eperen ep eme ten pternan autou, "has lifted up", as the Hebrew expresses it here. Judas had attempted to betray Christ already, and would do it more effectually hereafter; so that both the present and future might agree with him. We also find the psalm translated qui edebat panes meos But the difference is very small. (Haydock) 
To lift up the heel, is the posture of one who attempts to supplant his adversary. (Menochius)
