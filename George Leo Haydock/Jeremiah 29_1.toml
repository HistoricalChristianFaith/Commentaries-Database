Letter. Literally, "book. "(Haydock) 
It was probably sent at the beginning of the reign of Sedecias by his ambassadors, and is different from that sent by Baruch i. and chap. lii. 28. 
Prophets. Chaldean, "scribes. "(Calmet) 
Septuagint, "false prophets "ver. 8. (Haydock) 
Daniel had begun to prophesy, the year of the world 3402. Ezechiel commenced only five years after the captivity of Jechonias. One prophet frequently instructs another, as Nathan did David, Daniel ix. 2., and 1 Peter i. 11. (Calmet) 
Jeremias declares that the captivity would continue long. He comforts and rebukes to chap. xl. (Worthington)
