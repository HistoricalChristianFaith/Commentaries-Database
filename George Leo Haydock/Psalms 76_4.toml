"Thou art a light magnificently from (Haydock) or more than, (Berthier) the mountains of the captivity. "(St. Jerome) 
Or, "of prey. "(Protestants) 
"Thou art more terrible. Than the richest mountains. "(Theodoret) 
Yet this comparison hardly suits in this place, (Calmet) and Houbigant prefers the Vulgate and Septuagint, who may have read terem, "before "or saraph, "of the seraph "(alluding to God's seat upon the ark) instead of tareph, "prey. "(Berthier) 
God grants victory to his people, and enlightens them with the true faith. (Worthington)
