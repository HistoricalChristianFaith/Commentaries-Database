Victims. Moses ordered the blood to be poured out at the door of the tabernacle, and a part given to the priests, after which the rest might be taken away. The like was probably done at Jerusalem, Leviticus xvii. 4. These victims are contrasted with those of pleasure, chap. vii. 14. 
Mingled. It was not customary for any but barbarians and the gods to take pure wine. Some mixed two, others three, five, or even twenty parts of water. But the scholiast of Aristophanes says, the best method was to have three parts of water, and two of wine. Mercury complains that his wine was half water. (Arist. Plut. v. Sun. i.) 
The Fathers often apply this text to the feast of Jesus Christ in the blessed Eucharist. (Calmet) 
St. Cyprian (ep. iii.) citeth the whole passage of Christ's sacrifice in the forms of bread and wine. (Worthington)
