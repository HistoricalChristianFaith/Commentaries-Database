I will love thee, as a mother does her son. He that loves has fulfilled the law. This word is omitted 2 Kings. xxii. 2. (Calmet) 
Strength. Ibid. 
Rock. (Haydock) 
The Septuagint have inserted some alterations in the Psalms, giving the sense of the Hebrew. (Worthington) 
Others attribute the variations to David, or to the mistake of transcribers. (Haydock)

This title is almost wholly taken from the book of Kings, except Unto the end for; instead of which we read, And David spoke, (Haydock) which are the words of the inspired writer; so that Ferrand is very rash in rejecting both these titles. David wrote this psalm after he had subdued the Moabites (Calmet) 
He was inspired to write it (Worthington) twice, with some variations, (Berthier) 74 in number, (Aberbanel) or many more, if we believe Kennicott, who lays them to the charge of transcribers, perhaps, (Haydock) with greater reason. (Calmet) 
We cannot doubt but this psalm regards David. But there are some passages which refer to Jesus Christ and his Church more directly; and in general, David must here be considered as only (Berthier) the figure of the Messias, and of the just in his Church. (Worthington) 
James Paine has endeavoured to prove, with great ingenuity, that the whole must be explained of Jesus Christ, and that the name of Saul stands for "the grave "as the points which are of modern date, only need to be changed. Thus the sufferings of our Saviour, and the punishment of the Jews in the last siege of Jerusalem are described; and thus it is clear that St. Paul (Romans xv. 9.) has cited this psalm in it proper sense. (Berthier) 
See ver. 10, 41. 
Sts. Jerome and Augustine explain it of the victories of David, of the Messias, and of his Church. (Calmet) 
Saul may be particularly mentioned, because he was the most powerful. (Worthington)
