Semma. The same with the third hero, though his country is differently written, ver. 11. (Calmet) 
But this is very improbable, as the number of 37 would be thus destroyed. The former was an Hararite. The Septuagint style the present captain, Samoth, in 1 Paralipomenon; Vulgate Sam moth; and the Ald. copy has Semoth here. He was the fifth captain; (1 Paralipomenon xxvii. 8,) and the four subsequent ones relieved each other in waiting on the king. 
Harodi, more correct than Arorite, 1 Paralipomenon, (Haydock) as the Septuagint also there terminate with di. 
Elica is omitted, 1 Paralipomenon xi., (Kennicott) as he perhaps died soon; and Zabad succeeding to his honours, comes at the end of these 30 heroes, Ibid. ver. 30. (Junius)
