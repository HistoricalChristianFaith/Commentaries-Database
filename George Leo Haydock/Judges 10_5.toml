Camon is placed in Galaad by Adrichomius, though St. Jerome mentions another, six miles from Legion, where he supposes that Jair was buried. It seems more natural to say that he was interred in his own country, on the east side of the Jordan. (Bonfrere) 
It is, probably the same city as Hamon (1 Paralipomenon vi. 16,) and Hammothdor, Josue xxxi. 32. (Calmet)
