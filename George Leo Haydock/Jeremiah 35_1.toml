Joakim, when Nabuchodonosor besieged him again in his 7th year. The Rechabites then pitched their tents in Jerusalem, ver. 11. (Calmet) 
Here we behold a figure of religious orders in the Church, as well as in the Nazarites and disciples of the prophets, Numbers vi., and 4 Kings i. They observed certain rules for acquiring greater perfection, and refrained from many things which were otherwise lawful. Thus various religious orders, both of men and of women, have flourished in the Church, and though they have different names and regulations, yet they are not sects, as heretics would pretend, but all follow the same faith, use the same sacraments, and are a great ornament to the Catholic Church by their profession of the three essential vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience, in imitation of the apostles, Matthew xix. 12. 
Joakim. This happened before the preceding prophecies. (Worthington)
