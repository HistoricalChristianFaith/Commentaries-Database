Should. Literally, "Does one like me retire from his post? And who like me shall enter the temple and live? "(Haydock) 
It is unlawful for a layman to flee into the part of the temple assigned to the priests. Yet into this he had been invited, as the court of Israel was not perhaps yet secured. Those who suppose that Nehemias was a priest, say (Calmet) that he refused to flee, lest he should intimidate the people by his cowardly departure. (Tirinus) (Menochius) 
Semaia might also have a design upon his life, when they should be alone.
