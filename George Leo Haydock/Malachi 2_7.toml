The angel, viz., the minister and messenger. (Challoner) 
Priests must administer the sacraments, and likewise instruct the people, being God's messengers. (Worthington) 
The Jews were well acquainted with the law, Jeremias xviii. 18. 
The priests had to decide most intricate cases, Deuteronomy xvii. 9., and xxxiii. 9. (Calmet) 
The sentence of the high priest was received like that of an angel. (Diod. Sic. xl. apud Phol.) 
If such science was required under the old law, how much more is necessary in Christian priests, whose mysteries and duties are so much more important! (Calmet) 
Ignoratio scripturarum ignoratio Christi est. (St. Jerome in Isaiashic.)
