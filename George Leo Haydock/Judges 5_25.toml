Dish. Hebrew sephel; whence the sympule of the Lydians, Tuscans, and Romans, was probably derived, denoting a bowl or jug with a handle, designed for libations. They were formerly made of potter's ware, fictilibus prolibatur sympuciis, or sympulis. (Pliny, xxxv. 13.) "Aut quis
Sympuvium ridere Num√¶, nigrumve catinum
Aut vaticanas fragiles de monte patellas
Ausus erat. "(Juvenal, Sat. vi.) (Calmet)
