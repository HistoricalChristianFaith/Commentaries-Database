Shall reduce them to pieces In Hebrew, shall make them to skip like a calf. The psalmist here describes the effects of thunder, (which he calls the voice of the Lord) which sometimes breaks down the tallest and strongest trees; and makes their broken branches skip All this is to be understood mystically, of the powerful voice of God's word in his Church; which has broke the pride of the great ones of this world, and brought many of them meekly and joyfully to submit their necks to the sweet yoke of Christ. (Challoner) 
Calf, or "branch "as the Greek word also implies. But Hebrew seems more naturally to signify "a calf; Libanus and Sir ion, (or Sari on.; Deuteronomy iii. 9.) as the son of the unicorn. "These two mountains are represented jolting together. (Calmet) 
The violence of an earthquake has sometimes produced such effects. (Pliny, ii. 83.) See Psalm cxiii. 4., Judges v. 5., and Habacuc iii. 10. (Calmet) 
And as. The constructiondilectus, seems rather to make this another nominative, "the Lord shall, and the beloved, (Haydock) the Messias, like the son of the unicorn "shall perform the like wonders. It seems probable that the Septuagint have read Jeshurun for Shirion, (Berthier) or vissron, instead of ussriun; as i would only be a little transposed. (Haydock) 
Jeshurun is a title of Israel, (Deuteronomy xxxii. 15., and xxxiii. 5, 26.) who was a figure of the Messias, the beloved of God. (Berthier) 
"And he will scatter them as a calf would do; Libanus and Sari on, are in motion, like the son of the rhinoceros. "(St. Jerome) (Haydock) The most powerful submit to Christ, who works these wonders. (Worthington)
