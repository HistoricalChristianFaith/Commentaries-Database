Offend. It was more culpable for Juda to commit idolatry (as they had the temple, of the true God) than for Israel, whom Jeroboam hindered from going to Jerusalem, after he had set up his golden calves. (Worthington) 
Galgal and Bet haven. Places where idols were worshipped. Bethel, which signifies the house of God, is called by the prophet Bet haven, that is, the house of vanity, from Jeroboam's golden calf which was worshipped there. (Challoner) 
Galgal was on the confines of the two kingdoms, and always venerated by the Jews. Idols had been there in ancient times, and probably a sort of oracle, Judges iii. 19. If Israel be thus abandoned, let not Juda imitate them. (Calmet) 
Lord. Profane not this sacred name by giving it to idols. (Theodoret) 
Use not this expression, since you do not worship me. (St. Jerome)
