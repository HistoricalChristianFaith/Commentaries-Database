Our mouth is open to speak with freedom and confidence. 
Our heart is enlarged, dilated, as it were, with the warmth of love and charity. 
But you are straitened in your own bowels; you have not the like charity and love for me, nor for all your brethren, and for all mankind (Witham) 
The apostle here complains, that the Corinthians have not the same affection for him, which he has for them: as if he should say, however enlarged your heart may be, through the love you have for me, it can never equal the ardour of my love for you. He alludes to those who followed some false teachers, of whom he says a little after: Though I love you more, I am less loved. 
But having the same recompense, by a just return have the same affection for me, as I have for you. (St. Chrysostom) 
Let your heart be dilated for me, and receive the advice I give you as coming from a father, who most tenderly loves his children. (Haydock)
