Thy prayer is heard. We cannot suppose, as St. Augustine observes, (lib. ii. QQ. Evang. chap i., tom. 3, part 2, p. 249. Ed. Ben.) that he was praying to have children, when his wife was so advanced in years; that he did not think possible; but he was praying for the people, and for the coming of the Messias. See St. Chrysostom, hom. ii. de incomprehensibili, tom. 1, p. 454. Nov. Ed. Ben. (Witham) 
Zacharias so far despaired of having any offspring, that he did not believe the angel, when he made him the promise. When therefore the angel says, thy prayer is heard, we must understand it of the prayer he offered in behalf of the people, to whom salvation and remission of sins were to be brought by Christ. The angel, moreover, told him of the birth of his son, who was to be the precursor of Christ. (St. Augustine) 
The son that is to be born of thee, will show that thy prayer is heard, when he cries out, behold the Lamb of God. (St. Chrysostom) 
It is always a mark of singular merit, whenever the Almighty either appoints or changes the name of a man. (Ven. Bede) 
The name of John is derived from the Hebrew word, Jochanan, which frequently occurs in the Old Testament, as 1 Paralipomenon iii. 15. and vi. 9. and xii. 12. and signifies, blessed with grace or divine favour; see also in Isaias xxx. 18, 19.
