Asaph. Add, "to him, and (Haydock) to his sons, and his brethren, twelve "who taught the rest. Unless these twelve be admitted, (Tirinus) as in the sequel, (Haydock) the number 288 will not be found, ver. 7. (Tirinus) 
Septuagint is very confused: "And the first (entire) lot of his sons and brethren came out to Asaph, of Joseph, Godolias: the second Enia, his brethren, and his sons, twelve. "Hebrew, "the first lot came forth for Asaph to Joseph; the second to "(Protestants) In all the subsequent verses they read, "he, his sons, and his brethren, were twelve. "Why Asaph should be mentioned any more than Idithun or Heman, does not appear. Their children are placed indiscriminately by lot. (Haydock)
