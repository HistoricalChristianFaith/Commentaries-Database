Some think St. Paul alludes in this verse to the corporal exercises of wrestlers, which procured them but a little short renown, whereas the works of piety have a more lasting reward. (Menochius; Tirinus) 
Corporal exercises of temperance, mortification are good, but not to be compared with the spiritual virtues of charity, piety (St. Bernard)
