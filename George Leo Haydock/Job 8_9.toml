That. Hebrew, "because our days. "(Haydock) 
Baldad strives, in vain, to prove what nobody contested. But he does not come to the point, and show that Job was guilty. Past histories might have informed him that the just are often persecuted, like Abel, Abraham, Jacob, and Joseph. (Calmet) 
It is true, these were afterwards conforted in honour, except the first, who was slain, and better off in the other world. But Job might hope for the same treatment; and no man can be pronounced happy or miserable till his death. After a storm a calm frequently ensues; as Baldad might have seen verified in the person of his friend, if he had waited patiently, and not judged so peremptorily from equivocal arguments. (Haydock) 
We must allow, however, that what he said had been generally true. (Houbigant)
