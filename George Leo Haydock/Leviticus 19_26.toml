Blood. The flesh of any animal. The blood must belong to God. The members of the Sanhedrim eat nothing on the day that a criminal is executed, supposing that this is the meaning of the precept. The Septuagint read erim, "on the mountains "and another version has, "on the roof "as if the worship of idols on high places were forbidden. (Haydock) 
Divine. Perhaps by means of "serpents "or "plates of brass "as the Hebrew n√©ss, may insinuate. These methods were known to the ancients. (Horace, Ode iii. 37.; Pliny xxx. 2.) (Calmet) 
Dreams. Hebrew, times. See Galatians iv. 10. (Haydock)
