Jonathan. David's nephew, (1 Paralipomenon) of the sons of Assem, a Gezonite. This ought, perhaps, to be "Gouni, of the sons", otherwise the name will be lost, contrary to the design of the sacred writer. The verse is not terminated at Jonathan. But he was the son of Sage, (or rather of Semma, as here, ver. 33) an Ararite, 1 Paralipomenon. (Haydock) 
Sage was also the son of Samma, (ver. 11,) as Sage and Age are visibly the same; (Calmet) though of this we may doubt. (Haydock)
