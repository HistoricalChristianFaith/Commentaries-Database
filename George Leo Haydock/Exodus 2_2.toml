Goodly. Handsome, elegant, Hebrews xi. 23; agreeable to God, Acts vii. 20. Josephus says, Amram had been assured by God that the child should be the deliverer of his people. Yet he neglects not to use every prudent precaution. (Worthington) 
Months. Hebrew moons; whence some erroneously infer, that the Hebrew year was not solar. (Calmet)
