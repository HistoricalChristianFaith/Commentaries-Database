Call. Prayer is a perfect act of religion, and a confession of God's dominion. Qui fingit sacros auro vel mar more vultus, Non facit ille Deos: qui rogat, ille facit. (Martial viii. v. 24.) To neglect prayer is, in some sense, to deny God. (Calmet) 
He is pleased to exercise our confidence, (Haydock) and will have us to call upon him in distress. (Menochius)
