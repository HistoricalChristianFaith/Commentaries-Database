In him. Or "over it "the flower. Or the spirit of God's indignation will overwhelm him. The soul of man departs, and cannot naturally be reunited with the body, though it greatly desire that union. (Calmet) 
The longest life is but like the duration of a flower, (Isaias xl. 6.; Haydock) and the splendour of the noblest families is no better in the sight of God. (St. Augustine)
