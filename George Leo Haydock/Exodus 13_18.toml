Armed, in order of battle. Hebrew chamushim, "by fives "or in five battalions. (Josue i. 14; Judges viii. 11.) (Calmet) 
Calvin asks where the Hebrews could procure arms, as if to cavil with this translation. But surely they might get them in the same manner as the vessels of gold; and they undoubtedly were not destitute of arms when they encountered the Amalecites, ver. 17. (Haydock)
