Poverty. Septuagint have read áni instead of haoni, "my iniquity "which seems less accurate, as David had not offended Saul. Symmachus has "malice "(Calmet) or "ill-treatment "kakosin. (Haydock) 
We may form some judgment of David's distress, from his being obliged to eat the consecrated bread at Nobe. (Calmet) 
Yet without making any change in the Hebrew, we may explain it in the sense of the Vulgate, as áve signifies to be "bent down. "(Berthier) 
"Chastisements waste my strength. "(Pr. disc.) 
Jesus was a man of sorrows. (Berthier)
