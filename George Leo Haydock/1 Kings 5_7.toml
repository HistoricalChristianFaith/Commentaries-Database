Lord (Jehova) God "of Israel "as it is expressed, 2 Paralipomenon ii. 12. (Haydock) 
This pagan prince adored and erected temples and altars in honour of Baal, Astarte, and Hercules; (Josephus) yet he did not hesitate to acknowledge the God of Israel, as he supposed that there was a god for each nation. See chap. xx. 28., and 4 Kings xvii. 27. (Calemt) 
Thus many think that they may serve the God of unity, by going to hear the sermons of men who preach a contradictory doctrine. The devil will be satisfied, if he can share the divine honours: but God will admit of no rival, nor can he sanction any but the true religion. (Haydock)
