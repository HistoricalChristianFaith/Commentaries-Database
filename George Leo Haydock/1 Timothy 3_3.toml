Not given to wine, or a lover of wine. This, says St. Chrysostom, is less than to be a drunkard; for such are excluded from the kingdom of heaven, whoever they be. (1 Corinthians vi. 10.) 
No striker. St. Chrysostom understands not striving, fighting or quarreling even with his tongue. 
Not covetous of money, as appears by the Greek text. (Witham)
