Butter or "cream "as the former article was probably not yet discovered, Genesis xviii. 8. (Calmet) 
The proofs of this assertion, from the original, chemath, and from the Scripture, frequently representing butter as a liquid, seem not, however, very solid. See Judges v. 25., and Proverbs xxx. 33. The Septuagint have literally, "the butter of oxen "but the latter name includes all of the species. (Haydock) 
Basan. The Septuagint have, "the young of bulls and of he-goats "though they generally translate "fat sheep. "See St. Jerome in Isaias liii. 
Wheat. Hebrew, "fat of the kidneys of wheat. "
Grape. See Genesis xlix. 11. Androcides wrote to Alexander, who loved wine too much, "when thou art about to drink wine, remember, O king, that thou art drinking the blood of the earth. "(Pliny, xiv. 15.)
