Description, impressed by God on David's imagination; (Cajetan) or rather planned out by the hand of God, (ver. 19.; Salien) as the law was written. (Haydock) 
The Jews pretend that this plan was delivered to Moses, and handed down by Josue, to David. (Estius) 
But why might not David receive it immediately from heaven? (Calmet) 
Treasures. Literally, "cellars. "(Haydock) 
The original term, Ganzac, is not Hebrew. We find Ganas (Esther iii. 9.) to signify a treasure, being derived from the Persian, Gaza. David gave, therefore, a description of the rooms to keep the treasures of the temple, or of the cellars for wine and oil. (Calmet) 
Septuagint, "a pattern of the temple and of the houses thereof, and of the Zakcho, and of the upper rooms, and of the inner storehouses "(Haydock) 
Inner, or most retired closets, (3 Kings xx. 30.; Calmet) where the Levites slept. (Menochius) 
Seat, where the ark was kept, and God was rendered propitious. (Haydock)
