Ye stiff-necked, and uncircumcised in heart. St. Stephen, inspired by the Holy Spirit, knowing he should die a martyr, boldly reproaches them for persecuting the prophets, for putting to death the just one, that is, the Messias, foretold by the prophets. (Witham) 
Observe the holy indignation of St. Stephen at the obduracy of the incredulous Jews!
