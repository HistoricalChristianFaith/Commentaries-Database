The true children of God's Church, remaining in unity, under the guidance of their lawful pastors, partake of the grace of the Holy Spirit, promised to the Church and her pastors; and have in the Catholic Church all necessary knowledge and instruction, so as to have no need to seek it elsewhere, since it can be only found in that society of which they are members. (Challoner)
