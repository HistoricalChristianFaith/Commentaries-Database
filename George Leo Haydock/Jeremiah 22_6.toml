Galaad, the head of Libanus. By Galaad, a rich and fruitful country, is here signified the royal palace of the kings of the house of David; by Libanus, a high mountain abounding in cedar-trees, the populous city of Jerusalem. (Challoner) (Worthington) (Theodoret) 
Both mountains are connected. (St. Jerome) (Strabo xvi.) 
Yet the proper Galaad was at some distance, and on the side of Ammon very barren. The palaces had arisen from a miserable state to resemble Libanus. They shall surely be destroyed. (Calmet) 
The advantageous situation of Jerusalem should not protect it, no more than it had done Galaad, 4 Kings xv. 29. (Junius; Grotius)
