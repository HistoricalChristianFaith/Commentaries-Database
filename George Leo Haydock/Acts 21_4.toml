Not go up to Jerusalem. St. Paul says in the foregoing chapter that he was pressed by the Holy Spirit to go to Jerusalem; and do these prophets now advise him to stay away, and disobey the inspiration? No: their dissuasion was not the effect of inspiration, but the expression of their tenderness and affection for him, which made them fear what they saw he was going to endure. (Denis the Carthusian) 
Hence St. Paul disregarded their entreaties, as well as the imminent dangers that every where stared him in the face. See his heroic answer to the melting entreaties of the faithful of CÃ¦sarea, and their final acquiescence: "the will of the Lord be done. "(below, ver. 14)
