Eighteen. One Hebrew manuscript reads "thirteen "(Haydock) or 3 instead of 8. (Kennicott) 
The number seems also (Haydock) to be incorrect in Paralipomenon, where we find that Joachin was only eight years old, as the Syriac and Arabic have 18 in both places, and it could not well be said, that he did evil, (ver. 9.) at the age of 8, much less that he had wives so soon, ver. 15. (Calmet) 
Some attempt to reconcile both places, by saying that the eight years refer to the commencement of his father's reign; (Junius) which is very unusual: (Calmet) or to the servitude of Babylon, when Jerusalem was taken under Joakim. (Hardouin.) 
Sanctius conjectures that Joachin was associated with his father when he was 10 years old, and after 8 years became sole king. (Kimchi) (Du Hamel)
