Stand up, like people cited to the bar. Having undergone his own trial with applause, Samuel shows that the people will not come off so well at the tribunal of God, whom they had treated with greater disrespect, injustice, and ingratitude than they had himself, as he convinced them by an astonishing and terrible storm. (Haydock)
