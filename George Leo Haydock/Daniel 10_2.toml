Weeks. Marsham says twenty-one years. But it means only so many days. He began to mourn on the third of Nisan, and continued fasting (ver. 4.) it seems even on the sabbaths, and on the feast of Passover, till the 24th. (Calmet) 
He was grieved that the people did not make use of the leave granted by Cyrus; (Theod.) or because the Samaritans had prevailed at court to have the temple forbidden; (Usher, year of the world 3470; 1 Esdras i. 14.) or rather because he could not fully understand the former visions, chap. ix. 30., and xii. 9. (Calmet)
