Widowhood, or celibacy, (Menochius) like nuns. (Grotius; Salien) 
David could not with propriety approach to them, (Estius) as they resembled his daughters-in-law; (Leviticus xviii. 15.; Menochius) and no other person could marry them, while he was still their husband. (Haydock) 
The punishment of seclusion was very small in the East, where women seldom go out. The Jews assert, that the widows of the Hebrew kings could not marry again. (Selden, Uxor. i. 10.) 
The like custom formerly prevailed in Spain. (Council of Toledo, xiii. 3., A.D. 383.; of Saragossa, canon 5., A.D. 692.) So great was the respect for the king, or the apprehension, lest those who married their widows, should aspire to the throne.
