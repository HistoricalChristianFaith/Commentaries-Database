The fifth month. They fasted on the tenth day of the fifth month; because on that day the temple was burnt. Therefore they inquire whether they are to continue that fast after the temple is rebuilt. See this query answered ver. 19 of the following chapter. (Challoner) 
The third of the seventh month (ver. 5) was also a fast, on account of the death of Godolias, (Calmet) during the captivity, 4 Kings xxv. 8, 25. (Worthington) 
Septuagint, "Has the sanctification entered hither in the fifth month, as they (or I) have done? "(Haydock) 
Fasting and lamentation are styled sanctification, because they promote it; curatos quoque sanctificat; (St. Jerome) if the proper conditions be observed. (Haydock)
