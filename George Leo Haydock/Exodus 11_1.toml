To Moses, before he was gone out from Pharao. (Menochius) 
This revelation had been made at Mount Horeb. Calmet places the three first verses within a parenthesis; and the fourth, he supposes that Moses addressed to the king at the last interview, chap. x. 29. Kennicott maintains, that the Samaritan copy preserves the unity of this awful transaction almost in its original perfection, by preserving the speech of God to Moses, part of which the Hebrew seems to address to Pharao.
