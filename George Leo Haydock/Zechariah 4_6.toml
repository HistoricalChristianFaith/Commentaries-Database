To Zorobabel. This vision was in favour of Zorobabel, to assure him of success in the building of the temple, which he had begun, signified by the candlestick; the lamp of which, without any other industry, was supplied with oil dropping from the two olive-trees, and distributed by the seven funnels or pipes, to maintain the seven lights. (Challoner) 
Zorobabel might thus be comforted with the assurance that God would protect his Church. (Worthington) 
Spirit, represented by the eyes. The Messias would receive the fulness of this spirit, Isaias xi. 2. (Calmet)
