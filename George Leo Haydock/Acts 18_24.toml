Apollo.one mighty in the Scriptures. Literally, powerful in the Scriptures, yet knew no baptism, but that of John. (Witham) 
When we consider the great harvest, and few labourers, and the small time that the apostles could give to any one place for instructions, we shall not be so much surprised, that this zealous convert should not yet be perfectly instructed in every doctrine of Christianity. This happened about twenty years after our Lord's ascension. He is the same person as is mentioned 1 Corinthians iii. 7. (Haydock)
