Rightly. Septuagint, "unpraised. "Hebrew, "without any satisfaction "or, "he departed unregretted "oppressed with illness, and odious to all. 
Kings. Joas, Achaz, Achab, and Manasses, were disgraced in like manner, after their death. The Hebrews then showed their resentment, without fear. The like custom prevailed in Egypt, and kept many within bounds. No person could receive the usual honours of burial, if his accusers could maintain their charge against his character before a court of above forty people, assembled for the purpose. Calumny was severely punished. But the kings themselves were to stand their trial, while their corpse was placed in the porch of the monument, and the priest spoke their funeral oration. The people testified their approbation or discontent, "and many of the kings have been deprived of a glorious and legal burial, on account of the opposition of the multitude. "(Diodorus i. and ii.) (Calmet)
