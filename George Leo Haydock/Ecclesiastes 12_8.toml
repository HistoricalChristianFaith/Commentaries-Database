Ecclesiastes. "The preacher. "(Worthington) 
He returns to his first proposition, and having pushed the objection of free-thinkers as far as possible, shows us what we ought to believe and practise. He establishes the distinction of soul and body, the advantage of instruction, (ver. 11.) without meddling with things too high, (ver. 12.) the obligation of fearing God, (ver. 13.) and future retribution, ver. 14. This is the sum of all sound morality. (Calmet)
