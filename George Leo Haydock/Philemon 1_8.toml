Wherefore, though I might have much confidence Now St. Paul disposeth Philemon to grant his request, I am persuaded I might command thee, and thou wouldst not take it amiss. (Witham) 
To command thee As an apostle of Jesus Christ, I have the power even of ordering thee to forgive Ones Imus, and to receive him again into favour; likewise as Paul, the aged, respect and regard being always due in a particular manner to old men; or again, as a prisoner of Jesus Christ, suffering here out of love for Jesus Christ and the faithful: I might here make use of all these different reasons to induce thee to pardon a poor fugitive slave, but I will not; I merely as a poor humble supplicant, forgetting all the dignity due to my apostleship, my grey hairs, or my chains, beseech thee to pardon him. Nor can I for a moment doubt of obtaining my request, when I consider the great charity thou hast in Jesus Christ towards all the saints. (Calmet; Haydock)
