Accho. Hebrew haco. The Greeks not knowing the derivation of this word, supposed that the city was so called from ak√©, "a remedy "as they pretend that Hercules was cured in this place. It was also called Ptolemais, after the king of Egypt. The little river Belus, and the famous bed of sand so proper for making glass, were in the neighbourhood. (Pliny, v. 19.) 
Ahalab. The situation is unknown, unless it be Aleppo. They say it is the famous city of Berea. (Calmet)
