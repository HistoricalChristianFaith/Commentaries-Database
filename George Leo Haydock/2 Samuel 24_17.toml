Are, like sheep. (Menochius) 
They were not accountable for the fault of their shepherd, or king; nor were they punished for it, (Haydock) but for joining in the revolts of Absalom, Seba, (Salien) as well as for other secret offences. (Haydock) 
Some groundlessly condemn the people, for entertaining sentiments of pride, along with David. Both king and people suffer, when either draws down the vengeance of heaven.
