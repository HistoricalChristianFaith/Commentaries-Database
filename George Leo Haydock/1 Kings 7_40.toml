Shovels. Scutras may also signify "cauldrons "from their resemblance with a shield. These terms occur Exodus xxvii. 3., (Calmet) and are there properly translated, shovels (Haydock) 
The Jews say there were always, at least, three things of the same species, that one might be ready in case another was defiled.
