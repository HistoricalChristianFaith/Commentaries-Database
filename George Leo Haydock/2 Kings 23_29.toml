Nechao, six years (Usher, the year of the world 3394.) after he had succeeded his father Psammetichus, with whose ambitious views he was animated to attempt the conquest of Asia. (Marsham s√¶c. 18.) Pharao pretends that God had sent him to attack the Assyrians, 2 Paralipomenon xxxv. 21. But Josias thought he was only imposing on him, or speaking through fear. The Jews assert that Jeremias also opposed the king's design, 3 Esdras i. 28. (St. Jerome, ad Ctesip.) But this does not appear from the canonical Scripture. (Calmet) 
Meet him, in order to hinder him from passing through his dominions without leave; as this might prove dangerous. (Haydock) 
Seen him, and fought. (Menochius) 
He received a mortal wound at Mageddo, but died at Jerusalem, 2 Paralipomenon xxxv. 23. (Josephus, x. 6.) 
Mageddo lay to the south of Cison, where Barak had fought before, Judges v. 19. Herodotus (ii. 159.) says, that Nechos gained a victory over the Syrians at Magdolum, and took Cadytis, which is probably Cades, a strong city of Galilee, though some take it to be Jerusalem, as it may be interpreted "the holy city. "(Calmet) 
Mageddo is called Magdala in the Greek, and Magedan in other copies, and in the Vulgate, Matthew xv. 39.
