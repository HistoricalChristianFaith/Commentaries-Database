St. Jerome asserts the same of Solomon, and observes, that "many things which seem incredible in Scripture, are nevertheless true. "(ep. ad Vital.) He, with some others, has recourse to a miracle.

(Genebrard) St. Augustine (City of God xv. 11., and xvi. c. ult. and in psalm civ.) maintains that a person of 10 years of age is unfit for generation. (Calmet)

In the first year of his reign, and in the fifth Olympiad, the Ephori were appointed at Sparta under Theopompus, nephew of Lycurgus. (Salien, the year before Christ 59.)
