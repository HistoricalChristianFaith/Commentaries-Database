Youth. Hebrew, "a virgin. "The "conception of a mighty man (the Messias; Haydock) in a virgin "is fitly compared to the flight of an eagle in the air, which leaves no trace behind, and is the most difficult to comprehend. See Jeremias xxxi. 22.; Univ. Hist. iii. p. 144, note. Isaiah vii. 14.; Parkhurst in alm. (Haydock) 
Some of the Jews have admitted this explanation. (Cornelius a Lap ide) 
Others understand that the marks of virginity are equivocal; (Bossuet) or, if we stick to the Vulgate and Septuagint, the difference betwixt a child and a young man is extremely great, and almost incomprehensible. (Calmet) 
Young people who follow their carnal appetite, can no more give an account of their actions than of the course of an eagle (Worthington) 
His wanderings are manifold. The Hebrew seems to contain a prophecy of Christ's conception.
