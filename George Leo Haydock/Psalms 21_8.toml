Thy hand. O king, Messias, or God. No earthly monarch can always punish his enemies. But none can escape the hand of the Almighty. He will bring all to judgment. (Berthier) 
The just approve of God's decree in punishing. This is all a prediction. (Worthington) 
Let thine enemies find thy power, so as to return to good. (St. Jerome) 
To find, often means to attack, (Judges i. 5., and 3 Kings xiii. 24.) or to accomplish with ease, Deuteronomy xxxiii. 1.
