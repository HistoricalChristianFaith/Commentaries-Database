Because the multitude still insisted in begging for their corporal nourishment and remembering the food that was given to their fathers, Christ, to show that all were figures of the present spiritual food, answered, that he was the bread of life. (Theophylactus) 
Here Jesus Christ proceeds to the second part of his discourse, in which he fully explains what that bread of life is, which he is about to bestow upon mankind in the mystery of the holy Eucharist. He declares then, in the first place, that he is the bread of eternal life, and mentions its several properties; and secondly, he applies to his own person, and to his own flesh, the idea of this bread, such as he has defined it.
