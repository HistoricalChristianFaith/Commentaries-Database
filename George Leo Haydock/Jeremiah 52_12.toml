Tenth: 4 Kings seventh, on which day Nabuzardan set out from Reblatha, according to some. But it was above sixty leagues, or hours journey, distant. (Calmet) 
He entered the city on the 7th, and put his orders in execution on the 10th. (Usher) 
Nothing of the king's imprisonment, or of the city poor occurs, 4 Kings.
