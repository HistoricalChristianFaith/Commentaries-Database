11. Hath bid him curse. Not that the Lord was the author of Semei's sin, which proceeded purely from his own malice, and the abuse of his free-will; but that knowing and suffering his malicious disposition to break out on this occasion, he made use of him as his instrument to punish David for his sins. (Challoner) 
He adored the justice of God; who is often said to do what he does not hinder, or what he only permits. (Estius) 
David is here a noble figure of Jesus Christ, excusing his executioners, (Haydock) and receiving the insults of the Jews, without complaining. (Calmet) 
If Semei had not been guilty of sin, but acted according to God's will, he could not have been justly punished, 3 Kings ii. (Worthington)
