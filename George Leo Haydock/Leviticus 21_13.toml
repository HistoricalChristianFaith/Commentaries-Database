Wife. Josephus says he could not divorce her. The Rabbins allow him only one wife at a time. It is said that Joiada had two. But that might be successively; and it is not certain that he was the high priest; (2 Paralipomenon xxiv. 3.; Calmet) though he has that title in the Vulgate, 2 Paralipomenon xxii. 11. (Haydock) 
His wife must be an Isrealite. The Septuagint intimates, "of his own race. "But this is denied by others. He could not marry his brother's widow, (Selden) nor a girl under twelve and a half. "The Egyptian priests marry only one, while others have as many wives as they please. "(Diodorus i.) (Calmet)
