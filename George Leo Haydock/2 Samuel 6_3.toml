Cart, out of respect, as the Philistines had done, 1 Kings vi. 7. But God had ordered the Levites to carry it themselves, and the neglect here proved so dreadful; for which reason, David required the priests to attend when he removed the ark from the house of Obededom, 1 Paralipomenon xv. 12. 
Gabaa means "the hill of Cariathiarim "where the ark had been in the house of Abinadab, from the time of its being restored back by the Philistines. (Challoner) 
Hunnius would multiply the places where the ark was fixed, to show, against Catholics, that the Church is not confined to one place; (Amama) as if Catholic did not maintain the universality of the Church! (Haydock)
