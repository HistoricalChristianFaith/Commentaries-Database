Hyssop, which was used in sprinkling lepers, (Leviticus xiv. 6.) not that the like ceremony, or even sacrifice, would suffice to heal the wound of the soul. Sincere contrition, (ver. 18, 19.) and the virtue of Christ's blood, are necessary. (Calmet) (Hebrews ix. 19.) 
The heat (Numbers xix.) and operation of this sovereign medicine was shown to the prophet, John xix. (Worthington) 
The sprinkling of the priest might be of service, if the heart was contrite, Hebrews ix. 13. (Menochius)
