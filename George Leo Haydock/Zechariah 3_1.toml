Jesus, or Josue, the son of Jose Dec, the high priest of that time. (Challoner) 
To him this literally refers. (Worthington) 
As high priest, he represented the nation, whom several calumniated to Darius, 1 Esdras iv. God represses the adversary and adorns his people. It seems something has been done amiss, ver. 4. (Calmet) 
The high priest, (St. Jerome) or rather his sons, have married strangers. (Chaldean) (1 Esdras x. 18.) Many Fathers take Jesus for a figure of the Messias, covered with the sins of mankind. (Calmet) 
But the Orient (ver. 8) would not thus be promised unto him, (St. Jerome) unless we consider him also as high priest. 
Satan. Septuagint, "the devil "the accuser and calumniator, Apocalypse xii. 10.
