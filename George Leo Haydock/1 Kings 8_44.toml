Name. It was the practice of the religious Jews, to pray with their eyes turned towards the holy place, ver. 48. The primitive Christians looked towards the east, in prayer, to remind them of the ascension of our Saviour, (Calmet) from Mount Olivet, in that quarter. (Haydock) (Psalm lxvii. 34.) (St. Just. q. 118.; Tertullian, apol. xvi.; St. Epiphanius, h√¶r. xix.) (Calmet)
