For judgment without mercy It is an admonition to them to fulfil, as he said before, the royal precepts of the love of God and of our neighbour, which cannot be without being merciful to others. Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy. (Matthew v. 7.) 
And mercy exalteth itself above judgment. Some understand this as a confirmation of God's infinite mercies, out of Psalm cxliv. 9. where it is said that his "mercies are over all his works "that is, though all his perfections be equally infinite, yet he is pleased to deal with sinners rather according to the multitude of his mercies than according to the rigour of his justice. Others expound these words of the mercy which men show to one another, and that he exhorts them to mercy, as a most powerful means to find mercy; and the merciful works done to others will be beneficial to them, and make them escape when they come to judgment. (Witham) 
Similar to this are the words of old Tobias to his son: "Alms deliver from all sin, and from death, and will not suffer the soul to go into darkness. Alms shall be a great confidence before the most high God, to all them that give it. "(Tobias iv. 11, 12.) "Blessed are the merciful "says our divine Judge, "for they shall obtain mercy. "(Matthew v. 7.) (Calmet) 
And the definitive sentence of Christians, at the day of judgment will be favourable or not, as they have complied in life with the calls of charity.
