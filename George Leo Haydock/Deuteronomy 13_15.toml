Even the cattle. Nothing at all must be spared. Yet the Rabbins and some who argue that penal laws must be restrained as much as possible, exempt the women, and boys under thirteen years of age, and understand this law only of the central cities, ver. 13. If the city was seduced by one man, or by women, or by people of a different tribe, the culprit was only to be stoned, and the Sanhedrim had to take cognizance of the whole affair. If many cities joined in the idolatry, or if any of them were cities of refuge, they were not included. (Selden, Syned. iii. 5.; Grotius)

For the Lord, as a victim of expiation, and to manifest your zeal for the honour of the only true God. 
No more. Septuagint, "it shall be uninhabited. "The Rabbins are so exact, as to entertain a doubt whether the place might even be used as a garden. (Calmet)
