Chrysolite, (beryl or opale,) onyx, (Septuagint, beryl; Chaldean, or emerald; Calmet) beryl, (Hebrew, jasper; Septuagint, onyx) were inscribed with the names of Zabulon, Joseph, and Benjamin. In Ezechiel xxviii. 13, the jasper stone comes in the sixth place, as it does in the Vulgate here. (Calmet) 
The mystical interpretation of these stones, may be seen in Cornelius A Lap ide. St. Epiphanius has written a learned work on the 12 precious stones. (Haydock)
