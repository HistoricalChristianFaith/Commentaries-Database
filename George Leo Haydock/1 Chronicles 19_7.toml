Chariots. This number seems excessive, and it may have been put for infantry; the number of which, specified 2 Kings, was 33,000. But the troops of Mesopotamia are not there mentioned, and this supplies what was left defective. (Calmet) 
The chariots may signify those who fought upon them, (Menochius) ver. 18., and Isaias xxi. 7. (Tirinus) 
Sometimes the whole number is specified; at others only a part.
