Daughter. Hebrew ban, "the son. "But bath, "daughter "(Haydock) occurs properly in some manuscripts, as in the ancient versions. Leusden has here this very odd note: "perhaps by ban, (with a pathah) here both sexes may be understood. "Forte per ban hic intelligitur uterque sexus. (Kennicott) 
Protestants substitute, "daughter. "(Haydock)
