Oath. In certain cases, an oath would clear a person, Exodus xxii. 11. Solomon prays that perjury may be disclosed. 
Altar. It was customary to touch the altar, when a person took an oath, as Hannibal did. K. Latinus says; Tango aras mediosque ignes et Numina testor
Nulla dies pacem hanc Italis nec foedera rumpet. (Virgil, Ã†neid xii. 201.)
