All men, of his time (Lyranus) and nation. (Munster) 
But why should we limit these general expressions? (Calmet) See chap. iii. 12, 13. (Haydock) 
Ethan is the same as Idithun. The title of Ezrahite does not seem to belong to him; and Chalcol and Dorda seem to be inserted here by some transcriber from 1 Paralipomenon ii. 6., where we read, the sons of Zara. Ethan and Eman, and Chalchal and Dara, of the tribe of Juda. But they were different from these men, who were probably Levites. (Calmet) 
We find Chalcol and Dorda mentioned no where else. Heman was an Ezrahite, (Psalm lxxxvii.) and a seer of the king, presiding over the singers, (1 Paralipomenon xv. 19., and xxv. 4., and 5.; Menochius) who stood in the middle. Ethan's band surrounded the altar, (1 Paralipomenon vi. 44.) while Asaph's were on the right hand. 
Mahol was the mother of the four, unless the word denote their profession, as sons of "the choir "singing and playing on musical instruments. (Calmet) 
Solomon was eminent in both respects, as well as in poetry; as he is compared with those who were most noted for compositions and music. (Sanctius)
