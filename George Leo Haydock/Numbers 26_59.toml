Levi. Septuagint, "who bore these (Lobni) to Levi, in Egypt; and she bore to Amram, Aaron", as if Jochabed had been wife both of Levi and of Amram, which is very improbable. It is more likely that the wives of these two bore the same name. The Hebrew may agree very well with the Vulgate. See Exodus ii. 1. (Calmet) 
It was afterwards forbidden for a person to marry his aunt, Leviticus xviii. (Worthington)
