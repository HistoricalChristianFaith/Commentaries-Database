Melchom, the idol of the Ammonites. (Challoner) 
Gad, to whom a part of their country was assigned. After the captivity of this tribe, the Ammonites seized the country, regardless of God's appointment. They joined the Chaldeans afterwards; but the latter could not depend upon them, and sent them into captivity, to revenge the death of Godolias, chap. xli. 2., Sophonias ii. 8., and Ezechiel xxv. 3. (Calmet) 
They had taken the country as their right, as if all Israel had perished; which God resents. (Worthington)
