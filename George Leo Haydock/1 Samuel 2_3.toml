Old. Hebrew hathak means also, "hard things. "(Du Hamel) 
"Let arrogance come out of your mouth "to return no more. Yet most people supply the negation from the former member; "Let not arrogance or hard things. "Chaldean, "blasphemy "(Calmet) 
Cease to praise idols, as you have done. (Worthington) 
Use not the malevolent language to which you have been accustomed. 
Knowledge. The secrets of hearts are open to him. 
And to him. Hebrew, "and by him actions are weighed "as in scales; (Haydock) or, "thoughts (and actions) are not established. "(Symmachus) The Syriac and Arabic also read the negation, "there are not pretexts before him "or, "are not actions founded upon him? "Will he not execute what he has wisely designed, in spite of opposition? (Haydock) 
Septuagint, "and God prepares his thought "(Calmet) (epitedeumata autou) or, "what is convenient for him. "(Haydock) 
They have read lu, "of him "instead of la, "not "as they are authorized to do by the Keri, (or various readings in the margin) and by several Hebrew manuscripts. The Protestants think rightly, and suppose that la, "not "has been omitted, "Let not arrogancy "because we find it in Chaldean, Septuagint, Syriac and Arabic versions. Lu is substituted for la, ver. 16. When some have been pressed with the argument of variations, called Keri, they have said that they were rather explanations of obscure words in the text: but is there any obscurity in lu, "to him "and la, "not "or can they explain each other? Leusden answers in the affirmative, ver. 16! (Kennicott)
