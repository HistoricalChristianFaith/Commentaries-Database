Abomination. See chap. xliii. 32. The source of this hatred against foreign shepherds, was probably because, about 100 years before Abraham, the shepherd-kings, Hycussos, had got possession of a great part of Egypt, and were at last expelled by the kings of Thebais. See Manetho ap. Eusebius, Pr√¶p. x. 13. Another reason why they hated foreigners was, because they slew and eat sheep, which they themselves adored. The Egyptians kept sheep for this purpose, and for the benefits to be derived from their wool, chap. xlvii. 17. (Calmet) 
Joseph took advantage of this disposition of the inhabitants, to keep his brethren at a distance from them, that they might not be perverted. He does not introduce them at court, that no jealousy might be excited. He shows that he is not ashamed of his extraction. (Menochius)
