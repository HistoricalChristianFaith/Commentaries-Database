God. Hebrew tsavvar means, "neck. "But the Septuagint have not seen the a, and translate against God. Literally, "the rock "which is one of his titles; (Berthier) and this seems preferable to "speak not with a stiff neck "(Calmet) or "with the old neck: "(St. Jerome) though this sense is not contemptible, as the sinner's wonted pride rises against God.
