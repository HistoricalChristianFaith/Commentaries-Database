His testimonies. The commandments of God are called his testimonies, because they testify his holy will unto us. Note here, that in almost every verse of this psalm, (which in number are 176) the word and law of God, and the love and observance of it, are perpetually inculcated, under a variety of denominations, all signifying the same thing. (Challoner) 
We must search the law, not out of curiosity, but to practise it; (Haydock) otherwise we shall become more guilty. (Worthington) (James iv. 17.)
