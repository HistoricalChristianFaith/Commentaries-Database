The ariel. That is, the altar itself, or rather the highest part of it, upon which the burnt-offerings were laid. In the Hebrew it is harel, that is, the mountain of God; but in the following verse haariel, that is, the lion of God; a figure, from its consuming, and as it were devouring the sacrifices as a lion devours its prey. (Challoner) 
Fire descending sometimes from heaven. (St. Jerome) (Worthington) 
It also appeared like a little mountain in the court. See Isaias xxix. 1. The altar was probably made of brass, like Solomon's. Josephus and Philo say that rough stones were used after the captivity: but it seems little attention was paid to the dimensions of the temple, given by Ezechiel. (Calmet) 
Yet the prophets were present to see the laws of God executed, and never complain of their infringement in these particulars, which were attended with no great difficulty, chap. xl. 1. (Haydock) 
It is certain the Jews never thought themselves bound to make their altars of a determinate size.
