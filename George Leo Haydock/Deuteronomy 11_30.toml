Far. Hebrew, "over against Galgal, beside the plains of More, or Aluni More. "Samaritan reads, "the plain of More, near Sichem "as Exodus xx. 17. (Haydock) 
This is styled the noble vale, Genesis xii. 6. (Calmet) 
The road from Jericho to the Mediterranean Sea, left these mountains on the north. The Chanaanite inhabited all that region, from Galgal to Sichem. How far these places were distant from each other, is not here specified; though Eusebius seems to have inferred from this text, that Garizim was near Jericho. But the plain might be very extensive or noble, and reach from Sichem as far as Gal gala.
