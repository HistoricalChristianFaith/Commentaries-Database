Amona. Hebrew hamon, (Haydock) means "a multitude. "(Calmet) 
Septuagint, "a place for many graves: "poluandrion. (Haydock) 
So many would be buried there, that the place might justly receive such a name; though we find no such city in the neighbourhood. (Calmet) 
Rabbath, of Ammon, was sometimes so called. (Haydock)
