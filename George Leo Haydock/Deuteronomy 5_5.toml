Mediator. St. Paul acknowledges this title of Moses, (Galatians iii. 9,) who was a figure of Jesus Christ, the mediator of the New Testament, Hebrews viii. 6., ix. 15., and xii. 24. (Calmet) 
Let not Protestants, therefore, reject this title with so much indignation, when it is applied in the like limited sense to the saints, to denote that they pray for us, as we pray for one another. Christ is the one mediator (1 Timothy ii.) of redemption. (Haydock)
