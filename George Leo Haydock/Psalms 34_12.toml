Good days. St. Peter (1 Peter iii. 10.) adopts this sense, though the Hebrew is rendered, "and desireth days, that he may see good. "The apostle shows that heaven is here principally meant, though a virtuous life is the best to procure even present happiness. (Berthier) 
Many of David's followers probably confined their views to the latter. (Calmet) 
Every one desireth to be happy, but only the virtuous are really so. (Worthington)
