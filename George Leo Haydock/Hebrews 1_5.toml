Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee. These words, though commonly expounded of the eternal generation of the Son of God in the day or moment of eternity, yet may be truly applied either to Christ made man by his incarnation, or to Christ risen from the dead, as they are used by St. Paul, (Acts xiii. 33.) because the same Christ both these ways is the Son of God. It was the only true and natural Son of God, who was made flesh, who was made man, who rose from the dead; and the eternal Father manifested his eternal Son by his incarnation, and showed him triumphing over death by his resurrection. 
I will be to him a father Although these words might be literally spoken of Solomon, yet in the mystical sense (chiefly intended by the Holy Spirit) they are to be understood of Christ, who in a much more proper sense is the Son of God. (Witham)
