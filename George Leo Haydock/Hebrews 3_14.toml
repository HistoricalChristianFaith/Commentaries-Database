You have already been made partakers of the benefits of Christ, at your conversion and baptism, to the beginning of his substance, by which seems to be understood the faith of Christ. (Witham) 
If to subsist in Jesus Christ, to be washed in his blood, to be animated with his spirit, to be nourished with his flesh, is but a sketch, a seed of that union with him which on a future day is to be effected, how comes it that we are so attached to this earth, how can we hazard for such a mere trifle such immense felicity?
