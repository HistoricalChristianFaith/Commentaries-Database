The admirable mother of the Machabees suggested this consoling motive, (Berthier) to strengthen her youngest son, 2 Machabees vii. 28. Heaven is the temple of the Lord, (Haydock) though the tabernacle may be so styled here. See Psalm x. 8. (Calmet) 
The poor man is not in Hebrew but it is chiefly of him that the psalmist speaks; (Berthier) and the Septuagint and Arabic (Calmet) seem to (Haydock) have read it. Eliphaz remarks, that God does not disregard human affairs, as the wicked supposed, Job xxii. 12. (Calmet) 
If his eyes seem to be shut, his providence watcheth. (Worthington)
