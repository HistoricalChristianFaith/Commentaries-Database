Now I rejoice I should have been inconsolable, had my letter made you sad, without producing the salutary effect intended by it; but I now rejoice that it caused a sorrow and sadness productive of the great advantages you have reaped from it. Thus in every sentence St. Paul shows the solicitude of a father, seeking nothing but the advancement of his spiritual children. (Calmet)
