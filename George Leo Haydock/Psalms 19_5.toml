Sun. Here God seems to reside, (Ferrand) and the magnificence of his works shines forth, insomuch that almost all nations have offered divine honours to the sun, and even the Manichees adored it, imagining that it was the very body of Jesus Christ. (St. Augustine, contra Faust. xiv. 12., and xx. 6.) 
Hebrew, "For the sun he has place a tent in them "the heavens, (St. Jerome; Haydock) or the ends of the world. The Jews supposed that the heavens rested, like a tent, upon the earth. (Calmet, Diss.) 
The Hebrew preposition l, may have (Haydock) different meanings, ad solem posuit "He placed a tent in them, at or for the sun. "The idea of the Vulgate is more noble, but we would not exclude the other, which is very good, (Berthier) and obviates the gross mistake of the Manichees. (Amama) 
The Vulgate may admit the fig. hypallage, (M. Geneb.) as good authors say dare classibus austros, and thus it may signify "he placed the sun in his tent. "(Haydock) 
This vast body stands in need of no vehicle, or tent, but itself. (Diodorus) 
It was placed in the firmament at first, (Genesis i. 16.) and still performs its revolutions exactly. (Haydock) 
Giant. Moderns would render "a strong man "and Bythner remarks that the bulk of a giant would render him less fit for running, as if the stoutest wrestlers were not often the most active. (Berthier) 
The sun is represented as a hero at some of the ancient games. St. Augustine and St. Jerome explain all this of Jesus Christ, who diffuses the light and warmth of his grace throughout the world. (Calmet) 
He always resides with the Church, and is never divorced from her. (Worthington)
