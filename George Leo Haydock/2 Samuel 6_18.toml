Blessed. Wishing all sorts of happiness. Only priests and kings perform this function publicly, 3 Kings viii. 55. Afterwards David went to his palace, to impart the same blessing to his family, and particularly to the women, who had not been present. This is a vestige of the sacerdotal power, which masters of families formerly enjoyed.
