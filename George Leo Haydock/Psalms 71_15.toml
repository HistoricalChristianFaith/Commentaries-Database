Learning. As much as to say, I build not upon human learning, but only upon the power and justice of God. (Challoner) (Worthington) 
I have not leisure to write a canticle at present, as the word known intimates, Psalm xiii. 3., and lxxiii. 9. But I will do it hereafter, and record the praises which I now proclaim. Some would translate, "I know not the number "of thy mercies. (Berthier) 
This sense is adopted by the Chaldean, Theod. See Psalm xxxix. 6. Yet it seems more probable, that David acknowledges his inability to speak of God as he deserves, though he promises to do his best to show the utmost respect. So Solomon confessed his ignorance, (Proverbs xxx. 2.) and Socrates asserted, that all his knowledge consisted in the conviction of his complete ignorance. If this be true with respect to human science, how much more so is it, when we speak of God, (Haydock) and attempt to dive into the holy Scriptures? (Genebrard) 
David meditated on the law continually, Psalm i. 2. (Calmet) 
Yet he admits, that he stands in need of a guide (Haydock) and must enter into the sanctuary, to penetrate such high mysteries, Psalm lxxii. 17. St. Augustine and Eusebius understand, that the letter of the Mosaic law is incapable of insuring salvation. (Calmet) 
This text has been abused, to encourage ignorance, as Amama (p. 502.) complains with respect to the Protestant pulpits and colleges abroad. Knox gives a dreadful picture, of their universities in England. (Haydock) 
"With the unlearned Anabaptists and fanatics, such may perhaps conclude, that they will thus more easily approach to God "(Tarnov.) and "may boast, that they have been instructed in the school of the holy Spirit "theodikatoi, "when they boldly ascend the pulpit, and adduce texts from Scripture, it matters not whether right or wrong. "(Amama) 
Is not this generally the case among those who broach new religions? (Haydock) 
Vatican Septuagint reads, pragmateias, "mercantile affairs. "But the Vulgate follows the edition of Aldus, grammateias. (Berthier) 
A similar variation occurs, 1 Esdras viii. The former reading is adduced by the Fathers, and by Gelasius, (dist. 88.) who hence condemns clergymen engaging in merchandise, (Amama) as it was contrary to their calling: and formerly at least, very dangerous for any honest man. (Haydock) 
David had not received a polite education, and he disapproved of Achitophel's worldly prudence. (Menochius)
