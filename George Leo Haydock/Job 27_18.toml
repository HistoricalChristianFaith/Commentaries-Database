Moth. Hebrew, "as the polar star. "(Junius) 
But the Chaldean, translate with the Vulgate, which agrees better with the latter part of the verse. The moth devours another's property, like the wicked man, who lodges commodiously, though not at his own expense. 
Keeper of a field, or of a vineyard. (Calmet) 
Septuagint, "His house has slipt away like a moth, and what he has kept (or his riches) like a spider. "(Haydock) 
The moth demolishes its own house, and is then disturbed, (Menochius) or thrown with the rotten wood into the fire.
