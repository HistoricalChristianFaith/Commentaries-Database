For the wages, which the tyrant sin gives to his soldiers and slaves, is eternal death; but the wages, the pay, the reward, which God gives to those that fight under him, is everlasting life; which, though a reward of our past labours, as it is often called in the Scriptures, is still a grace, Ver. 23. Gratia Dei, vita æterna; that is, in construction, vita æterna, est gratia Dei.
