Testimony. To offer incense, which always preceded the morning holocaust. 
Glory; or fire, probably issuing from the tabernacle, and consuming the victims in a moment. Thus God was pleased to show his approbation of the priests and victims, (Calmet) and at the same time, to impress a religious awe upon the minds of the spectators. (Haydock) 
This fire was carefully preserved and nourished by the priests with wood; though the Rabbins say, this was done only to conceal the miracle of its perpetual continuance. A fire, of the same nature, came down upon the victims, when Solomon dedicated his temple, (2 Paralipomenon vii. 1,) and was kept burning till the captivity, when it was hidden in a cistern. Being found afterwards, like a muddy water, God kindled it again, (2 Machabees i. 18; ii. 10,) and it was not lost till the persecution of Epiphanes.
