Hebrew, "They (the just) shall go round the wicked, when baseness shall have raised herself up, on account of the children of men. "When God shall have restored the Jews to liberty, the Babylonians shall be, in their turn, oppressed by Cyrus and the Persians, whom they now despise: or, when the miserable shall be placed in power, the wicked shall not dare to approach them. (Calmet) 
"The wicked shall walk round about, when the vilest of the sons of men shall be exalted. "(St. Jerome) (Haydock) 
The former have spent their life in vanity, and shall be kept for ever out of the kingdom of heaven; as the error of the Platonists, who assert that all things will come to pass again, the world being compared to a wheel, is manifestly refuted by Scripture, which assures us that God will preserve the just from this generation, (St. Augustine) and the wicked will knock at the door, like the foolish virgins, and will be rejected with, I never knew you, Matthew xxv. (St. Jerome or some other learned author.) (Worthington) 
For some suspect that the commentary which goes under the name of St. Jerome, is not in the state in which it came from his hands.
