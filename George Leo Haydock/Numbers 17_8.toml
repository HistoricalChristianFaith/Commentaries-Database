The rod of Aaron for the house of Levi, was budded This rod of Aaron, which thus miraculously brought forth fruit, was a figure of the blessed Virgin conceiving and bringing forth her Son, without any prejudice to her virginity. (Challoner) 
Almonds. Buds, blossoms, leaves, and fruit just formed, (Isaias xviii. 5,) appeared upon the rod, which before was dry. To stat believes, that it continued in the same state during the whole time that it was preserved in the ark. "The grace of the priesthood never fades. "(St. Ambrose, ep. 63, or 58.) The almond tree is the first which blossoms, and therefore it is styled a watching rod, Jeremias i. 11. The Fathers observe in this of Aaron, a figure of Christ's passion and glorious resurrection; and Origen (hom. 9,) remarks, that from his cross proceed the sweet odours of virtue, and the fruits of converted nations. (Calmet) 
For Christ made peace through the blood of his cross, Colossians i. 20. The blessed Virgin, whom the blooming rod also represents, might as easily become a mother without losing her virginal integrity, as this dry rod might produce fruit, without receiving any moisture from the earth. (St. Augustine; St. Gregory of Nyssa; St. Bernard;) (Worthington)
