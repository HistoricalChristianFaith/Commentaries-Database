He took not away He left some of the high places, viz., those in which they worshipped the true God: but took away all others, 2 Paralipomenon xvii. 6; (Challoner) and even those also, before the end of his reign; (Calmet) as they were contrary to the law. (Menochius) 
Others think that the passage in Paralipomenon is incorrect; ula being substituted for vaud. He took away the high places, (chap. xix. 3.) and the groves. (Grotius) (Capell.) 
We know that such remained in the days of Joas; and Josaphat in not ranked among the irreproachable kings, Ecclesiasticus xlix. 5. (Calmet) 
He attempted perhaps to remove those places, but was prevented by the people. (Menochius) See chap. xv. 14.
