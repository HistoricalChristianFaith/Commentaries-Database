This; God's protection (Haydock) and light, (Menochius) or in the very heat of battle: pr√¶lium. Septuagint express the Hebrew feminine pronoun, as they do with the Vulgate, ver. 4, unam. There is no neuter in Hebrew, which commonly uses the feminine, instead. (Calmet) 
It may be deemed too scrupulous an exactitude, to express this in a version. The word petition may be understood. (Berthier) (Menochius) 
The one petition of David comprised every blessing; as he had his mind bent on heaven. (Du Hamel)
