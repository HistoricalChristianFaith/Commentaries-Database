So be it. Chaldean, "Amen. "This word, at the beginning of a discourse, implies an affirmative oath; (Matthew vi. 13.) and at the end, it is a mark of approbation, Numbers v. 22. 
Here the Jews terminate the first book of the psalms, which they divide into five. (Calmet) 
St. Jerome rejects this division, as our Saviour mentions only the psalms, and the last psalm has no such conclusion. (Worthington) 
It has Alleluia. All the rest have Amen. See Psalms lxxii., lxxxix., and cvi. (Hebrew) (Berthier)
