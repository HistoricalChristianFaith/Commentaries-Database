Levites, or priests, (Haydock) who were seduced by Jeroboam, or offered victims on the high places, 4 Kings xxiii. 9. Such lost their privileges and were condemned to serve in the meanest offices. It seems the race of Ithamar was alone guilty, and the threat against his house was now put in execution, 1 Kings ii. 39., and iii. 14., and Leviticus xxi. 17., and 2 Esdras vii. 64. (Calmet)
