Rule, as a shepherd, (poimaneis) as it is cited Apocalypse ii. 26. But he is speaking of vengeance taken on the rebellious; and we might translate, "Thou shalt break "(Calmet) 
Yet this is not necessary, as a shepherd sometimes beats with severity, to prevent his sheep from straying. (Haydock) 
The Church guides also use coercion, but for the good of the flock. (Calmet) 
God brought the murderers of his Son to an evil end, and destroyed their city. (Haydock) 
He broke the Gentiles, to make them a more noble vessel, Jeremias xviii. 4. (St. Hilary) 
He will execute judgment at the last day, Apocalypse xix. 11. (Calmet) 
When the clay is still soft, the vessel may easily be repaired; so the sinner may be reclaimed, when he has only just fallen. (St. Jerome) 
Even the most obdurate, are as clay in God's hands. (Worthington)
