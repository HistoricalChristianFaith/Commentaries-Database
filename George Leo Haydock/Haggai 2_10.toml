Peace: another title of the Messias. His presence ennobles this temple (Calmet) more than precious ornaments of gold and silver (ver. 9.) did that of Solomon. (Haydock) 
Some have pretended that the second temple, repaired by Herod, was more spacious and magnificent than the former. It also subsisted a longer time. But this circumstance adds no superior value, unless the structure was better finished. What Josephus relates of Herod's repairs, is denied by several respectable modern authors. (Salien, year of the world 4035) 
Yet as the fact was so recent, it seems it had some foundation, though the account may be greatly exaggerated. Josephus was not always exact. (Calmet) 
The Jews all agree that the temple of Zorobabel and of Herod was the same. (Lempereur.) 
It is almost certain that this edifice was never honoured with the ark, like that of Solomon; so that if it be not on account of the Messias, no good reason appears for giving it the preference. (Haydock) 
The ancients who had seen the former, wept (Worthington) when that of Zorobabel was founded, confessing its inferiority (Haydock) both in size and elegance. It was only 60 cubits high and broad, while the former was 120, built of polished stone and covered with cedar. Zorobabel had rough stones, 1 Esdras v. 8., and vi. 3., and 2 Paralipomenon iii. 4., and 3 Kings vi. 7. As for the same temple, enlarged and adorned by Herod, it continued not long in that state; and its chief glory consisted in our Saviour's presence, when he was received in the arms of Simeon, and often preached there. Hence St. Augustine (City of God xviii. 45.) shows that the prophet foretells the glory of Christ's mystical temple, the faithful of all nations, in whom he dwells by the grace of the new testament, as in living stones, far more gloriously than in any temple erected by Solomon or after the captivity. (Worthington)
