Exposed. Hebrew, "he was sent on foot into the vale "to contend with the 900 chariots of Sisara. Issachar boldly followed him in battle. They came down with such fury and speed, as if they were falling headlong down a precipice. (Haydock) 
Sisara presently turned his back, being affrighted with the apparition of angels, who probably fought at the head of Barac's troop. (Salien) 
Only three tribes exposed themselves to danger, while the rest were either engaged in civil broils, or in their usual employments. (Calmet)

Protestants, "for the divisions of Ruben, there were great thoughts of heart. "Bonfrere supposes that these disputes excited the surprise and observations of all. (Haydock)
