Thee. What insolence! Kings are often forced to brook the affronts of their higher servants, as well as other masters. There is a gradation in human affairs, which makes the next in dignity and power think himself equal to the highest. Similis ero altissimo, Isaias xiv. 14. (Haydock) 
David sincerely desired the welfare of all his people, as well as of Absalom. (Menochius)
