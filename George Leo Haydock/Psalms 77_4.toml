My eyes. Vatican Septuagint, Arabic, and St. Augustine read, "my enemies "but our Vulgate follows the edition of Aldus and Complutensian (Berthier) very frequently, which here agree better with the Hebrew, "I hindered my eyes from looking up "(St. Jerome; Symmachus) or, "thou hast kept the watches of my eyes "(Aquila) hindering me from sleeping; (Haydock) so that I did not watch three hours only, like the sentinels, but all night. (Calmet) 
The sudden address to God seems incorrect. (Berthier) 
I rose before the usual time, yet did not utter my sentiments, (Worthington) being quite oppressed both with grief and joy. (Haydock) 
I durst not speak, as I was convinced that thy judgments were right. (Menochius)
