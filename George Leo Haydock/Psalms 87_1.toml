Mountains. So far the Jews extend the title, supposing that the subject of this canticle was concerning Sion, Moria Others think that, thereof, refers to a part of the psalm which has been lost, (Calmet) or to the temple or city which occupied the prophet's thoughts; or it is sufficiently explained by the word Sion, which follows, as the relative sometimes comes first. (Du Hamel) See Proverbs xiv. 3. 
This psalm might be composed (Berthier) by some of the Corites, during, or after the captivity, when Jerusalem received strangers within her walls, as a figure of the Christian Church; (Isaias ii. 2., and Zacharias viii. 20.; Calmet) or David (Berthier) might write it when he had removed the ark to Sion, which was to be the seat of the true religion. (Ferrand) 
Mountains. The apostles and prophets; (Ephesians ii. 20.; Challoner) on which the Church is founded. (Haydock) 
The city was styled holy, from the temple built on Moria. Several other mountains were included within its walls. (Calmet)
