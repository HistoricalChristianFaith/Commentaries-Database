Vale of Casis, "incision "so called, as some pretend, on account of the balm, which was extracted by cutting the bark with a stone, or with glass. But this etymology seems too far fetched, and there is no proof that balm was cultivated there in the days of Josue. (Calmet) 
Some of the cities of Benjamin have been here omitted, as two others are mentioned, chap. xxi. 18. (Menochius)
