Princes, (satrapas) a Persian word. (Menochius) 
These heads of the five great cities of the Philistines, are called Seranim, (Haydock) but never kings, whether they were governors of so many petty states, united in the same form of republican or aristocratical government, or independent of each other. See Josue xiii. Three of these cities are said to have been take by Juda, (chap. i. 18,) unless the Septuagint be more accurate, as this passage would seem to insinuate. (Calmet) 
They might have thrown off the yoke in a short time, as we before observed. These five cities were Gaza, Geth, Ascalon, Azotus, and Accaron. (Haydock) 
All but Geth were on the Mediterranean sea. (Calmet) 
All the Chanaanites, who dwelt in Libanus, with some others, who were dispersed through the country, ver. 5. (Haydock) 
These chiefly inhabited the environs of Sidon. 
Baal Hermon. The idol of Baal might probably be adored on this mountain. (Menochius) 
We find Baal-gad in the same neighbourhood, and both may mean the same city. (Calmet)
