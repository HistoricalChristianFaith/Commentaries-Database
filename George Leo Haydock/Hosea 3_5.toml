David, their king. That is, Christ, who is of the house of David. (Challoner) 
After the captivity, the Jews submitted to Zorobabel. Yet this only foreshewed a more sincere conversion to Jesus Christ. In fact, the house of David never regained the throne, (Calmet) and it is not clear that Zorobabel had any authority over the people. (Haydock) 
Christ is the literal object of this prediction. (Calmet)
