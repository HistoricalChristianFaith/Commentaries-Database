Let us endeavour sedulously to imitate the good example of this blind man, who did not ask for honours, riches, or other worldly advantages, but only that he might receive his sight; that he might behold the light with the blessed angels, to which faith alone can conduct us. (Ven. Bede) 
In this worse than Cimmerian darkness, how few are found, who pray as they ought for this all-necessary light of faith!!!
