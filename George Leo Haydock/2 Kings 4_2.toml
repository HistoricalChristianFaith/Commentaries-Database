Anoint me, for delicacy or health, Matthew vi. 17. (Menochius) 
To abstain from this unction, in the East, was a great mortification, 2 Kings xiv. 2., and Deuteronomy xxviii. 40. Sanctius supposes, that the woman intended the oil to anoint her body for interment, Matthew xxvi. 12. Hebrew asuc, occurs no where else, and my signify a pot, or "skin of oil. "The woman had nothing else. The original does not say what she intended to do with it. (Calmet) 
She might use it for food: (3 Kings xvii. 12.) but the Septuagint agree with the Vulgate. (Haydock)
