Journey. During this time, we know not where they encamped. The first place that is specified is Tab era, or "the burning "(chap. xi. 3.; Calmet) which St. Jerome believes is the same place, which was also called the sepulchres of concupiscence, (ver. 34,) the 13th station, (Haydock) which is described above as the desert of Pharan. (Menochius) 
Before them. See ver. 17. (Haydock) 
The Rabbins assert that there were two arks; one containing the writings of Moses going before, with the lawgiver, at the head of the army; and the other, carried by the Levites, in the centre. (Drusius) 
Calmet would rather translate "went in their presence "that is, in the midst. The kings of Persia always marched in the centre, for greater safety, and that they might communicate their orders with more expedition, as well as to keep all in order, and observe what was doing. (Xenophon.; Cyrop. iv. and viii.; Arian ii. and iii.) (Calmet) 
But the ark of God would probably go before the people, with the cloud, which hung over it.
