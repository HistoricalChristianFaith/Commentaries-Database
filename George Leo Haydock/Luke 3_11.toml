He that hath two coats St. John exhorts them to works of charity towards the poor, by giving what is superfluous. (Witham) 
Here we are taught that whatever we have more than our own wants require, must be bestowed on those who are in need; for the love of that God, of whom we have received all. (St. Basil, in Avar.) 
Charity to the poor is frequently recommended in Scripture, as a powerful method of redeeming sin, and reconciling us to divine mercy. This was Daniel's advice to king Nabuchodonosor: "May my counsel please thee, O king, and do thou redeem thy sins with alms and mercy to the poor. "(Daniel iv.) Hence St. Chrysostom says: "The poor are physicians, and their hands are an ointment for your wounds. "(hom. xiv. in ep. 1. ad Tim.) 
See the unbounded love of God; he offers us his mercy, provided we will relieve our indigent brethren! (Haydock)
