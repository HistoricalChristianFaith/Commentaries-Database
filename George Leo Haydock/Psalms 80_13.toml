Singular. The wild boar, which does not go with other beasts. Nabuchodonosor is here designated, (Calmet) or Salmanasar, and all persecutors, (Berthier) particularly the devil, who goes about like a roaring lion, and stirs up his agents to disturb the world. Hence the enemy becomes more cruel than any wild beast. (Worthington)
