Milked. Hebrew, "poured me out as milk, and curdled me like cheese? "(Haydock) 
See Wisdom vii. 1. The ancients explained our origin by the comparison of milk curdled, or cheese; (Arist. vii. 15.) which the moderns have explained on more plausible principles. (Calmet) 
Yet still we may acknowledge our ignorance with the mother of Machabees, 2 Machabees vii. 22.
