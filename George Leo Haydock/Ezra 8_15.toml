Ahava. This river (ver. 21., and 31.) runs through the territory of the same name, called Hava; (4 Kings xvii. 24.) the people of which exchanged places with the Israelites. Esdras makes a circuit to prevail on some of the latter to return with him, unless he began his journey from Susa. Babylon comprises all that country. (Calmet) 
None there, who were not priests, ver. 2. (Lyranus) (Menochius)
