Wept, in private. (Menochius) 
Would. David lamented the death of Absalom, because of the wretched state in which he died; and therefore would have been glad to have saved his life, even by dying for him. In this he was a figure of Christ weeping, praying, and dying for his rebellious children, and even for them that crucified him. (Challoner; St. Ambrose (de Ob. Valent.); Theodoret, q. 35.) 
David had presently ceased to weep for the son of Bethsabee, because he had reason to hope that he was saved. (Calmet)
