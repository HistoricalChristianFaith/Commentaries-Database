Two angels of Persia and Greece, near the Tigris. (Maldonatus) Ver. 6. I. Hebrew, "He. "Theod., Syriac and Arabic, "they said "to Gabriel, chap. x. 5. Angels ask questions of each other, chap. viii. 13. 
Wonders. How long shall this be in the dark, and the misery continue? Ver. 7. Heaven. He thus shows that he is not God. (Calmet) 
Time often implies a year, chap. iv. 13. Hence he means three years and a half. Christ assures us that those days shall be shortened, (Matthew xxiv. 22.) and the persecutor shall tarry a short time, Apocalypse xvii. 10., and xii. 14. The same period is insinuated by 1290 days, (ver. 11) and 1330, ver. 12. The two witnesses prophesy 1260 days, during which the Church shall be fed in the wilderness, Apocalypse xii. 6. But the term is most exactly specified by forty-two months, Apocalypse xi. 2., and xiii. 5. Hence all the Fathers agree that the last persecution shall continue no longer. (Worthington) 
How absurdly do some Protestants explain this of years during which, they say, the papacy shall subsist! Whence will they date its origin? But they will readily trifle with the word of God, and admit any one to indulge his fancy, as long as he does not strike at the thirty-nine articles. If he do, he may expect the treatment of poor Stone, (Haydock) whose death in the King's Bench, aged 75, has been just announced. He pleaded that one article decided, "nothing was to be maintained which could not be proved by Scripture. "Yet he was deprived of his living by Dr. Porteus, who at one time was as eager to procure a change in the articles, yet was not prevented by his scruples from mounting the episcopal throne of Chester or of London. Stone had not this discretion. (Rock. N. 306.) He fell a victim to contradictory articles. He might be in error. But what right had Proteus to throw the first stone at him? or how will Protestants show that any man is reprehensible for adopting the principles of the Reformation, which was entirely built on private interpretation? They applaud Luther, who established Scripture self-interpreted for the only rule, and they condemn Stone, Wesley for acting accordingly. If they have such just weights and measures for their own, what wonder then if the rights of Catholics be disregarded? (Haydock) 
Half a time. The idol of Jupiter remained just three years. Yet the temple was not ready for sacrifices till other ten days had elapsed. They had been interrupted six months before that idol was set up. (Calmet) 
We must date from the profanation and distress caused by Apollonius, 1 Machabees iv. 52. (Jos. ; Usher, the year of the world 3836.; Calmet) 
Band. Literally, "hand. "(Haydock) 
When the people shall be destitute of strength, God will miraculously deliver them. Ver. 8. Understand not. The prophets were obliged to pray, and sometimes to receive a fresh revelation to explain what they had seen, chap. ix. 2.; 1 Peter i. 11.; and 1 Corinthians xiv. 26. What regarded Antiochus and the Church was almost inexplicable before the event, as the times of antichrist are to us, ver. 9. Ver. 10. White, by persecution endured with patience, chap. xi. 35. 
Learned. While the weak Jews will be scandalized at this treatment, the virtuous will reflect that suffering is a trial of God's servants, and a mark of predestination. Ver. 11. Days: thirteen more than three and a half, as we reckon. The odd number might be neglected, ver. 7. The abomination continued three years and ten days, but the sacrifices had been discontinued six months and three days before. See Chap. viii. 14. If Daniel speak of lunar years, as it is probable, the difference would only be two days. (Calmet) 
From the abolishing of the mass as much as possible, and the practice of heresy and abomination, unto the end of antichrist's persecution, 1290 days shall elapse. (Worthington) Ver. 12. Days. After the three years and a half, fifty-eight days will occur before the death of Antiochus, when Judas will disperse the troops of his three generals. (Calmet) 
Some respite will be granted for forty-five days, during which sinners may repent. (Menochius) 
It is difficult to say why forty-five days are here added to the former number. We are content to depart with Daniel, (ver. 9.) without searching any farther into these high mysteries. (Worthington) Ver. 13. Lot. Thou shalt enjoy a glorious resurrection, (Menochius) and thy dignities till death, for which thou must prepare. (Calmet) 
Days. "Hitherto "says St. Jerome, "we read Daniel, in the Hebrew volume; what follows, to the end, is translated from Theodotion's edition. "(Haydock) 
The history of Susanna is there placed at the beginning. (Calmet) 
According to the order of time, it should be placed after the first chapter. (Menochius)
