Psalm. Protestants intimate that this was not in the Hebrew; but we find mizmor, "canticle "which is equivalent. (Haydock) 
David speaks of his own restoration to health as a figure of Jesus Christ, who is principally intended, Hebrews x. 7. The end of the psalm is nearly the same with the 69th. (Calmet) 
Some arbitrarily (Berthier) explain the words with relation to the revolt of Absalom. (Bossuet) 
Others think it may refer to the captives, (Ven. Bede) to Daniel, or Jeremias, rescued from prison. See Theodoret, who explains it of men waiting for the general resurrection. It may express the sentiments of the Church, when the persecutions ceased. (Euthymius) 
Christ sometimes speaks in his own name, and sometimes in that of his members. (St. Ambrose; St. Augustine) (Calmet) 
It is certain that David had Christ in view; and if he alludes to himself, it is only as the figure of him. (Berthier)

Expectation, or patience. (Haydock)
