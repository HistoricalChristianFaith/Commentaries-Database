The Lord said God standeth not in need of any counsellor; nor are we suppose, that things pass in heaven in the manner here described: but this representation was made to the prophet, to be delivered by him in a manner adopted to the common ways and notions of men. (Challoner) (St. Gregory, Mor. ii. 21.) (Worthington) 
God did not enable the king to discern the falsehood. (Bellarmine ii. 13. Grat. Amis.)
