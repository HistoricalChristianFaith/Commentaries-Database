The priests, or ancient ministers, (i.e. bishops, priests) deserve a double honour; i.e. to be more liberally supplied and maintained by the flock, especially when they labour in preaching the word. 
Thou shalt not muzzle See 1 Corinthians ix. 9. (Witham) 
It is the obligation of the faithful to provide a decent maintenance for their pastors, and the duty of pastors to be content with little. Happy the church where there is no further difference found than between the liberality of the former and the disinterestedness of the latter!
