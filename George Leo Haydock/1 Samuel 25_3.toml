Caleb, the famous companion of Josue. His name means, "a dog "whence the Septuagint, "he was a Cynic. "Josephus, "he followed the manners of the Cynics "who were remarkable for their impudence, like dogs. Caleb was of the same tribe as David, and ought to have been more favourable to him on that account, ver. 6. (Haydock)
