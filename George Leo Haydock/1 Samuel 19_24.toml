Naked. Divested of his regal ornaments, (Tirinus) though not in an indecent posture. People are said to be undressed, when they have not such clothes on as might be expected. Hesiod and Virgil say, Nudus ara, sere nudus; hiems ignava colono. "Plough and sow naked; choose a fine season for work, and rest in winter. "(Haydock) See Micheas i. 8., and 2 Kings vi. 20. 
Yet some assert (Calmet) that Saul was entirely undressed, as some pretended prophets and slaves go in the hot countries, Isaias xx. 1. We are not to judge of the indecency of such behaviour from our own manners. Some copies read cecinit, (Calmet) and the Douay Bible has "and sang naked. "(Haydock) 
Saul had not the gift of prophecy, like holy men, but only like Balaam's ass, for a time. (St. Augustine ad Simp. ii. 1.) (Worthington) 
Prophets. This is something wonderful. (Menochius) 
The proverb was now confirmed, chap. x. 11. (Calmet)
