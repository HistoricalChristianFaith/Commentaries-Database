Destroyed. Hebrew, "smote also the tents of cattle. "Septuagint, "they cut in pieces the tents of cattle, the Amazons "or, according to the Vatican copy, (Haydock) "the Alimazonians "as they seem to have read aeli manim, which may be well rendered, "the tents of the Mineans "a people of Arabia, chap. xx. 1., and xxvi. 7., and Judges x. 11. (Calmet) 
If these nations came to punish Asa, for banishing their foreign worship, (ver. 12) as the Sieur de Folard thinks the sacred penman insinuates, (ver. 5) we need not wonder that they met with such ill success, and that not one of them was spared, as God avenged his own cause, ver. 12, 13. (Haydock) 
We read of no cavalry here, though it is mentioned, chap. xvi. 8. It seems not to have been considerable, as the people of Asia, the Greeks and Romans, trusted more to their infantry; and, in effect, no species of warfare is more costly to a state, nor less useful, than a multitude of horses, which were introduced in barbarous times. (De Folard)
