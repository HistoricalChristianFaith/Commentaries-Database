Woman. This second woman denotes the penitent Israel, yet not quite reconciled. The people in captivity are separated both from her idols and from God, though the latter still retains an affection for them. Osee does not marry this woman, but gives his word. We must not urge the parable too far. He acts as a figure of the Lord, who has received an outrage. (Calmet) 
Grace is still offered to sinners, whose persons are never hated by God. (Worthington) 
Husks. Septuagint, "cakes made with grapes "for idols. (Theodoret; St. Jerome)
