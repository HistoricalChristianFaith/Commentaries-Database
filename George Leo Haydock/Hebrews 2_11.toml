For both he who sanctifieth, (i.e. our Redeemer, who sanctifieth, or has obtained sanctification for all, by sacrificing himself on the cross) and they who are sanctified, are all of one; have the same human nature, and are from the same first parent Adam, whose Son, (Christ) as man, was; on which account he calls men his brethren. See John xx. 17. and Psalm xxi. 23., in which is a clear prediction of Christ's sufferings, where it is said: I will declare thy name to my brethren (Witham)
