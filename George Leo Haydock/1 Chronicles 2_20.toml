Bezel eel, the famous artist, (Exodus xxxi. 2.; Calmet) or a different person. (Du Hamel) 
The Rabbins, who confound Caleb with the son of Jephone, say that he espoused Ephrata, or Mary, the sister of Moses, when he was ten years old, that Ur and Uri had each a child at eight, and the Bezel eel began to work at the tabernacle before he was nine years old. (Lyranus) 
But this is extravagant, and the Bezel eel here mentioned was of the family of Hesron. (Calmet)
