To me. Hebrew also signify, "when they were sick "which manifests a more heroic charity; though yet it is more natural to suppose that David would assume these robes of penance when he was under affliction, as St. Jerome intimates, cum infirmarer ab eis. (Berthier) 
Our Saviour's life was a continual penance, though he stood in no need of it for himself. (Worthington) 
David was aware that the best method of avoiding the attacks of his enemies, was to make God his friend, by sentiments of humility, and by penance. (St. Augustine) (Calmet) 
Bosom. I shall reap the advantage from my prayer, if it be of no service to my enemies. (Genebrard) (Luke x. 6.) (Menochius) 
May what I wish for my enemies fall to my own lot. I have prayed for them in secret and with the utmost fervour. (Calmet) 
I have repeatedly urged my request, (Houbigant) or I am confident my prayer will be of some service, at least to myself. (Berthier)
