Sinned. It is rather wonderful that his repentance is not here noticed; but we find it mentioned 2 Paralipomenon xxxiii. 12. (Haydock) 
He was probably taken prisoner by Thartan, general of Sargon, or Asarhaddon, who had reunited the two kingdoms of Assyria and Babylon, Isaias xx. 1. In prison Manasses composed a penitential prayer, which is not absolutely rejected by the Church, but left in the rank of Apocryphal writings; (Calmet) the authority of which is not clearly ascertained. (Haydock) 
The Greek church admits this prayer into her Euchologium, (Calmet) or Office-book. (Haydock) 
Being liberated, probably by Saosduchin, Manasses did all things well, only he left the high places, where the people had been accustomed to sacrifice to the Lord. Hozai wrote his history, 2 Paralipomenon xxxiii. 19.
