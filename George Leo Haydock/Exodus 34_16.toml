Son. The Chaldean and Septuagint add, "nor give any of thy daughters to their sons "or, joining this verse with the 15th, the Septuagint say, "make no covenant. Lest they commit fornication after their gods. And call thee and thou eat. And thou take of thier daughters wives for thy sons, and thou wilt give some of thy daughters to their sons, and thy daughters shall go fornicating after their gods. "The most imminent dangers attend those women, who have infidel husbands. (Haydock) 
The intention of Moses, and the custom of the Hebrews, justly reprobated such marriages. (Calmet)
