Astarthe. Hebrew Hashtoreth, "ewes "is in the plural form, as if to denote many idols. But the moon, or the queen of heaven, (Jeremias vii. 18.) is particularly designated, Judges ii. 12. (Haydock) 
Some explain it of Venus, (Sanctius) or Juno. (Tirinus) 
Moloch. Hebrew Molciom, (their king) "the abomination "(Haydock) supposed to be the sun, (Sanctius) or saturn. (Tirinus) See 4 Kings xxiii. 10.
