David. There is no title in Hebrew; and the Greek copies vary. This psalm may be considered as a continuation of the former, with the last verse of which it may be well connected. (Calmet) 
Some suppose that David composed it after he had been rescued from the giant Jesbibenob, ver. 16., and 1 Paralipomenon xx. 4. (Ferrand.) 
It is not certain that he is the author; but as other psalms without a title are ascribed to him, we have no reason to deny that he wrote this. (Berthier) 
Many explain it as a thanksgiving of Ezechias. (Theodoret) 
But we need not refer it to any particular event. (Calmet) 
Upright. But it is not seemly in the mouth of a sinner, Ecclesiasticus xv. 9., (Worthington) and Psalm lxix. 16. (Calmet)
