The king. David, (Berthier) or Zorobabel, for whom the Jews had the highest regard, though he was not an independent monarch, nor wore a crown, Aggeus ii. 24., and Zacharias iii. 8. It was customary to swear by the life of the king, 1 Kings i. 26., and xx. 3. The Fathers understand Jesus Christ to be meant, and this is the true and primary sense; as Zorobabel was only a figure of Him, and never really possessed the throne, that the Jews might not think that the prophecies were fulfilled in his person. 
By him. The king, (Du Pin; Calmet) or God. (Menochius) (Bossuet) (Tirinus) 
Those who follow the true religion, (Deuteronomy vi. 13., and Isaias xlv 23.; Calmet) and act accordingly (Haydock) shall be kings for ever, Apocalypse. (Berthier) (1 Peter ii. 9.) (Haydock) 
As David came to the throne, on the death of his rival, so was Christ's name exalted, after the Romans had destroyed the Jews. (Worthington)
