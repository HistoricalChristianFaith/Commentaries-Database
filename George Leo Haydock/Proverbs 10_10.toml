Sorrow. Septuagint add, "to men as well as to himself. "(Calmet) 
"But he who chides boldly shall make peace "(Haydock) or "work safety "as the Syriac and Arabic also read, instead of Hebrew, "a prating fool shall fall. ""When a man connives at his friend's failings. The offender is encouraged to sin on, and to heap up matter for very sorrowful reflections; but the man, who with an honest freedom, prudently reproves him, most effectually contrives his honour and safety. "The consequences of a virtuous and a vicious friendship, seem to be also expressed in the next verse. Thus the latter hemistic generally illustrates the first. But here, part of ver. 8. may be improperly inserted. The two parts of the verses in Proverbs, being arranged in distinct columns, has occasioned sometimes a part, and sometimes a whole verse, to be omitted, as the transcriber might mistake the line.
