Protector. Hebrew, "buckler "to defend me from external enemies, as his grace enables me to do good. 
Flesh. Hebrew, "heart. "But joy would manifest itself over the whole body: (Proverbs xvii. 22.; Berthier) and the Syriac agrees with the Septuagint, "My flesh shall bud forth, and I shall sing his praises in glory. "(Calmet) 
Will. Hebrew, "canticle "which was dictated by the will. It is suspected that the Septuagint read differently. Only the saints taste true joys, so that they alone might be styled sensual. But this world lings cannot understand, 1 Corinthians ii. 14. (Berthier) 
The Fathers explain this text of Christ's, or of our resurrection, (St. Jerome) which was prefigured by the return from captivity. (Calmet) 
Interior comfort causes the body to be refreshed; and the psalmist gladly (Worthington) expresses his gratitude. (Haydock)
