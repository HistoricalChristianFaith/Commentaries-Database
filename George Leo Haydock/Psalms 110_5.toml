The Lord. He speaks to God the Father concerning the Messias, (Menochius) or God assisted the sacred humanity. (St. Chrysostom) 
In the Godhead the persons are equal. The Father is at the right of the Son, as He is at his Father's, ver. i. (St. Augustine) (Calmet) 
Yet it seems more probable, that the discourse is addressed to the first person. (Berthier)
