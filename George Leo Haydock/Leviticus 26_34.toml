Desolation. It shall be uncultivated; and though you would not comply with my injunctions to let it rest one year out of seven, it shall now remain desolate for many years together. (Haydock) 
Theodoret (q. 37) says for 70 years; the number of sabbatic years, from the reign of Saul till the captivity of Babylon, during the space of 490 years. This verse seems evidently to allude to those days of distress. (Calmet) (2 Paralipomenon xxxvi. 21.) 
But we can hardly suppose that none of the sabbatic years should have been duly observed during the reigns of David, Solomon (Haydock) 
Instead of enjoy, Hebrew may be "shall expiate her sabbaths "or the neglect of them. The same term, tirtse, is used, (ver. 41 and 43,) and the Vulgate generally renders it agreeable, speaking of sacrifices, chap. i. 4 and xxii. 20. (Calmet)
