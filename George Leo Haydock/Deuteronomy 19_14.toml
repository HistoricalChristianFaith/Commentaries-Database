Landmarks, either which divided the tribes, or the inheritance of individuals. The former were strictly kept up till after the captivity. Those who removed the latter were to be scourged for theft, and again for disobeying this law. (Selden, Jur. vi. 3.) Josephus ( iv. 8,) understands that encroachments on the territories of others, which give rise to many wars, are hereby prohibited. (Calmet) 
So are likewise innovations in religion. The Romans had a superstitious veneration for these landmarks, which they adored under the name of the god Terminus, (Haydock) crowning them with flowers, and offering cakes and sacrifices to them. Spargitur et coeso communis Terminus agno. (Ovid, Fast.) 
They punished the crime of removing them either with death, banishment, or a fine.
