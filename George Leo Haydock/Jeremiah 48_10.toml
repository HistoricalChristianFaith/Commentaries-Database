Deceitfully. In the Greek, negligently. The work of God here spoken of, is the punishment of the Moabites. (Challoner) 
Woe to those who spare those whom God orders to be destroyed, as Saul and Achab did, 1 Kings xv. 8, 23., and 3 Kings xx. 32, 42. The zeal of the Levites, Phinees, is rewarded, Exodus xxxii. 27., and Numbers xx. 8.
