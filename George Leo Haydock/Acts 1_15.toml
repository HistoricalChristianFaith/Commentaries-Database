Peter, rising up Peter, says St. Chrysostom on this place, who was prince, or chief of the apostolical college, who had authority over them all, who by his place and dignity, might, without them, have chosen, and appointed a new apostle to succeed Judas, (Christ having said to him, confirm thy brethren,) yet he consults them. (Witham) 
Here Peter acts and ordains in virtue of his supremacy, and the other apostles agree to his appointment.
