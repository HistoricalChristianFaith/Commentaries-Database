Time. One decision ought to suffice; and God had declared Job innocent, chap. i. 8. (Worthington) 
His decrees are immutable; and yet thou wouldst have him to explain his conduct, as if he could be under a mistake, and correct it. He manifests his will, and it is our business to be attentive. We cannot expect that he should speak twice, though he does so frequently in his great mercy. Hebrew, "God speaketh once, and he regardeth not a second time. "(Calmet) 
Septuagint, "But the second time, (15) a dream "(Haydock) 
Eliu specifies three methods by which God declares his will; (ver. 26) 1. By vision; 2. by afflictions; 3. by the voice of angels, or of preachers, ver. 19, 23.
