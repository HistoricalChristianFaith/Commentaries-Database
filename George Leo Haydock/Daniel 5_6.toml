Loosed, so that he quaked for fear, Ezechiel xxix. 7. (Calmet) 
He was not so drunk as to be deprived of sense. (Haydock) 
This happened in the 17th and last year of his reign, when Daniel was about a hundred years old, (Worthington) though we have no certain account of his age. (Haydock) 
He might be eighty-two when he died. (Calmet)
