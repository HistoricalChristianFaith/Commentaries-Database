(Bible de Vence) 
It was not at this time that John relates, after our Saviour had begun to work miracles, and after his baptism. St. Luke anticipates this event, in order to describe more strongly the malice of Herod; who, whilst he saw multitudes flocking to hear the words of John, his own soldiers believing, and all the people receiving baptism, still could despise the Baptist, could imprison him, and put him to death. (Ven. Bede)

This was Herod Antipas, son of Herod the great, mentioned in Chap. i, ver. 5.
