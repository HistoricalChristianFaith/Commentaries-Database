Here. In 2 Kings v. 6, the passage is much fuller, and attended with many difficulties. Kennicott would correct and translate it: "And they spake unto David, saying, Thou shalt not come hither: for the blind and the lame shall keep thee off, by saying, David shall not come hither. But David took the stronghold of Sion "(different from the citadel. Josephus) "which is the city of David. And David said, on that day, whosoever (first) smiteth the Jebusites, and, through the subterraneous passage, reacheth the blind and the lame, which are hated of David's soul, because the blind and the lame continued to say, he shall not come into this house
shall be head and captain. So Joab, the son of Zeruiah, went up first, and was head."
