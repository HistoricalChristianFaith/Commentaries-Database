Sanctuary, with respect to the things mentioned, ver. 31. (Menochius) 
The Samaritan copy observes, that they also carried the brazen laver, as we find they did, chap. iv. 14. All these things were folded up in the violet curtains of the sanctuary, while the ark was covered with the veil which hung before it, chap. iv. 5. Some pretend that the number here specified ought to be 830, to obviate a difficulty ver. 39. But this amendment has no solid foundation. (Calmet)
