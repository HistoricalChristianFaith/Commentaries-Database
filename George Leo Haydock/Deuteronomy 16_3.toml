Affliction. Hebrew also, "of poverty. "Syriac, "of humility. "Septuagint, "of evil treatment "or such bread as the poorest sort of people and slaves are forced to eat. The Jews serve the bread in small pieces, to denote their former poverty. This unleavened bread is also less palatable, and less wholesome. 
Fear. Septuagint, "in haste "Exodus xii. 11. The psalmist (Psalm civ. 43,) mentions, the exultation and joy of the Hebrews, but it was mixed with fear, lest they should lose so great a benefit.
