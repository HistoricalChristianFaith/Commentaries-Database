Did not return. The negotiation Not, is not to be found in any Hebrew copy now extant; though it is still retained by the Septuagint, and several Latin manuscripts, according to the testimony of Liranus. If we adhere, therefore, to the Hebrew text, we must translate it with St. Jerome, thus; It went forth, going and returning, (Egredicbatur exiens et revertens) sometimes repairing to the mountains, where it found carcasses to feed on, and at other times returning not unto the ark, but to rest upon the top of it. (Estius) (Challoner) 
Or receded farther from it; as the Hebrew may be explained, agreeably to the Vulgate, Septuagint, Syriac which admit the negation. (Calmet) 
Till, as long as the waters covered the earth, not that it returned to the ark afterwards. (Menochius)
