Buffaloes. Yachmur means also a sort of wild-goat, like a stag, Deuteronomy xiv. 5. (Bo chart, Anim. i. B. iii. 22.) 
Fowls. Some Rabbins explain barburim, (or borbrim) of capons, or birds from Barbary; as if this name had been known in the days of Solomon. (Calmet) 
There was an ancient Ethiopian Barbary on the Persian gulf, (Bo chart) with which the Rabbins were not acquainted. (Calmet)
