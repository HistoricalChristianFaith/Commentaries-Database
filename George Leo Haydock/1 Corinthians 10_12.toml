Take heed lest he fall. This regards the doctors and teachers in the new Church of Corinth; who, relying upon their own learning, did not think themselves weak, and presuming too much upon their own strength, exposed themselves to the danger of falling. See St. Chrysostom and St. Augustine, de dono. Persev. 
Self-diffidence is the foundation of our strength. We prevent many dangerous falls when we keep close to the earth by humility.
