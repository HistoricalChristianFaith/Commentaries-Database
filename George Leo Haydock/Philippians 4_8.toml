For the rest, brethren, whatsoever things are true Here the apostle enumerates general precepts of morality, which they ought to practise. 
Whatsoever things are true. In words, in promises, in lawful oaths he commands rectitude of mind and sincerity of heart. 
Whatsoever things are modest. By these words he prescribes gravity in manners, modesty in dress, and decency in conversation. 
Whatsoever things are just. That is, in dealing with others, in buying or selling, in trade or business, to be fair and honest. 
Whatsoever things are holy. By these words may be understood, that those who are in a religious state professed, or in holy orders, should lead a life of sanctity and chastity, according to the vows they make; but these words being also applied to those in the world, indicate the virtuous life they are bound by the divine commandments to follow. 
Whatsoever things are amiable. That is to practise those good offices in society that procure us the esteem and good will of our neighbours. 
Whatsoever things are of good repute. That is, that by our conduct and behaviour we should edify our neighbours, and give them good example by our actions. 
If there be any virtue, if there be any praise of discipline: that those in error, by seeing the morality and good discipline of the true religion, may be converted. And finally, the apostle commands not only the Philippians, but all Christians, to think on these things: that is, to make it their study and concern, that the peace of God might be with them.
