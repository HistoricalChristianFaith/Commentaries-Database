Innocent. Hebrew, "He shall deliver even the man who is not innocent, and that for the sake of the purity of thy hands. "(Chaldean; Junius) 
God will even spare the guilty, to manifest the regard which he has for the intercession of the saints. These interpreters have taken ai in the same sense as ain, which is the case, 1 Kings iv. 21. (Calmet) 
Others explain, "He shall deliver the island of the innocent, and it is delivered by the pureness of thine hands. "(Protestants) This also would show the merit and protection of the saints, as a whole island may owe its safety to one of God's servants. In effect, the world stands by the prayers of the saints. (Haydock) 
All that has been said from ver. 21 tends to show that God favours his friends; and, consequently, that he would never have punished Job, if he had not been guilty. (Calmet)
