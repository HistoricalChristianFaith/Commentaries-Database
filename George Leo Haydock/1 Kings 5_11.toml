Wheat, "ground or beaten. "(Hebrew; Paralipomenon) (Haydock) 
By comparing this passage with chap. iv. 22, we may see how much the court of Solomon surpassed that of Hiram. The former consumed 90 measures of flour a day; and 20,000 of wheat sufficed for the Tyrian prince's family a whole year. 
Twenty. It is supposed by many commentators that thousand is to be supplied from the former sentence; as there seems otherwise to be no proportion between the wheat and the oil. (Piscator) 
The Septuagint, Syriac, read 20,000. (Calmet) 
The Alexandrian copy has not core, but only beth, (Haydock) or "bath "which is a smaller measure, containing 29 pints and something more, (Calmet) or seven gallons, four pints, English wine measure; whereas the core, or chomer, consisted of 75 gallons, five pints. (Arbuthnot) (Haydock) 
In Paralipomenon, the workmen have 20,000 cores of wheat, and also of barley, and as many baths of wine and of oil; which bear some proportion with each other. (Calmet)
