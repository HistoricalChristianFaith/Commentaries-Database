Understandeth. Believing with eagerness, (Haydock) or reflecting seriously on Jesus Christ, (Berthier) who was pleased to be poor for our sakes. (Haydock) 
And the poor, is not in the ancient Septuagint, (Eusebius) nor Hebrew But it only expresses the same idea as the word needy, (Berthier) being added to show the extreme misery to which our Saviour was reduced. (Haydock) 
The Fathers explain the passage in this sense, though some would suppose, that David speaks of his own conduct, (Calmet) or of those who adhered to him in his distress, while most followed Absalom. (Flaminius) 
Day of death or judgment. Happy the man, who makes the life of Christ his constant meditation, (Berthier) and endeavours to imitate his example, and divine charity! (Haydock) 
The Church recites this psalm for the sick. Those who assist them may hope for similar treatment. But such as are not scandalized at Christ, on account of his poverty and afflictions, may be pronounced blessed, (Luke vii. 23.) as He will deliver them from distress, if they place their confidence in Him. (Worthington) 
The sick are relieved, when they think on Christ's sufferings. (Menochius) 
Preserve. Hebrew, "will preserve. And thou wilt not deliver him unto the will of his enemies. "(Protestants) 
But St. Jerome has, "and he will not "(Haydock) 
Sixtus V reads, "into the hands of his enemy "after St. Augustine Others add, "he will purify his soul from, or on the earth. "(Calmet) 
Our Lord will give to such servants more grace in this life, and glory in the next, nor will he suffer them to yield to temptation. (Worthington) 
He will defend them and heal them, when sick. (Calmet)

Himself; implying, that David composed this psalm, though the word is not expressed in Hebrew or Greek. (Berthier; T. iii.) 
The same articles, however, occur, which have been thus rendered before. (Haydock) 
Some explain this psalm of the sickness of Ezechias, (Ven. Bede) or of that of David, a little before the revolt of Absalom. (Rab. Muis; Bossuet) 
This may be described as a figure of our Saviour's sufferings. (Calmet) 
For it would be rash not to acknowledge, that He is here the principal object in view, (Theodoret) since he has applied (ver. 10.) to the traitor's conduct, (Calmet) and all the rest may properly allude to the same events. The psalmist speaks of the Messias in the six first verses, and introduces him, in the remainder, uttering his own sentiments, (Berthier) respecting his passion and resurrection. (Worthington) (Isaias liii. 4.) (Menochius)
