Joel seems better than Igaal, (2 Kings; Haydock) as we know there were some of this name 2 Kings. It is, therefore, more natural for us to adhere to that copy which has the greatest authority from the ancient versions. (Kennicott) 
Brother, relation, adopted child, (Du Hamel) or son, (2 Kings) which seems more correct, as this is an usual expression. (Calmet) 
This reason may rather lead us to conclude that the mistake being more natural, has been made by the transcriber of that book; particularly as we no where else read of Joel being the son of Nathan, but rather of Pedaiah 
Mibahar, or rather "Nathan of Tzoba. "
The son, ought to be the proper name, "Bonni, (of Gadi, 2 Kings) or the Gadite. "(Kennicott)
