Heaven. Christ appeared about sixty years after the subversion of the Syrian monarchy. Yet these expressions literally refer to his second coming, Matthew xxvi. 64. (Calmet) 
He had the form of man, as he had the nature. (Menochius) 
He is clearly predicted. By his power antichrist is overthrown. (Worthington)
