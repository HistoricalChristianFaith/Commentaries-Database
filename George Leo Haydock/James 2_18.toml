Some men will say: Thou hast faith, and I have works. Shew me thy faith He confutes the same error, by putting them in mind that one can show that he has faith, which is an interior virtue, only by good works, and that good works in a man show also his faith; which is not to be understood, as if good works were merely the marks, signs, and effects of faith, as some would pretend, but that good works must concur with faith to a man's salvation by an increase in grace.
