Name. Josephus ( iv. 8,) takes this literally, as St. Augustine once did, though afterwards he retracted that opinion, (B. ii. 12,) on considering that Booz called his son Obed, and not MA halon, which was the name of the first husband of Ruth, Ruth iv. 17. (Calmet) 
Houbigant thinks some omissions have taken place in the very short genealogy of David, mentioned in that chapter, and instead of Obed, he would substitute Jachin, as the first-born of Ruth. He thinks that Solomon alluded to two of his ancestors, when he styled the two pillars before the temple Jachin and Booz. "In strength it shall stand or establish "3 Kings vii. 21. Hebrew, "the first-born which she beareth shall arise (or succeed) in the name (or by the right and title) of his brother. "See Numbers xxiv. 3. (Haydock) 
Name is sometimes put for succession, (Calmet) or instead of another. (Menochius)
