The permission was moreover only granted to the Jews: (Calmet) but Cyrus had exhorted all to contribute; (chap. i. 4,) and Darius, as well as his pagan governors, were not repelled with disdain, chap. vi. 13. This treatment caused the Samaritans to be more inveterate, though the Jews were always more unwilling to come to a reconciliation. (Haydock) 
"For the Scripture did not say, the Samaritans have no commerce with the Jews "says St. Chrysostom in John iv. The Jewish authors inform us, that "Ezra, gathered all the congregation into the temple, and the Levites sung and cursed the Samaritans. That no Israelite eat of any thing that is a Samaritan's, nor that any Samaritan be proselyted to Israel, nor have any part in the resurrection "(R. Tan chum) (Lightfoot i. p. 598.) (Kennicott)

They knew the character of the Samaritans, and wished to bring them to a sense of their duty, by this rebuke. (Haydock)
