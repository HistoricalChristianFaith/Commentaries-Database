Urias, the husband of Bethsabee. We have observed (ver. 25,) that in Paralipomenon the number of 37 is completed by Zabad, instead of Elica. (Haydock) 
Only 36 are specified in these catalogues, as the name of the sixth hero (ver. 18,) is omitted, whom some take to be Sobati, Jonathan, (chap. xxi. 22,) Joiada, (ver. 20,) or Joab. (Calmet) 
But the truth is, Joab is not mentioned here at all, as he was sufficiently known for the chief; (1 Paralipomenon xi. 6,) and he makes up the number of 37. The sixth, therefore, was Asael; (ver. 24,) and after him there are exactly 30. For though Gouni be lost, (ver. 32,) Semma is substituted in the following verse. (Haydock)
