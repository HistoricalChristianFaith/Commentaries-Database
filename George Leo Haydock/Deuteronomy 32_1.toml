Speak. Hebrew and Septuagint, "Heaven attend, and I will speak. "(Haydock) 
Never was there an exordium more pompous, or better adapted to the subject. Moses calls those who never die to witness what he asserts, as if to insinuate that these truths ought never to be forgotten. See Numbers iv. 6. Virgil (Æneid xii.) imitates this style, Esto nunc sol testishæc mihi terra precanti, (Calmet) which he puts in the mouth of Æneas, to whom Latinus replies, Hæc eadem Ænea, terram, mare, sidera juro.
