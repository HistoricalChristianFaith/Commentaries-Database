Now Peter did not dare to weep openly, lest he should be detected by his tears, but he went out and wept. Ho wept not because of punishment, but because he denied his beloved Lord, which was more galling than any punishment.

Whenever sitting and a throne are spoken of God, His kingly and supreme majesty is signified. For we do not imagine any judgment-seat to be placed, on which we believe the Lord of all takes His seat; nor again, that in any wise right hand or left hand appertain to the Divine nature; for figure, and place, and sitting, are the properties of bodies. But how shall the Son be seen to be of equal honour and to sit together on the same throne, if He is not the Son according to nature, having in Himself the natural property of the Father?

When Christ spoke this, the company of the Pharisees were very wroth, uttering shameful words; as it follows, Then said they, What need we any further witness?

“Now the men who were holding Jesus mocked him and beat him; they also blindfolded him and asked him, ‘Prophesy! Who is it that struck you?’ ” “When he was reviled, he did not revile in return; when he suffered, he did not threaten; but he trusted to him who judges justly.” We should say what the holy prophets said about certain men, “Be appalled, O heavens, at this, be shocked, be utterly desolate, says the Lord.” He is the Lord of earth and heaven, the Creator and Architect of all, the King of kings and Lord of lords. He is of surpassing greatness in glory and majesty, the foundation of everything, and that in which all things exist and remain. All things exist in him. He is the breath of all the holy spirits in heaven. This One is despised as one of us, patiently endures beatings, and submits to the ridicule of the wicked. He offers himself to us as a perfect pattern of patience. He rather reveals the incomparable greatness of his godlike gentleness.

Perhaps even Christ endures this to rebuke our minds’ weakness and to show that human things fall as far below the divine excellencies as our nature is inferior to his. We of earth, mere corruption and ashes, immediately attack those who would disturb us, as we have a heart full of fierceness like savage beasts. He, who in nature and glory transcends the limits of our understanding and our powers of speech, patiently endured those officers when they not only mocked but also hit him. It says, “Now the men who were holding Jesus mocked him and beat him; they also blindfolded him and asked him, ‘Prophesy! Who is it that struck you?’ ” They ridicule, as if he were some ignorant person, him who is the giver of all knowledge and even sees what is hidden within us. He has somewhere said by one of the holy prophets, “Who is this that darkens counsel by words without knowledge?” He who tries hearts and minds and is the giver of all prophecy, how could he not know who hit him? As Christ said, “Darkness has blinded their eyes, and their minds are blinded.” One may say of them, “Woe to them that are drunk, but not with wine! Their vine is of the vine of Sodom and of Gomorrah.”

When at dawn their wicked assembly gathered, they brought into their midst the Lord of Moses and the Sender of the prophets. After illegally mocking him, they asked if he were the Christ. O senseless Pharisee, if you ask because you do not know, surely until you had learned the truth you should not hurt him, or else by chance you may hurt God. If you make pretense of ignorance, while really you know that he is the Christ, you must hear what the sacred Scripture says, “God is not mocked.”

I think that we should examine the words used by Christ, because they were a correction for the lack of love to God of which the scribes and Pharisees were guilty. When they ask whether he is truly the Christ and could learn this very thing, he answers them, “If I tell you, you will not believe; and if I ask, you will not return an answer.”

They say, “We no longer need any testimony,” as being the hearers of Christ’s words. What had they heard him say? O vile and senseless people, you wanted to learn if he were the Christ! He taught you that by nature and in truth he is the Son of God the Father, and he shares the throne of Deity with him. As you confessed, you now have no need of testimony, because you have heard him speak. You might now have learned best that he is the Christ. This would have proved for you the pathway to faith, had you only been one of those who would know the truth. Making even the pathway of salvation an occasion for their souls’ ruin, they do not understand. They senselessly slay him, keeping but one aim in view in contempt of all law. They totally disregard the divine commands. It is written, “The holy and the just you shall not kill.” They paid no regard whatsoever to the sacred commands but rushed down some steep hill to fall into the snares of destruction.
