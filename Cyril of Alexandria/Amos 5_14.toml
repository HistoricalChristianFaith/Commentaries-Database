Seek good, and not evil: So that in living and being saved you may attain a proper life, and the Lord God, who has power over everything, may be with you..
It is really necessary, therefore, to have sound attitudes and direct our own thinking to attitudes and that please God, to live virtuously, to adhering to the ways of righteousness and being wise devotees of uprightness. This in fact is the way we shall have the God of all to accompany and protect us.
