“I descended from heaven not to do my own will but the will of the one who sent me, that is, the will of the Father who sent me that I shall not lose nothing of all which he has given but raise it up on the last day.” For Christ appeared in the world and accomplished the gospel among those from Israel. But since they were unbelieving and obdurate, hostile and aggressive, they did not make room for faith. Instead, they sinned in many ways against it and ended up crucifying its perfect form. See in me [Christ says] the power of ineffable wisdom. For from their insensibility there came an affliction—I am referring to his death. For he clearly foretold the salvation of the flesh to everyone on the earth, and death itself suffered corruption, being destroyed through his resurrection. We, in turn, were revived to life, even we who in Adam were dragged down to its opposite. - "Commentary on Isaiah 4.4.49.8-12"

After they were called to the light of truth, they were provided with pastures and forests that nurtured their spiritual strength and satisfied them with every good thing. God made the abundance of his grace, help and spiritual consolation available to them. “For they shall not hunger or thirst.” For once they were without spiritual consolation and did not have godly law or prophet or schoolmaster or tutor or teacher, or any spring of water of understanding. After God took mercy on them, however, a feast has been prepared for them in the choir school of spiritual good things. The food there will profit their souls. For they will eat bread from heaven and drink living water, of which the Christ himself said to the Samaritan woman: “Anyone who drinks from this water will thirst again. But whoever drinks the water I give will never be thirsty.”
