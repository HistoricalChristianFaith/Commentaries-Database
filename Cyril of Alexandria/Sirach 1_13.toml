"I have acted thus so that he would be full of fear toward me; I have acted in such a way that he would cringe before my name." Conveniently he enumerates all the splendid ornaments of the priesthood, obtained by means of the mystagogy of the Law. He inspired, first of all, the fear of God in the ministers of the divine worship, making them withdraw before his name, that is, making them fear and tremble when they hear the name of the Lord and driving them to experience a sentiment of reverence toward him that is not superficial but diligent, and next to which nothing is more precious. It is written, in fact, that he "who fears the Lord fares well." And again: "The fear of the Lord is glory and exultation." He has, therefore, guaranteed security to the one who fulfills the priesthood with sanctity and in truth. He does not simply say that they have been nourished with fear but that they were absolutely filled with fear, that is, the fear of God occupies their entire heart and soul. In this verse, the emphasis and the repetition of the words indicate to the audience the steadfastness in virtue of those who are praised. - "Commentary on Malachi 2.19"
