It seemed right to some of the previous exegetes to make this the head of the chapter that follows. For thus says the Lord: “In due season I heard you and on the day of salvation I helped you.” And they say that this is what was said by the God and Father of all to Christ our Savior. For they weave in such a sense to the words. For he prayed, saying before the precious cross, “Father, if it is possible, take away this cup from me.” But he was not heard, and he drank it. When he had suffered death with the Father permitting it, then the Father said to him what was necessary, “In due season I heard you, and on the day of salvation I helped you.”
