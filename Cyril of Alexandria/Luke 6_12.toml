Let us examine then in the actions which Jesus did, how He teaches us to be instantin prayer to God, going apart by ourselves, and in secret, no one seeing us; putting aside also our worldly cares, that the mind may be raised up to the height of divine contemplation and this we have marked in the fact, act, that Jesus went into a mountain apart to pray.
But mark the great carefulness of the. Evangelist. He not only says that the holy Apostles were chosen, but he enumerates them by name, that no one should dare to insert any others in the catalogue; Simon, whom he also called Peter, and Andrew his brother.
But if we may learn the interpretation of the Apostles' names, know that Peter means, &#8220;loosening or knowing;&#8221; Andrew &#8220;glorious power,&#8221; or &#8220;answering;&#8221; James, &#8220;apostleof grief;&#8221; John, &#8220;the grace of the Lord;&#8221; Matthew, &#8220;given;&#8221; Philip, &#8220;large mouth,&#8221; or the&#8220;orifice of a torch;&#8221; Bartholomew, &#8220;the son of him who lets down water;&#8221; Thomas, &#8220;deep or twill;&#8221; James the son of Alphaeus, &#8220;supplanter of the step of life;&#8221; Judas, &#8220;confession;&#8221;Simon, &#8220;obedience.&#8221;.
