Jesus rebuked them, therefore, for asking so foolishly, “Isn’t this Joseph’s son?” Keeping to the goal of his teaching, he says, “Truly, I tell you, that no prophet is acceptable in his country.” As I have mentioned, certain Jews affirmed that the prophecies relating to Christ had been fulfilled in the holy prophets or in certain of their own more distinguished men. For their good, he draws them away from such a supposition. He said that Elijah had been sent to a single widow and that the prophet Elisha had healed but one leper, Naaman the Syrian. By these he refers to the church of the heathen, who were about to accept him and be healed of their leprosy, by reason of Israel’s remaining impenitent.
