Or to show that men being as nought, (as regards human nature, and the proneness of our minds to fall,) it is not meet that they should wish to be above their brethren. Therefore passing by all the others, He comes to Peter, who was the chief of them, saying, But I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not.

Marvel then at the superabundance of the Divine forbearance: lest He should cause a disciple to despair, before the crime was committed, He granted pardon, and again restored him to his Apostolic rank, saying, Strengthen thy brethren.

Admire the beautiful skill of the passage and the surpassing greatness of the divine gentleness! He fears that Peter's impending fall would lead the disciple to desperation, as though he would be expelled from the glories of the apostleship. Peter's former following of Christ would then lose its reward, because of his inability to bear the fear of death and his denying him. Christ therefore immediately fills him with good hope. He grants him the confident assurance that he will be counted worthy of the promised blessings and gather the fruits of faithfulness. He says, "When you are converted, strengthen your brothers." O what great and incomparable kindness! The affliction of faithlessness had not yet made the disciple ill, and already he has received the medicine of forgiveness.
