What then is the distinction between the law and the grace that comes through the Savior?… The law condemned the world (for God through [the law] “concluded all under sin,” as Paul says) and showed us subject to punishment. But the Savior rather sets the world free, for he came “not to judge the world but to save the world.” And the law too used to give grace to people, calling them to the knowledge of God and drawing away from the worship of idols those who had been led astray. It also pointed out evil and taught good, if not perfectly, yet in the manner of a teacher and usefully. But the truth and grace that are through the Only Begotten do not introduce to us the good that is in types or to limited things that are only profitable as in shadow. Rather, in glorious and most pure ordinances, it leads us by the hand to an ever more perfect knowledge of the faith. And the law used to give the “spirit of bondage to fear,” but Christ gives the spirit of adoption to liberty. The law likewise brings in the circumcision in the flesh, which is nothing (for “circumcision is nothing”22). But our Lord Jesus Christ is the giver of circumcision “in the spirit and heart.” The law baptizes the defiled with mere water; the Savior baptizes “with the Holy Spirit and with fire.” The law brings in the tabernacle for a “figure of the true”; the Savior bears up to heaven itself and brings to the truer “tabernacle, which the Lord set up and not man [humankind].” There are plenty of other proofs besides, but we must respect our limits.But we will say this for profit and need. The blessed Paul in few words solved the question, saying of the law and of the Savior’s grace, “For if there was splendor in the dispensation of condemnation, the dispensation of righteousness must far exceed it in splendor.” For he says that the commandment by Moses is “the ministration of condemnation,” but the grace through the Savior he calls “the ministration of righteousness,” which he says surpasses in glory. And so he most perfectly examines the nature of things like a child with the Spirit. Since then the law, which condemns, “was given by Moses,” the grace that justifies came by the Only Begotten. If this is true, he says, how can it be otherwise than that [Jesus] is superior in glory through whom the better things were ordained?
