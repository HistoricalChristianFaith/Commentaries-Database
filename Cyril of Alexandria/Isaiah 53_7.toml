For the spiritually dead and unholy Caiaphas asked him, “I put you under oath to the living God to tell us if you are the Chist, the Son of God.” And he answered him right away, saying, “From now on you will see the Son of man seated at the right hand of power and coming on the clouds of heaven.” And then Pilate asked him whether he was king of Israel, and Christ replied, “You say so.” Pilate was complacent with the madness of the Jews and had Jesus beaten, and he ordered his soldiers to put him between two thieves in his suffering of death on the cross. So what the prophet said was true: “Because of his affliction he did not open his mouth.” But he suffered a myriad of afflictions from the time of his arrest onwards, suffered insolence and spitting and the beatings of mindless underlings and other things beside these that could be wickedly arranged, before he was brought to Pilate.
