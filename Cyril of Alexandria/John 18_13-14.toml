They bring Jesus to Annas, who was the father-in-law of Caiaphas. From this we may conclude that he was the prime mover and planner of the iniquity against Christ.… Jesus is, therefore, taken away to him first of all.… Having been captured by the malice of Annas and the services of his hirelings and ensnared within the net, Jesus was then led to the one who encompassed and instigated the slaughter of the innocent. This was Caiaphas, and he was adorned with the office of the priesthood.… This miserable man committed the most impious act ever committed. For what can be worse than impiety against Christ?
