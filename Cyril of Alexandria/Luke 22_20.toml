By uniting flesh that was subject to death to himself, the Word being God and life drove corruption away from it. Christ also made it to be the source of life. The body of him who is the life must be this.Do not doubt what I have said but rather accept the word in faith, having gathered proofs from a few examples. When you place a piece of bread into wine, oil, or any other liquid, you find that it becomes charged with the quality of that particular thing. When iron is brought into contact with fire, it becomes full of its activity. While it is by nature iron, it exerts the power of fire. The life-giving Word of God, having united himself to his own flesh in a way known to himself, likewise endowed it with the power of giving life.… When we eat the holy flesh of Christ, the Savior of us all, and drink his precious blood, we have life in us. We are made one with him, abide in him, and possess him in us.

It was suitable for him to be in us divinely by the Holy Spirit. It was also suitable for him to be mingled with our bodies by his holy flesh and precious blood, which we possess as a life-giving Eucharist, in the form of bread and wine. God feared that seeing actual flesh and blood placed on the holy tables of our churches would terrify us. Humbling himself to our infirmities, God infuses into the things set before us the power of life. He transforms them into the effectiveness of his flesh, that we may have them for a life-giving participation, that the body of life thus might be found in us as a life-producing seed. Do not doubt that this is true. Christ plainly says, “This is my body. This is my blood.” In faith, receive the Savior’s word. Since he is the truth, he cannot lie. You will honor him. The wise John says, “He that receives his witness has set his seal that God is true. For he whom God sent speaks the words of God.” The words of God, of course, are true. In no way whatsoever can they be false. Although we cannot understand how God does that, yet he himself knows the way of his works.
