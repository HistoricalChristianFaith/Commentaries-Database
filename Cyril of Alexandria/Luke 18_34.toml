The Savior of all then declared these things beforehand to the holy apostles. It says, "They did not understand what was said, and the word was hid from them." They did not then know accurately what the holy prophets proclaimed. Although [Peter] who was first among the disciples heard the Savior once say that he should be crucified, die and arise, he did not yet understand the depth of the mystery. He resisted, saying: "Far be that from you, Lord. This will not happen to you." He was rebuked for speaking this because he did not know the meaning of the relevant Scripture inspired by God. When Christ arose from the dead, he opened their eyes, as another of the holy Evangelists wrote. They were enlightened, being enriched with the abundant participation of the Spirit.
