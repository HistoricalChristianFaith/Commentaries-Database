“I will place you as a carbon stone.” It is fitting to want to signify Jesus through this stone that was set, the Scriptures say, as the foundation of Zion. If anyone trusts in this foundation, he will not be ashamed. He calls him a foundation stone among them. And he is also mentioned by the holy prophets. For he says through the voice of Amos, “Look, I am setting a diamond in the middle of my people Israel.” And through the voice of Zechariah, “Behold, I will bring my servant the sunrise.” “I have placed a stone before the face of Jesus; on the one stone there are seven eyes.” For the all-seeing one is Christ who is able to survey all things everywhere. For the carbon is placed to be a stone and a fixed foundation of the holy city. On it are the stones of sapphire, which perhaps signify the ranks of the apostles who are set. For they were very close to Christ, and when they followed him they became foundations in the earthly realm.
