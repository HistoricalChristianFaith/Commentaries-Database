You see the skillfulness of the question. He did not at once say, "Who do you say that I am?" He refers to the rumor of those that were outside their company. Then, having rejected it and shown it unsound, he might bring them back to the true opinion. It happened that way. When the disciples had said, "Some, John the Baptist, and others, Elijah, and others, that some prophet of those in old time has risen up," he said to them, "But you, who do you say that I am?" Oh! how full of meaning is that word you! He separates them from all others, that they may also avoid the opinions of others. In this way, they will not conceive an unworthy idea about him or entertain confused and wavering thoughts. Then they will not also imagine that John had risen again, or one of the prophets. "You," he says, "who have been chosen," who by my decree have been called to the apostleship, who are the witnesses of my miracles. Who do you say that I am?"
