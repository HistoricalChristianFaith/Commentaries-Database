Is it not perhaps superfluous and extremely dangerous to have to inquire into what is beyond our logical capacities and exceeds our intelligence? How can what God works, mysteriously, be clear to us? Moreover, what eye of the heart can be so acute as to be able to gaze on God? And, indeed, who could understand things that are far superior to us, even if someone were to speak about and explain them? In fact, our Lord Jesus Christ once spoke to Nicodemus of spiritual rebirth, saying, “Truly, truly I say to you, if a person is not born again, he cannot enter the kingdom of God,” etc. But because he understood nothing, in the end Christ, revealing the coarseness of human intelligence and how far it is below the subtlety of certain concepts, says, “If you do not believe when I spoke to you of earthly things, how will you believe if I speak to you of heavenly things?” Then he adds, “Truly, truly I say to you: we speak of what we know and testify to what we have seen, but no one accepts our testimony.” As you can see, what is above us remains inscrutable. If it is true, as it is written, that “only with difficulty do we know the things at hand,” should we not think, without making further inquiries or vain research, that faith is indispensable for everything that surpasses our logical capacities? In this area, the most splendid ornament is prudence.
