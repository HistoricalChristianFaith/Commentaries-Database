It was not otherwise possible for man, being of a perishable nature, to escape death, unless he recovered that ancient grace, and partook once more of God who holds all things together in being and preserves them in life through the Son in The Spirit. Therefore His Only-Begotten Word has become a partaker of flesh and blood (Heb 2.14), that is, he has become man, though being Life by nature.., so that, having united himself with the flesh which perishes according to the law of its own nature... He might restore it to His own life and render it though himself a partaker of God the Father... And He wears our nature, refashioning it to his own Life. - "Commentary on John 14:20"
