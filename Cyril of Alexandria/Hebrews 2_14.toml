It was not otherwise possible for man, being of a perishable nature, to escape death, unless he recovered that ancient grace, and partook once more of God who holds all things together in being and preserves them in life through the Son in The Spirit. Therefore His Only-Begotten Word has become a partaker of flesh and blood (Heb 2.14), that is, he has become man, though being Life by nature.., so that, having united himself with the flesh which perishes according to the law of its own nature... He might restore it to His own life and render it though himself a partaker of God the Father... And He wears our nature, refashioning it to his own Life. - "Commentary on John 14:20"

For existing essentially as life, the only begotten Word of God united himself to earthy and mortal flesh in order that death, which was pursuing it like some wild beast, might thereafter relax its hold … Indeed, if the only begotten Word of God did not become human, but rather united to himself the external form [prosōpon] of a man, as is the opinion of those who define the union only by good pleasure and by an inclination of will, how would he be likened to “his brethren in all respects”?… How would he have “shared in blood and flesh” unless these had become his own as they are ours?

We say that he partook of blood and flesh in accordance with the meaning established by the interpreters of God. By “he” we do not mean the one who was in flesh and blood by his own nature and could not exist otherwise, but rather the one who never existed in this way and was of a nature different from ours.… For the Word became flesh, only not sinful flesh.… He was God and human at the same time.

Therefore, the one Lord Jesus Christ must not be divided into two sons. The correct expression of the faith is not assisted by taking this line, even when some allege that there is a union of persons, for Scripture says not that the Logos united to himself the person of the human being but that he became flesh. And for the Logos to become flesh is nothing other than for him to “share flesh and blood as we do,” to make his own a body from among us, and to be born of a woman as a human being. He did not depart from his divine status or cease to be born of the Father; he continued to be what he was, even in taking on flesh. This is what the correct teaching of the faith everywhere proclaims. And this is how we shall find the holy fathers conceived things. Accordingly, they boldly called the Virgin “God’s mother” (Theotokos) not because the nature of the Logos or the deity took the start of its existence in the holy Virgin, but because the holy body which was born of her possessed a rational soul to which the Logos was hypostatically united and was said to have had a fleshly birth.
