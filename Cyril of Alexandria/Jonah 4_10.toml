Notice in fact, how He presents Jonah being distressed not at an appropriate time nor when it was called for, despite being obliged like a saint to applaud and praise the Lord for his goodness. If you took it personally, he says, or rather were brought to the extremes of distress because your pumpkin plant withered, which grew up in a single night and perished likewise, how for my part should I not take account of the great city.
