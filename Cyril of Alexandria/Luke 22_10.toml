Someone may ask, "Why did Christ not plainly mention the man to those whom he sent? He did not say, 'When you go to such and such a person, whoever it might be, there prepare the Pascha for us at his house.' " He simply gave them a sign: a man bearing a pitcher of water. What do we reply to this? Look, Judas the traitor had already promised the Jews to deliver Christ to them. Judas continued in his company to watch for a good opportunity. While still making profession of the love that was the duty of a disciple, he had admitted Satan into his heart and was travailing with the crime of murder against our common Savior Christ. Jesus gives a sign to prevent Judas from learning who the man was and running to tell those who had hired him. "There will meet you," he says, "a man carrying a pitcher of water."
