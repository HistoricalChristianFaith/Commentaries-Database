Now that disciple was known unto the high priest, and entered in with Jesus into the court of the high priest.

The Apostle shows great forethought in condescending to mention this fact, and does not scruple to enter into detail where it is profitable for us. For, as he was about to set down in order in his book what was done and said in the palace of the high priest, he was, as it were, compelled to show us how he was able to enter there with Christ; for, he says, he was known unto the high priest. He enters, therefore, without hindrance, his knowledge of the leader of the people----for he has not thought proper to say friendship----allowing him free entrance within the doors. In order, then, that he might convince us that he did not compile his account of what took place in the palace from information drawn from others, but that he himself saw and heard what passed, he has given us this most useful explanation of his knowledge of the high priest.

While the other disciples, it seems, were panic-stricken and fled from the present wrath of the murderers, Peter (who was always moved by a more fervent passion) clings to his love for Christ and follows him at the peril of his own life, as he watched the chain of events unfold. The other disciple accompanying him (and with similar courage) sustained a similar resolution. This was John, the truly pious writer of this divine work. For he calls himself that other disciple without giving himself a definite name. He did not want to seem boastful, and he abhorred the appearance of being better than the rest. For the crowning achievements of virtue, if shown by any of the righteous, are never trumpeted to the world by their own mouth. For it very ill becomes someone to win praise out of his own mouth rather than the conversation of other people.
