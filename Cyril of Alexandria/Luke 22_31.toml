To humble our tendency for pride and to repress ambitious feelings, Christ shows that even he who seemed to be great is nothing and infirm. He therefore passes by the other disciples and turns to him who is the foremost and sat at the head of the company. He says, "Satan has many times desired to sift you as wheat, that is, to search and try you and expose you to intolerable blows." Satan usually attacks people who are above average. Like some fierce and arrogant barbarian, Satan challenges to one-to-one combat those of high reputation in the ways of piety. He challenged Job, but his patience defeated him. The boaster fell. The endurance of that triumphant hero conquered him. Satan preys on human nature, because it is infirm and easy to overcome. He is harsh, pitiless and unappeasable in heart. As the sacred Scripture says of him, "His heart is hard as a stone, and he stands like an anvil that cannot be beaten out." Christ's might, however, places him under the feet of the saints. He has said, "Behold, I have given you to tread on serpents and scorpions and upon all the power of the enemy, and nothing shall hurt you."
