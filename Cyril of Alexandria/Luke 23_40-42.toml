“This man,” he says, “has done nothing that is hateful.” O how beautiful is this confession! How wise the reasoning and how excellent the thoughts! He became the confessor of the Savior’s glory and the accuser of the pride of those who crucified him.…Let us look at his most beautiful confession of faith. He says, “Jesus, remember me when you come in your kingdom.” You see him crucified and call him a king. You expect the One who bears scorn and suffering to come in godlike glory. You see him surrounded by a Jewish crowd, the wicked gang of the Pharisees, and Pilate’s band of soldiers. All of these were mocking him, and no one confessed him.
