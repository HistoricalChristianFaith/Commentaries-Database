And do you, whose lot is the unquenchable fire, promise to the  Lord of all that which is His own? Did you think to have Him for your worshiper, from dread of whom the whole creation trembles? .
But how comes ;it that the Son (if as the heretics say a created being) is worshipped? What charge can be brought against those who served the creature and not the Creator, if the Son(according to them a created being) we are to worship as God? .
This command touched him to the quick; for before Christ's coming he was every where worshipped. But the law of God casting him down from his usurped dominion, establishes the worship of Him alone who is really God.
