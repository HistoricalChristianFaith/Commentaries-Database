The Savior therefore drives away from the holy apostles the affliction of pride. They might perhaps think among themselves and even say, “What will be the reward of faithfulness? What advantage shall we, who have waited on Christ, receive when temptations happen from time to time?” Confirmed by the hope of the blessings that are in store, they throw away from their minds all laziness in virtuous pursuits. They rather choose with an eager mind to follow him and take pleasure in labor for his sake. They also count the doing it a cause of gain, the pathway of joy, and the means of eternal glory. Commentary on Luke, Homily

By means of the things of our present life He describes spiritual things. For they exercise a high privilege with earthly kings, who sit at their table as guests. So then by man's estimation He shows who shall be rewarded by Him with the greatest honors.
