They were unworthy to learn the truth and to see the pathway that leads directly to every good work. Christ answered them, "Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things." The Jews therefore did not know the truth, and they were not taught of God, that is, of Christ. Christ reveals that knowledge to us who have believed in him. We, receiving in mind and heart his divine and adorable mystery, or rather the knowledge of it, and being careful to fulfill those things which are pleasing to him, shall reign with him.
