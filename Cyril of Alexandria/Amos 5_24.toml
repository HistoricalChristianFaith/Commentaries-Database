Namely the righteous verdict against you-will be like an impassable torrent, that is, dragging away what falls into it and sparing nothing, since torrents descend from the mountains with a rush. This is also the way with the divine verdict: if it is delivered against some people, it will be nothing other than invincible water and an irresistible torrent.
