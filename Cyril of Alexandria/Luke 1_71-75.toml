Christ is mercy and justice. We have obtained mercy through him and been justified, having washed away the stains of wickedness through faith that is in him.

No one should swear just because God swore to Abraham. For just as God’s anger is not anger, nor does anger imply passion but signifies power exercised in punishment or some similar motion. So neither is an oath an act of swearing. For God does not swear but indicates the certainty of the event—so that which he says will necessarily come to pass. For God’s oath is his own word, fully persuading those that hear and giving each one the conviction that what he has promised and said will certainly come to pass.
