"There was in the synagogue a woman who for eighteen years was bowed down by infirmity." Her case may prove to be of great benefit to those who have understanding. We must gather what is to our advantage from every quarter. By what happened to her, we may see that Satan often receives authority over certain persons who fall into sin and have grown lax in their efforts toward piety. Whomever he gets into his power, he may involve in bodily diseases since he delights in punishment and is merciless.… The accursed Satan is the cause of disease to the human bodies, just we affirm that Adam's transgression was his doing, and by means of it our bodily frames have become liable to infirmity and decay.
