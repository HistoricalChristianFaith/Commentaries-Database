We should think that the use of gold denotes spiritual union, which is precious and divine. For, to demonstrate the union of God and humankind, the ark in the desert was also covered within and without by gold. The purple signifies that number of persons who are called to the kingdom. And when someone believes, at that moment Christ is received in the heart, who is a precious pearl. For it says that he made a litter for himself from the daughters of Jerusalem on account of love alone: “For God so loved the world that he sent his only-begotten Son, that all who believe in him would not perish but have eternal life.” - "Fragments in the Commentary on the Song of Songs 3.10"

The church forged from the Gentiles says this: “Go forth and see.” But what it calls the day of his wedding is the day of his passion, when he married the church by his blood. - "Fragments in the Commentary on the Song of Songs 3.11"
