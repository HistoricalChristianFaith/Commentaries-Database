Whoever therefore is guided by good sense, does not look at the sins of others, does not busy himself about the faults of his neighbor, but closely reviews his own misdoings. Such was the blessed psalmist, falling down before God and saying on account of his own offenses, "If you, Lord, closely regard iniquities, who can endure?" Once again, putting forward the infirmity of human nature as an excuse, he prays for a reasonable pardon, saying, "Remember that we are dirt."
