A most base pest, my beloved, is double dealing and hypocrisy in our actions and conduct, by which a person uses the pretense of pleasant-spoken words and of a tongue anointed, so to speak, with the honey of deception, while the heart is full of utter bitterness. Of such we say, in the words of one of the holy prophets, “Their tongue is a piercing arrow; the words of their mouth are deceitful. He speaks peacefully to his neighbor, and enmity is in his heart.” And again, “Their words are smoother than oil, yet are they arrows.” By which is meant that they have the force of darts falling violently and shot forth from bows.

Matthew says that when the traitor drew near to Christ, our common Savior, he kissed him and added, “Hail, Master.” How can you say “Hail” to him who by means of your word and deed is made the prey of death? How could such a word possibly be true? We thus see that, inasmuch as that false one, Satan, was within him, he used falsehood even in saying “Hail.” Because of deeds like this, the prophet says, “Their tongue is a piercing spearhead. The words of their mouth are deceitful. To his neighbor he speaks things of peace, but in his soul there is enmity.”
