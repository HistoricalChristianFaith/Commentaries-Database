That which has been spoken possesses an interpretation that comes through the vision of faith. For when “the fullness of the nations come in” and they believe in Christ, then the Jews who believe after these things see the beauty of the divine nature of Christ. They behold the Father in the Son and declare him to be the Redeemer proclaimed through the prophets, whom the prophets previously mentioned as coming in the name of the Lord. For the other prophets did not come in the name of the Lord. For they were saying, “The Lord says these things” and “I am the servant of the Lord, and I worship the God of heaven.”
