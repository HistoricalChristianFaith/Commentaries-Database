The Savior … was speaking of the last day, that is, the end of this world.… Strengthening them to recall the last day and the end time, he commands them to disregard all earthly and temporary matters and look only to one end, the duty of everyone saving his soul. He says, "He that is on the housetop, do not let him go down to the house to carry away his goods." In these words, he apparently means the one who is at ease, living in wealth and worldly glory. Those that stand on the housetops are always conspicuous in the eyes of those who are around the house.

He says, "Even if anyone is in the field, in the same way, do not let him turn back." That means if anyone is found devoted to work and occupied in labor, earnestly desiring spiritual fruitfulness and gathering the wages of virtuous toil, let him hold firmly to this diligence. Let him not turn back. As Christ himself has again said somewhere, "No one that puts his hand to the plough and turns back is fit also for the kingdom of heaven."
