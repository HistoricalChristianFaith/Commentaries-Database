Those who look toward the Savior do not attribute grace for salvation to other gods but to him. For it is said about him that he was moved by love, that is, he was most loving and kind to them in that he was prepared to go all the way to the very end, to the uprooting of the seed of the Chaldeans, that is, those who fought against them and perpetrated all sorts of inhuman acts.… I am spurred by love for you that I will do what is your pleasure in the land of the Babylonians, so that the seed of the Chaldeans will be removed. For [Isaiah] speaks here about Cyrus. - "Commentary on Isaiah 4.3.48.15–16"
