“Behold, he comes leaping upon the mountains and jumping across the hills.” … Some things imply that the bridegroom is already present, whereas other things suggest that the bridegroom is being sought by the bride. For we too investigate some problems for which we do not know the solution and some problems, when the bridegroom and Word enlightens our hearts, which we find already solved. Then, in other matters, we doubt again and it is revealed to us anew. This will happen often until we possess the bridegroom fully, when he not only comes to us but also remains within us.… “He comes leaping upon the mountains.” He also comes trampling upon the nets cast by the evil demon, breaking them that we too might trample on them contemptuously.
