And this too needs to be added by way of explanation, that the allotment of the tribes of Zebulun and Naphtali extended to the Gentile city of Sidon. The Jews dwell there interspersed among the Gentiles to this day. Now “Zebulun” may be interpreted as a sweet smell and blessing, while “Naphtali” is a sprouted stump, that is to say, a spreading plant. And such things have believers in Christ become. Those who formerly were in Galilee, when they went forth like fragrance, became worthy of divine blessing and were extended into every good thing. Now “Galilee” is interpreted under the metaphor of “circular,” so those believers from Galilee are like wheels rolling against the pits of destruction.

If anyone asks what is the difference between “disease” and “infirmity,” our answer is that an infirmity is a temporary indisposition of the body, whereas disease denotes an abiding disequilibrium of the body’s elements.
