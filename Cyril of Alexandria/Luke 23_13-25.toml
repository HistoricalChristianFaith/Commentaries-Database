They brought the holy and just One to Pilate. They spoke violent and unrestrained words against him and poured out falsely invented accusations. They persisted in the ferocity with which they accused him. Pilate then ruled that it should be as they desired, although he had publicly said, “I find no wickedness in this man.” It says, “They cried out, ‘Away with him, crucify him!’ ” The Lord had rebuked this unmerciful and unlawful cry by the voice of the prophet Isaiah. It is written, “The vineyard of the Lord of hosts is the house of Israel, and the men of Judah are his pleasant planting; and he looked for justice, but behold, bloodshed; for righteousness, but behold, a cry!” In another place, he said of them, “Woe to them, for they have strayed from me! Destruction to them, for they have rebelled against me! I would redeem them, but they speak lies against me.” It is written again, “Their princes shall fall by the sword, because of the rudeness of their tongue.”
