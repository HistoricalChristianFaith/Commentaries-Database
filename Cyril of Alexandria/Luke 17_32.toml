It is our duty to maintain our religious exertions without wavering and to persevere in them with undaunted wills or else we may suffer the kind of fate that befell the woman at Sodom. We take her as an example because he says, "Remember Lot's wife. For when she was rescued from Sodom, but would afterward have returned, she became a pillar of salt." That means she became foolish and stonelike.
