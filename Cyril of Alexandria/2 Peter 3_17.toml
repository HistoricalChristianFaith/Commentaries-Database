Peter has to warn his people so that they will not be deceived. Our Lord Jesus Christ himself warned us for our safety, that we should “beware of those who come to us in sheep’s clothing, but inside they are ravenous wolves.” And again: “Take care that you are not deceived. For many shall come in my name, saying, I am the Christ, and they will deceive many.” And Paul cries: “Beware of dogs, beware of evil workers claiming to believe in the Lord Jesus.” For those who deform the truth by their doctrines of ungodliness and works of evil are like those who killed the prophets and apostles. Indeed, they are worse, because they have killed not only the living but those who have been saved as well.
