He adds that he was one of the Twelve. This also is a matter of great importance to demonstrate more fully the guilt of the traitor’s crime. The Lord equally honored him with the rest and decorated him with apostolic dignities. Christ admitted him, chosen and beloved, to the holy table and the highest honors, but this became the pathway and the means for the murderers of Christ. What dirge can be sufficient for him, or what floods of tears must not each shed from his eyes when he considers from what happiness that wretched being fell into such total misery! For a worthless cent, he stopped being with Christ and lost his hope toward God. He lost the honor, crowns, life and glory prepared for Christ’s true followers, and the right of reigning with the Lord. Commentary on Luke, Homily

He says, he that was called Judas, holding his name asit were in abhorrence; but adds, one of the twelve, to signify the enormity of the traitor. Forhe who bad been honored as an apostle became the cause of the murder of Christ.
Unmindful of the glory of Christ, he thought to be able to act secretly, daring to make an especial token of love the instrument of his treachery.
Whereby He does not blame the chiefs of the Jews that they had not sooner prepared their murderous designs against Him, but convicts them of having presumptuously supposed they had attacked Him against His will; as if He says, &#8220;You did not take Me then, because I willed it not, but neither could you now, did I not of My own accord surrender Myself into your hands.&#8221; Hence it follows, But this is your hour, that is, a short time is permitted you to exercise your vengeance against Me, but the Father's will agrees with Mine. He also says, that this power is given to darkness, i.e. the Devil and the Jews, of rising in rebellion against Christ. And shell is added, And the power of darkness.
