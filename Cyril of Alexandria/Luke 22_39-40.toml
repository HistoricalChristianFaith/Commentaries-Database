The Savior stayed in Jerusalem during the day, evidently teaching the Israelites and revealing to them the way of the kingdom of heaven. When the evening came, he continued with the holy disciples on the Mount of Olives at a spot called Gethsemane. The wise evangelist Matthew tells us this.…“Taking with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, he began to be sorrowful and troubled. Then he said to them, ‘My soul is very sorrowful, even to death.’ ” Going forward a little, Christ knelt and prayed, saying, “Father, if you will, put this cup away from me, but not my will but yours be done.” Please see here the depths of the appointed time in the flesh and the height of that unspeakable wisdom. Focus the penetrating eye of the mind on it. If you can see the beautiful art of the mystery, you also will say, “Oh, the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and the knowledge of God! His judgments are unsearchable, and his ways past finding out.”
