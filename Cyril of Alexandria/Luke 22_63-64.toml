"Now the men who were holding Jesus mocked him and beat him; they also blindfolded him and asked him, 'Prophesy! Who is it that struck you?' " "When he was reviled, he did not revile in return; when he suffered, he did not threaten; but he trusted to him who judges justly." We should say what the holy prophets said about certain men, "Be appalled, O heavens, at this, be shocked, be utterly desolate, says the Lord." He is the Lord of earth and heaven, the Creator and Architect of all, the King of kings and Lord of lords. He is of surpassing greatness in glory and majesty, the foundation of everything, and that in which all things exist and remain. All things exist in him. He is the breath of all the holy spirits in heaven. This One is despised as one of us, patiently endures beatings, and submits to the ridicule of the wicked. He offers himself to us as a perfect pattern of patience. He rather reveals the incomparable greatness of his godlike gentleness.

Perhaps even Christ endures this to rebuke our minds' weakness and to show that human things fall as far below the divine excellencies as our nature is inferior to his. We of earth, mere corruption and ashes, immediately attack those who would disturb us, as we have a heart full of fierceness like savage beasts. He, who in nature and glory transcends the limits of our understanding and our powers of speech, patiently endured those officers when they not only mocked but also hit him. It says, "Now the men who were holding Jesus mocked him and beat him; they also blindfolded him and asked him, 'Prophesy! Who is it that struck you?' " They ridicule, as if he were some ignorant person, him who is the giver of all knowledge and even sees what is hidden within us. He has somewhere said by one of the holy prophets, "Who is this that darkens counsel by words without knowledge?" He who tries hearts and minds and is the giver of all prophecy, how could he not know who hit him? As Christ said, "Darkness has blinded their eyes, and their minds are blinded." One may say of them, "Woe to them that are drunk, but not with wine! Their vine is of the vine of Sodom and of Gomorrah."
