There is truth in the saying of Wisdom: “The Spirit of the Lord fills the universe,” and “An attentive ear hears all things.” To those, then, who foolishly, even godlessly, think that their words remain hidden to the divine mind, the psalmist says somewhere, “Understand, you senseless among the people. Fools, when will you become wise? Does he who made the ear not hear?” How is it possible that he who gave hearing to his creatures would not hear everything? And from this you understand, yet again, that the Lord is God by nature. He was not unaware of what the Jews murmured secretly among the crowd. Rather, as befits God, he heard it, even though they did not speak openly of him, for fear of their leaders.
