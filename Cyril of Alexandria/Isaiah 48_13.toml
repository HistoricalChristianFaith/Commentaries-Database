Now the hand and the right arm is what God the Father calls his Son. And we often find him so called throughout Scripture. The divine Moses said, “Your right hand has been glorified in might, your right hand has shattered the enemies,” and David the blessed said, “May your hand be strengthened, may your right arm be lifted up.”
