He says, “I AM your God.” This “I AM” means “I am the beginning.” He explained all this to the all-wise Moses saying “I am the one who is.” For he as Lord is truly the God of everything. Those things that are brought into being by him are said to be “beings” also and to share in the source of being.… Again he works in them a steadfast thinking and a well-established mind that they can see God to be truly existing in nature. To these he reveals his glory so that they are not carried away by deceitful voices.
