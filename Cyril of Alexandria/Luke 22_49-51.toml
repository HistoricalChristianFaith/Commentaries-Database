The blessed disciples, wounded with the prodding of divine love, drew their swords to repel the attack. Christ would not permit this, but he rebuked Peter, saying, “Put your sword into its sheath; for all who have taken swords shall die by swords.” In this, he gave us a pattern of the way in which we must hold on by our love for him and of the extent to which the burning zeal of our piety may proceed. He does not want us to use swords to resist our enemies. He would rather have us use love and prudence.… The Savior moderates the unmeasured heat of the holy apostles. By preventing the example of such an act, he declares that those who are the leaders in his religion have no need in any way whatsoever of swords. With divine dignity, Christ healed him who received the blow and gave this godlike sign for their condemnation to those who came to seize him.
