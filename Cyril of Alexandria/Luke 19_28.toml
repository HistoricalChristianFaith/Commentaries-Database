As long as it was fitting that he should travel the country of the Jews trying to win by lessons and admonitions superior to the law many to the grace that is by faith, he did not cease to do so. The time was now calling Christ to the passion for the salvation of the whole world. He therefore goes up to Jerusalem to free the inhabitants of the earth from the tyranny of the enemy, to abolish death, and to destroy the sin of the world. First, he points out to the Israelites by a plain fact, that a new people from among the heathen shall be subject to him, while they themselves are rejected as the murderers of the Lord.
