People of true and good sense, who have intellectually gathered that knowledge that gives life, are never jaded by the sacred sciences. Indeed it is written that “humankind shall not live by bread alone but by every word that comes from the mouth of God.” The word of God is food for the mind and a spiritual “bread that strengthens the heart of humankind,” as the book of Psalms sings.
