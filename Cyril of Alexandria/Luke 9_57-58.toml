(non occ.) Although the Almighty Lord is bountiful, He does not grant to every one absolutely and indiscriminately heavenly and divine gifts, but to those only who are worthy to receive them, who free themselves and their souls from the stains of wickedness. And this we are taught by the force of the angelic words, And it came to pass, that, us they went in the way, a certain man said unto him, Lord, I will follow thee. First indeed there is much tardiness implied in the manner of his coming. It is next shown that he is filled with too great presumption. For he sought not to follow Christ simply as several others of the people, but rather caught at the honour of the Apostleship. Whereas Paul says, No one taketh the honour to himself but he that is called of God. (Heb. 5:4.)

In another respect also our Lord deservedly gives him a refusal, for He taught that to follow the Lord, a man must take up his cross, and renounce the affection of this present life. And our Lord finding this lacking in him does not blame him, but corrects him.
It follows, And Jesus says to him, The foxes have holes, &c.

Now under a mystical signification He applies the name of foxes and birds of the air to the wicked and crafty powers of evil spirits. As if He said, Since foxes and birds of the air have their abode in thee, how shall Christ rest in thee? What fellowship has light with darkness? (2 Cor. 6:14.)

A certain man came near to Christ the Savior of us all, saying, "Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go." Christ rejected the man, saying that the foxes have holes, and the birds of heaven a place to lodge in; but he had no place to lay his head.… It is easy for anyone that will examine such matters accurately to perceive that in the first place there was great ignorance in his manner of coming near. Second, it was full of excessive presumptuousness. His wish was not simply to follow Christ, as so many others of the Jewish multitude did, but rather to thrust himself into apostolic honors. This was the following that he was seeking, being self-called. The blessed Paul writes that no one takes the honor to himself unless he is called of God, as Aaron also was. Aaron did not enter the priesthood through himself, but on the contrary, God called him. We find none of the holy apostles promoted himself to the office of apostle but rather received the honor from Christ. He said, "Come after me, and I will make you to become fishers of men." This man, as I said, boldly took upon himself honorable gifts, and, although no one called him, thrust himself into what was above his rank.

He rebuked him not to reproach him but rather to correct him, so that he might of his own desire grow better and become eager in following the ways of virtue.… The simple meaning of the passage that is at hand follows. The beasts and birds have dens and dwellings, but I have nothing to offer of those things that are the objects of general pursuit. I do not have a place where to dwell, rest and lay my head. Profounder thoughts achieve the inner and secret symbolism of the passage. He seems to mean by the foxes and birds of heaven those wicked, cunning and impure powers, the herds of demons.… We affirm that he did not say this about the material and visible birds. He said this about those impure and wicked spirits that often remove the heavenly seed that fell on the hearts of people and carry it away, so that they may not bring forth any fruit. As long as the foxes and birds have holes and dens in us, how can Christ enter? Where can he rest?
