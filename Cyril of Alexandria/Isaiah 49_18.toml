What, then, is the message promised by the divine words? Namely, the calling and assembling of those who were scattered and a return in the spirit for those who were lost and a way back for those who fled, and a return and a reawakening as well as the reward of love for Christ.… “And I have put them on” says the Lord, “to be the ornament of a bride.” Such is the beautiful order of the churches. For it is customary in the divinely breathed Scriptures to decorate the church with gold and colors.
