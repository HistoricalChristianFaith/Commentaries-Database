Generously he lays his hands on them and in order to crown with many fine gifts those petitioning he says, “Everyone who sees them will recognize that they are a seed blessed by God” and adds, “And they will rejoice in the Lord.” And he immediately gives them joy. Here the person of the church is introduced full of joy as it sounds forth, “May my soul rejoice in the Lord, for he has clothed me in a cloak of salvation and a tunic of rejoicing.” The tunic of rejoicing means our Lord Jesus Christ. … They who have him like a garment gain not only salvation but also happiness and many joys. The Savior says, “The thief only comes to steal, but I have come that they may have life and have it abundantly.” … Christ is, therefore, the tunic that is from heaven and from above, which if anyone takes he or she will be crowned with all beauty (spiritually understood) and with the distinction of good work—like a groom wearing a mitre or as a bride clothed in all beauty. For those in Christ, fortified for the spiritual mastering, are well-equipped and ready for every aspect of virtue. They are like brides on account of their fruitfulness, with the many-splendored beauty that comes from the brilliance of virtues. Thus spoke one of the holy prophets, highlighting those who made straight the well-led life, “For the fear of you, Lord, we have conceived in the womb and labored and brought forth the spirit of salvation that you have given throughout the world.” Thus, the saints are compared with a bridegroom and bride on account of their fortitude and their fertility.… It shows that Christ shines out justice and gladness among the nations, just like flowers garland the earth.… For as the small and growing seed becomes a flower, just so was our Lord Jesus Christ proclaimed before the nations when it says also in the Song of Songs, “I am flower of the field, a lily of the valleys.”
