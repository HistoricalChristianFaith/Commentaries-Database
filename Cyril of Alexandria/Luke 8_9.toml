The word of the Savior, so to speak, is constantly hidden. The blessed psalmist has also brought him before us saying, “I will open my mouth in parables.” See what he spoke in olden times happened. “A large multitude was assembled round him of people from all Judea, and he spoke to them in parables.” Since they were not worthy to learn the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, he wrapped the word for them in darkness…. It was not granted to them to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but rather to us, who are more ready to embrace the faith. He has given us, since he is perfect wisdom, the ability to understand parables and the dark saying, the words of the wise and their riddles. Parables, we may say, are the images not of visible objects but rather spiritual and understandable by the intellect. The parable points out to the eyes of the mind what is impossible to see with the eyes of the body. It beautifully shapes out the subtlety of intellectual things by means of the things of sense and palpable to the touch. Commentary on Luke, Homily
