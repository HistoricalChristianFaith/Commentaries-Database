When at dawn their wicked assembly gathered, they brought into their midst the Lord of Moses and the Sender of the prophets. After illegally mocking him, they asked if he were the Christ. O senseless Pharisee, if you ask because you do not know, surely until you had learned the truth you should not hurt him, or else by chance you may hurt God. If you make pretense of ignorance, while really you know that he is the Christ, you must hear what the sacred Scripture says, "God is not mocked."
