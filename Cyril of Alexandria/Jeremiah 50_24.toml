Now had you been truly desirous of learning, you would have heard from him the things that lead on to eternal life; but as you wickedly tempted him, you will hear nothing more than those commands only that were given to them of old time by Moses. For “what,” said he, “is written in the law? How do you read it?” And on the lawyer’s repeating what is enacted in the law, as if to punish his wickedness and reprove his malicious purpose, Christ, as knowing all things, said, “You have answered rightly; do this, and you shall live.” The lawyer has missed his prey; he has shot wide of the mark, his wickedness is unsuccessful, the sting of envy has ceased, the net of deceit is torn asunder, his sowing bears no fruit, his toil gains no profit; and like some ship that misfortune has overwhelmed, he has suffered a bitter wreck. Let us, therefore, cry out against him in the words of Jeremiah, “You are found and caught, because you have stood up against the Lord.”
