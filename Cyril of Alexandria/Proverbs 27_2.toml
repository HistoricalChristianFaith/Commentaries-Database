No one crowns himself, and that person is justly ridiculed who devises praises for himself, for it is written, “Let your neighbor praise you, and not your own mouth; a stranger, and not your own lips.” Though hypocrites may be able possibly to remain undetected and thus to seize the honors that people bestow, yet God knows your hearts. The judge cannot be deceived.… He knows who steals by fraud the honor which another truly deserves.
