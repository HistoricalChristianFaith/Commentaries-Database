He had previously shown us that judging others is utterly wicked and dangerous. It causes final condemnation. "Do not judge," he said, "and you shall not be judged." Do not condemn, and you shall not be condemned. By conclusive arguments, he persuades us to avoid the very wish of judging others. Deliver yourself first from your great crimes and your rebellious passions, and then you may set him right who is guilty of only minor offenses.
