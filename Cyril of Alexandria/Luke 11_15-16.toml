“But certain of them,” it says, “being scribes and Pharisees,” with hearts intoxicated with pride and envy, found in the miracle fuel for their illness. They did not praise him but even went to the very opposite extreme. Having stripped him of the godlike deeds he did, they assigned to the devil almighty power and made Beelzebub the source of Christ’s strength. They said, “He casts out devils by him.” Others who were afflicted with a similar wickedness ran without discernment into a disgraceful forwardness of speech. Being stung by envy, they required seeing him work a sign from heaven. They called out, as it were, and said, “Even if you have expelled from a man a bitter and malicious demon, that as yet is no such great matter, nor worthy of admiration. What is done up to now is no proof of divine ability.” … Such were their forward fault findings. The fact of their wishing to ask a sign from heaven proves nothing else than that they entertained such thoughts as these concerning him.
