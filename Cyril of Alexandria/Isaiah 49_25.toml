Our Lord Jesus Christ came into the house of the strong man … he raided it and, throwing away the broken chains and the bonds of dark hell, he gave him over to the judgment of the great day to be kept for punishment.… Then Christ has conquered, and he has passed the victory on to us.… For he is the sole cause of our salvation. Therefore, he is the boast of the might of the saints, as Paul the most wise says: “I can do all things through Christ who gives me strength.” …For Christ gave us the ability to overcome the murderous dragon so that we can take spoil from it, and we are saved from it as he sends us the victory to everlasting life for glory, praise and the kingdom of heaven.… For Christ said, “I have given you authority to tread on snakes and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy.” … This is just what we take from the strong one, that is, from Christ. Since he is the Lord of powers, we have been saved and have the victory.…
Whoever suffers anything on account of me obtains help from me, the One who gives strength to you, Jacob, that is, all of you from the seed of Jacob. I have said how he sends them prophetic words in the mouth of the holy apostles and evangelists that they are from Jacob, which clearly relates to the flesh. And it is small wonder that Jacob was called the supplanter, that is, the supplanter of Satan and of those who casually and with youthful neglect rush into the noose of sins.
