Coming to the house of his supplicant, he quiets their funeral songs, silences the musicians, and stops the tears of the weepers, saying, "The girl is not dead but rather sleeps." "And they," it says, "laughed at him." I ask you to observe here the great skill of the management. Although he well knew that the girl was dead, he said, "She is not dead but rather sleeps." What is his reason? By their laughing at him, they might give a clear and manifest acknowledgment that the daughter was dead. There would probably be some of that group who always resist his glory who would reject the divine miracle and say that the damsel was not yet dead. Delivering from sickness was nothing very extraordinary for Christ. To have the acknowledgment of many that the girl was dead, he said that she was rather sleeping. Let no one affirm that Christ spoke falsely. To him, as being life by nature, there is nothing dead. Having a firm hope of the resurrection of the dead, we call the dead "those that sleep" for this reason. They will arise in Christ, and as the blessed Paul says, "They live to him," because they are about to live.
