He then, as was said, announced forgiveness of sins, since he is endowed with a most godlike authority. But the declaration disturbed again the ignorant and envious gang of the Pharisees. They said one to another, “Who is this that speaks blasphemies?” But would you have said this about him, Pharisee, if you had known the divine Scriptures, and borne in mind the words of prophecy, and understood the adorable and mighty mystery of the incarnation? Instead, they now involve him in a charge of blasphemy, bringing against him the uttermost penalty and condemning him to death. The law of Moses commanded that whoever spoke blasphemies against God should be put to death. But no sooner have they arrived at this height of daring, than he immediately shows that he is God, to convict them once more of intolerable impiety, “Why do you question in your hearts?” If you, therefore, Pharisee, say, “Who can forgive sins but God only?” I will also say to you, “Who can know hearts, and see the thoughts hidden in the depth of the understanding, but God only?” For he himself says somewhere by the voice of the prophets, “I, the Lord, search the minds and try the heart.” David also said somewhere concerning both him and us, “He who fashions the hearts of them all.” Therefore he who as God knows both the hearts and minds, as God also forgives sins.
