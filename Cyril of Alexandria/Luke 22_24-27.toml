Soft words are also given them by their subjects, as it follows, And they that exercise authority upon them are called benefactors. Now they truly as alien from the sacred law are subject to these evils, but your preeminence is in humility, as it follows, But ye shall not be so.

“Awake and watch” is one of the holy apostles’ summons to us. The net of sin is spread everywhere, and Satan makes us his prey in different ways. He grabs hold of us by many passions and leads us on to a condemned mind.… The disciples had given in to human weakness and were arguing with one another about who was the leader and superior of the rest. Perhaps those who held the second rank among them were not willing to give way to those who held the first. This happened, and it was recorded for our benefit. What happened to the holy apostles may prove an incentive for humility in us. Christ immediately rebukes the sickness. Like a vigorous physician, he uses an earnest and deep-reaching commandment to cut away the passion that sprang up among them.

In the passage that has just been read, Christ says, “For which is the chief, he that reclines at table, or he that serves? Is it not he that reclines? But I am in the midst of you as he that serves.” When Christ says this, who can be so obstinate and unyielding as not to put away all pride and banish from his mind the love of empty honor? Christ is ministered to by the whole creation of rational and holy beings. He is praised by the seraphim. He is tended by the services of the universe. He is the equal of God the Father in his throne and kingdom. Taking a servant’s place, he washed the holy apostles’ feet. In another way, Jesus holds the post of service, because of the appointed time in the flesh. Blessed Paul witnesses to this. He writes, “I say that Christ was a minister of the circumcision to fulfill the promises of the fathers, and the Gentiles will praise God for mercy.” He who is ministered to became a minister. The Lord of glory made himself poor, leaving us an example, as it is written.

Let us avoid the love of pride and deliver ourselves from the blame attached to the desire for leadership. To act this way makes us like Christ, who submitted to empty himself for our sakes. Arrogance and haughtiness of mind make us plainly resemble the princes of the Gentiles, who always love to act arrogantly. It may even be fitting in their case. “They are called,” he says, “benefactors that are flattered as such by their inferiors.” Let them be like this. They are not within the pale of the sacred laws or obedient to the Lord’s will. They are the victims of these afflictions. It should not be so with us. Let our exaltation rather consist in humility and our glorying in not loving glory. Let our desire be for those things that please God, while we keep in mind what the wise man says to us, “The greater you are, humble yourself the more, and you will find grace before the Lord.” He rejects the proud and counts the boastful as his enemies but crowns with honors the meek and lowly in mind.
