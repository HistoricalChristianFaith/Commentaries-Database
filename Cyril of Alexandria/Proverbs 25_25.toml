Just as “waters are pleasant to the thirsty soul,” as Scripture says, so to the mind that loves instruction is the lifegiving knowledge of the mysteries of our Savior. Let us, therefore, draw from the sacred springs the living and lifegiving waters, even those that are rational and spiritual. Let us take our fill, and weary not in the drinking; for in these things more than enough is still for edification, and greediness is great praise. Commentary on Luke, Homily
