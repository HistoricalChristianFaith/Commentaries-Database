When Christ died according to the flesh, his disciples mourned, but the world rejoiced at his passion. If, however, the mourning of the saints was turned into joy when death and corruption were rendered powerless by Christ our Savior’s resurrection from the dead, then surely in a similar way the joy of the worldly minded was lost in sorrow.
