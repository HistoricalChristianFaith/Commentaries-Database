What hour does he mean as that in which the Pharisees said these things to Jesus? He was occupied in teaching the Jewish multitudes, when someone asked him whether there were many that are saved. He, however, passed by the question as unprofitable and turned to what he saw as a suitable topic, namely, the way by which people must walk to become heirs of the kingdom of heaven. He said, “Strive to enter through the narrow gate,” and told them that if they refuse so to do, they will see Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God, and themselves cast out. He also added that whereas they had been the first, they would be the last at the calling of the heathen. These remarks goaded the mind of the Pharisees to anger. They saw the multitudes already repenting and receiving with eagerness faith in him. They saw that now they needed only a little more instruction to learn his glory and the great and adorable mystery of the incarnation. Likely to lose their office of leaders of the people and already fallen and expelled from their authority over them and deprived of their profits—for they were fond of wealth, and covetous, and given to lucre—they made pretense of loving him, and even drew near, and said, “Get away from here, for Herod wants to kill you.”
