It would be fruitless, Christ says, to consider as obscure something universally known. And how can it be right to set up a pretence of ignorance when something is fully known? This is what Christ seems to us to be saying, with the object of releasing himself from the charges that had been fabricated and maliciously devised against him by the malice of the leaders of the people. But I think, also, that there is a suggestion of another meaning. For he says, “I have spoken openly to the world,” that is to say, the words given to you by the mediation of Moses come in types and shadows and do not teach expressly the will of God but rather create a vision of the actual truth beyond themselves. And, wrapped up in the obscurity of the letter, they do not completely reveal the knowledge of those things that we need. “I have spoken openly to the world.” And, apart from riddles and the shadow of the form of that which is good, I set before you the right way and pointed out the straight path of a life directed toward God without any tortuous turnings. I spoke to the world—not, he says, to the one nation of the Israelites. If the whole world does not yet know me, it will know in due time. “I always taught in the synagogues.” We can scarcely fail to see what he means here. He reminds those of the Jews who were in his presence, I think—however reluctant they were—of the prophecies that spoke about him. For what did the divine Isaiah say, putting the words in Christ’s mouth? “I have not spoken in secret, in a dark place of the earth.” And again: “I have spread out my hands all the day unto a disobedient and rebellious people.” For what else can “not speaking in secret, in a dark place” mean, but teaching openly and speaking in places where there is no small gathering of hearers?
