We also ourselves sometimes; for some live a most excellent and perfect life, another ofttime even in his old ageis converted to God, or perhaps when just about to close his last day, through God's mercy washes away his guilt. But this mercy some men reject from restless timidity of mind, not counting upon the will of our Savior, who rejoices in the salvation of those who are perishing.
