Saying “a certain person” does not reveal a name but indicates any one of the saints. For the Word governs over every saint. The disciples of the Lord are the first he receives—evangelists, apostles foreordained in their souls even in the same way as the Christ. He does not exclude; rather, unbidden, the Holy Spirit dwells within each from the hour of holy baptism. So this “certain man” is the one with the “earthen pot washed with water” as described by Mark and Luke.
