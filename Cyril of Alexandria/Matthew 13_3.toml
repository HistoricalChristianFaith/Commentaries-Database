For this reason Jesus speaks in parables, in order that through them he should show that he is the One who was prophesied. Concerning [him] David said, “I will open my mouth in parables,” and again, “and there will be a man who shall hide his words, and he will be hidden as though carried away by the waves of the sea.”
