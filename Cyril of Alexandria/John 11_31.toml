The Jews therefore who were present, thinking she had run to the tomb to tear herself [in her grief], follow her; doing this by the will of God, in order that they might go in a body to see the marvellous deed, even without wishing to do so. For had this not taken place by the providence of God, the Evangelist would not have mentioned it; neither would he have written down the concurrent causes of each matter, had he not been everywhere very zealous for the truth. Therefore he stated the cause wherefore many ran to the tomb, and were found there, and became beholders of the marvellous deed, and reported it to others.

The Jews who follow Mary are doing the will of God in order that they might go to see the marvelous deed, even without wishing to do so. Had this not taken place by the providence of God, the Evangelist would not have mentioned it, neither would he have written down the reason they followed Mary to Lazarus’s tomb if he had not been continuously zealous for the truth. Thus, he states the reason why many ran to the tomb, and were found there, and became witnesses of the marvelous deed and reported it to others.
