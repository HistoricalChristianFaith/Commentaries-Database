This, therefore, is the upright and most exact faith of the holy Fathers, that is, the confession of faith. But as Paul says, “the god of this world has blinded the minds of unbelievers that they should not see the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ.” Accordingly some, after having ceased to go along the straight road of truth, dash themselves against the rocks, “when they understand neither what they say nor the things about which they make assertions.” For after attributing the glory of the sonship only to the Word begotten of God the Father, they say that another son of the seed of David and Jesse has been conjoined to him and has a share in the filiation and of the glory proper to God and of the very indwelling of the Word and has had almost everything from him but has nothing at all of his own.
