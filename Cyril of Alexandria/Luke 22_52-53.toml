“You have one hour against me.” That is a very short and limited time, between the precious cross and the resurrection from the dead. This also is the power given to darkness. Darkness is the name of Satan, for he is total night and darkness. Blessed Paul says that the God of this world has blinded the minds of those that do not believe, or else, the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ should shine on them. God granted power to Satan and the Jews to rise up against Christ. They, however, dug for themselves the pitfall of destruction. He certainly saved all under heaven by means of his passion and rose the third day, having trampled under foot the empire of death. They brought down inevitable condemnation on their own heads in company with that traitorous disciple.
