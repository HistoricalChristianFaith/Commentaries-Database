Humanity, having yielded to an inclination for sin, wandered away from love toward God. On this account we were banished from the sacred and divine fold, I mean the realm of paradise. Having been weakened by this calamity, we became the prey of two bitter and merciless wolves: namely, the devil who had beguiled humanity to sin; and death, which had been born from sin. But when Christ was announced as the good Shepherd over all, in the struggle with this pair of wild and terrible beasts, he laid down his life for us. He endured the cross for our sakes that by death he might destroy death. He was condemned for our sakes that he might deliver all of us from condemnation for sin, abolishing the tyranny of sin by means of faith and “nailing to his cross the bond that was against us,” as it is written. Accordingly, the father of sin used to put us “in hades like sheep,” delivering us over to “death as our shepherd,” according to what is said in the Psalms. But the truly good Shepherd died for our sakes, that he might take us out of the dark pit of death and prepare to enfold us among the companies of heaven and give to us mansions above, even with the Father, instead of dens situated in the depths of the abyss or the recesses of the sea. Therefore Jesus says to us, “Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father’s good pleasure to give you the kingdom.”
