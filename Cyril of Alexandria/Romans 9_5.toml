God chose Israel for himself from the beginning, which is why he called it the firstborn. But the Israelites fell because they were proud, wicked and, worst of all, murderers of their Lord. Therefore they perished, for they were rejected and abandoned and excluded from Godâ€™s company, placed behind even the Gentiles and cut off from the hope promised to their ancestors.
