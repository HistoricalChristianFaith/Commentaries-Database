Know that Christ is the Most High.… What do those who neglect his divinity have to say? And why will they not understand that when Zechariah said “And you, child, will be called the prophet of the Most High, he meant “of God,” of whom the rest of the prophets also belonged.

For those under the law and dwelling in Judea, John the Baptist was a lamp preceding Christ. God also spoke of him in a similar way: “I have prepared a lamp for my anointed.” And the law also typified him in the lamp. In the first tabernacle it was necessary for the lamp to always remain lit. But the Jews, after being pleased with him for a short time, flocking to his baptism and admiring his mode of life, quickly made him sleep in death, doing their best to extinguish the ever-burning lamp. Therefore the Savior also spoke of him as “a burning and shining lamp, and you were willing to rejoice for a while in his light.”
