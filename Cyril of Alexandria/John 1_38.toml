They said unto Him, Rabbi, where dwellest Thou?

Like people well instructed do they that are asked reply. For already do they call Him, Master, thereby clearly signifying their readiness to learn. Then they beg to know His home, as about therein to tell Him at a fit season of their need. For probably they did not think it right to make talk on needful subjects the companion of a journey. Be what is said again to us for a useful pattern.

Those who are asked reply like people who are well instructed. Notice already how they call him “Rabbi,” thereby clearly signifying their readiness to learn. Then they beg to know where he lives, since they are looking for an appropriate time to tell him their concerns. They probably did not think it was right to talk about such vital topics as companions on a journey.
