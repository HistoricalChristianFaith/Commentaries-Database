For by the two men in one bed, He seems to denote the rich who repose themselves in worldly pleasures, for a bed is a sign of rest. But not all who abound in riches are wicked, but if one is good and elect in the faith, he will be taken, but another who is not so will be left. For when our Lord descends to judgment, He will send His Angels, who while they leave behind on the earth the rest to suffer punishment, will bring the holy and righteous men to Him; according to the Apostle's words, We shall be caught up together in the clouds to meet Christ in the air.
When He said that some should be taken up, the disciples not unprofitably inquire, 'Where, Lord?'.
As if He said, As when a dead body is thrown away, all the birds which feed onhuman flesh flock to it, so when the Son of man shall come, all the eagles, that is, the saints, shall haste to meet Him.
