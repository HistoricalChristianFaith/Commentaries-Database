He says, “Two women will be grinding at a mill. The one will be taken, and the other left.” By these he again seems to mean those who live in poverty and labor. Even in these, he says that there is a certain vast difference. Some have carried the burden of poverty courageously, honoring a serious and virtuous way of life. Others have been of a different character. They are planners for every wicked practice and all shamefulness. There will be even in their case a full and exact investigation of their manners. The good will be taken, and he that is not good will be left. Commentary on Luke, Homily

By the two who are in one bed, he seems to hint at those who live in rest and plenty. They are equal to one another, as far as being possessed of worldly affluence. The bed is the symbol of rest. He says, “One of them will be taken, and one will be left.” How is one taken? Not all those who are possessed of wealth and ease in this world are wicked and merciless. Commentary on Luke, Homily

For by the two men in one bed, He seems to denote the rich who repose themselves in worldly pleasures, for a bed is a sign of rest. But not all who abound in riches are wicked, but if one is good and elect in the faith, he will be taken, but another who is not so will be left. For when our Lord descends to judgment, He will send His Angels, who while they leave behind on the earth the rest to suffer punishment, will bring the holy and righteous men to Him; according to the Apostle's words, We shall be caught up together in the clouds to meet Christ in the air.
When He said that some should be taken up, the disciples not unprofitably inquire, 'Where, Lord?'.
As if He said, As when a dead body is thrown away, all the birds which feed onhuman flesh flock to it, so when the Son of man shall come, all the eagles, that is, the saints, shall haste to meet Him.
