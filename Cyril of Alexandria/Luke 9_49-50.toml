But we ought to consider not so much the worker of the miracles, as the grace which was in him, who, by the power of Christ, performed miracles. But what if there should be both those which be numbered together with the Apostles, and those who are crowned with the grace of Christ; there are many diversities in Christ's gifts. But because the Saviour had given the Apostles power to cast out evil spirits, (Matt. 10:8.) they thought no one else but themselves alone was permitted to have this privilege granted to him, and therefore they come to enquire if it were lawful for others also to do this.

As if He said, On the side of you who love Christ, are all they who wish to follow those things which conduce to His glory, being crowned with His grace.

"Teacher, we saw one casting out devils in your name, and we forbade him." Has the sting of envy troubled the holy disciples? Do they grudge those highly favored? Have even they taken within themselves a passion so abominable and hateful to God? "We saw one casting out devils in your name, and we forbade him." Tell me, do you forbid one who in Christ's name troubles Satan and crushes evil demons? Was it not your duty rather to think that he was not the doer of these wonders, but that the grace that was in him performed the miracle by the power of Christ? How do you forbid him who in Christ wins the victory? "Yes," he says, "for he follows not with us." O blind speech! "What if he is not numbered among the holy apostles, who are crowned with Christ's grace, yet he is equally with you adorned with apostolic powers?" There is great diversity in Christ's gifts. The blessed Paul teaches this, saying, "To one is given through the Spirit the utterance of wisdom, and to another the utterance of knowledge according to the same Spirit."

What is the meaning of his "not walking with us," or what is the force of the expression? Listen and I will tell you as well as I can. The Savior gave the holy apostles authority over unclean spirits, to cast them out and to heal all disease and all sickness among the people. They did so, and the grace given them was effective. They returned with joy, saying, "Lord, even the devils are subject to us in your name." They imagined that permission to be invested with the authority that he granted them was not given to anyone else but only to them. They came near for this reason. They wanted to learn whether others also might exercise it, although they were not appointed to the office of apostle or even to the office of teacher.We find something like this also in the ancient, sacred Scriptures. God once said to the priest Moses, "Choose seventy men from the elders of Israel, and I will take of the Spirit that is on you and give it to them." When those who were chosen assembled at the first tabernacle, except for only two men who remained in the camp, the spirit of prophecy descended on them. Not only did those who assembled in the holy tabernacle prophesy but also those who remained in the camp. It says, "Joshua the son of Nun, the minister of Moses, one of his chosen men, said, 'My lord Moses, forbid them.' But Moses said to him, 'Are you jealous for my sake? Would that all the Lord's people were prophets, that the Lord would put his spirit upon them!' " Christ at that time made the priest Moses speak by the Holy Spirit. Here also in person he says to the holy apostles, "Do not forbid him who is crushing Satan." Christ crushes Satan in his name, for he is not against you. He says, "For he who is not against you is on your side." All who wish to act to his glory are on the side of us who love Christ and are crowned by his grace. This is a law to the churches continuing even to this day. We honor only those who lift up holy hands purely and without fault or blame. In Christ's name, they rebuke unclean spirits and deliver multitudes from various diseases. We know that it is Christ who works in them.
