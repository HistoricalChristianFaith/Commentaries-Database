The dispensation was still at its beginning and not yet fulfilled. How would it have been fitting for Christ to abandon his love for the world and depart from his purpose of suffering on its behalf? By undergoing death in the flesh and by abolishing death by the resurrection from the dead, he redeemed all under heaven. Peter therefore knew not what he said.
