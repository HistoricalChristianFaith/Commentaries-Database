They who are eager to go up into the mountain of the Lord and wish to learn thoroughly his ways promise a ready obedience, and they receive in themselves the glories of the life in Christ and undertake with their whole strength to be earnest in all holiness. “For let everyone,” he says, “in every country and city go the way he chooses and pass his life as seems good to him, but our care is Christ, and his laws we will make our straight path; we will walk along with him; and that not for this life only, present or past, but yet more for what is beyond.” It is a faithful saying. “For they who now suffer with him shall walk with him forever, and with him be glorified, and with him reign.” But “they” make Christ their care who prefer nothing to his love, who cease from the vain distractions of the world and seek rather righteousness and what is pleasing to him, and to excel in virtue. Such a one was the divine Paul, for he writes, “I am crucified with Christ; and now no longer I live, but Christ lives in me.” And again: “I determined not to know anything among you save Jesus Christ, and him crucified.”
