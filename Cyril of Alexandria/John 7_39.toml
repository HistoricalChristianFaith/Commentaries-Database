The Spirit came to be in the prophets so that they could prophesy, and now the Spirit dwells in believers through Christ, having first dwelled in Christ when he was made man. For as God, Christ has the Spirit unceasingly, since the Spirit is essentially of Christ’s nature: the Spirit is his own. Christ is anointed and is said to receive the Spirit as a man, not so that he could participate in the divine good things but rather for our sake and for the sake of human nature, as we have been taught. When the Evangelist says to us, “The Spirit had not been given, because Jesus was not yet glorified,” let us understand him to mean the full and complete indwelling of the Holy Spirit in humankind.
