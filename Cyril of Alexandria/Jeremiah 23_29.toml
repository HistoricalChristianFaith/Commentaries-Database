“Fire” is called “the Gospel” and “salvation” is called “preaching,” or “fire” could also refer to participation in the Holy Spirit, which is similar to experiencing fire. And indeed, this is also why the most wise John the Baptist concerning himself and all of us said, “I baptize you with water for repentance” etc., [looking ahead] to our Savior Jesus Christ [who will baptize with the Holy Spirit and with fire]. Rightly, therefore, did Christ say, “I have come to bring fire upon the earth, and I wish that it were already kindled.”
