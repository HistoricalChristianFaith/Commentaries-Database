As soon as the disciples had prepared the Passover, they proceed to eat it; as it is said, And when the hour was come, &c.

He says this, because the covetous disciple was looking out for the time for betraying Him; but that he might not betray Him before the feast of the Passover, our Lord had not divulged either the house, or the man with whom He should keep the Passover. That this was the cause is very evident from these words.
