He teaches us this by saying, “I have a baptism to be baptized with; and how I am constrained until it is accomplished!” By his baptism, he means his death in the flesh. By being constrained because of it, he means that he was saddened and troubled until it was accomplished. What was to happen when it was accomplished? The saving message of the gospel would not be proclaimed only in Judea. Comparing it with fire, he said, “I have come to send fire upon earth—but that now it should be published even to the whole world.” Before the precious cross and his resurrection from the dead, his commandments and the glory of his divine miracles were spoken of in Judea only.
