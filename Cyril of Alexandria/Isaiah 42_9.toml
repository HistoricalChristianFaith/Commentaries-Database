When the prophet says, “Behold, the former things have come to pass, and new things I will now declare, and before I declare them they have been made known to you,” he does not allow the word of the Savior to be disbelieved by us in any detail. For just as what was said from the beginning about his coming has come to fulfillment, he says, so too will what he calls the new things turn out to be true and will be revealed before they appear. What are these things? They are the eternal life that is to come, which our Lord Jesus Christ promised us, that is, the life of incorruption and holiness and righteousness, the kingdom of heaven, the glorious participation in spiritual good things, the fruits of forbearance, the rewards of piety, the crown of love for Christ. May we too attain them through his grace and loving kindness. - "Commentary on Isaiah 3.5.42.8–9"
