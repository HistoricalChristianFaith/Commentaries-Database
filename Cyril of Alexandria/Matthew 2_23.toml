But if “the Nazarene” is interpreted to mean “holy” or, according to some, as “flower,” this is the designation found in many instances. For Daniel calls him “holy” or “of the holy ones.” Likewise we find in Isaiah: “A branch from the stock of Jesse and its flower.” Even the Lord says of himself in the Song of Songs, “I am the bloom of the plain, the lily of the valleys.”
