As if to say, O Pharisees, since ye say, Who can forgive sins, but God alone? I answer you, Who can search the secrets of the heart, but God alone, Who says by His prophet, I am the Lord, that searcheth the hearts, and trieth the reins. (Jer. 17:10.)

But no sooner have they arrived at this height of daring, than he immediately shows that he is God, to convict them once more of intolerable impiety, "Why do you question in your hearts?" If you, therefore, Pharisee, say, "Who can forgive sins but God only?" I will also say to you, "Who can know hearts, and see the thoughts hidden in the depth of the understanding, but God only?" For he himself says somewhere by the voice of the prophets, "I, the Lord, search the minds and try the heart." David also said somewhere concerning both him and us, "He who fashions the hearts of them all." Therefore he who as God knows both the hearts and minds, as God also forgives sins.
