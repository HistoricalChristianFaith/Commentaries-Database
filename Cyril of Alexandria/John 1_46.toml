Come and see. 

Sight will suffice for faith, says he, and having only conversed with. Him you will confess more readily, and will unhesitatingly say that He is indeed the Expected One. But we must believe that there was a Divine and Ineffable grace, flowing forth with the words of the Saviour, and alluring the souls of the hearers. For so it is written, that all wondered at the gracious words which proceeded out of His Mouth. For as His word is mighty in power, so too is it efficacious to persuade.

Nathanael readily agrees that he expects great things to appear out of Nazareth. It is, I suppose, perfectly clear that not only did he take Nazareth as a pledge of what he sought but, bringing together knowledge from Moses and the prophets as one fond of learning, he gained a pretty quick understanding. “Come and see,” [Philip] says. Sight will suffice for faith. All you need to do is talk with him, and you will be all the more ready to confess and say without hesitation that he is indeed the expected One. But we must also believe that there was a divine and ineffable grace flowing from the words of our Savior that proved alluring for the souls of his hearers. … For since his word is mighty in power, it is also efficacious to persuade.
