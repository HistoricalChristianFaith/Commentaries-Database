This verse would apply particularly to the people of Judah and Benjamin. You see, whereas the tribes in Samaria were totally devoted to the worship of the idols, and were proven to be extremely lax and very neglectful of the laws of Moses, the people in Jerusalem, though sacrificing in the high places of Baal and pouring libations to the host of heaven, in addition made a pretense of paying respect to the Law and of being anxious to perform sacrifices and festival.
