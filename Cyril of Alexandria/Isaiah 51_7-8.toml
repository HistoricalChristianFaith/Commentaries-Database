The Son is called “salvation” and “righteousness,” as we often say, and thus his quality is declared that he has in himself, by which and in which he is Son by nature. Indeed, he is eternal and does not “wear out.” Such is the difference between creator and creation, the made from the maker, which is clearly seen in this verse.
