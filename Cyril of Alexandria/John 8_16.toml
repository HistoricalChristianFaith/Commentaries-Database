But we must know that by his saying again that he was sent, he does not show that he is second in dignity to the Father. For we must not imagine a mission befitting a servant, even though, because he was clothed in a servant’s form, he might rightly say even this of himself. But he was sent as Word from Mind, as the Sun’s radiance from itself. For these I suppose are processions from those things in which they are, from their appearing to issue forth, yet they exist naturally and immovably in those things from which they come. For we should not suppose that the things that mind and sun have produced, that is, Word or radiance, are devoid of Word or radiance once they have gone forth from them.… For mind will never be wordless, nor will words ever exist without the mind that fashioned them.
