"You will be a crown of beauty in the hand of the Lord and a royal diadem in the hand of your God." Now this compares both each holy soul and the collective church, that is, the company of the saints, to a garland tied together from many flowers or to a royal diadem, shining with Indian jewels and with a variety of beautiful forms. For many are the noble characteristics of the saints, and there is not one type of distinction but many and various … and Christ himself said about his own sheep or the flock of those believing in him, "No one shall snatch them from the hand of the Father."
