But although as God He was able to drive away diseases by His word, He nevertheless touches them, showing that His flesh was powerful to apply remedies, since it was the flesh of God; for as fire, when applied to a brazen vessel, imprints on it the effect of its own heat, so the omnipotent Word of God, when He united to Himself in real assumption a living virgin temple, endued with understanding, implanted in it a participation of His own power. May Healso touch us, nay rather may we touch Him, that He may deliver us from the infirmities ofour souls as well as the assaults of the evil spirit and pride! For it follows, And devils also came out.
