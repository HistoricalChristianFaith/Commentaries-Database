To keep the company of the holy disciples free from disgraceful faults, he usefully testifies. He says, “Beware of the scribes and Pharisees.” That means do not expose yourselves to be the prey of their vices and do not be partakers of their disregard of God. What was their custom? They walked in the streets beautifully clothed, dragging with them a pompous dignity to catch the praises of those who saw them. While they were wicked and their hearts were full of all dishonesty, they falsely assumed to themselves the reputation of piety. With solemn ways not based on reality, they diligently lengthened their prayers, supposing that unless they used many words, God would not know what their requests were. The Savior of all did not permit his worshipers to act so shamefully. He said, “When you pray, do not babble as the heathen do. They think that they will be heard for their many words.” He commanded them to be humble and not lovers of boasting. He commanded them not to pay any regard to the desire of empty glory but rather to seek the honor that comes from above, from God. In such ways, he deposits the knowledge of his mystery. He also appoints instructors of others, as possessing an exact and blameless knowledge of the sacred doctrines. He makes them to know how David’s Son is also David’s Lord. We also will classify ourselves with them, God the Father illuminating us with divine light in Christ. Commentary on Luke, Homily

The passions of the Scribes were the love of vainglory and the love of gain. That the disciples should avoid these hateful crimes, He gives them this warning, and adds, And love greetings in the markets.
