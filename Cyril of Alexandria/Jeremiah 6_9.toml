It was that you may learn that God silently and noiselessly observes the affairs of people and watches the course of each one’s life, and so it is written, “The paths of a person are before the eyes of God, and God looks at all his tracks.” And as he is good and wills that all people should be saved, he often purifies those who are entangled in sins by inflicting sickness on their body. He somewhere says by the voice of Jeremiah, “You shall be taught, O Jerusalem, by labor and the scourge.” - "Commentary on Luke, Chapter 5.18"
