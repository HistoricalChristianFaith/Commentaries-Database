The Savior himself admonished them, saying, "Woe to you lawyers! for you have taken away the key of knowledge; you did not enter yourselves, and you hindered those who were entering." They rise up against Christ as he teaches. They wickedly and despicably shout out, "Tell us, by what authority you do these things? Who gave you this authority?" They say, "The law given by Moses and the commandment that regulates all our institutions commanded that only those who are of the lineage of Levi should approach these sacred duties. They offer the sacrifices. They regulate whatever is done in the divine temple. The office of instructing and the government of the sacred trusts are given to them. Being of another tribe, from Judah, you grab honors that have been set apart for us. Who gave you this authority?"
