Having nothing at all of which to accuse him, and none of those crimes to allege against him that normally bring with them just punishment—and Pilate persisting in inquiring why they had brought him—they assert that Jesus had sinned against Caesar in assuming the dominion that Caesar had acquired over the Jews and in changing the glory of his kingdom to suit his personal aspirations. Great was the malice that suggested this device and caused the false accusation to assume this shape. For they knew that Pilate, however reluctant he might be, would think first about his own safety and would swiftly and precipitously punish the man against whom any such outcry was raised. For, as the inhabitants of Judea were always moved to riots and civil strife and were easily provoked to revolt, Caesar’s officers were proportionally vigilant in this respect and were more careful guardians of order. To this end, they inflicted the most summary penalties on people who had this charge brought against them, sometimes groundlessly. The Jews, therefore, make it a charge against Christ that he ruled over Israel.… Pilate, then, speaks out plainly what he heard the Jews muttering and bids Jesus answer him, whether he was in truth the King of the Jews. Pilate was full of anxiety, it would appear, and thought Caesar’s rule was endangered. Therefore he was anxious to learn the truth in order to meet what had been done with appropriate retribution and acquit of blame the office entrusted to him by the Romans.
