“In my chamber by night I sought him.” This refers to the women who came at the beginning of the morning on the sabbath to the tomb of Jesus and did not find him. He is in the chamber, therefore, or away from the chamber. Or perhaps they call their chamber the Lord’s tomb because we are buried together with him. But when they did not find him, they heard at once: “He is not here, for he has been raised.” And they discovered guardian angels, whom they asked, “Where have you laid the Lord?” Then, when they had left the angels whom they were questioning, the Lord met them and said, “Rejoice.” For this reason, it says, “When I had passed by them for a little while, I found him whom I will not let go.” She grasped his feet and heard, “Don’t hold me.” Finally, he called the gathering of the apostles the house of the mother, to whom he announced the resurrection of Christ.
