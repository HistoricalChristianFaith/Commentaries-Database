But the Lord forbade not them that glorified Him as God, but rather forbade those that blamed them, so bearing witness to Himself concerning the glory of the Godhead. Hence it follows, He answered and said unto them, I tell you, if these should hold their peace, the stones would immediately cry out.

Christ therefore sits upon the colt. Since he now came to the descent of the Mount of Olives close to Jerusalem, the disciples went before him praising him. They were called to bear witness to the wonderful works that he performed and of his godlike glory and sovereignty. We likewise should always praise him, considering who and how great he is. Another holy Evangelist mentioned that children, holding high branches of palm trees, ran before him. With the rest of the disciples, they celebrated his glory.

The Pharisees truly complained because Christ was praised. They came near and said, “Rebuke your disciples.” O Pharisee, what wrong action did they do? What charge do you bring against the disciples or how would you rebuke them? They have not sinned in any way but have rather done what is praiseworthy. They extol as King and Lord the One the law had before pointed out by many symbols and types. The ancient company of the holy prophets had preached of him. You despised him and grieved him by your great jealousy. Your duty was to join the rest in their praises. Your duty was to withdraw far from your innate wickedness and to change your way for the better. Your duty was to follow the sacred Scriptures and to thirst after the knowledge of the truth. You did not do this, but transferring your words to the contrary, you wanted to rebuke the heralds of the truth.

What does Christ answer to these things? “I tell you that if these be silent, the stones will cry out.”It is impossible for God not to be glorified, although those of the race of Israel refuse to do so. The worshipers of idols were once as stones and hardened, but they have been delivered from their former error and rescued from the hand of the enemy. They have escaped from devilish darkness. They have been called to the light of truth. They have awakened as from drunkenness. They have acknowledged the Creator. They do not praise him secretly, in concealment, in a hidden way and silently, but with freedom of speech and a loud voice. They praise him diligently, as it were, calling out to one another and saying, “Come, let us praise the Lord and sing psalms to God our Savior.” They acknowledged Christ the Savior of all.

The disciples praise Christ the Savior of all, calling him King and Lord, and the peace of heaven and earth. Let us also praise him, taking the psalmist’s harp and saying, “How great are your works, O Lord! In wisdom you have made them.” Only wisdom is in his works because he guides all useful things in their proper manner and assigns to his acts the season that suits them.
