A reproof which exalts the meek is generally hateful to the proud man. When therefore our Saviour was blaming the Pharisees as men who were wandering far from the right path and fallen into unbecoming practices, the body of Lawyers were struck with consternation. Hence it is said, Then answered one of the Lawyers, and said unto him, Master, thus saying thou reproachest us also.

The Savior of all was rebuking the Pharisees as men who were wandering far from the right way and fallen into unbecoming practices.… The band of wicked lawyers was indignant at these things, and one of them stood up to contradict the Savior's declarations. He said, "Teacher, in saying these things, you reproach us also." … These men subject themselves to blame. Rather, the force of truth showed that they were liable to the same accusations as the Pharisees and were of one mind with them. They are partners of their evil deeds if they consider that what Christ said to the others was spoken also against them.
