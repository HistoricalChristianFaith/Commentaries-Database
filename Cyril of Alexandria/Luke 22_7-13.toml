By its shadows, the law prefigured from of old the mystery of Christ. He is himself the witness of this when he said to the Jews, “If you would have believed Moses, you would have also believed me, for he wrote concerning me.” Christ is presented everywhere by means of shadows and types, both as slain for us, as the innocent and true Lamb, and as sanctifying us by his life-giving blood. We further find the words of the holy prophets in complete agreement with those of most wise Moses. Paul says, “When the fullness of time was come,” the only-begotten Word of God submitted to the emptying of himself, the birth in the flesh of a woman, and subjection to the law according to the measure that was fitting for human nature. He was also then sacrificed for us, as the innocent and true lamb on the fourteenth day of the first month. This feast day was called Pascha, a word belonging to the Hebrew language and signifying the passing over.…The name of the feast on which Emmanuel bore for us the saving cross was the Pascha.

Someone may ask, “Why did Christ not plainly mention the man to those whom he sent? He did not say, ‘When you go to such and such a person, whoever it might be, there prepare the Pascha for us at his house.’ ” He simply gave them a sign: a man bearing a pitcher of water. What do we reply to this? Look, Judas the traitor had already promised the Jews to deliver Christ to them. Judas continued in his company to watch for a good opportunity. While still making profession of the love that was the duty of a disciple, he had admitted Satan into his heart and was travailing with the crime of murder against our common Savior Christ. Jesus gives a sign to prevent Judas from learning who the man was and running to tell those who had hired him. “There will meet you,” he says, “a man carrying a pitcher of water.”

Perhaps Christ speaks this as symbolizing something mystical and necessary. Wherever waters enter, the waters of holy baptism, Christ stays there. How or in what way does this happen? They free us from all impurity, and they wash us from the stains of sin. They do this so that we also might become a holy temple of God and participants in his divine nature, by participation of the Holy Spirit. So that Christ may rest and stay in us, let us receive the saving waters, also confessing the faith that justifies the wicked and raises us high so that we might be counted as an upper room.…He that would say that the soul of every saint is an upper room would not miss the truth.

When the disciples had prepared the Pascha, Christ ate it with them. Christ was patient toward the traitor, and from his infinite lovingkindness condescended to admit him to the table. Judas was already a traitor, because Satan was staying within him. What did Christ also say to the holy apostles? “I have desired a desire to eat this Pascha with you.” Let us examine the deep meaning of this expression. Let us search out the meaning concealed in there, and let us search for what the Savior intended.I have already said that the greedy disciple was seeking an opportunity to betray Christ. So Judas might not deliver him to his murderers before the feast of the Pascha, the Savior did not openly state either the house or the person with whom he would celebrate the feast. He explains to them the cause of his unwillingness to tell them openly with whom he would lodge. He says, “I have desired a desire to eat with you this Pascha,” apparently meaning, “I have used every effort to enable me to escape the wickedness of the traitor, that I might not endure my passion before the time.”
