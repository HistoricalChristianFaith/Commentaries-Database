For the law was not a perpetual and immoveable law, but it remained in force only as long as the time of its imposition. As the most wise Paul said, “For the former and ancient command has a gap whose filling is to be sought in the second, that is, the new has many things quite different from the old.” …That second one is the eternal covenant, and that he fulfilled it for those approaching him by faith is confirmed when it immediately adds, “the holy trustworthy things of David.” This concerns the announcements about the Savior of us all, Christ, which are declared to be given to those who are attentive among the nations, or it means the divine and sacred prophecies of Christ, who was born from the seed of David according to his humanity. These are called “holy,” for they make perfect those in whom they dwell, just as the fear of God is called “pure” because it is purifying and the gospel word is called “life” because it gives life.… This is the power through Christ of these prophecies.…
For those who had never seen Christ on account of residing in gloom and darkness called on him, that is, they acknowledged Jesus as God and fled to him calling him their hope and shelter and means of salvation and called on him as God … for although according to the measure of humanity Christ was thought to be ignoble, he went back to that which was appropriate to him and divine and the highest glory—but not without his flesh.
