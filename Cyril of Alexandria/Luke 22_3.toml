What was this many-headed serpent's invention? It says, "He entered Judas Iscariot, who was one of the Twelve." Why did he not rather enter blessed Peter, James, John, or some other of the rest of the apostles? Why Judas Iscariot? What did Satan find in him? Satan could not approach any of those we have mentioned here, because their heart was steadfast and their love to Christ immovable. There was a place for Satan in the traitor. The bitter disease of greed, which the blessed Paul says is the root of all evil, had overpowered him. Satan is crafty in working evil. Whenever he gains possession of anyone's soul, he does not attack him by means of general vice. He rather searches for that particular passion that has power over him and by its means makes him his prey.

Judas lost heaven for a little silver. He missed the crown of immortality and the desirable honor of the apostleship. He missed to be numbered among the Twelve to whom Christ somewhere said, "You are the light of the world." He did not care to be a light of the world. He forgot Christ, who says, "You who have followed me in my temptations, when the Son of man shall sit upon the throne of his glory, you also will sit on twelve thrones and judge the twelve tribes of Israel." Judas did not want to reign with Christ. What a confusion of error blinded the mind of that greedy man! The Evangelist says, "Satan entered him." His pathway and door was the passion of greed. "There is great gain in godliness with contentment." The sacred Scripture says, "We neither brought anything into the world, nor can we carry anything out." Those who seek to be rich, fall into numerous and unprofitable lusts, which sink people in pitfalls and destruction. The disciple who became a traitor is a clear proof of this, because he perished for the sake of a few miserable coins.
