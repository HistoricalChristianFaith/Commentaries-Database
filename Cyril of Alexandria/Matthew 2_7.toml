It wasn’t the words of the magi that troubled Herod. It was the speculations of the legal experts about the words of the believing prophets. For the magi were seeking a king, but the Jews were declaring that Christ had been born. For this reason, turning aside the magi, Herod calls the Jews and asks them where the Christ should be born, he “whom you, having heard the magi, are now announcing.” This is how the enemies of the truth may sometimes unwillingly speak the truth. They interpret the whole prophecy uselessly, failing to grasp what is necessary.
