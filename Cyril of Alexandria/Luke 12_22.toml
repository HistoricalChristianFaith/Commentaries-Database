Now the soul is more excellent than food, and the body than clothing. Therefore He adds, The life is more than meat As if He said, &#8220;God who has implanted that which is greater, how will He not give that which is less?&#8221; Let not our attention then be stayed upon trifling things, nor our understanding serve to seek for food and raiment, but rather think on whatever saves the soul, and raises it to the kingdom of heaven.
