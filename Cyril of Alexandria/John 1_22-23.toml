I come, [John the Baptist] says nothing else than that the one you are looking for is finally at the doors. Indeed, the Lord is within the doors. Be ready to go whatever way he asks you. You have gone the way given you through Moses, [but now] take up the way of Christ. For this is what the choir of the holy prophets told you beforehand.
