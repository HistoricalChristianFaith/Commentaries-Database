He calls Christ an axe “sharper than a two-edged sword,” which was to cut off the unbelieving Jews and dissociate them from the honor and communion of the patriarchs. Those spoken of as “the root” are the fathers of old who remained well pleasing to God, those who with Abraham and as with many people in former times were holy. The unbelievers who sprang from them were cut off as fruitless branches. But the root remained, onto which those of the believing Gentiles were engrafted. And as Irenaeus reminds us, God’s Word is like an axe in accordance with Jeremiah’s saying: the word of the Lord is “like a pickaxe chopping stone.” Why am I saying that you are going to fall away? God did not spare the root.
