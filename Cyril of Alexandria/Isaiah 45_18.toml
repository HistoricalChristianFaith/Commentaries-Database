For it says, “thus says the Lord” and not simply an earthly “lord,” for there are many in heaven and earth that ruin this name [the Lord] by overusing it. But he is the one who by nature and in truth is just—he is what he is said to be and derives no false glory from what he has ordained.… For if he who made heaven and earth did not make it in vain but to be inhabited, … then who else other than him can be considered God? - "Commentary on Isaiah 4.3.45.18–19"
