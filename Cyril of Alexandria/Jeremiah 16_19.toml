Having been brought near, they make Christ their glorying. For again, God the Father has said of them, “And I will strengthen them in the Lord their God, and in his name shall they glory, says the Lord.” This also the blessed psalmist teaches, speaking as it were to Christ the Savior of all and saying, “Lord, they shall walk in the light of your countenance, and in your name shall they exult all the day, and in your righteousness shall they be exalted. For you are the glorying of their strength.” We shall find also the prophet Jeremiah calling out to God, “Lord, my strength and my help, and my refuge in the day of my evils, to You shall the heathen come from the ends of the earth, and say, ‘Our fathers took for themselves false idols, in which there is no help.’ ”
