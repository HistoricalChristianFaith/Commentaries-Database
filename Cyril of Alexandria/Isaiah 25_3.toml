Israel was called to the knowledge of God through the tutoring of the law and was richly endowed with the things of God. It was delivered [from Egypt] and inherited the Promised Land. Although there were many other peoples living in other parts of the world, all were alien to spiritual matters and heavenly things. They had not tasted the gifts that come from God. They were, as it were, naked and unclothed, enjoying neither divine protection nor shelter from on high, nor the spiritual wealth that comes from virtue nor other things worthy of praise or admiration.When Christ appeared, destroying the arrogance of the devil, he led the nations to God the Father, and they basked in the splendor of the true light and shared in his glory. Enjoying the splendor of the way of life according to the gospel, they offered hymns of thanksgiving to the God and Father for these gifts. Thus the text says, you have carried out a “faithful plan formed of old,” O Lord, recapitulating all things in Christ and enlightening those in darkness, destroying the mighty powers of this age. That is, like “fortified cities the impoverished people will bless you” and whole cities will “glorify you.” Having become a “help to all” and “protection” to those whose ancestral traditions were impoverished, you have saved them from wicked people.
