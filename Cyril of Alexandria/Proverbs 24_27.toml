The sacred Scripture has somewhere said, “Prepare your works for your departure, and make yourself ready for the field.” Now by our departure I imagine is meant our going from this world and removal from it. And this time must of course overtake every one; for, as the psalmist says, “What man is there that shall live and not see death, and that can save his soul from the hand of hell?” For the nature of man was condemned in Adam and fell away unto corruption, because he foolishly transgressed the commandment given him.
