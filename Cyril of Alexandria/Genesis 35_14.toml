When we ascend to Bethel, that is, to the house of God, we will know the stone, I mean, the elected stone, which was made into a cornerstone, that is, Christ. We will see the one who is anointed by the Father in joy and exultation for all the creatures that live under the sky. As I said, the Son is anointed by God the Father: “Joy of us all, universal exultation” according to the words of the psalmist. And you see how this is prefigured in the words that were just said to us: “And Jacob set up a stone and poured oil upon it.” That action is a symbol of the mystery of Christ, through whom and with whom be glory to God the Father and the Holy Spirit, world without end. Amen.
