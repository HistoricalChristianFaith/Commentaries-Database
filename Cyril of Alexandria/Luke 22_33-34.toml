In the passion of his zeal, Peter professed steadfastness and endurance to the last extremity, saying that he would courageously resist the terrors of death and count chains as nothing. In so doing, he erred from what was right. When the Savior told Peter that he would be weak and contradict the Lord, he should not have loudly protested the contrary. The Truth could not lie. Peter should have rather asked strength from Christ, either that he might not suffer this or that he might be rescued immediately from harm. He was fervent in spirit, warm in his love toward Christ, and of unrestrained zeal in rightly performing those duties which fit a disciple in his service to his master. Peter declares that he will endure to the last extremity. Christ rebuked him for foolishly speaking against what was foreknown and for his unreasonable haste in contradicting the Savior's words. For this reason he says, "Truly I tell you, that the rooster will not crow tonight, until you have three times denied me." This proved true. Let us not think highly of ourselves, even if we see ourselves greatly distinguished for our virtues. Let us rather offer the praises of our thanks to Christ who redeems us and who grants us even the desire to be able to act correctly.
