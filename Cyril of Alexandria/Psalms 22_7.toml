Just as we say that the flesh became [the Word’s] very own, in the same way the weakness of that flesh became his very own in an economic appropriation according to the terms of the unification. So, he is “made like his brothers in all things except sin alone.” Do not be astonished if we say that he has made the weakness of the flesh his own along with the flesh itself. He even attributed to himself those external outrages that came on him from the roughness of the Jews, saying through the voice of the psalmist: “They divided my garments among them and cast lots for my clothes,” and again: “All those who saw me sneered at me, they wagged their tongues, they shook their heads.”
