Likewise, the common Jewish people rejected the grace that was given them and found it unacceptable; for they resisted, as I have said, the teachings of Christ.… “For I desire to refashion you,” he says, “into something better, to remake you into something superior through a spiritual birth which, of course, is the one through water and the Spirit; but you foolishly resist my plans. Did the clay,” he says, “ever reproach the potter for not having a skillful hand, or for not knowing how to give shape to what he holds in his hands? Nor,” he says, “does the one who is about to be born put a question to his own father, ‘Will you give birth?’ How is it, then, that you, who are like clay in the potter’s hands, and do not know at all how your spiritual rebirth will take place, are not afraid of being cantankerous? And why do you not realize you ought to leave it to me, as to a craftsman and father, how to do these things?” … Therefore, it is necessary to [yield] to what God says. He himself knows the way of his own works, and what he fashioned is not subject to prying, and what transcends our understanding should be given the honor of unquestioning faith.One must also understand that the prophet Jeremiah was sent to the house of the potter to see him at work. When the clay collapsed and was reshaped into a different vessel, God said to him: “Can I not do with you as this potter has done, O house of Israel? Behold, just like the clay in the potter’s hand, so are you in my hand.” Paul, also, explains that we are transformed spiritually into a holy and utterly good life, when he says: “And all of us, with unveiled faces, seeing the glory of the Lord as though reflected in a mirror, are being transformed in to the same image from one degree of glory to another; for this comes from the Lord, the Spirit”8; through whom we are also born again, not any longer of corruptible seed, but through the word of the living God who endures forever.
