There are some other men going about, as they say, pretending only to devote themselves to prayer and doing no work, making piety a pretext for cowardice and a means of gaining a living, but not thinking rightly. Let them say that they are better even than the holy apostles who worked when opportunity gave them time for it, and they were exhausted for the word of God. How did they miss reading the holy Paul writing to certain people, “For I hear that some among you are living irregularly, doing no work but busy at meddling.” The church does not admit those who do this. It is necessary without doubt that those who live a quiet life in the monasteries pray continually. But it does no harm and rather is exceedingly helpful to work so that he who accepts the labors of others for his own need may not be found to be burdensome to others. It might be possible from his labors to relieve the widow and the orphan and some of the weak ones of his brothers.
