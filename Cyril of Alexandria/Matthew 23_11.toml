Since those who have arrived teaching new beliefs for the most part do so from conceit and arrogance, I will say something concerning the value of the teaching. The Lord cuts short this opinion and way as leading to destruction. He says, “You love glory and the places of first importance.” Meanwhile he desires the servant’s role and cultivates humility.
