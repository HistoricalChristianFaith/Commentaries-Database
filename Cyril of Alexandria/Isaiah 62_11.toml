This forecasts the coming of the Savior and our redemption by his coming. It also foretells the granting of riches to those who believe in him.… Concerning that which is new, that is, the church, it may be fittingly said that it is the daughter of Zion.… For whom does he order to proclaim good news to Zion? Those holy spiritual guides, of course, who took on the leadership role in the church and whose job it was to open the gates and to remove the stones from their midst. And what were they to announce? “That the Savior has come bringing his own reward and his work before his face.” Two points are made, that which relates to his godhead and that which is a reward for us. Through both the Savior’s glory becomes apparent.
