And since, contrary to his usual habits, on this occasion only, Christ appears seated on a donkey, we do not say that he sat on it because it was a long distance to the city. For it was not more than two miles away. Nor do we say that it was because there was a multitude. For it is certain that on other occasions when he was found with a multitude he did not do this; but he does this to indicate that he is about to make subject to himself as a new people the unclean among the Gentiles, and to lead them up to the prerogative of righteousness and to the Jerusalem above of which the earthly is a type. It is into this Jerusalem that this people, being made clean, shall enter with Christ, who will be hymned by the guileless angels of whom the babes are a type. And he calls the donkey a colt, because the people of the Gentiles had been untrained in the piety that faith produces.
