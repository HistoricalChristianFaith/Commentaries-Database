But what did he tell them to say? “Behold, I cast out demons and perform cures today and tomorrow, and the third day I finish my course.” You see that he declares his intention of performing what he knew would grieve the troop of Pharisees. So they drive him from Jerusalem, fearing that by the display of miracles he will win many to faith in himself. But inasmuch as their purpose there did not escape him since he was God, he declares his intention of performing what they hated and says that he shall also rebuke unclean spirits and deliver the sick from their sufferings and be perfected. This means that of his own will he will endure the passion on the cross for the salvation of the world. He knew, therefore, as it appears, both how and when he would endure death in the flesh.
