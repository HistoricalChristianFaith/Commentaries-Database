This approach of the Greeks [to Philip] happened at that time as a sort of firstfruits. And the Galileans came to Philip as being himself a Galilean, asking him to show them Jesus whom they wanted to see because they were continually hearing good things about Jesus. They wanted to worship him and attain the object of their desires. But Philip remembered what the Lord had said to them, “Do not go into any area of the Gentiles or enter any city of the Samaritans.” And so Philip was afraid that he might give offense by bringing to Christ those who had not believed, not realizing that it was for a set purpose that the Lord had forbidden the disciples to approach the Gentiles until the Jews should first have rejected the grace given to them. And so Philip tells Andrew, who was more disposed for and accustomed to such things, and then, with his approval they both carry the message to the Lord.
