Therefore as the prophet Jeremiah has said, Take up arms and shields. Especially as the right hand of God our Savior is invincible in the battle, and as most wise Paul has said, he does not permit people to be tried more than they can bear, but with the trial he will make also the way out, that they may be able to endure patiently.
