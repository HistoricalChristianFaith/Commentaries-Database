(non occ.) The devil lays plots of various kinds for them that love the best way of life. And if indeed by carnal allurements he can gain possession of a man's heart, He sharpens his love of pleasure; but if a man has escaped these snares, he excites in him a desire of glory, and this passion for vain-glory had seized some one of His apostles. Hence it is said, Then there arose a reasoning among them, which of them should be the greatest. For to have such thoughts, belongs to him who desires to be superior to the rest; but I think it improbable that all the disciples gave way to this weakness; and therefore suppose that the Evangelist, not to seem to lay the charge to any individual, expresses himself indefinitely, saying, that there arose a reasoning among them.

But our Lord, Who knew how to save, seeing in the hearts of the disciples the thought that had risen up thereupon as it were a certain root of bitterness, plucks it up by the roots before it received growth. For when passions first begin in us, they are easily subdued; but having gained strength, they are with difficulty eradicated. Hence it follows, And Jesus perceiving the thought of their heart, &c. Let him who thinks Jesus to be mere man, know that he has erred; for the Word, although made flesh, remained God. For it is God alone Who is able to search into the heart and reins. But in taking a child, and placing it beside Him, He did it for the Apostles' sake and ours. For the disease of vain-glory feeds generally on those who have the preeminence among other men. But a child has a pure mind and unspotted heart, and abides in simplicity of thought; he courts not honours, nor knows the limits of each one's power, nor shuns seeming to be inferior to others, bearing no moroseness in his mind or heart. Such the Lord embraces and loves, and thinks them worthy to be near Him, as those who had chosen to taste of the things which are His; for He says, Learn of me, for I am meek and lowly of heart. Hence it follows, And he says unto them, Whosoever shall receive a child in my name, receiveth me. As if He were to say, Seeing that there is one and the same reward to those that honour the saints, whether perchance such an one be the least, or one distinguished for honours and glory, for in him is Christ received, how vain is it to seek to have the preeminence?

Now He still more plainly conveys the meaning of the preceding words, saying, For he that is least among you all, the same shall be great; in which He speaks of the modest man who from honesty thinks nothing high of himself.

But we ought to consider not so much the worker of the miracles, as the grace which was in him, who, by the power of Christ, performed miracles. But what if there should be both those which be numbered together with the Apostles, and those who are crowned with the grace of Christ; there are many diversities in Christ's gifts. But because the Saviour had given the Apostles power to cast out evil spirits, (Matt. 10:8.) they thought no one else but themselves alone was permitted to have this privilege granted to him, and therefore they come to enquire if it were lawful for others also to do this.

As if He said, On the side of you who love Christ, are all they who wish to follow those things which conduce to His glory, being crowned with His grace.

The passion and lust of pride attacked some of the holy apostles. The mere argument about who of them was the greatest is the mark of an ambitious person, eager to stand at the head of the rest. Christ, who did not sleep, knows how to deliver. He saw this thought in the disciple’s mind, springing up, in the words of Scripture, like some bitter plant. He saw the weeds, the work of the wicked sower. Before it grew up tall, struck its root down deep, grew strong, and took possession of the heart, he tears up the evil by the very root.…In what way does the Physician of souls amputate pride’s passion? How does he deliver the beloved disciple from being the prey of the enemy and from a thing hateful to God and man? “He took a child,” it says, “and set it by him.” He made the event a means of benefiting both the holy apostles themselves and us their successors. This illness, as a rule, preys upon all those who are in any respect superior to other people.

What kind of type and representation did he make the child he had taken? He made the child a representation of an innocent and humble life. The mind of a child is empty of fraud, and his heart is sincere. His thoughts are simple. He does not covet rank and does not know what is meant by one man being higher than another is.…Christ brought forward the child as a pattern of simplicity and innocence, and set him by him. He showed him as in an object lesson, that he accepts and loves those who are like the child. He thinks they are worthy of standing at his side, as being like-minded with him and anxious to walk in his steps.

Christ calls him least whom lowly things please and who from modesty does not think highly of himself. This person pleases Christ. It is written that “every one that exalts himself shall be humbled, and he that humbles himself shall be exalted.” Christ himself somewhere says, “Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.” The ornament of a sanctified soul is a poor and humble mind.… Let the illness of pride be far from those who love Christ. Let us rather consider our companions as better than we are and be anxious to decorate ourselves with the humility of mind that is well pleasing to God. Being simpleminded, as fits saints, we will be with Christ who honors simplicity.

“Teacher, we saw one casting out devils in your name, and we forbade him.” Has the sting of envy troubled the holy disciples? Do they grudge those highly favored? Have even they taken within themselves a passion so abominable and hateful to God? “We saw one casting out devils in your name, and we forbade him.” Tell me, do you forbid one who in Christ’s name troubles Satan and crushes evil demons? Was it not your duty rather to think that he was not the doer of these wonders, but that the grace that was in him performed the miracle by the power of Christ? How do you forbid him who in Christ wins the victory? “Yes,” he says, “for he follows not with us.” O blind speech! “What if he is not numbered among the holy apostles, who are crowned with Christ’s grace, yet he is equally with you adorned with apostolic powers?” There is great diversity in Christ’s gifts. The blessed Paul teaches this, saying, “To one is given through the Spirit the utterance of wisdom, and to another the utterance of knowledge according to the same Spirit.”

What is the meaning of his “not walking with us,” or what is the force of the expression? Listen and I will tell you as well as I can. The Savior gave the holy apostles authority over unclean spirits, to cast them out and to heal all disease and all sickness among the people. They did so, and the grace given them was effective. They returned with joy, saying, “Lord, even the devils are subject to us in your name.” They imagined that permission to be invested with the authority that he granted them was not given to anyone else but only to them. They came near for this reason. They wanted to learn whether others also might exercise it, although they were not appointed to the office of apostle or even to the office of teacher.We find something like this also in the ancient, sacred Scriptures. God once said to the priest Moses, “Choose seventy men from the elders of Israel, and I will take of the Spirit that is on you and give it to them.” When those who were chosen assembled at the first tabernacle, except for only two men who remained in the camp, the spirit of prophecy descended on them. Not only did those who assembled in the holy tabernacle prophesy but also those who remained in the camp. It says, “Joshua the son of Nun, the minister of Moses, one of his chosen men, said, ‘My lord Moses, forbid them.’ But Moses said to him, ‘Are you jealous for my sake? Would that all the Lord’s people were prophets, that the Lord would put his spirit upon them!’ ” Christ at that time made the priest Moses speak by the Holy Spirit. Here also in person he says to the holy apostles, “Do not forbid him who is crushing Satan.” Christ crushes Satan in his name, for he is not against you. He says, “For he who is not against you is on your side.” All who wish to act to his glory are on the side of us who love Christ and are crowned by his grace. This is a law to the churches continuing even to this day. We honor only those who lift up holy hands purely and without fault or blame. In Christ’s name, they rebuke unclean spirits and deliver multitudes from various diseases. We know that it is Christ who works in them.
