You say, “We found this man perverting our people.” Tell us in what this perversion consisted? Christ taught repentance. Where did he forbid giving tribute to Caesar? He said, “Give to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and to God the things that are God’s.” Where then did he forbid giving tribute to Caesar? Their only purpose was to bring down to death the One who was raising them to life. This was the goal of their strategy, the shameful deeds they planned, of the falsehood they invented, and the bitter words running from their wicked tongues. The law still loudly proclaims to you, “You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor,” and “The holy and the just you shall not kill.”

They had no respect whatsoever for the law. Led by an uncontrolled recklessness into whatever pleased only themselves without examination of the case, they invented numerous charges heaping up against Christ accusations that were neither true nor capable of being proved. They were convicted of being even more wicked than an idolater is. Acquitting Jesus of all blame, Pilate not only once but three times openly said, “I find no crime in this man.”
