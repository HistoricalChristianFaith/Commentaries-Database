We say then that the power of the divine message resembles a live coal and fire. And the God of all somewhere said to the prophet Jeremiah, “Behold, I have made my words in your mouth to be fire, and this people to be wood, and it shall devour them.” And again, “Are not my words as burning fire, says the Lord?” Rightly, therefore, did our Lord Jesus Christ say to us, “I came to cast fire on the earth, and would that it were already kindled.” For already some of the Jewish crowd believed on him, whose firstfruits were the divine disciples. The fire, being once kindled, was soon to seize on the whole world immediately after the whole dispensation had attained to its completion.… He had borne his precious passion on the cross and had commanded the bonds of death to cease. He rose on the third day from the dead.
