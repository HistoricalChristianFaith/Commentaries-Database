Now, the verse God is jealous and the rest would properly apply also to those not wishing to follow the straight and narrow path of godliness, but rather to be diverted to a fleshly style of life. After all, there is no doubt that he will take vengeance by inflicting punishment and subjecting to penalties the stubborn and guilty, especially if it is true that “all of us must appear before the judgment seat of Christ so that each may receive recompense for what has been done in the body, whether good or evil.” (2 Cor 5.10) The passage is no less relevant, however, also to the leaders of the Jews—I mean the scribes and Pharisees—who rejected faith in Christ and were guilty of destroying themselves and others. Their attitude was hostile, in fact, and they took issue with the Incarnation of the Only-begotten;  they  “took  away  the  key  of knowledge,” as he says himself, not entering themselves or allowing others to enter. (Lk 11.52) If he is also long-suffering, therefore, he still will certainly not absolve the guilty who have warred against the true faith.
