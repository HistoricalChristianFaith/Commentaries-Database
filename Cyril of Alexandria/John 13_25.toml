The Evangelist tells us that he was himself the object of special honor and love on the part of Christ our Savior. He reclines next to Jesus, actually in the very bosom of the Lord, considering this a token of Christ’s surpassing affection toward him. Those who are pure in heart are most especially near to God and in the highest place of honor. For the Savior himself assigns them this conspicuous honor when he says that the pure in heart shall be blessed for they shall see God. … To those who keep their mind unstained by the world and from an empty preoccupation with the things of this life, it does seem that Christ reveals his own peculiar glory by a subtle and perhaps incomprehensible process, thereby showing also the glory of the Father, which must be what Jesus meant when he said, “Whoever has seen me has seen the Father.”
