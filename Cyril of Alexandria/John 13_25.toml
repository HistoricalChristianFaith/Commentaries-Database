The Evangelist tells us that he was himself the object of special honor and love on the part of Christ our Savior. He reclines next to Jesus, actually in the very bosom of the Lord, considering this a token of Christ's surpassing affection toward him. Those who are pure in heart are most especially near to God and in the highest place of honor. For the Savior himself assigns them this conspicuous honor when he says that the pure in heart shall be blessed for they shall see God. … To those who keep their mind unstained by the world and from an empty preoccupation with the things of this life, it does seem that Christ reveals his own peculiar glory by a subtle and perhaps incomprehensible process, thereby showing also the glory of the Father, which must be what Jesus meant when he said, "Whoever has seen me has seen the Father."

Notice again how effectually the very wise Evangelist spurs us on to a desire to live, as far as possible, in the manner most accordant with reason, and to train up the keenness of our intellectual powers so as to be able, and that with perfect ease, to act in obedience to the Divine intentions, and to endeavour, as far as in us lies, to thoroughly fulfil the conditions of the vision of God. He tells us that he was himself the object of special honour and love on the part of Christ our Saviour, so as even to recline next Him, actually in the very bosom of the Lord, deeming this circumstance a token of His surpassing affection towards him. Nearest therefore to God, and as it were in the highest place in His honour, will most especially be those whose heart is pure: and to them also the Saviour Himself assigns conspicuous honour when He says that the pure in heart shall be blessed, for they shall see God. And we shall bring forward, as evidence of the truth of this saying, even this very wise Evangelist himself. For he has seen the glory of Christ, according to his own words, for he says: I beheld His glory, the glory as of the Only-begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth. For surely not with bodily eyes could any one gaze at the nature of Him Who to every creature is absolutely invisible. For, according to the Saviour's words: No man hath seen the Father, save He Which is from God, that is, the Son; He hath seen the Father. To those however who keep their mind untainted by worldly stain, and freed from vain imagination whose only concern is with this life, it seems that Christ reveals His own peculiar glory by a subtle and perhaps incomprehensible process, thereby showing forth also the glory of the Father. For it must have been with this meaning that He said: He that hath seen Me hath seen the Father.
