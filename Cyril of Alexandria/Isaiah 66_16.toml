“For he will come like fire.” … For he will descend from heaven in the glory of God the Father and with the angels. This is his chariot, as it is praised in the Psalms: “The chariot of the Lord is ten thousand in dimensions with thousands of those rejoicing.” For he will come to give judgment in anger and to cast them off with a flame of fire. For “casting off” means rejection, just as he says to those who are dead in their sins, “Depart from me, you evildoers.”
