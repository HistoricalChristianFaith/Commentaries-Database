Prey will not be taken in advance. Sound of whips, sound of rumbling  wheels,  pursuing  horses,  hurtling  chariots,  charging  horsemen, flashing swords, gleaming weapons, numbers of wounded, heavy casualties. There was no respite for its nations; they will be weak in their bodies from the great degree of prostitution. Again the treatment is developed on the basis of what normally happens. Bird  catchers,  you  see,  envelop  the  densely  compact  bushes with nets, and in many cases catch those hidden under them by laying hold of them—no mean feat. He says that prey will not be taken in advance by them; in other words, some would not hunt as  in  the  past,  seizing  others’  possessions  for  themselves,  nor would there be a snare and trap for the weaker ones, since a different concern occupied them and a struggle for the ultimate hung over them with the sound of whips being heard there. I have the impression that once again the prophet describes clearly the tumult arising from war, as though before his eyes. He  observes,  for  example,  how  the  city  rings  to  the  sound  of horses and is struck with the wheels of chariots, men in gleaming battle armor plundering it, the wreckers beyond counting, and its houses shaken down (he mentions heavy casualties, note). He is aghast at the fact that a vast number of nations are assembled in it, many faint-hearted, stricken with culpable weakness and a  prey  to  deep  fear.  Immediately  he  supplies  the  reason,  that they will be weak in their bodies from the great degree of prostitution; depraved and vicious in their habits, idolaters to boot, and wrongfully disposed to error, consequently they will duly be weak and timid, unable even to give a thought to resistance.

O city of blood, completely false, full of iniquity. He  gave  it  the  name city of blood; those who reigned   over Nineveh were bloodthirsty and disposed to murder, while on a different note its inhabitants were warlike, ever on the alert to conduct wild sorties against whomever they met. He says it was false because awash with idols, whose utter  falsity  could  not  be  gainsaid;  its  handmade  gods,  falsely named, stole glory from the Divinity, being only “silver and gold, works of human hands,” as Scripture says. Jeremiah in his wisdom somewhere calls it “a land of statues.” In another way as well, it could be understood to be false, the falsity being taken to refer to knavery, scheming, and deceit that is hated by God, obviously because accompanying iniquity. After all, where there are deceit and scheming, there follows without question iniquitous behavior as well. Now, Jerusalem, killer of the Lord, was also city of blood, completely false, full of iniquity; we recall Christ’s words, “Jerusalem, Jerusalem, who kills the prophets and stones those sent to her.” He also said somewhere in the statement of the prophets, “Woe to  them,  because  they  have  strayed  from  me.  They  are  in  a wretched  state  for  their  impious  behavior  to  me.  I  redeemed them, but they told lies against me.” They impugned the glory of Christ, in fact, once by saying that it was through Beelzebul that he expelled the demons, at another time by calling him a drunkard as well as a Samaritan, and other vile things. In fact, only their slanderous speech would be capable of the things they presumed to say.
