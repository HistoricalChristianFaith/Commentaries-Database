As if not knowing how to continue in the right beginnings. Now Christ disdains to dwell with those who are thus disposed. Hence He says, How long shall I be with you, and suffer you? Feeling troubled with their company, because of their evil deeds.
Now before not his father but the devil possessed him, but now the Evangelist adds that the people were astonished at the greatness of God, saying, And all were amazed at the mighty power of God, which he says, because of the gift of Christ, who conferred on the holy Apostles also the power of working divine miracles, and having the mastery over evil spirits.

The man was thoroughly an unbeliever and perverse, refusing the straight paths, straying from the mark, and wandering from the right ways. Christ does not want to be with those who think this way and have fallen into this wickedness. If one may speak in the manner of people, Christ is tired and weary of them. He teaches us this saying, “How long am I to be with you and bear with you?” The father says that the disciples, who received at Christ’s wish power to cast them out, were powerless to cast out evil spirits. He finds fault with the grace itself, rather than with those who received it. It was wicked blasphemy, because if grace is powerless, the fault and blame is not with those who received it but rather with the grace itself. Anyone who wishes may see that the grace that worked in them was Christ’s grace. Commentary on Luke, Homily

The father of the demoniac was rude and not courteous. He did not simply ask for the healing of the child, and in so doing crown the healer with praises. On the contrary, he spoke disrespectfully of the disciples and found fault with the grace given them. “I brought him,” he says, “to your disciples, and they could not cast it out.” It was owing to your lack of faith that the grace did not help. Do you not understand that you were the cause that the child was not delivered from his severe illness? Commentary on Luke, Homily

This lesson proves that he delivered us from the power of unclean spirits. We heard read that a man ran toward him from among the crowd and related the intolerable illness of his son. He said that he was cruelly torn by an evil spirit and suffered violent convulsions. The manner of his approach was not free from fault, because he shouted loudly against the company of the holy apostles, saying that they could not rebuke Satan. It would have been more fitting for him to honor Jesus when asking his aid and imploring grace. He grants us our request when we honor and confide in him as being the Almighty, whose power nothing can withstand. Commentary on Luke, Homily
