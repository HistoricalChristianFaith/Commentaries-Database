In the passage that has just been read, Christ says, "For which is the chief, he that reclines at table, or he that serves? Is it not he that reclines? But I am in the midst of you as he that serves." When Christ says this, who can be so obstinate and unyielding as not to put away all pride and banish from his mind the love of empty honor? Christ is ministered to by the whole creation of rational and holy beings. He is praised by the seraphim. He is tended by the services of the universe. He is the equal of God the Father in his throne and kingdom. Taking a servant's place, he washed the holy apostles' feet. In another way, Jesus holds the post of service, because of the appointed time in the flesh. Blessed Paul witnesses to this. He writes, "I say that Christ was a minister of the circumcision to fulfill the promises of the fathers, and the Gentiles will praise God for mercy." He who is ministered to became a minister. The Lord of glory made himself poor, leaving us an example, as it is written.
