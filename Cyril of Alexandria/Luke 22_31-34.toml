Or to show that men being as nought, (as regards human nature, and the proneness of our minds to fall,) it is not meet that they should wish to be above their brethren. Therefore passing by all the others, He comes to Peter, who was the chief of them, saying, But I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not.

Marvel then at the superabundance of the Divine forbearance: lest He should cause a disciple to despair, before the crime was committed, He granted pardon, and again restored him to his Apostolic rank, saying, Strengthen thy brethren.

To humble our tendency for pride and to repress ambitious feelings, Christ shows that even he who seemed to be great is nothing and infirm. He therefore passes by the other disciples and turns to him who is the foremost and sat at the head of the company. He says, “Satan has many times desired to sift you as wheat, that is, to search and try you and expose you to intolerable blows.” Satan usually attacks people who are above average. Like some fierce and arrogant barbarian, Satan challenges to one-to-one combat those of high reputation in the ways of piety. He challenged Job, but his patience defeated him. The boaster fell. The endurance of that triumphant hero conquered him. Satan preys on human nature, because it is infirm and easy to overcome. He is harsh, pitiless and unappeasable in heart. As the sacred Scripture says of him, “His heart is hard as a stone, and he stands like an anvil that cannot be beaten out.” Christ’s might, however, places him under the feet of the saints. He has said, “Behold, I have given you to tread on serpents and scorpions and upon all the power of the enemy, and nothing shall hurt you.”

In the passion of his zeal, Peter professed steadfastness and endurance to the last extremity, saying that he would courageously resist the terrors of death and count chains as nothing. In so doing, he erred from what was right. When the Savior told Peter that he would be weak and contradict the Lord, he should not have loudly protested the contrary. The Truth could not lie. Peter should have rather asked strength from Christ, either that he might not suffer this or that he might be rescued immediately from harm. He was fervent in spirit, warm in his love toward Christ, and of unrestrained zeal in rightly performing those duties which fit a disciple in his service to his master. Peter declares that he will endure to the last extremity. Christ rebuked him for foolishly speaking against what was foreknown and for his unreasonable haste in contradicting the Savior’s words. For this reason he says, “Truly I tell you, that the rooster will not crow tonight, until you have three times denied me.” This proved true. Let us not think highly of ourselves, even if we see ourselves greatly distinguished for our virtues. Let us rather offer the praises of our thanks to Christ who redeems us and who grants us even the desire to be able to act correctly.

Admire the beautiful skill of the passage and the surpassing greatness of the divine gentleness! He fears that Peter’s impending fall would lead the disciple to desperation, as though he would be expelled from the glories of the apostleship. Peter’s former following of Christ would then lose its reward, because of his inability to bear the fear of death and his denying him. Christ therefore immediately fills him with good hope. He grants him the confident assurance that he will be counted worthy of the promised blessings and gather the fruits of faithfulness. He says, “When you are converted, strengthen your brothers.” O what great and incomparable kindness! The affliction of faithlessness had not yet made the disciple ill, and already he has received the medicine of forgiveness.
