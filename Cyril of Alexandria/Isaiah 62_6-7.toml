Jerusalem … there is nothing like you; for there is nothing like you among us. Nevertheless, because whatever he has surpasses the human by the excess of glory, God outstrips us by the glory of his divinity in his being good and compassionate.…If you could correct yourself, Jerusalem, that is, if you could change to spiritual worship, if you could … take notice of the things written by Moses, if you would receive God’s grace through faith and make his praise known through the earth, then you would make known the shining glory that is in Christ. This is the glory by which the Lord has sworn, since he has no one better to swear by. He has sworn “by his right arm,” in that those who of old afflicted you with great injustice would no longer get in your way.
