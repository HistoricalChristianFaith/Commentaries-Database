An oracle for Nineveh. A book of a vision of Nahum of Elkosh (v.1). 
He begins by specifying the purpose of the prophecy, and helpfully makes precise the focus of his attention.   He then makes clear who is speaking and from where he comes, saying it is an oracle; that is to say, the prophecy “taken up” and set in our hands has to do with nothing else than Nineveh—in other words, let the oracle of the prophecy be taken as Nineveh.  The book bears the inscription, an oracle of Nahum of Elkosh, which is definitely a town somewhere in the country of the Jews; we shall take the phrase of Elkosh to refer not to his father but to a place, making this claim on the basis of the tradition of what has been conveyed to us.
