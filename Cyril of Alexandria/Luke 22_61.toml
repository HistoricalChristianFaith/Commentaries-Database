This miserable act arose from the affliction of human cowardice. The disciple’s conscience condemned him. The proof of this is his grieving immediately afterwards and his tears of repentance that fell from his eyes as for a serious sin. It says, “Having gone out, he wept bitterly,” after Christ had looked at him and reminded him of what he had said to Peter.
