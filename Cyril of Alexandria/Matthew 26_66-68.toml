This is clearly a reflection of the holy prophet’s words, “Be appalled at this, O heavens, and shudder with great fear,” says “the Lord,” the one true God, the king of kings and Lord of lords. He was dishonored by us: first he endured blows, and then he endured laughter from the impious, exemplifying the highest forbearance yet presented to us. How can the one who “examines heart and mind,” the one who illumines prophets, not know “who strikes you”?
