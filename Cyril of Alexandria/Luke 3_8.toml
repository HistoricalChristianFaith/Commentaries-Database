For what profits the nobleness we inherit through the flesh, unless it be supported by kindred feelings in us? It is folly then to boast of our worthy ancestors, and fall away from their virtues.

Can you see how most skillfully he humbles their foolish pride and shows that their being born of Abraham according to the flesh brings them no profit? Of what benefit is nobility of birth, if people's deeds are not accordingly earnest and they fail to imitate the virtue of their ancestors? The Savior says to them, "If you were Abraham's children, you would do what Abraham did." The relationship that God requires is one of character and manners. Thus it is useless to boast of holy and good parents, while we fall short of their virtue.But, says the Jew, if it is so, how is the seed of Abraham still to be multiplied? How can God's promise to him hold true, according to which he will multiply his seed as the stars of heaven? By the calling of the Gentiles, O Jew! God said to Abraham himself, "Through Isaac shall your descendants be named," adding that he has set Abraham as a father of many nations. But the phrase "through Isaac" means "according to promise." He is set, therefore, as a father of many nations by faith, that is to say, in Christ.
As can be seen, the blessed Baptist called them stones, because they as yet did not know the one who is by nature God. They were in error and in their great folly worshiped the creation instead of the Creator. But they were called and became the sons of Abraham and, by believing in Christ, acknowledged him who is by nature God.
