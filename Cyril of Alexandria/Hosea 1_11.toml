“They come up out of the land,” namely, they will live the life of the saints as well, “for great is the day of Jezreel.” Indeed, great is the day of Christ, when he will raise to life all the dead. In fact, he will descend from heaven and sit on his glorious throne. “And he will give everyone according to his works.” Therefore if one wishes to understand by “day” the time of the visitation—when the remission of sins is given by Christ to the Greeks, the Judaeans and those who have sinned against him—this will not deviate from the true words. For David too indicated the time of the coming of our Savior by saying, “This is the day that the Lord has made; let us be glad and rejoice in it.”
