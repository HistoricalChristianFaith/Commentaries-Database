For the miracle which was performed escaped not the Lord, but He who knew all things asks as if He were ignorant.

"For I know," he said, "that power has gone out from me." It transcends our order, or probably that even of the angels, to send out any power of their own nature, as something that is of themselves. Such an act is an attribute appropriate only to the nature that is above everything and supreme. Every created being God endows with power, whether of healing or something similar, does not possess it of itself but as a thing given it by God. All things are given and worked in the creature, and it can do nothing of itself. As God he said, "I know that power has gone forth from me."
