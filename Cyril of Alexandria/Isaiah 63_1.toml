The only-begotten Word of God ascended in the heavens with his flesh united to him, and this was a new sight in the heavens. The multitude of holy angels was astounded seeing the king of glory and the Lord of hosts in a form similar to ours. And they said, "Who is this that comes from Edom [that is, from earth], in crimsoned garments, from Bosor." But "Bosor" is to be interpreted as "flesh" or "anguish and affliction."
