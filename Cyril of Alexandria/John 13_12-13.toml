Christ does not hold the title Lord as an empty name of honor like we do when we are decorated by the favor of others with titles that surpass our nature and merit, even though we remain mere servants by nature. Rather, Jesus is Lord by nature, possessing authority over the universe as God, as it is said somewhere by the psalmist, “all things are your servants.” Also, he is Master [or Teacher] by nature, for “all wisdom comes from the Lord,” and all understanding comes by him. For inasmuch as he is wisdom he makes all intelligent beings wise, and in every rational creature, both in heaven and on earth, he implants the intelligence that is appropriate for it.
