When Christ came from heaven, he bound the leaders of the demons in hell. This is clear from the way in which he commanded the spirits, lest they be thrown into the abyss. For he bound some and ordered others to depart, as we can see from sayings like “Look, I have given you power over unclean spirits”; “Cast out demons,” and so on. Afterwards, in order to perfect the punishment of those whom he had earlier bound, he cast them into eternal fire.
