We say, therefore, that he came forth from a woman, and in the likeness of sinful flesh, he who for our sake became as we are and yet is above us insofar as he is understood as God.â€¦ The same was at once God and man. I cannot understand how these people pillage this wonderful and noble economy of the Only-Begotten. They connect a man to him in terms of a relationship adorned with external honors and radiant in a glory which is not his, for then he is not truly God. They treat him as someone who has fellowship and participation with God, and is thus a falsely-named son, a saved savior, a redeemed redeemer; all of which contradicts what the blessed Paul wrote.
