Here too let the prophet Jeremiah say of the race of Israel, “Who will grant for my head to be waters, and my eyes a fountain of tears, that I may weep for this people day and night?” “For what lamentation can suffice for those who fell into the pit of destruction because of their wicked conduct to Christ, and for guilt so great, that not with words only did they grieve him, and mock him with blasphemous cries, but even laid sinful hands upon him and prepared the snare of death for him?… “The heavens themselves were astonished, and shuddered very greatly,” says the Lord. For the Lord of earth and heaven, the Creator and Maker of all, the King of kings and Lord of Lords, he who is of such surpassing greatness in glory and majesty, the foundation of everything, and that in which all things exist and abide—for all things exist in him12—he who is the breath of all the holy spirits in heaven is scorned like one of us and patiently endures beatings.
