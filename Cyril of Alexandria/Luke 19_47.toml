As one who possessed authority over the temple, he took care of itâ€¦. Their duty was to worship him, as One who with God the Father was Lord of the temple. In their great folly, they did not do this, but rather being savagely eager for hatred, they set up the sharp sting of wickedness against him and hurried to murder, which is the neighbor and brother of envy. It says that they sought to destroy him but could not, because all the people were hanging on him to hear him. Does this not make the punishment of the scribes and Pharisees, and all the rulers of the Jewish ranks, heavier? The whole people, consisting of unlearned persons, hung upon the sacred doctrines and drank the saving word like the rain. They were ready to produce the fruits of faith and place their neck under his commandments. They who had the position to urge on their people to this very thing savagely rebelled and wickedly sought the opportunity for murder. With unbridled violence, they ran upon the rocks, not accepting the faith and wickedly hindering others. Commentary on Luke, Homily
