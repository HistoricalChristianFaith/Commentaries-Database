It is a work that is necessary, and it is the fruit of admirable foresight to avoid these things that are announced and not to wait for the end of the unhappy times but to stand outside of all wrath and judgment.… “I have restrained my wrath for the sake of my name,” and I will establish my glorious deeds over you lest you be destroyed.… We see in this the greatness of God’s love; he mixes in with unhappy events glorious things lest they be totally destroyed.
