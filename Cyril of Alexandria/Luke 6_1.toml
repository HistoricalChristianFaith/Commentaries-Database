But the Pharisees and Scribes not knowing the Holy Scriptures agreed together to find fault with Christ's disciples, as it follows, And certain of the Pharisees said to them, Why do you Tell me now, when a table is set before you on the sabbath day; do you not break bread? Why then do you blame others? .
