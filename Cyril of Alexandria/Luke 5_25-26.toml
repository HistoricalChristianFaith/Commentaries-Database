A place still remains open for disbelief when it is said, “Your sins are forgiven you”—for people cannot see the forgiven sins with the eyes of the body. By contrast, the putting off of the disease and the paralytic’s rising up and walking carries with it a clear demonstration of a godlike power. Jesus adds, “Rise, take up your bed and go home.” And he returned to his house, delivered from the infirmity from which he had so long suffered. This very fact proves that the Son of man has power on earth to forgive sins. But to whom does he refer when he says this? Himself only, or us too? Both the one and the other are true. For he forgives sins as the incarnate God, the Lord of the law. We too have received from him this splendid and most admirable grace. He has crowned human nature with this great honor also, having even said to the holy apostles, “Truly, I say to you, whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.” And again, “If you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven; if you retain the sins of any, they are retained.” And what is the occasion on which we find him speaking this to them? It was after he had trampled on the power of death and risen from the grave, when he breathed on them and said, “Receive the Holy Spirit.” After he had made them partakers of his nature and bestowed upon them the indwelling of the Holy Spirit, he also made them sharers of his glory, by giving them power both to remit and to bind sins. And as we have been commanded to perform this very act, how much more must he himself remit sins, when he gives to others authority to enable them to do so?
