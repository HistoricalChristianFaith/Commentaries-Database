"Therefore we groan in our present state, desirous to be clothed with our heavenly body." Thus we groan, as those weighed down by corruption. We long to put on the dwelling that is on high and that comes from heaven, which is to say immortality. We groan, not seeking freedom from what now exists but rather asking that it be clothed with incorruptibility, which is a dwelling not made by human hands. "And if we have clothed ourselves with it, we will not be found naked." It is indeed true that "a corruptible body weighs down the soul." Let us make the oppression of this corruption an occasion for groaning. Let us long to put on the dwelling that is above and comes from heaven, that is, immortality. What, then, does "to put on" mean, if not that incorruptibility will encompass the present body? - "Fragment on 2 Corinthians 5.2"
