Blessed Peter, considering within himself the force of what Christ said, rightly asked which of the two was meant: the declaration referred to all believers, or only to them? That is, to those who had been called to the discipleship, and especially honored by the grant of apostolic powers?

What is our Lord’s reply? He makes use of a clear and very evident example to show that the commandment especially belongs to those who occupy a more influential position and have been admitted into the rank of teachers. “Who,” he says, “is the faithful and wise servant, whom his lord will set over his household, to give the allowance of food at its season?” …This is the simple and plain meaning of the passage. If we now fix our mind accurately upon it, we will see what it signifies and how useful it is for the benefit of those who have been called to the office of apostle, that is, to the office of teacher. The Savior has ordained faithful men of great understanding, and well instructed in the sacred doctrines, as stewards over his servants who have been won by faith to the acknowledgment of his glory. He has ordained them, commanding them to give their fellow servants their allowance of food. He does not do this simply and without distinction but rather at its proper season. I mean spiritual food, as is sufficient and fitting for each individual.

He says, “Neglecting the duty of being diligent and faithful, and despising watchfulness in these things as being superfluous, he lets his mind grow intoxicated with worldly cares. He is seduced into improper courses, dragging by force and oppressing those who are subject to him. If he is not giving them their portion, he will be in utter wretchedness.” I think this and this only is the meaning of his being cut in two. “His portion,” he says, “will be with the unbelievers.” Whoever has done wrong to the glory of Christ or attempted to disregard the flock entrusted to his charge does not differ in any way from those who do not know him. These persons will be rightly counted among those who have no love for him.
