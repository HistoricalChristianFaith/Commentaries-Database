He has taken hold of Israel—not of the Israel according to the flesh, who prides himself on the bare name, but of him who is so after the Spirit, in accordance with the true meaning of the appellation. The latter comprises those who look to God, believe in him and obtain through the Son the adoption of sons, according to the Word that was spoken and the promise made to the prophets and patriarchs of old. It has, however, a true application also to the carnal Israel, for many thousands and ten thousands of them believed. But he has remembered his mercy as he promised to Abraham and has accomplished what he said to him: that in his seed shall all the tribes of the earth be blessed. This promise was not in the act of fulfillment by the impending birth of our common Savior Christ—who is the seed of Abraham, in whom the Gentiles are blessed. For he took on him the seed of Abraham, according to the apostles’ words, and fulfilled the promise made unto the fathers.
