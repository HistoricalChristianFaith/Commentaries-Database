You have heard Christ say, “Father, if you will, remove this cup from me.” Was then his passion an involuntary act? Was the need for him to suffer or the violence of those who plotted against him stronger than his own will? We say no. His passion was a voluntary act, although in another respect it was severe, because it implied the rejection and destruction of the synagogue of the Jews.…Since it was impossible for Christ not to endure the passion, he submitted to it, because God the Father so willed it with him.

The passion of grief, or affliction or sore distress as we may call it, cannot have reference to the divine nature of the Word, which is not able to suffer. That is impossible since it transcends all passion. We say that the incarnate Word also willed to submit himself to the measure of human nature by suffering what belongs to it. He is said to have hungered although he is life, the cause of life and the living bread. He was also weary from a long journey although he is the Lord of powers. It also is said that he was grieved and seemed to be capable of anguish. It would not have been fitting for him who submitted himself to emptiness and stood in the measure of human nature to have seemed unwilling to endure human things. The Word of God the Father, therefore, is altogether free from all passion. For the appointed time’s sake, he wisely submitted himself to the weaknesses of humankind in order that he might not seem to refuse that which the time required. He even obeyed human customs and laws. He still did not bear this in his own [divine] nature.

God the Father had pity on earth’s inhabitants who were in misery, caught in the snares of sin, and liable to death and corruption. A tyrant’s hand made them bow and herds of devils enslaved them. He sent his Son from heaven to be a Savior and Deliverer. He was made like unto us in form. He knew he would suffer. The shame of his passion was not the fruit of his own will, but he still consented to undergo it that he might save the earth. God the Father wanted that, from his great kindness and love for humanity. He “so loved the world that he gave even his only-begotten Son, that whosoever believes in him should not perish but have everlasting life.” As to the disgrace of his passion, Christ did not want to suffer.… He was obedient to the Father, even to death, and the death of the cross at that.
