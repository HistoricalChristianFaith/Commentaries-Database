Neither do we say that the Word of God dwelled, as in an ordinary man, in the one born of the holy Virgin, in order that Christ might not be thought to be a man bearing God. For even if the Word both “dwelt among us,” and it is said that in Christ “dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily,” we do not think that, being made flesh, the Word is said to dwell in him just as in those who are holy, and we do not define the indwelling in him to be the same. But united kata phusin, and not changed into flesh, the Word produced an indwelling such as the soul of man might be said to have in its own body.
