By its shadows, the law prefigured from of old the mystery of Christ. He is himself the witness of this when he said to the Jews, "If you would have believed Moses, you would have also believed me, for he wrote concerning me." Christ is presented everywhere by means of shadows and types, both as slain for us, as the innocent and true Lamb, and as sanctifying us by his life-giving blood. We further find the words of the holy prophets in complete agreement with those of most wise Moses. Paul says, "When the fullness of time was come," the only-begotten Word of God submitted to the emptying of himself, the birth in the flesh of a woman, and subjection to the law according to the measure that was fitting for human nature. He was also then sacrificed for us, as the innocent and true lamb on the fourteenth day of the first month. This feast day was called Pascha, a word belonging to the Hebrew language and signifying the passing over.…The name of the feast on which Emmanuel bore for us the saving cross was the Pascha.
