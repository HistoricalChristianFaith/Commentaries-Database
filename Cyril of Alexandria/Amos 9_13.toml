and all the hills shall flow with it: The hills being second and of lower ranking in virtue compared with those more conspicuous for it; there are measures of holiness and righteousness in churches, and as Paul says, ‘according to the grace given to each one’ by God, who distributes such things. They will grow together, then he says, luxuriant and fruitful, with a mind richly bedecked with the correctness of divine teachings.
