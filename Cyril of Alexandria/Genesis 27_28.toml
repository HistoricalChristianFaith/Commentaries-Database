These things therefore fit with Christ and also fit quite reasonably with the new people: “May God give you of the dew of heaven and of the fatness of the earth and plenty of grain and wine.” The dew of heaven and the fatness of the earth, that is, the Word, was given to us by the Father, together with the participation through the Spirit, and therefore we were made participants in the divine nature through him. And we also received plenty of grain and wine, that is, strength and happiness. In fact, it is said truly, “Bread strengthens the heart of man, and wine makes glad his heart.” Bread is the symbol of spiritual strength, wine of the physical. They are given to those who are in Christ through him. In which other way were we made stable and firm in piety and immovable and aware to think the right things? Certainly the power “to trample serpents and scorpions underfoot and the whole power of the enemy” was given to us. This, I believe, is the meaning of the abundance of grain. But we have also received wine. “We rejoice in hope,” and “we have become glad,” according to Scripture. We expect heavenly dwellings, an eternal life in incorruption, and to reign together with Christ. Therefore these things may be said about us.
