What is the meaning of “Prepare the way of the Lord”? Make ready for the reception of whatever Christ may wish to enact; withdraw your hearts from the shadow of the law; cease from the types; think no more perversely.… “Make the paths of our God straight.” For every path that leads unto good is straight and smooth and easy; but the other is crooked that leads down to wickedness those who walk therein. For of such it is written, “Whose paths are crooked, and the tracks of their wheels awry.” Straightforwardness, therefore, of the mind is as it were a straight path, having no crookedness.
