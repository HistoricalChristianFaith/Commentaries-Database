The prophet Jeremiah also blamed the Jewish multitudes with their rulers because of their excessive arrogance, saying, “To whom shall I speak and testify, and he will hear? Behold, their ears are uncircumcised, and they cannot hear. Behold, the Word of the Lord has become to them a derision. They will not hear it.” And in another place he spoke of Jerusalem: “We healed Babel, and she was not healed. Let us leave her and depart every one to his land, because her judgment has reached to the heavens.”
