The vessel was severely tossed by the violence of the tempest and the breaking of the waves. And along with the ship, the faith of the disciples also was tossed, so to speak, by similar agitations. But Christ, whose authority extends over all, immediately arose. He at once appeased the storm, restrained the blasts of wind, quieted their fear and yet further proved by his actions that he is God at whom all created things tremble and quake and to whose nods is subject the very nature of the elements. He rebuked the tempest, and Matthew says that the manner of the rebuke was with God-like authority. He tells us that our Lord said to the sea: “Peace! Be still!” What can there be more grand than this in majesty? Or what can equal its sublimity? Appropriately worthy of God is the word and the might of the commandment, so that we too may utter the praise written in the book of Psalms: “You rule the power of the sea. You still the turbulence of its waves.” He too has himself said somewhere by one of the holy prophets, “Why do you not fear me,” says the Lord, “nor tremble at my presence? I who have set the sand as the bound of the sea, a commandment forever, and it has not passed it.” For the sea is subject to the will of him who made all creation and is, as it were, placed under the Creator’s feet, varying its motions at all times according to his good pleasure and yielding submission to his lordly will.
