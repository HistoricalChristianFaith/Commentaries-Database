God has called the devil the ruler of this world not as though it was actually true, or as though this overruling power were a dignity inherent in his being, but rather because he obtained the glory of ruling through fraud and covetousness. The devil is still influencing and ruling over those who are astray by reason of the wicked purpose that is in them that binds their minds in error and inextricably entangles them in the noose of captivity, even though it is in their power to escape by being converted through faith in Christ to a recognition of the one who is truly God. Satan is merely a pretender to the title of ruler and has no natural right to it as opposed to God, and he maintains it only through the abominable wickedness of those who are astray.
