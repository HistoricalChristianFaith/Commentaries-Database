Soft words are also given them by their subjects, as it follows, And they that exercise authority upon them are called benefactors. Now they truly as alien from the sacred law are subject to these evils, but your preeminence is in humility, as it follows, But ye shall not be so.

Let us avoid the love of pride and deliver ourselves from the blame attached to the desire for leadership. To act this way makes us like Christ, who submitted to empty himself for our sakes. Arrogance and haughtiness of mind make us plainly resemble the princes of the Gentiles, who always love to act arrogantly. It may even be fitting in their case. "They are called," he says, "benefactors that are flattered as such by their inferiors." Let them be like this. They are not within the pale of the sacred laws or obedient to the Lord's will. They are the victims of these afflictions. It should not be so with us. Let our exaltation rather consist in humility and our glorying in not loving glory. Let our desire be for those things that please God, while we keep in mind what the wise man says to us, "The greater you are, humble yourself the more, and you will find grace before the Lord." He rejects the proud and counts the boastful as his enemies but crowns with honors the meek and lowly in mind.
