I think that we should examine the words used by Christ, because they were a correction for the lack of love to God of which the scribes and Pharisees were guilty. When they ask whether he is truly the Christ and could learn this very thing, he answers them, "If I tell you, you will not believe; and if I ask, you will not return an answer."
