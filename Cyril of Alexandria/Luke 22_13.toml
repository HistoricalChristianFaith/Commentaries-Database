When the disciples had prepared the Pascha, Christ ate it with them. Christ was patient toward the traitor, and from his infinite lovingkindness condescended to admit him to the table. Judas was already a traitor, because Satan was staying within him. What did Christ also say to the holy apostles? "I have desired a desire to eat this Pascha with you." Let us examine the deep meaning of this expression. Let us search out the meaning concealed in there, and let us search for what the Savior intended.I have already said that the greedy disciple was seeking an opportunity to betray Christ. So Judas might not deliver him to his murderers before the feast of the Pascha, the Savior did not openly state either the house or the person with whom he would celebrate the feast. He explains to them the cause of his unwillingness to tell them openly with whom he would lodge. He says, "I have desired a desire to eat with you this Pascha," apparently meaning, "I have used every effort to enable me to escape the wickedness of the traitor, that I might not endure my passion before the time."
