When Jesus has shown in advance and rightly defined who those that love him are and of what blessings they will partake, he at once proceeds to treat of others who have not yet chosen to love him. "For they will not keep my words," he says, for this is the meaning of the saying, "He will not keep my word," spoken as if it was about one man, even though it has a broad and generic signification. And what he says here has a very apt connection with what precedes. For, if the keeping of his commandments or his word is a clear proof of love toward him, surely the converse of this will be true. For treating his bidding as of no account and thrusting his commandment aside will be a sign that we refuse to love him, since these are the acts of people inured to evildoing. But just as he promised that together with God the Father he would abide with those who keep his laws, for the same reason, I think, he will pass away from and wholly abandon those who do the reverse. For thus the truth of Solomon"s saying will be seen: "Into the soul of the one who makes iniquity wisdom will not enter or dwell in the body given over to sin." For in common life you can observe that a similar result follows: for does not a person gain a reputation by conversing with those who are like-minded and who choose the same path of life, rather than with others? And "every creature loves his own," according to the saying, and "people will seek union with his own kind." And if it seems most desirable even among ourselves to live with those of similar habits to ourselves, how can we escape the reflection that this is still more the case with God? For as he is good by nature and the beginning and source of all virtue, he takes up his abode not in the lovers of wickedness but in the workers of virtue and disdains the impure. - "Commentary on the Gospel of John 10.14.24"
