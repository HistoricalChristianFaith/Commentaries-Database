To prepare the disciples’ minds, the Savior of all tells them that he will suffer the passion on the cross and death in the flesh as soon as he has gone up to Jerusalem. He added that he would also rise wiping out the pain and obliterating the shame of the passion by the greatness of the miracle. It was glorious and worthy of God to be able to break the bonds of death and hurry back to life. According to the expression of wise Paul, the resurrection from the dead testifies that he is God and the Son of God. Commentary on Luke, Homily

The Savior of all then declared these things beforehand to the holy apostles. It says, “They did not understand what was said, and the word was hid from them.” They did not then know accurately what the holy prophets proclaimed. Although [Peter] who was first among the disciples heard the Savior once say that he should be crucified, die and arise, he did not yet understand the depth of the mystery. He resisted, saying: “Far be that from you, Lord. This will not happen to you.” He was rebuked for speaking this because he did not know the meaning of the relevant Scripture inspired by God. When Christ arose from the dead, he opened their eyes, as another of the holy Evangelists wrote. They were enlightened, being enriched with the abundant participation of the Spirit.

He told them beforehand what would happen so that they might be aware that he foreknew his passion. Although it was in his power easily to escape, Christ still went ahead to willingly meet it. Saying, “Behold, we go up to Jerusalem,” he urgently testified and commanded them to remember what had been foretold. He necessarily added that the holy prophets had foretold all these things. As in the person of Christ, Isaiah says, “I have given my back to scourging, and my cheeks to buffetings; and I have not turned away my face from the shame of spitting.” In another place, the prophet says of him, “As a sheep he was led unto the slaughter, and was silent, as a lamb before its shearer.” “All we like sheep have gone astray: every one has gone astray in his path, and the Lord has delivered him up because of our sins.” In the twentysecond psalm, blessed David, painting as it were beforehand the sufferings upon the cross, set before us Jesus speaking as one already hanging on the tree. He says, “But I am a worm, and no man; scorned by men and despised by the people. All who see me mock at me, they make mouths at me, they wag their heads; ‘He committed his cause to the Lord; let him deliver him, let him rescue him, for he delights in him!’ ” Some of the Jews did shake their wicked heads at him, deriding him and saying, “If you are the Son of God, come down now from the cross, and we will believe you.” He said, “They divide my garments among them, and for my raiment they cast lots.” In another place, Christ again says of those that crucified him, “They gave gall for my food, and for my thirst they made me drink vinegar.” Commentary on Luke, Homily

And to convince them that He foreknew His Passion, and of His own accord came toit, that they might not say, &#8220;How has He fallen into the hands of the enemy, who promised us salvation?&#8221; He relates in order the successive events of the Passion; He shall be delivered to the  Gentiles, and shall be mocked, and scourged, and spitted on.
The disciples did not as yet know exactly what the Prophets had foretold, but after He rose again, He opened their understanding that they should understand the Scriptures.
