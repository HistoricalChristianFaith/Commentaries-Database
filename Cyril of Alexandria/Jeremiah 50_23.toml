Let us trample Satan under foot. Let us raise the shout of victory over him now that he is thrown and fallen. Let us exult over the crafty reptile, caught in an inextricable snare. Let us, too, say of him in the words of the prophet Jeremiah, “How is the hammer of the whole earth cut asunder and broken! You are found and also caught because you have stood against the Lord.” Long ago, that is, before the time of the advent of Christ the Savior of all, the universal enemy had somewhat grand and terrible notions about himself.… Therefore, as I said, human nature, as victorious in him, wins the crown. And this in ancient times the Son proclaimed, where, by one of the holy prophets, he thus addresses Satan, “Behold, I am against you, O destroying mountain, says the Lord, that destroys all the earth.”
