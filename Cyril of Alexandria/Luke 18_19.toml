What reply is made by the all-knowing One of whom it is written that he "takes the wise in their craftiness"? "Why do you call me good? No one is good except one, God." You see how Christ proved immediately that the ruler was neither wise nor learned, although he was the ruler of a synagogue of the Jews. He says, "You did not believe that I am God, and the clothing of the flesh has led you astray. Why did you apply to me titles suitable to the supreme nature alone, while you still assume that I am a mere man like you and not superior to the limits of human nature?" In the nature that transcends all, God alone is found to be good by nature, that is, unchangeably good.… He says, "I do not seem to you to be truly God. Ignorantly and foolishly, you have applied to me the properties and virtues of the divine nature. Why do you then imagine that I, a mere man that never is invested with goodness but only gains it by the assent of the divine will, have the property of the unchangeable nature?" This was the meaning of what Christ spoke.
