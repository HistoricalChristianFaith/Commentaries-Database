This they say, finding fault with themselves, that they had not long ago put Jesus and Lazarus also to death, urging themselves to murder; being angry concerning the believing multitude, as though deprived of their special possessions----those which really belonged to God.

They say this, finding fault with themselves because they had not put both Jesus and Lazarus to death a long time ago, wishing they had murdered them then. They were angry concerning the “believing multitude,” as though they [as the people’s leaders] were being deprived of their special possessions comprised of those who really belonged to God.
