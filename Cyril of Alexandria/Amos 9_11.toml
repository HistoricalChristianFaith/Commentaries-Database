The tent of David means the race of the Jews. It must be known that after Cyrus had freed Israel from captivity, they returned to Judea and built the temple of God. Then, after they had again fortified the cities that had been detroyed before, they lived in security day by day for a long time, that is, for many days and long periods..
While such is the factual reference in the passage, therefore, the deeper meaning closer to reality would be in Christ. You see, when the god and Father raised his tent that had fallen into death-that is, raised the flesh from the ground-and he came back to life, then it was that he restored all human things to their former condition, and imparted a fresh appearance to everything of ours that head been cast down.
