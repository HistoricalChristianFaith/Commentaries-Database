The Nestorians are sensual men, not having the Spirit, because they divide the one Christ and Son and Lord into two sons.â€¦ For they pretend to confess one Christ and Son and say that his person is one, but by dividing him into two separate hypostases they completely sweep away the doctrine of the mystery.
