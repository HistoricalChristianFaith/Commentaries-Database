Levi was a publican, a man greedy for dirty money, filled with an uncontrolled desire to possess, careless of justice in his eagerness to have what did not belong to him. Such was the character of the publicans. Yet he was snatched from the workshop of sin itself and saved when there was no hope for him, at the call of Christ the Savior of us all. For Jesus said to him, “ ‘Follow me.’ And he left all and followed him.” What most wise Paul says is true: “that Christ came to save sinners.” Do you see how the only-begotten Word of God, having taken upon him the flesh, transferred to himself the devil’s goods?
