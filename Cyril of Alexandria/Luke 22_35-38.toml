Our Lord had foretold to Peter that he should deny Him; namely, at the time of His being taken. But having once made mention of His being taken captive, He next announces the struggle that would ensue against the Jews. Hence it is said, And he said unto them, When I sent you without purse, &c.For the Saviour had sent the holy Apostles to preach in the cities and towns the kingdom of heaven, bidding them to take no thought of the things of the body, but to place their whole hope of salvation in Him.

Or else; When our Lord says, He who hath a purse, let him take it, likewise a scrip, His discourse He addressed to His disciples, but in reality He regards every individual Jew; as if He says, If any Jew is rich in resources, let him collect them together and fly. But if any one oppressed with extreme poverty applies himself to religion, let him also sell his cloak and buy a sword. For the terrible attack of battle shall overtake them, so that nothing shall suffice to resist it. He next lays open the cause of these evils, namely, that He suffered the penalty due to the wicked, being crucified with thieves. And when it shall have come at last to this, the word of dispensation will receive its end. But to the persecutors shall happen all that has been foretold by the Prophets. These things then God prophesied concerning what should befall the country of the Jews, but the disciples understood not the depth of His words, thinking they had need of swords against the coming attack of the traitor. Whence it follows; But they said, Lord, behold, here are two swords.

Christ foretold the war about to burst on the Jews. With unendurable violence, it would spread like some river over all their land. He now says, “But now, let him who has a purse take it, and likewise a bag.” The saying in appearance had reference to the apostles but in reality applied to every Jew. Christ addressed them. He did not say that the holy apostles must get a purse and bag. He said that whosoever has a purse, let him take it. This means that whoever had property in the Jewish territories should collect all that he had and flee, so that if he could save himself, he might do so. Some did not have the means of equipping themselves for travel and from extreme poverty must continue in the land. “Let such a person,” Jesus says, “sell his cloak and buy a sword.” From now on, the question with all those who continue in the land will not be whether they possess anything or not, but whether they can exist and preserve their lives. War will come to them with such unendurable force that nothing shall be able to stand against it.

He tells them the cause of the evil and of a tribulation so severe and irremediable befalling them. He says that according to the Scriptures, he is about to be numbered with the transgressors. Christ plainly refers to his being hung on the cross with the thieves who were crucified with him, enduring a transgressor’s punishment.… He will also sit on the throne of his glory, judging the world in righteousness, as it is written. The prophet says, “Then they will look on him whom they pierced.” As these wretched beings ridiculed Christ as they saw him hang on the precious cross, they will behold him crowned with godlike glory and will fall into the pit of destruction in just retribution of their wickedness toward him. “What concerns me,” he says, “has an end as far as it relates to my suffering death in the flesh.” Then those things foretold by the holy prophets in olden times will happen to those who murdered him.
