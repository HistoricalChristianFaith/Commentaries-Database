Observe also in another respect the folly of his words, when he says, I will gather allmy fruits, as if he thought that he had not obtained them from God, but that they were the fruits of his own labors.
The rich man then builds barns which last not, but decay, and what is still more foolish, reckons for himself upon a long life; for it follows, And I will say to my Soul, you have much goods laid up for many years. But, O rich man, you have indeed fruits in your barns, but as for many years whence can you obtain them?
