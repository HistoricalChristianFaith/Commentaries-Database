What does the rich man do, surrounded by a great supply of many blessings beyond all numbering? In distress and anxiety, he speaks the words of poverty. He says, “What should I do?” … He does not look to the future. He does not raise his eyes to God. He does not count it worth his while to gain for the mind those treasures that are above in heaven. He does not cherish love for the poor or desire the esteem it gains. He does not sympathize with suffering. It gives him no pain nor awakens his pity. Still more irrational, he settles for himself the length of his life, as if he would also reap this from the ground. He says, “I will say to myself, ‘Self, you have goods laid up for many years. Eat, drink, and enjoy yourself.’ ” “O rich man,” one may say, ‘You have storehouses for your fruits, but where will you receive your many years? By the decree of God, your life is shortened.’ ” “God,” it tells us, “said to him, ‘You fool, this night they will require of you your soul. Whose will these things be that you have prepared?’ ” Commentary on Luke, Homily

Observe also in another respect the folly of his words, when he says, I will gather allmy fruits, as if he thought that he had not obtained them from God, but that they were the fruits of his own labors.
The rich man then builds barns which last not, but decay, and what is still more foolish, reckons for himself upon a long life; for it follows, And I will say to my Soul, you have much goods laid up for many years. But, O rich man, you have indeed fruits in your barns, but as for many years whence can you obtain them?
