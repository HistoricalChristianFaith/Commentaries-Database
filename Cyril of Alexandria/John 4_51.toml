The one command of the Savior heals two souls. In the official, the Savior’s command brings about unexpected faith even as it also rescues the child from bodily death. It is difficult to say which one is healed first. Both, I suppose, are healed simultaneously. The disease left at the command of the Savior. The official’s servants meet him and tell him of the healing of the child. This shows at the same time the swiftness of the divine commands and how wisely Christ ordered all of this. They speedily confirmed the hope of their master, who was weak in faith.… When the official learned that the sick child’s recovery coincided exactly with Jesus’ command, he is saved with “his whole house.” He attributes the power of the miracle to the Savior Christ, and he is brought to a firmer faith.
