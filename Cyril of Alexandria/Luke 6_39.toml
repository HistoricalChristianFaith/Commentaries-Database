As if He said, How can he who is guilty of grievous sins,(which He calls the beam,) condemn him who has sinned only slightly, or even in some cases not at all? For this the mote signifies.
That is to say, first show yourself clean from great sins, and then afterwards shall you give counsel to your neighbor, who is guilty only of slight sins.
