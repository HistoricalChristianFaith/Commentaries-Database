He urges the disciples to seek for spiritual gifts and at the same time gives them confidence that, if they ask for them, they will not fail to obtain them. He adds the word Amen, that he might confirm their belief that if they ask the Father for anything they would receive it from him. He would act as their mediator and make known their request and, being one with the Father, grant it. For this is what he means by “in my name.” For we cannot draw near to God the Father in any other way than through the Son. For it is by him that we have access in the one Spirit to the Father. It was because of this that he said, “I am the door. I am the way. No one comes to the Father but by me.” For as the Son is God, he being one with the Father provides good things for his sanctified people and is found to be generous of his wealth to us.… Let us then offer our prayers in Christ’s name. For in this way, the Father will most readily consent to them and grant his graces to those who seek them, that receiving them we may rejoice.
