A messenger from the synagogue ruler’s house met them saying, “Your daughter is dead; do not trouble the Teacher.” What was Christ’s answer, seeing that he possesses universal sovereignty? He is Lord of life and death. By the all-powerful detemination of his will, he accomplishes whatever he desires. He saw the man oppressed with the weight of sorrow, fainting, stunned, and all but despairing of the possibility of his daughter being rescued from death. Misfortunes are able to disturb even an apparently well constituted mind and to estrange it from its settled convictions. To help him, he gives him a kind and saving word that is able to sustain him in his fainting state and work in him an unwavering faith: “Fear not, only believe, and she shall live.”

Coming to the house of his supplicant, he quiets their funeral songs, silences the musicians, and stops the tears of the weepers, saying, “The girl is not dead but rather sleeps.” “And they,” it says, “laughed at him.” I ask you to observe here the great skill of the management. Although he well knew that the girl was dead, he said, “She is not dead but rather sleeps.” What is his reason? By their laughing at him, they might give a clear and manifest acknowledgment that the daughter was dead. There would probably be some of that group who always resist his glory who would reject the divine miracle and say that the damsel was not yet dead. Delivering from sickness was nothing very extraordinary for Christ. To have the acknowledgment of many that the girl was dead, he said that she was rather sleeping. Let no one affirm that Christ spoke falsely. To him, as being life by nature, there is nothing dead. Having a firm hope of the resurrection of the dead, we call the dead “those that sleep” for this reason. They will arise in Christ, and as the blessed Paul says, “They live to him,” because they are about to live.

When he came to the house in which the girl was lying dead, he took with him only three of the holy apostles and the father and the mother of the girl. The manner in which he performed the miracle was worthy of God. “Having taken her,” it says, “by the hand, he said, ‘Girl, arise’; and she arose immediately.” O the power of a word and the might of commands that nothing can resist! O the life producing touch of the hand that abolishes death and corruption! These are the fruits of faith, for the sake of which the hand of Moses also gave the law to those of old time.
