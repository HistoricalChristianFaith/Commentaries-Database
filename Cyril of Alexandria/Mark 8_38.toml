He who as God was beyond suffering, suffered in his own flesh as a human being. When he became flesh, being God, he did not in any way cease to be God. Precisely as he entered into the created order, he remained above creation. He remained as giver of the law when he came to serve “under the law.” He retained the inviolable divine dignity precisely when he took on “the form of a slave.” It was precisely as only begotten Son that he became “the firstborn among many brothers,” while still remaining the only begotten. So why should it seem so strange that he should suffer in the flesh according to his humanity, even while transcending suffering according to his divinity? Thus the ever astute Paul says that the Word himself who is “in the form of God” and equal to God the Father “became obedient even unto death, death of the cross.”
