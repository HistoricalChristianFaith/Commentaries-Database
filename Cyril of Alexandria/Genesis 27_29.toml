Afterward the power of blessing is transferred again to the Immanuel himself. “And let nations serve you, and princes bow down to you, and be lord of your brother.” The Immanuel was called “the firstborn” when he became so with reference to us, “among many brothers.” But for this reason we must not forget that he is God and the Lord of the universe. We worship him as God, and he has reigned as God over those who are called from the brothers through grace. “Who in the heavens shall be compared to the Lord, and who shall be likened to the Lord among the sons of God?” Therefore the Immanuel has reigned as God over those who were received into the brotherhood, and to him “every knee should bow in heaven and on earth, and under the earth, and every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the father.” And cursed is he who curses, “and blessed is he that blesses.” These words are quite clear. Those who curse are detestable and hateful to God; those who bless, that is, who announce his divine glory, are filled with heavenly and divine goods. This is the blessing of Jacob, whose strength refers to the Immanuel himself and to those who are justified in the faith.
