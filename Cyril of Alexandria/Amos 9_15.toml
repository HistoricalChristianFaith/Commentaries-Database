Now there is no doubting that the God of all also turned back our captivity; Christ proclaimed ‘release to captives,’ and from the Devil’s oppression he rescued the earth under heaven. Then it was that, like farmers, we became completely attentive to spiritual fruitfulness, planted gardens and vineyards, and will eat their fruit; we shall receive the reward of our labors, and harvest the fruit of goodness. The fact that we have in god an immovable abode, and that, once the inheritance is given by him, no one shall dismiss those in it, he clarifies by saying, I shall plant them in their land that I gave them, says the Lord god. “The gifts and the calling from God are irrevocable,” remember, and we shall have a stable hold on every food, with Christ himself as guide and festal leader. To him, together with the God and Father along with the Holy Spirit, be glory and honor for ages of ages. Amen.
