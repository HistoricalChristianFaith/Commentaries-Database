Solomon seems to me very wise in bestowing upon an indecent woman the face of every heresy and then saying about her that it is necessary to repudiate and to flee such a woman, “who is a hunter’s snare, and her heart is a net, and in her hands are bonds.” The good man before the face of God will be rescued from her and the sinner will be ensnared by her.
