Nicodemus, who was numbered among those having authority … is himself indignant with the Pharisees for condemning the people for only marveling at Jesus. It is clear that he agrees with those who believe. However, he is still sick from harmful shame and, not yet mingling boldness with his zeal, he does not permit his faith to be clearly revealed. Rather, he hides his faith as with a dark cloak and conceals that he is on Christ’s side. Nicodemus is sick with a terrible sickness because we ought to believe fearlessly, glorying rather than being ashamed, practicing a transparent openness and rejecting slave-like hypocrisy.… Thus it was fitting for the wise Paul to declare, “I am not ashamed of the gospel. It is the power of God for salvation to every one who has faith.”
