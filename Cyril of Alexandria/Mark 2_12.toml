: Now they accuse Him of blasphemy, anticipating the sentence of His death: for there was a commandin the Law, that whosoever blasphemed should be put to death. And this charge they laid upon Him, because He claimed for Himself the divine power of remitting sins. Wherefore it is added, “Who can forgives in, save God only?” For the Judge of all alone has power to forgive sin.
