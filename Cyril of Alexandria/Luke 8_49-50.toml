A messenger from the synagogue ruler's house met them saying, "Your daughter is dead; do not trouble the Teacher." What was Christ's answer, seeing that he possesses universal sovereignty? He is Lord of life and death. By the all-powerful detemination of his will, he accomplishes whatever he desires. He saw the man oppressed with the weight of sorrow, fainting, stunned, and all but despairing of the possibility of his daughter being rescued from death. Misfortunes are able to disturb even an apparently well constituted mind and to estrange it from its settled convictions. To help him, he gives him a kind and saving word that is able to sustain him in his fainting state and work in him an unwavering faith: "Fear not, only believe, and she shall live."
