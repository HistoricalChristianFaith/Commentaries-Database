(non occ.) It is said that she was espoused, to imply that nothing more than espousals preceded the conception; for it was not by man's seed that the Holy Virgin conceived.

The Evangelist says that Mary was engaged to be married to Joseph, to show that the conception had taken place only upon her engagement, and that the birth of the Emmanuel was miraculous, and not in accordance with the laws of nature. For the Virgin did not bear from the emission of man’s seed. And why was this so? Christ, who is the first fruits of all, the second Adam according to the Scriptures, was born of the Spirit, that he might transmit the grace (of the spiritual birth) to us also. For we too were intended no longer to bear the name of sons of men, but rather of God. We have obtained the new birth of the Spirit in Christ first, that he might be “foremost among all,” as Paul declares.And the occasion of the census conveniently caused the virgin to go to Bethlehem, so that we might see another prophecy fulfilled. For it is written, “But you, Bethlehem Ephratha, who are little to be among the clans of Judah, from you shall come forth for me one who is to be ruler in Israel!”
Some argue that if he were brought forth in the flesh, the Virgin was corrupted. If she were not corrupted, then he was brought forth only in appearance. We reply, “the Lord, the God of Israel, has entered in and gone out, and the gate remains closed.” If, moreover, the Word was made flesh without sexual intercourse, being conceived altogether without seed, then he was born without injury to her virginity.
