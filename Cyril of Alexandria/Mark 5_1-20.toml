(non occ.) See how the devil is divided between two passions, fear and audacity; he hangs back and prays, as if meditating a question; he wishes to know what he had to do with Jesus, as though he would say, Do you cast me out from men, who are mine?

(non occ.) Consider the unconquerable power of Christ; He makes Satan shake, for to him the words of Christ are fire and flame; as the Psalmist says, The mountains melted at the presence of the Lord, (Ps. 97:5) that is, great and proud powers. There follows, And he asked him, What is thy name?
