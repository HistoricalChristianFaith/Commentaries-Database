They see a fire of coals, for the Savior had kindled a fire miraculously and put a fish on it that he had caught by his ineffable power. This too he had done by design. For it was not the hand of the holy apostles or the preaching of these spiritual fisherman among the human race that started the work. For he first caught one fish as the firstfruits of those who were to come (not that we mean one precisely, for by one is signified a small number). Then afterward the disciples caught the multitude in their nets, being enabled by his divine bidding to catch what they were fishing for.
