But when the time of his incarnation unexpectedly arrived, then the shadows made way for the truth. And he said, “Listen to me, O my people.” … He is speaking here not only to those who are numbered among the people but also to the kings, because he wanted the rulers, the leaders of the people, to receive his message as well.… “The law will go forth from me, and my judgment will be a light to the nations.” He refers to the divine and evangelical preaching as “law” here; it is just that it is in a different form now, just as the oracles and salvation also are new. For just as the old law was changed to something better, there has also been a transfer from those things that were provisional types to that which is the truth. For Christ said, “Do not think I have come to destroy the law.” … The law in letters was given by Moses, but the preaching of salvation, which is the gospel, came through Christ.… He calls his “judgment” here something that is both sanctioned by the law of God as well as a benevolent accounting; it is the grace from him that went out to illuminate the Gentiles; they were amazed at his judgment, which was both righteous and just—truly the righteousness that is clearly made known in the gospel.
