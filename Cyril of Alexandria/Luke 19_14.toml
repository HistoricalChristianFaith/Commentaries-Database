It says that his citizens hated him. Likewise, Christ admonishes the Jewish crowds, saying, "If I had not done among them the works which no one else did, they would not have sin; but now they have seen and hated both me and my Father." They would not let him reign over them, and yet the holy prophets were constantly speaking predictions of Christ as a king. One of them even said, "Rejoice greatly, daughter of Zion, for your King comes to you, just, and a Savior; he is meek, and riding on a donkey, and on a new foal." Blessed Isaiah says of him and of the holy apostles, "Behold, a just king shall reign, and princes shall rule with judgment." Again, Christ somewhere said by the voice of the psalmist, "But I have been appointed King by him on Zion, his holy mount, and I will declare the commandment of the Lord." They then denied his kingdom. When they came near to Pilate saying, "Away with him, away with him, crucify him," he asked them, or rather said to them in derision, "Shall I crucify your king?" They answered with wicked words and said, "We have no king but Caesar."Having denied the kingdom of Christ, they fell under the dominion of Satan and brought on themselves the yoke of sin that cannot be lifted.
