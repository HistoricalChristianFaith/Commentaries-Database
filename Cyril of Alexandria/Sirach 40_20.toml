We say that the saints who have arisen in the churches"mystagogues and teachers"are called holy stones that roll on the earth. They were similar in appearance "to the precious, chosen cornerstone, placed by the God and Father in the foundation of Zion." And if the foundation is of stones, compacted and joined to him and raised to God as a holy temple, these also are rightly called stones. It is very well said that they roll, thus in some way indicating the agility and velocity with which they move toward every aspect of holiness. Round or spherical stones, in fact, overcome any obstacle and move with great facility, if one wants to move them. The mind of the saints, in turn, willingly adapts to the will of God. Since we are such "stones," it is clear that we should be righteous and blameless. But if there is some good, it is his, if there is something beautiful, it comes from him, because God lavishes on us everything related to piety. What things? "Grain for the youths, sweet-smelling wine to the virgins." One who " is disposed to follow God"s will with youthful boldness, wanting to do good, will receive from him even greater strength, symbolized by grain, since "bread strengthens the heart." Another, who has been purified and has a pure mind and may justly be compared with the venerable and holy virgins, will receive like intelligible wine the clear and secure knowledge of God "that gladdens hearts." Young people and virgins, therefore, as we have just explained, will rightly be called to participate to a high degree in the goods of heaven, and they will hear God say, "Eat and drink, become inebriated, you who are near me." These are close to God, not with respect to place"it is stupid to think or imagine this"but in relation to an incontestable firmness of intellect and the aspiration to every virtue and to love for Him. - "Commentary on Zechariah 9.64"
