For just as iron, though naturally strong, cannot encounter without injury the harder kinds of stone if it is not strengthened in the forge, so a person’s soul may be buoyed up with unwavering enthusiasm for everything that is good. However, it can never be triumphant in the conflicts that come up unless it is first perfected by the grace of the Spirit of God. Even the disciples, therefore, themselves were frail at first. But when they had received the Spirit of Almighty God, they cast aside their native weakness and by communion with him attained to great boldness. It was expedient that the frailty of the saints should be recorded to the praise and glory of God, who changed their weakness into power, and like a strong tower, raised up their spirits, which were easily daunted even by slight dangers and at times were broken down by the mere apprehension of suffering. And that which happened to a single one, or a few of the saints, may afford us at the same time a lesson and a consolation. For we are taught through this example not to slacken in God’s service by inconsiderately dwelling on our own infirmities. We are, rather, to trust in him who is able to make all of us strong, and we are to boast in God’s miraculous works and favor shown to us who were beyond hope.
