The disciples were not merely confused; rather the matter greatly disturbed them, and the knowledge of this mystery was hard to grasp. How could one be raised from the dead, or one with countless signs done on behalf of the people be handed over to death and dishonor? Yet this agrees with what the prophet said: “Strike the shepherd.” David also says to the Father, “Therefore those whom you struck, they will persecute.” However, not all this occurred at the will of the Father; he did not desire for him [the Son] to suffer, if only the Jews would have accepted him. So one cannot say he willed a murder. The Father consented with the Son’s choice to suffer this. So it is written that the Father struck “the shepherd.” He permitted him to suffer yet had the power to prevent the suffering. Something like this is at work in the passage that says Pilate was “over” Christ. “You would have no power over me if it were not given to you from above,” that is, “if the Father had not permitted me to suffer.”
