We do not say that the denial took place in order that Christ’s words might come true. We say rather that his object was to forewarn the disciple, inasmuch as what was about to happen did not escape Christ’s knowledge. The misfortune, therefore, happened to the disciple from the cowardice of human nature. Since Christ had not risen from the dead, he had not yet abolished death and wiped corruption away. The fear of undergoing death was something beyond human endurance.
