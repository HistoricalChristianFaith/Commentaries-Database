For the Savior said, "When you pray, say, 'Our Father.' " And another of the holy Evangelists adds, "who art in heaven." …He gives his own glory to us. He raises slaves to the dignity of freedom. He crowns the human condition with such honor as surpasses the power of nature. He brings to pass what was spoken of old by the voice of the psalmist: "I said, you are gods, and all of you children of the Most High." He rescues us from the measure of slavery, giving us by his grace what we did not possess by nature, and permits us to call God "Father," as being admitted to the rank of sons. We received this, together with all our other privileges, from him. One of these privileges is the dignity of freedom, a gift peculiarly befitting those who have been called to be sons.
He commands us, therefore, to take boldness and say in our prayers, "Our Father." We, who are children of earth and slaves and subject by the law of nature to him who created us, call him who is in heaven "Father." Most fittingly, he enables those who pray to understand this also. Since we call God "Father" and have been counted worthy of such a distinguished honor, we must lead holy and thoroughly blameless lives. We must behave as is pleasing to our Father and not think or say anything unworthy or unfit for the freedom that has been bestowed on us.…
The Savior of all very wisely grants us to call God "Father," that we, knowing well that we are sons of God, may behave in a manner worthy of him who has honored us. He will then receive the supplications that we offer in Christ.

What, therefore, is the meaning of "hallowed be your name"?…When it is our settled conviction and belief that he who by nature is God over all is Holy of the Holies, we confess his glory and supreme majesty. We then receive his fear into our mind and lead upright and blameless lives. By this we become holy ourselves, and we may be able to be near unto the holy God.… The prayer is, therefore, "May your name be kept holy in us, in our minds and wills." This is the significance of the word hallowed. If a person says, "Our Father, hallowed be your name," he is not requesting any addition to be made to God's holiness. He rather asks that he may possess such a mind and faith to feel that his name is honorable and holy. The act is the source of life and the cause of every blessing. How must being this influenced by God be worthy of the highest estimation and useful for the salvation of the soul?

God is our King before the worlds. Since God always reigns and is omnipotent, with what view do those who call God "Father" offer up to him their requests and say, "Your kingdom come"?They seem to desire to behold Christ the Savior of all rising again upon the world. He will come. He will come and descend as judge, no longer in a lowly condition like us or in the humility of human nature. He will come in glory such as becomes God, as he dwells in the unapproachable light, and with the angels as his guards. He somewhere said, "The Son of man shall come in the glory of his Father, with his holy angels." …
That judgment seat is terrifying. The Judge is unbiased. It is a time of pleading, or rather of trial and of retribution. The fire, enduring punishment and eternal torments are prepared for the wicked. How can men pray to behold that time?… The wicked and impure lead low and lewd lives and are guilty of every vice. In no way is it fitting for them in their prayers to say, "your kingdom come." …
The saints ask that the time of the Savior's perfect reign may come, because they have labored dutifully, have a pure conscience and look for the reward of what they have already done. Just as those who, expecting a festival and merriment about ready to come and shortly to appear, thirst for its arrival, so also do they. They trust that they will stand glorious in the presence of the Judge and hear him say, "Come, you blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundations of the world." … They fully believed what he said about the consummation of the world.
When he will appear to them again from heaven, they will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. They correctly say in their prayers, "your kingdom come." For they feel confident that they will receive a reward for their bravery and attain to the consummation of the hope set before them.

Why then did he command the saints to say to God the Father in heaven, "Your will be done; as in heaven, so on earth?" … This petition is worthy of the saints and full of all praise.…We request that power may be given to those on earth to do the will of God and imitate the conduct practiced above in heaven by the holy angels.…
The saints request that both Israel as well as the Gentiles may be counted worthy of peace from on high and be comforted since they were in misery and caught in the net of sin without possibility of escape. Having received the righteousness that is in Christ by faith, they may become pure and skillful in every good work. They pray, "Your will be done, as in heaven, so on earth for this reason." As I said, the will of God over all is that those on earth should live in holiness, piously, without blame, being washed from all impurity, and diligent in imitating the spiritual beauty of the spirits above in heaven. The church on earth, since it was the visible likeness and image of the church of the firstborn that is above, may please Christ.
