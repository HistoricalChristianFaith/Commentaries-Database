Observe, I pray, this also, that Christ is the Highest, Whose forerunner John was both in his birth, and in his preaching. What remains, then, for those to say, who lessen 3 His divinity? And why will they not understand, that when Zacharias said, "And thou shalt be called Prophet of the Highest," he meant thereby "of God," of Whom also were the rest of the prophets.

Know that Christ is the Most High…. What do those who neglect his divinity have to say? And why will they not understand that when Zechariah said “And you, child, will be called the prophet of the Most High, he meant “of God,” of whom the rest of the prophets also belonged. .
