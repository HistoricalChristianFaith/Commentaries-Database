Let us look at his most beautiful confession of faith. He says, "Jesus, remember me when you come in your kingdom." You see him crucified and call him a king. You expect the One who bears scorn and suffering to come in godlike glory. You see him surrounded by a Jewish crowd, the wicked gang of the Pharisees, and Pilate's band of soldiers. All of these were mocking him, and no one confessed him.
