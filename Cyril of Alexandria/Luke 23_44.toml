When they fastened to the cross the Lord of all, the sun over their heads withdrew and the light at midday was wrapped in darkness, as the divine Amos had foretold. “There was darkness from the sixth hour until the ninth hour.” This was a plain sign to the Jews that the minds of those who crucified him were wrapped in spiritual darkness, for blindness in part has happened to Israel. In his love for God, David even curses them, saying, “Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see.”Creation itself mourned its Lord. The sun was darkened, and the rocks were split, and the temple put on the mourners’ clothes. Its veil was split from the top to the bottom. This is what God signified to us by the voice of Isaiah, saying, “I clothe the heavens with blackness, and make sackcloth their covering.” Commentary on Luke, Homily
