If we want to know the meaning of these words in the person of God and Father, then we say that he calls the Son “his righteousness.” For we are saved in him … through his great mercy.… He is called “righteousness” and “salvation” and rightly so. For he has removed all evil from us and, freeing us from the chains of death, has led us into eternal life.… Those who were once weak and prostrate on the ground grasp his right hand and gain the hope of an unexpected salvation. For the holy Scriptures often call the Son the right arm of the Father. For he is his power.
