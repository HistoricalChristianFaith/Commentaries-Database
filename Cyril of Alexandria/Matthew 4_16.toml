And the “great light” is Christ our Lord and the brightness of the gospel preaching. It is not, in fact, the law, which was likened to a lamp. For this reason a lamp always burned in the tabernacle, on account of the shortness of the law’s rays, which had strength to extend their light only within the confines of the Jewish territories. Therefore the Gentiles were “in darkness,” not having this lamplight.
