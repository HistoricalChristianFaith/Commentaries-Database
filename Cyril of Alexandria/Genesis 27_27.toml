In fact, these things were not completely fulfilled in Jacob but in Christ and in those who were justified through faith, who were also made sons according to the promise in Isaac. Therefore the meaning of the prophecy will also suit the new people and Christ himself, who is beginning and leading. He is also considered to be a second Adam24 and was born as a second root of humanity. For that which is in Christ is a new creation, and we are renewed in him to sanctification, incorruption and life. The words of the blessing, I believe, signify the sweetness of the spiritual perfume in Christ, like that of a garden or a plentiful field spreading a sweet and beautiful perfume from its spring flowers. And so Christ described himself to us in the Song of Songs: “I am the flower of the field, the lily of the valleys.” He was actually a lily and a rose born of the earth for the sake of humanity. Since he did not know sin, he was the most divine of all those who inhabited the whole world and produced a perfume though his works. For this reason [Scripture] compares Christ with a field blessed by God, and with very good reason, because he is the perfume of the knowledge of God the Father. So again the divine Paul says, “But thanks be to God, who in Christ always leads us in triumphal procession, and through us spreads in every place the fragrance that comes from knowing him.” Our Lord Jesus Christ is revealed through the holy apostles like the perfume of the knowledge of God the Father. “If someone knows the Son, he also fully knows the Father,” because of the sameness of nature, as in everything he possesses the same things in the same degree.
