Or else, his father was borne down with years, and he thought he was doing an honourable act in proposing to pay the kind offices which were due to him, according to Exodus, Honour thy father and thy mother. (Exod. 20:12.) Hence when calling him to the ministry of the Gospel, our Lord said, Follow me, he sought for a time of respite, which should suffice for the support of his decrepit father, saying, Permit me first to go and bury my father, not that he asked to bury his deceased father, for Christ would not have hindered the wish to do this, but he said, Bury, that is, support in old age even till death. But the Lord said to him, Let the dead bury their dead. For there were other attendants also bound by the same tie of relationship, but as I consider dead, because they had not yet believed Christ. Learn from this, that our duty to God is to be preferred to our love for our parents, to whom we show reverence, because through them have we been born. But the God of all, when as yet we were not, brought us into being, our parents were made the ministers of our introduction.

"Leave the dead burying their dead, but go, preach the kingdom of God." There were, no doubt, other guardians and relatives of his father. I consider them dead, because they had not yet believed in Christ nor been able to receive the new birth by holy baptism to incorruptible life. "Let them," he says, "bury their dead, because they also have within them a dead mind and still have not been numbered among those who possess the life that is in Christ." We learn from this that the fear of God is to be set even above the reverence and love due to parents. The law of Moses, in the first place, commanded that you shall love the Lord God with all your soul, all your might and all your heart. It put as second to it the honor due to parents, saying, "Honor your father and your mother."
