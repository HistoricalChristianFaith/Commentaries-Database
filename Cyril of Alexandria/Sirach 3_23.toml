Somewhere in Isaiah we read thus concerning Christ: “Who will be able to declare his generation?” And the blessed prophet, speaking about God the Word, has used the word “generation” instead of speaking about Being. Who, in fact, will be able to declare the mode of being of the Only-Begotten? And what language will explain the ineffable generation of the Son from the Father? And what mind will not be powerless in the face of this concept? In fact, we know and believe that the Word was generated from God the Father. But we say that the concept is unattainable for any intelligence, and any inquiry into this line of argument is risky at best. We should not have to explore that which is too advanced for our abilities, nor must we inquire about what is too difficult. We must rather hold on to what we are commanded and believe firmly that God truly exists and rewards those who diligently seek him. But we must not search into—as it is written—the things that surpass our mind and our knowledge, and not only ours but of every creature, including those who are spirits.
