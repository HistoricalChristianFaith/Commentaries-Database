For if it was a shadow and an appearance and not really an incarnation, then the Virgin did not give birth, nor did the Word from God the Father assume “the seed of Abraham,” nor did he become “like his brothers.” … Therefore, if the Word did not become flesh, neither was he tested by what he suffered so as to be able to help those who are tested.

The Only Begotten operated not through his own nature, for that would in no way have improved our state, or through the nature of angels; but he operated through “the seed of Abraham,” as Scripture has it. For in this way and no other could the race, fallen into corruption, be restored to salvation.
