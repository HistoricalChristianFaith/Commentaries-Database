The Lord protested against their wickedness through the voice of the prophet, saying, “Alas for the shepherds, who destroy and scatter the sheep of my inheritance,” and again, “The shepherds have become foolish and have not sought the Lord. Therefore did none of the flock understand and were scattered.” Such, then, was their state. But we are under the rule of the chief Shepherd of all, even Christ, by whom and with whom to God the Father be praise and dominion, with the Holy Spirit, forever and ever. Amen. - "Commentary on Luke, Homily 126"
