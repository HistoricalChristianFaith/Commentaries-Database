Now some one perhaps will say, How were the disciples ignorant of the mystery of the cross, seeing that it was touched upon in several places by the shadows of the Law? But as Paul relates, Even to this day, when Moses is read, the vale is upon their hearts. It becomes then those who approach Christ, to say, Open you my eyes, that I may behold, the wonderful things out of your law.

The mystery of the passion may be seen also in another instance. According to the Mosaic law, two goats were offered. They were not different in any way from one another, but they were alike in size and appearance. Of these, one was called “the lord,” and the other was called “sentaway.” When the lot was cast for the one called “lord,” it was sacrificed. The other one was sent away from the sacrifice, and therefore had the name of “sentaway.” Who was signified by this? The Word, though he was God, was in our likeness and took the form of us sinners, as far as the nature of the flesh was concerned. The male or female goat was sacrificed for sins. Death was our desert, for we had fallen under the divine curse because of sin. When the Savior of all undertook the responsibility, he transferred to himself what was due to us and laid down his life, that we might be sent away from death and destruction.

In order that those who were going to teach the whole world might know exactly his mystery, he usefully and necessarily explains it clearly to them beforehand. He says, “Lay these words to your hearts; for the Son of man is about to be delivered into the hands of men.” The reason that led Christ to speak this is, I think, a subject both useful and necessary for our consideration. He had then led Peter, James and John up into the mountain. He was transfigured before them, and his countenance shone as the sun. He showed them the glory, with which in due time he will arise upon the world. He will come, not in humiliation such as ours or in the lowliness of the human condition as such, but in the majesty and splendor of the Godhead, and in transcendent glory. Again, when he came down from the mountain, he delivered a man from a wicked and violent spirit. He certainly was ready to bear for our sakes his saving passion and endure the wickedness of the Jews. As the minister of his mysteries, he by the grace of God “tasted death for every man.” When this happened, there is nothing unlikely in supposing that the disciples would be troubled. Perhaps in their secret thoughts even they would say, “How is One so glorious, who raised the dead by his godlike power, rebuked the seas and winds, and by a word crushed Satan, now seized as a prisoner and caught in these murderers’ traps? Were we mistaken in thinking that he is God? Have we fallen from the true opinion regarding him?” Those who did not know the mystery that our Lord Jesus Christ would endure the cross and death would find therein an occasion of stumbling.
