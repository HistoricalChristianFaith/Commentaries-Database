“I will act, and who will hinder it?” For I have accomplished the calling of the nations, he says, that is, I have saved those who were led astray. And who can alter this, or who could change things so that they did not happen? The Savior himself assures us that no one can snatch those who are being saved from the hand of God. “For my sheep hear my voice, and I know them; and they follow me, and I give them eternal life.”
