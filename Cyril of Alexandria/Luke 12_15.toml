Jesus does not leave us without instruction. Having found a good opportunity, he makes a profitable and saving speech. Protesting against them, he declares, “Take heed, and keep yourselves from all greed.” He showed us that covetousness is a pitfall of the devil and hateful to God. The wise Paul even calls it idolatry, perhaps as being suitable for only those who do not know God or as being equal in the balance with the defilement of those people who choose to serve sticks and stones. It is a snare of evil spirits, by which they drag down a person’s soul to the nets of hell. For this reason, he says very correctly, as setting them on their guard, “Take heed and keep yourselves from all greed,” from great and small and from defrauding anyone whoever he may be. Greed is hateful to God and humankind.
