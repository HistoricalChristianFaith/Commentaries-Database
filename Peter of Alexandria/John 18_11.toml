Those Christians who deliver themselves up to persecution forget that the Savior taught us to pray not to enter into temptation. They forget his many retreats from those who sought to plot against him â€¦ and how when the time of his passion was at hand he did not give himself up but waited until they came upon him with swords and spears.
