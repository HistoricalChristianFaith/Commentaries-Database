For this reason the Lord descended so that he might save sinners, raise up the dead and bring new life to those wounded by death and to enlighten those who lay in darkness. The Lord truly came and called us to be Godâ€™s adopted children, to enter into a holy city, ever at peace, to possess a life that will endure forever, to share an incorruptible glory. Let us each strive to come to a good end after a good beginning. Let us persevere in poverty, in our pilgrimage, living in affliction and petitions to God without any shame as we continuously knock at the door.
