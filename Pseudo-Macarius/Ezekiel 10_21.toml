[[commentary]]
quote='''
Here God truly mounts and guides the soul. He always obtains the victory skillfully directing and leading with expertise the chariot of the soul to a heavenly mind forever. God does not wage war against wickedness, but since he possesses all power and authority of himself, he brings about the victory by himself. Therefore the cherubim go not where they wish but where the rider in control directs them. Wherever God inclines them, there they go, and he supports them.
