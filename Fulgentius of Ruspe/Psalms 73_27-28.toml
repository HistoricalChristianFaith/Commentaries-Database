Therefore, the human being began to sin in the matter by which he departed from God. For it is written that “the beginning of human pride is to forsake the Lord.” And in another place, “Indeed those who are far from you will perish; you put an end to those who are false to you.” Therefore, they who are far from God and are false to him indeed perish by sinning through their evil will that is not from God. God will destroy them by his just judgments as is proper to God. For God would not destroy them by his judgment, unless they had perished through their iniquities. For it is written, “How they are destroyed in a moment, swept away utterly by terrors.”
