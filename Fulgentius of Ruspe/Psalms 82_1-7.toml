We find the name of God in the holy Scriptures, as many as now come to mind, spoken of in four ways. For God is spoken of according to the truth of [his divine] nature, that the holy Trinity is one, true and unchangeable God, who says, “See now that I, even I, am he; there is no God besides me.” And concerning whom David says, “For who is God except the Lord? And who is a rock besides our God?” This is the one and only God who alone is God by nature. From this one true God, certain ones, in order that they might be gods, did not have the name by nature but received it by the gift of grace. Concerning such gods, it was Moses to whom that one true God said, “See, I have made you like God to Pharaoh.” Of such people are also those to whom it is said, “I said, ‘You are gods, children of the most High, all of you.’ ” Therefore, these gods received that grace to be gods so that they might become the children of God. The Evangelist says that “to those who did accept him, he gave power to become the children of God, to those who believe in his name, who were born, not by natural generation, or by human choice or by a man’s decision, but of God.” Likewise, to them it is said, “I said, ‘You are gods, children of the most High, all of you.’ ”
