Just as there is no illness that is incurable for our physician, so the heavenly medicine cannot be powerless in any wound or for any length of time. Therefore, the physician testifies that he is always able to restore health to the one converted. He says, “In returning and rest, you shall be saved.” Hence God, through Jeremiah, does not cease to reprove the hardheartedness of certain ones. Instead he says in this way: “When people fall, do they not get up again? If they go astray, do they not turn back? Why then has this people turned away in perpetual backsliding? They have held fast to deceit. They have refused to return.” God does not punish the sins in the sinner, if the neck of the sinner is not stiffened.
