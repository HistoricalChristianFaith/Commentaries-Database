Eternal life will be given in the future only to the one to whom forgiveness of sins has been given in this world. Only he will receive the forgiveness of sins here who renounces his sins and hastens to the highest and true God with true conversion of heart. For that will not be a time of forgiveness but of retribution. There mercy will not justify the sinner, but justice will distinguish the just and the sinner. This is written in the psalm: “The Lord tests the righteous and the wicked.” And, so that he might show that in iniquity lies the destruction, not the salvation, of the soul, he goes on the say, “He who loves iniquity hates his own soul.” Lest they who persist in iniquity to the end of the present life promise themselves mercy, it is said subsequently concerning God: “On the wicked he will rain coals of fire and sulphur; a scorching wind shall be the portion of their cup. For the Lord is righteous; he loves righteous deeds; the upright shall behold his face.” … Whoever, hearing these things, is unwilling to seek the mercy of God through conversion in the present time, will never be able to find it in the future life.
