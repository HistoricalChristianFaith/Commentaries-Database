So useful are trials for Christians that through them, our spirit becomes a sacrifice to God. For it is written in the psalm: “The sacrifice acceptable to God is a broken spirit; a broken and contrite heart, O God, you will not despise.” Enlightened by this and innumerable other texts of this type, let us hasten as rapidly as possible to be converted to God absolutely.… Converted, let us never despair of the forgiveness of sins, holding on to the faithful promise of the Lord who says, “In returning and rest, you will be saved.” Let us put up with the pressures and trials of the present time with patient courage, and let us never depart from the fear of the Lord. For the apostle commands us to “endure in affliction.” He bears witness that the correction of the present time is of great avail to us for avoiding the punishment of the future judgment, saying, “But since we are being judged by the Lord, we are being disciplined so that we may not be condemned along with the world.”
