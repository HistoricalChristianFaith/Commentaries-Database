Let no one hold that the three persons are separable, since he would not be able to find any one of the persons existing or acting before another or after another or without another. Just as by nature there can be no separability of action, in the same way there remains, by nature, an immutable unity of the will. We will now consider in what way both angels and human beings have been separated from God, in order to enable us to grasp without a shadow of doubt that the Trinity is inseparable. For holy Scripture says, in fact, that “perverse thoughts separate people from God,” and that “wisdom does not enter into a malignant spirit, nor does it dwell in a body given over to sin” and that “the Holy Spirit of discipline flees from deceit and distances himself from thoughts lacking in reason.” In effect, Isaiah also proves that iniquities dig a trench between God and humanity. The holy Trinity, therefore, is the same faithful God in whom no wickedness can exist: “The Son of God came to take away sins; there is no sin or iniquity in him.”
