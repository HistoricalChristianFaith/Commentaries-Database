Indeed, no one should continue longer time in his sins out of hope for the mercy of God, since no one wishes to be ill for a longer time in the body because of the hope for future health. Those who decline to give up their sins and vices and promise themselves forgiveness from God are thus frequently visited beforehand by the sudden fury of God, so that they find neither time for conversion nor the blessing of forgiveness. Therefore, holy Scripture mercifully forewarns each one of us when it says, “Do not delay to turn back to the Lord, and do not postpone it from day to day; for suddenly the wrath of the Lord will come on you, and at the time of punishment you will perish.” Blessed David also says, “Today, if you hear his voice, do not harden your hearts.” The blessed Paul agrees that we should not continue in our sins in these words: “Take care, brothers, that none of you may have an evil and unfaithful heart, so as to forsake the living God. Encourage yourselves daily while it is still ‘today’ so that none of you may grow hardened by the deceit of sins.”
