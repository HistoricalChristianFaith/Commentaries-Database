Not the Trinity but Christ, who is God above all things, who ascended to heaven in the flesh under the gaze of the disciples and who will come from heaven in the flesh. He who did not leave heaven when he took on flesh on earth and did not leave his own on earth when he ascended into heaven in the flesh, because of his divinity. Indeed, he promised this, saying, “See, I am with you all days, until the end of the world.” He is that God, therefore, who according to the prophecy of blessed Jeremiah “is great and without limits, sublime and immense” in the divine nature and of whom a little later the same prophet says, “He is our God, and no other can be compared with him. He has searched every way of knowledge and has given it to Jacob his servant, and to Israel his beloved.” It is this God who made himself for a little while lower than the angels, taking on the nature of a servant, as the same prophet says, “After these things he appeared on the earth and lived among human beings.” The faithless thought he was a mortal and changeable human being, but he is precisely the same one that those who truly believe in him will see—now that their hearts have been cleansed from sin—as the immortal and unchangeable God according to his own nature.
