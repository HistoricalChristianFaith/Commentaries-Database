Thus to those who wish to have happiness in the goods of present things, the psalm says, “How long, you people, shall my honor suffer shame? How long will you love vain words and seek after lies?” And in another text, “Put no confidence in extortion, and set no vain hopes on robbery; if riches increase, do not set your heart on them.” The blessed James does not cease to reprove such people, saying, “Come now, you rich, weep and wail over your impending miseries. Your wealth has rotted away, your clothes have become moth-eaten, your gold and silver have corroded, and that corrosion will be a testimony against you; it will devour your flesh like a fire. You have stored up treasure for the last days. Behold, the wages you withheld from the workers who harvested your fields are crying aloud, and the cries of the harvesters have reached the ears of the Lord of hosts. You have lived on earth in luxury and pleasure; you have fattened your hearts for the day of slaughter.” He commanded that the laughter and the joy of such people be turned to mourning and dejection, saying, “Cleanse your hands, you sinners, and purify your hearts, you of two minds. Begin to lament, to mourn, to weep. Let your laughter be turned into mourning and your joy into dejection. Humble yourselves before the Lord, and he will exalt you.”
