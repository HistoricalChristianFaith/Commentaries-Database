Therefore we know both the will to do good and the ability to do good come from God. David agrees completely with this, showing that by the command of divine generosity the grace of a good will is granted: “Our steps are made firm by the Lord when he delights in our way.” We have no good works in us unless they come from God, and we bear witness that it is done in God, saying, “Show your strength, O God, as you have done for us before.” And in another place: “With God we shall do valiantly,” that is, the work of virtue. So here in the place of the work of virtue, he said “virtue” just as John, for the work of justice, spoke of doing justice. For he says, “The person who acts in righteousness is righteous.” Paul also wants us to do the will of God, saying, “May the God of peace, who brought up from the dead the great shepherd of the sheep by the blood of the eternal covenant, Jesus our Lord, furnish you with all that is good, that you may do his will.”
