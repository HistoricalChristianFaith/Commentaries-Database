In the book of Wisdom it is clear that what separates people from God is not the distance of place but evil thoughts and wicked actions. It says, “Perverse thoughts separate people from God; the excellence of virtue banishes fools, because wisdom will not enter a heart that does evil or dwell in a heart enslaved to sin. The Holy Spirit of instruction flees deceit and departs from foolish speech.” Who cannot see that this alludes to the Trinity of persons, each according to their properties? In fact, it is said that “perverse thoughts separate people from God,” using a name by which the person of God the Father can be recognized. Then it adds that “wisdom will not enter a heart that does evil”; by this name Christ is indicated, whom Paul calls “the power of God and the wisdom of God.” Then it says, “The Holy Spirit flees from deceit, and departs from foolish speech.” Moreover, in order that no one would think that an evil or godless person could distance himself, spatially, from this holy Trinity who is the one, true and good God, Scripture then says, “Wisdom is a spirit that is a friend of people; but he will not leave unpunished one who blasphemes, because God is witness of his inmost feelings and a true observer of his heart, and he hears the words of his mouth. In fact, the Spirit of the Lord fills the universe.”
