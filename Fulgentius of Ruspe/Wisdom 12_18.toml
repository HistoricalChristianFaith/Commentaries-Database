With respect to existence and power, the Trinity is everywhere, wholly one God, filling all things with his power, not by his mass but wholly in each creature, and simultaneously wholly in all creatures. Regarding our thoughts, it is said that God descends to our level when he divinely moderates his word in such a way that he condescends to communicate his knowledge and love to us, speaking to us in a human way. Conversely, he rises in us when we ascend in charity and knowledge of the divinity, learning not to look for anything local in him who is infinite, or think that there is anything lowly in him who is sublime, or believe that there is anything changeable in God or think that there is anything temporary in him who is eternal.This is the way we are to understand the manifestation of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. Indeed, it is said that God rested in the beginning after having finished the creation of the world, although he was not fatigued by his work, because he accomplished everything solely by his will. To him it was said, “You exercise power when you wish,” as we hear in the psalm, “Whatever the Lord wishes he does, in heaven and on earth, in the seas and in all the depths.”

Abraham, “father of us all,” as the apostle says, “did not doubt God’s promise in unbelief but was strengthened in faith and gave glory to God, fully convinced that what he had promised, he was also able to do.” There is therefore no falsehood whatsoever in God’s promises, since no obstacle can stand before the action of the Almighty. And consequently, the effect of his will can ever fail, since we discover that his will itself is nothing other than his power. He who can do whatever he wants can want anything. Only of him, then, can it be truly said, “Whatever he wanted, he did.” And further, “You exercise power when you wish.” For this reason we said that in him there is as much power of the will as there is the will itself of the power. Since “power always accompanies his will,” in him will and power are one. In fact, just as God is not constrained by any necessity to promise what he does not want to do, so he is not impeded by anything in doing what he has promised to a lesser degree than he wants to or to delay its realization.
