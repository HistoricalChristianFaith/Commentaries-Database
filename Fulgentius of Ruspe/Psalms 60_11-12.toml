For the Spirit of the Lord did not say, he who does the truth, that his works be clearly seen as done in the Holy Spirit but “as done in God,” which we say are done not in the Father alone, or in the Son alone or in the Holy Spirit alone. But we confess that the truth is done by a human being in the holy Trinity itself, which is one God, in whom the blessed David indicates is the power of what is done by the faithful, saying, “With God we shall do valiantly; it is he who will tread down our foes.” For he is the one God concerning whom the blessed apostle says, “For from him and through him and for him are all things. To him be glory forever.”
