Therefore, let them [Arians] say that the Father and the Son are not two lord gods but their one Lord God, if they wish to hold to the truth of the faith and are unwilling to be found in rebellion against the commandments of the law and the gospel. For thus they will be able to preserve equally the understanding and the obligatory force of that text where it is said, “The Lord your God you shall adore, and him alone shall you serve.” Nor is it right for anyone to adore the Father as God in such a way that he does not adore the Son as God, for indeed it has been written about the Son in Deuteronomy: “Praise, O heavens, his people; worship him, all you gods.” Concerning him as well, the blessed David says in the psalms, “May all kings fall down before him, all nations give him service.”
