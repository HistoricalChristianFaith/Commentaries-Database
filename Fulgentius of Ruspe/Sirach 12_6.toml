The impious and sinners who have no intention of repenting of their impiety or iniquity will be condemned at the end to eternal torments, while to those who have repented God will lavish his mercy. This is what is written in the book of Ecclesiasticus: “The Most High has mercy on the penitent and will inflict punishment on the impious and sinners.” Further, in the same book it is said, “Remember that wrath will not be late in coming. Humble yourself to the utmost, because fire and worms fill up the punishment of the ungodly.” Again, Isaiah says that “their fire shall not be quenched, and their worm shall not die.” It is also written in Ecclesiasticus, “A synagogue of sinners is like a bundle of oak, and their end will be the flame of fire. The way of sinners is full of offenses, and, at the end, there will be the fiery pit, darkness and pains.”
