Concerning the coming judgment of human beings, living and dead, the blessed Paul says this, “I bear witness in the presence of God and of Christ Jesus, who will judge the living and the dead, and by his appearing and his kingly power.” At his coming, from the body of the first man which God fashioned from the earth, up until the bodies of all human beings which began to live when they were infused with a soul, all will be raised by him by whose action they were created. In the resurrection, individual bodies will be restored to their individual souls, which they began to have in the wombs of their mothers, in order that they might begin to live—in order that, in the examination of the just judge, souls might receive in their very same individual bodies their reward, of the kingdom or of punishment, in those bodies in which they had led a good or evil life in this world.
