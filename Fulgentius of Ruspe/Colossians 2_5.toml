This love, which is from God and is God, cannot be separated from the being of God, because God and love are one. For since love, itself inseparable from its source, not only possesses human beings who can be separated from one another, but from many hearts and souls makes one heart and one soul, what madness is it to say that love which is accustomed to join separated minds in an inseparable love can be separated from the human beings who express it? Hence it is that Paul said, “For even if I am absent in the flesh, yet I am with you in spirit, rejoicing as I observe your good order.” And in the Acts of the Apostles, it is written that the “community of believers was of one heart and mind” … something that was not brought about except by the Spirit of faith and love.
