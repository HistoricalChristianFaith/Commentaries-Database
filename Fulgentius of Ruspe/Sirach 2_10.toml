Know that God is working in you both to will and to do, according to a good will. Therefore, attend to your salvation with fear and trembling. Humble yourself before the Lord so that he may exalt you. Ask him for the beginning of a good will, seek from him the effects of good works, ask him for the gift of perseverance. Do not believe that when his support has stopped you can want or do anything good. Ask him to turn your eyes somewhere else so that they do not see vanity;37 beseech him to show you the way you should go, pray, so that he may direct your steps according to his Word and so that you will not be dominated by sins;39 call on him so that he can direct the work of your hands for you. Therefore, “be strong and take heart.” “Entrust your concerns to the Lord, and he will provide for them.”As he told you, you must not ascribe anything to your own strength, for you must not distrust divine power and devotion in anything. For, “The Lord is faithful in his words and holy in all his works.” He will not deny you his help in this world, nor will he withhold your reward in that life which is to come. He has shown you the right way and is himself the guide that will lead you to your heavenly home. “Trust, therefore, in the Lord, and do good.” Do not believe you will fail if he has agreed to have you under his protection. It is indeed written, “Has anyone trusted in the Lord and been put to shame? Or, has anyone persevered in the Lord and been abandoned? Or, has anyone called upon him and been neglected by him?” Therefore, do not lose your confidence which will have a great reward. Be strong and steadfast, knowing that your work shall not prove fruitless in the Lord.
