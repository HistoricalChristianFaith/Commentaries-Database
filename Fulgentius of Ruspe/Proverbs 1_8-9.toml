The church is not truly called the “pillar and foundation of truth” if it is found unsound in the most basic mystery of human salvation. But because it is truly called the “pillar and foundation of truth” by the apostle, whatever according to the canons of the church itself is given and received within it, among the holy mysteries of human redemption and reconciliation, is given with firm truth and received with firm truth.It is so commanded in Proverbs: “Hear, my child, your father’s instruction and do not reject your mother’s teaching,” so that we may never reject the general canons of holy mother the church, that is, those which the most harmonious assent of all the bishops confirms.
