Hold most firmly and never doubt that the holy Trinity, the only true God, just as it is eternal, is likewise the only one by nature unchangeable. God indicates this when he says to his servant Moses, “I am which I am.” Hence, it is said in the psalms, “In the beginning you laid the foundation of the earth, and the heavens are the work of your hands. They will perish, but you endure.”
