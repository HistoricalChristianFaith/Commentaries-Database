If there are any who are even in the catholic church and live evil lives, before they finish this life, let them hasten to give up the evil life, and let them not think that the catholic name is enough for salvation, if they do not do the will of God.… In Proverbs each one of us is commanded both to fear the Lord and to depart from evil. There it is said, “Fear the Lord and turn away from evil. It will be a healing for your flesh and a refreshment for your body.”
