The psalm sings truthfully, “Great is the Lord our God, almighty, his wisdom has no limit.” And to show the limitless immensity of this infinite eternity, it says elsewhere, “Great is the Lord and worthy of all praise; his greatness cannot be measured.” Indeed, it is necessary that he who is by nature eternal also be proclaimed immeasurable by nature, since what always exists cannot be measured, and what is everywhere cannot be enclosed in a place. Thus finally another testimony of Scripture says, “By her purity she pervades all things.” And a little later, “She reaches mightily from one end to the other, and governs all things well.” And if now we hear that wisdom reaches from one end to the other, we must understand that if she reaches from one end to the other, she surpasses both ends by the immensity of her infinite nature. Indeed, only one who cannot be enclosed within creation can reach the entire creation, since, if in filling the heavens she is immeasurable, she is likewise infinite in reaching from one end to the other.
