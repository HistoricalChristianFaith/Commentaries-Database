Therefore, there is no falseness in God’s promises because for the all-powerful there is no problem about doing things. And so the effects of the will are never lacking because the will itself is nothing other than power. Whatever God wills, he can do; he can do as much as he wishes.So it is rightly said of him alone, “He does whatever he pleases.” And again, “For you have power to act whenever you choose.” So we have said that there is as much power of will there as there is will itself for the power. Since for the one to whom it is subject, when he shall will, he can, willing being nothing other than power.
