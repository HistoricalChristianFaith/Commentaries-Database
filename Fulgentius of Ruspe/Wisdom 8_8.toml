The Scriptures are accustomed to speaking of opinion in two ways. They in fact speak of opinion both when someone thinks something that is not true and when he knows with all certainty that something is true. Blessed Stephen, in the Acts of the Apostles, speaks of an opinion concerning uncertain knowledge when he says of holy Moses, “He thought that his countrymen would have understood that God was offering them salvation through him.” But, to show that this was an uncertain opinion, he adds, “But they did not understand.” Similarly, it is said in the same book when the angel brought blessed Peter out of the jail, “he still did not realize that what was happening through the angel was real: he thought he was having a vision.” In the book of Wisdom an utterly certain knowledge is given as an opinion, in the place where wisdom itself says, “And if one desires wide experience, she knows what is past and infers what is to come.” What does it mean that wisdom infers, if not that it knows with all certainty? Thus also Paul, who had the mind of Christ, spoke of thinking something that he knew with certainty, saying, “I consider, in fact, that the sufferings of the present moment are not to be compared with the future glory that will be revealed in us.” And neither in this case can it be said that Paul had an uncertain knowledge of these things. In fact, he had a certain knowledge of them. Similarly, blessed Jeremiah said of Christ, “He is our God, and he will not be compared with another.” Does “he will not be compared” perhaps not mean that another will not be known? Thus blessed Isaiah says, “Lord, beside you we have known no other. We have invoked your name.”
