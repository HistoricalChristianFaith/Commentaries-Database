It is written that "wisdom opened the mouth of the mute and loosed the tongues of infants." Wisdom indeed opened the mouths of the mute, so the incredulous might believe, and loosed the tongues of infants, so that they might preach what they believed. Therefore, not without reason does Paul attribute his faith and his ability to speak to the gift of the Holy Spirit, saying, "Moved by that same spirit of faith of which it is written, "I believed, therefore I spoke," we also believe, and therefore we speak." A person believes with the will, and with the will speaks. The human will, however, cannot possess these things of its own if they are not given by God, "because wisdom opens the mouth of the mute and loosens the tongue of infants." - "On the Truth of Predestination 2.6.9"
