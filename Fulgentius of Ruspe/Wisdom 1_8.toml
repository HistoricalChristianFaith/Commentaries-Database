Divinely inspired, he speaks thus of the Holy Sprit: “Because the Spirit of the Lord fills the world, he embraces all things and knows what is said.” One understands, moreover, that here the Scripture refers to the voice of the heart, not of the body. That is, not to the voice of speech among living beings, but that of one’s most hidden thoughts, that resounding voice that only God hears, since he alone sees the one who ponders secretly. Thus he continues, “Therefore, no one who utters unrighteous things can remain hidden, nor will he be spared his chastening judgment.” To show further in what this wicked speech consists, so that it would be understood more as the expression of the conscience than of the tongue, the holy Scripture then explains, “There will be an inquiry into the reflections of the godless.” I have said this because it says of the Holy Spirit, “because he encompasses all things, he knows what is said.” Given that he encompasses all things, the Holy Spirit is not inferior to the Father or the Son. And because he has knowledge of hidden thoughts, he is recognized as the true God.
