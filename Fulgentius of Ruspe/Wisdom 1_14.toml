Every human being is so corrupted by the voluntary sin of the first man that only God, if he wills, can heal a person’s will by his good will. In fact, it is written, “He created all things that they might exist, and the creative forces of the world he made wholesome.” Still, lest human beings would ever think the beginning of their healing derived from themselves, the divine word immediately adds, “And there is no purging medicine in them.” Therefore, though the devil had deprived the first man of faith, he nevertheless did not deprive God of the power to give again what he had first given. Nor could the devil corrupt human nature to such a degree that it could not receive once again what it had lost, thanks to the generosity of God. In fact, the Almighty, who was capable of forming human nature, can also reform and preserve it, healing its fragility through grace.
