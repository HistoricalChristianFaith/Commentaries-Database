The grace of justification is given in the present time, but the grace of glorification is saved as a future grace. The one is of faith, the other of sight. Paul says that now “we walk by faith, not by sight.” What the saints believe now, then they will see.… The just person living by faith says with trusting faith, “I believe that I shall see the good things of the Lord in the land of the living.” This, therefore, is the order of divine redemption and reward in humankind so that, having been justified, he believes now what, having been glorified, he will receive then.
