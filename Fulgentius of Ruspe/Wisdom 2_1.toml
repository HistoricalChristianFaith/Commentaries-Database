Our thought, which originates and is formed in the memory, is rightly called an interior word. Indeed, what is thought, if not an interior discourse? Thus it is written, “What you speak in your hearts on your bed, reflect on and be silent.” In fact, in the Gospel, when the Lord said to the paralytic he had healed, “Your sins are forgiven you,” Luke the Evangelist adds, “The scribes and the Pharisees began to ask themselves, ‘Who is this who speaks blasphemies? Who can forgive sins, but God alone?’ But Jesus, knowing their thoughts, responded, ‘What are you thinking in your hearts?’ ” Whereas Luke said, “the scribes and the Pharisees began to ask themselves,” Matthew says, “Then some scribes began to think, ‘This man blasphemes!’ But Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said, ‘Why do you think evil things in your hearts?’ ” The book of Wisdom also says of some, “They spoke among themselves, reasoning unsoundly.” It is therefore clear that to think is the same as to speak within oneself. Thus, thought is invisible. That is, thoughts are said without the sound of the voice of the body, but they reach another’s hearing only through bodily speech.
