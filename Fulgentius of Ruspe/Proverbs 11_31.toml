Conversion from both impiety and iniquity is commanded. For both provoke the wrath of God against one, because God detests and condemns both, as Paul says, “The wrath of God is indeed being revealed from heaven against every impiety and human wickedness.” And Solomon says, as the blessed Peter had also inserted among his own words, “And if the righteous one is barely saved, when will the godless and the sinner appear?”
