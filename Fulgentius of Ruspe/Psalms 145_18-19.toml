If there are any who are even in the catholic church and live evil lives, before they finish this life, let them hasten to give up the evil life, and let them not think that the catholic [Christian] name is enough for salvation, if they do not do the will of God. For our Savior says, “not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord’ will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father in heaven.” In the book of Psalms as well, it is written that “the Lord is near to all who call on him, to all who call on him in truth. He fulfills the desire of all who fear him; he also hears their cry and saves them.” Wherefore also in Proverbs each one of us is commanded both to fear the Lord and to depart from evil. There it is said, “fear the Lord and turn away from evil. It will be a healing for your flesh and a refreshment for your body.”
