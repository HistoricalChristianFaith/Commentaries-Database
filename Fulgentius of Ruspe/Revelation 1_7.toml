Hold most firmly and never doubt that the Word made flesh always has the same truly human flesh with which God the Word was born of the Virgin, with which he was crucified and died, with which he rose and ascended to heaven and sits at the right hand of God, with which he will come again to judge the living and the dead. For this reason, the apostles heard from the angels, “He … will return in the same way as you have seen him going into heaven,” and the blessed John says, “Behold, he will come amid the clouds, and every eye will see him, even those who pierced him; and all the tribes of the earth will see him.”
