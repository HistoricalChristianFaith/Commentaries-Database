Hence it is that the true faith asserts that the Holy Spirit as well is the Creator, not created. How is the Spirit to be denied as Creator, by which the power of the heavens has been strengthened, as David says, “By the word of the Lord the heavens were made and all their host by the breath of his mouth.” And in another text: “When you send forth your spirit, they are created.” Indeed it is the Creator of all things who is the maker of human beings. Concerning it, the blessed Job says, “The Spirit of God has made me.” The Holy Spirit, then, as it has created all things, so, as infinite, it fills all things. And the one who fills all things is by nature true God. It is written that “the Spirit of the Lord has filled the whole world.” The blessed David as well bears witness that the Spirit of God is everywhere, saying to God, “Where can I go from your Spirit, or where can I flee from your presence?” How do the Arians deny that the Holy Spirit is God since we are the temple of the Holy Spirit, just as we are the temple of the Father and the Son? For the apostle says, “Do you not know that you are the temple of God and that the Spirit of God dwells in you? If anyone destroys God’s temple, God will destroy that person; for the temple of God, which you are, is holy.” The apostle asserts that we are the temple of God in such a way that in the same letter he also says that we are the temple of the Holy Spirit. For he says, “Do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit within you, whom you have from God?” And in order that he may show that the Holy Spirit is God, he immediately added, “Therefore glorify God in your body.”
