We know through the grace of God that the holy church is called a virgin, as the apostle says, “I betrothed you to one husband to present you as a chaste virgin to Christ,” but in that one virgin herself, virgins in the plural are also named. For we read, “Virgins will be brought to the king after her.” Nor is there any doubt that there is one church which is spread throughout the whole world which is called by the apostle “the church of the living God, the pillar and foundation of truth.” Still this is one church in such a way that in it many are called churches.
