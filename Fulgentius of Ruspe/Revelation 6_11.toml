The Word of God shows that when the time of vengeance comes, conversion will not then help the evil person evade punishment but avenging wrath will destroy him with due damnation. For that will be a time not of remission but of retribution, not of forgiveness but of revenge. This is put off by the divine patience so that the number of the saints can be filled up. The blessed John in the Apocalypse recalls that it is the saints who asked for this vengeance in these words, “How long will it be, holy and true master, before you sit in judgment and avenge our blood on the inhabitants of the earth?” And to teach those who are joined to this company that the time for vengeance is being put off by the highest ordinance, he adds right away. “Each of them was given a white robe, and they were told to be patient a little while longer until the number was filled of their fellow servants and brothers.”
