The true faith asserts that the Holy Spirit also is creator, not created. Indeed, how can one deny that he is creator, about whom it has been proven that he established the array of the heavens? David says, "By the word of the Lord the heavens were made, and by the Spirit of his mouth their entire array." And elsewhere, "Send forth your Spirit, and they shall be created." The one who made humanity is in fact the creator of all. Blessed Job calls him "the divine Spirit who made me." Therefore, just as the Holy Spirit created all things, in the same way he pervades all things, without limit. And one who pervades all things is true God by nature. It is written, "The Spirit of the Lord fills the world." And even blessed David attests that the Spirit is everywhere, saying precisely of God, "Where will I go, far from your Spirit, and where will I flee from your face?" Then how can the Arians deny that the Holy Spirit is God, given that we are the temple of the Holy Spirit, just as we are the temple of the Father and the Son? Indeed, the apostle says, "Do you not know that you are the temple of God and that the Spirit of God dwells in you? If anyone defiles the temple of God, God will destroy him. In fact, the temple of God is holy, and that is what you are." In the same letter, the apostle asserts that we are the temple of God in such a way as to say that we are also the temple of the Holy Spirit. He says, "Do you not know that your members are the temple of the Holy Spirit who is in you, whom you have from God?" And precisely to show that the Holy Spirit is God, he adds, "Glorify and keep God in your hearts." - "Letters 8.17.8"
