We read that it is written of wisdom, “Its memory is immortal, by the fact that it is recognized by God and by human beings.” How can it be recognized by human beings if it is not interior to them, but exterior? It cannot be recognized if it does not enter the soul of the person. It is said of wisdom, “Though remaining in itself, it renews all, and through the ages it enters holy souls.” And so that we should not think that to move into souls is something different than to enter them, the text of Scripture refers to it again with these words, “It freed a holy people and a blameless race from a nation of oppressors. It entered the soul of a servant of the Lord and withstood fearsome kings with wonders and signs.” This entry into souls is also proclaimed in the Apocalypse of John: “See, I stand at the door and knock. If anyone listens to my voice and opens to me, I will come to him, I will sup with him, and he with me.” By this same movement the Father and the Son enter the one who loves them, and they establish their dwelling in him, as the Son says: “If anyone loves me, he will keep my word, and the Father will love him, and we will come to him and make our dwelling with him.” And if this coming of the Father and the Son to the one with whom they make their dwelling were exterior and not interior, we would then like to know: where will they come to, and where will they make their dwelling with him? Moreover, we have seen that Christ dwells interiorly in his faithful ones, as Paul proclaims, saying, “That Christ would dwell in your hearts through faith.”
