The Christian who has lived in the fear of God, at whatever age he dies, is not swept away by a bitter and untimely death but crosses over supported by a maturity approved by God. Indeed, in the book of Wisdom we read, “Old age is not honored for length of time or measured by number of years. Wisdom, rather, is a person’s gray hair, and a blameless life is old age. Having become dear to God, this one was loved by him.”
