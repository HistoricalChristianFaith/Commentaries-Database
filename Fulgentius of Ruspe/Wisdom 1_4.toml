The Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit come and go in their own, incomprehensible way. One cannot speak of a “change of locality” of the Father or of the Son or of the Holy Spirit. They come and go in such a way that, physically, they neither go to a place nor depart from it. Consequently, this coming of the Father, of the Son and of the Holy Spirit does not demonstrate the mobility of God but his piety. It is said in fact that the unique divinity of the Trinity, who fills all things and contains all things, comes to the one to whom he deigns to manifest himself, and he distances himself from the one to whom he hides the light of his love. But this does not mean a local absence, when he justly abandons one who is unworthy; nor does he make himself present in a place if he visits with his mercy one whom he has made worthy. Therefore, even though God says, “I fill heaven and earth,” of some it is said, “God is not with them.” And though the Father fills all things, the book of Wisdom says, “Perverse thoughts separate human beings from God.” And if it also says of the Son—that is, of the wisdom of God, “she reaches from end to end with power and orders all things well,” the same Wisdom says of itself, “The perverse will seek me, but they will not find me.” And again, “Wisdom does not enter a soul who does evil or dwell in a body enslaved to sin.” And of the Holy Spirit, of whom it is said that he is immense in every way, it is said, “The Holy Spirit flees from deceit and departs from foolish speech.”
