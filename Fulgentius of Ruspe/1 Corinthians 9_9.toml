These animals accomplish their life and purpose in this world according to the incomprehensible will of the Creator. They render no account of their deeds because they are not rational. “Is God concerned about oxen?” Human beings, however, because they have been made rational, will render an account to God for themselves and for all the things which they have received for use in this present life.
