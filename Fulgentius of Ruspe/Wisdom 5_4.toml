This is the unexpected salvation: they considered the life of the righteous madness, and though insane, they believed themselves to be sane and did not expect the retribution of divine justice. They therefore neglected to correct their lives. In fact, they delighted to live here in luxury for a brief time, not believing that after a little while they would be tormented with eternal punishments. For this reason, seeing the righteous in the glory of the children of God, that glory about which blessed Paul says, “We live in it, and we boast in the hope of the glory of God,” the wicked will be amazed at the glory of the righteous, that is, of the children of God, because the righteous are children of God.
