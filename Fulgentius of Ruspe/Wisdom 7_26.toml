The Arians clearly show themselves to worship two gods when they deny that the Son is equal to the Father. And they declare him less, not regarding the assumption of the flesh (which the truth of the faith teaches) but with respect to the nature of the immeasurable divinity, even though it is said of him who is the wisdom of God that he is “a reflection of the eternal light.” It is also said of him, in the letter to the Hebrews, “that he is the radiance of his glory and the imprint of his being.” They should look at the “reflection of the eternal light” and recognize that, as that eternal light is infinite, so its reflection is in no way secondary or inferior by nature. Its eternity, rather, is identical to its infinity and its infinity to its eternity.

So as to show that the Son is infinite along with the Father, the sacred Scripture was careful to say of wisdom, “It is the reflection of the eternal light, a spotless mirror of the majesty of God and an image of his goodness.” In this testimony are shown the oneness of nature, the distinction of persons and the infinite equality of the Father and the Son. No one can doubt that in this passage the Father is called the light and the Son the reflection. About this, the apostle also says authoritatively, “He is the radiance of his glory and the imprint of his being and sustains all things with the power of his word.” See that it is said that the Son is the reflection and governs all things. If someone thinks that the Father is infinite but that the Son has limits, let him show us in what way the light and its reflection could be different beings, when, even if they are differentiated by name, they are not distinct in kind, nor do they differ in extension. In fact, the light and its reflection do not have the same name, but neither do they have different natures.
