The word cup means nothing other than the new covenant in the Lord.… The grace of suffering was intended by the Lord when the word cup is used. For what did he wish to be understood when he said to the sons of Zebedee, “Can you drink the cup that I am going to drink?” … and “Shall I not drink the cup that the Father gave me?” A stone’s throw from his disciples he is torn away to die for the sins of humanity. This is his cup of suffering. He shows his feelings of human weakness, saying … “Father, if you are willing, take this cup away from me.”.
