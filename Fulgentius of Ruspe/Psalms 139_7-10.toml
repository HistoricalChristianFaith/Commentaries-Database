Hold most firmly and never doubt that God the Trinity is unbounded in power, not in mass; and that every creature, spiritual and bodily, is bound by his power and his presence. For God the Father says, “I fill the heavens and the earth.” For it is said of the Wisdom of God, which his Son is, that “it reaches mightily from one end of the earth to the other and orders all things well.” Concerning the Holy Spirit we read that “the Spirit of the Lord has filled the whole world.” And David the prophet says, “Where can I go from your Spirit? Or where can I flee from your presence? If I ascend to heaven, you are there; if I make my bed in Sheol, you are there.”
