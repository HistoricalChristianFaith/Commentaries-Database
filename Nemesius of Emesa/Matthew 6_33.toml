De Nat. Hom., 42: That there is a Providence, is shown by such signs as the following; The continuance of all things, of those things especially which are in a state of decay and reproduction, and the place and order of all things that exist is ever preserved in one and the same state; and how could this be done unless by some presiding power? But some affirm that God does indeed care forthe general continuance of all things in the universe, and provides for this, but that all particular events depend on contingency.
