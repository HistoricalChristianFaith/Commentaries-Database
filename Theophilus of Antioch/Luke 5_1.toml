But the Lord seeks to avoid glory the more it followed Him, and therefore separating Himself from the multitude, He entered into aship, as it is said, And he saw two ships standing near the lake: but the Fishermen were gone out of them, and were washing their nets.
Behold the gentleness of Christ; He asks Peter; and the willingness of Peter, who was obedient in all things.
