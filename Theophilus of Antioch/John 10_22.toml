The Evangelist mentions the time of winter, to show that it was near His passion. He suffered in the following spring; for which reason He took up His abode at Jerusalem.
Be you also careful, in the winter time, i.e. while yet in this stormy wicked world, to celebrate the dedication of your spiritual temple, by ever renewing yourself, ever rising upward in heart. Then will Jesus be present with you in Solomonâ€™s porch, and give you safety under His covering. But in another life no man will be able to dedicate Himself.
After He had said, You are not of My sheep, He exhorts them to become such: My sheep hear My voice.
But how then did Judas perish? Because hedid not continue to the end. Christ speaks of them who persevere. If any sheep is separated from the flock, and wanders from the Shepherd, it incurs danger immediately.
