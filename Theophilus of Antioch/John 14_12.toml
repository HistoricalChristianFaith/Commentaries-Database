This is an explanation of the doctrine of miracles. It is by prayer, and invocation of His name, that a man is able to work miracles.
Observe the order in which the glorifying of the Father comes. In the name of Jesus miracles were done, by which men were made to believe the Apostlesâ€™ preaching. This brought them to the knowledge of the Father, and thus the Father was glorified in the Son.
