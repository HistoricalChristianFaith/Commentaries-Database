Now He says, on the second sabbath after the first, because the Jews called every feast a sabbath. For Sabbath means rest. Frequently therefore was there feasting at the preparation, and they called the preparation a sabbath because of the feast, and hence they gave to the principal sabbath the name of the second-first, as being the second in consequence of the festival of the day preceding.
But he reproves them in another way, as it is added, And he said to them, that the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath. As if he said, I am the Lord of the sabbath, as being He who ordained it, and as the Legislator I have power to loose the sabbath; for Christwas called the Son of man, who being the Son of God yet condescended in a miraculous manner to be made and called for man's sake the Son of man.
