As if He says, What think you of My death? Behold, a little while, and it willcome to pass. But by the words, Today and tomorrow, are signified many days; as we also arewont to say in common conversation, &#8220;Today and tomorrow such a thing takes place,&#8221; not that it happens in that interval of time. And to explain more clearly the words of the Gospel, you must not understand them to be, I must walk to day and to morrow, but place a stop after today and tomorrow, then add, and walk on the day following, as frequently in reckoning weare accustomed to say, &#8220;The Lord's day and the day after, and on the third I will go out,&#8221; as ifby reckoning two, to denote the third. So also our Lord speaks as if calculating, I must do soto day, and so to morrow, and then afterward on the third day I must go to Jerusalem.
But because they said to Him, Depart from hence, for Herod seeks to kill you, speaking in Galilee where Herod reigned, He shows that not in Galilee, but in Jerusalem it had been fore-ordained that He should suffer. Hence it follows, For it can not be that aprophet perish out of Jerusalem. When you hear, It can not be (or it is not fitting) that aprophet should perish out of Jerusalem, think not that any violent constraint was imposed upon the Jews, but He says this seasonably with reference to their eager desire after blood; just as if any one seeing a most savage robber, should say, the road on which this robber lurks can not be without bloodshed to travelers. So also no where else but in the abode of robbers must the Lord of the prophets perish. For accustomed to the blood of His prophets, they will also kill the Lord; as it follows, O Jerusalem, which kills the prophets.
Or your house, (that is, temple,) as if He says, As long as there was virtue in you, it was my temple, but after that you made it a den of thieves, it was no more my house but yours. Or by house He meant the whole Jewish nation, according to the Psalm, O house of Jacob, bless you the Lord, by which he shows that it was He Himself who governed them, and took them out of the hand of their enemies. It follows, And verily I say to you
For then also will they unwillingly confess Him to be their Lord and Savior, when there shall be no departure hence. But in saying, You shall not see me until he shall come does not signify that present hour, but the time of His cross; as if He says, When you have crucified Me, you shall no more see Me until I come again.
