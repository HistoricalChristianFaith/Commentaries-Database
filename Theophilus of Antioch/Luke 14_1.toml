But by His question He exposes their folly. For while God blessed the sabbath, they forbade to dogood on the sabbath; but the day which does not admit the works of the good is accursed.
As though He said, If the law forbids to have mercy on the sabbath-day, haveno care of your son when in danger on the sabbath-day. But why speak I of a son, when you do not even neglect an ox if you see it in danger?
