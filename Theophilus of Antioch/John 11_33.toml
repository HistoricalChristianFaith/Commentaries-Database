To prove His human nature He sometimes gives it free vent, while at other times He commands, and restrains it by, the power of the Holy Spirit. Our Lord allows His nature to be affected in these ways both to prove that He is very Man, not Man in appearance only; and also to teach us by His own example the due measures of joy and grief. For the absence altogether of sympathy and sorrow is brutal, the excess of them is womanly.
Martha said this from weakness of faith, thinking it impossible that Christ could raise her brother, so long after death.
Christ reminds Martha of what He had told her before, which she had forgotten: Jesus said to her, Said I to you, that, if you would believe, you should see the glory of God?
