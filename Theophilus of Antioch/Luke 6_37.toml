As if he says, As when you wish to measure meal without sparing, you press it down, shake it together, and let it pour over abundantly; so the Lord will give a large and overflowing measure into your bosom.
But some one will put the subtle question, &#8220;If the return is made over abundantly, how is it the same measure?&#8221; to which we answer, that He said not, &#8220;In just as great a measure shall it be measured to you again, but in the same measure.&#8221; &#8220;For he who has shown mercy, shall have mercy shown to him, and this is measuring again with the same measure; but our Lord spoke of the measure running over, because to such a one He will show mercy a thousand times. So also in judging; for he that judges and afterwards is judged receives the same measure. But as far as he was judged the more severely that he judged one like to himself, was the measure running over.
