Our Lord having described a rightful difference, next teaches us a rightful reconciliation, saying, When you go with your adversary to the magistrate, as you are in the way, give diligence that you may be delivered from him As if He says, When your adversary is bringing you to judgment, give diligence, that is, try every method, to be released from him. Or give diligence, that is, although you have nothing, borrow in order that you maybe released from him, lest he summon you before the judge as it follows, Lest he hale you to the  judge, and the judge deliver you to the officer, and the officer cast you into prison.
