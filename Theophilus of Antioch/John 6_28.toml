Christ, though He saw it would not avail, yet for the good of others afterwards, answered their question; and showed them, or rather the whole world, what wasthe work of God: Jesus answered and said to them, This is the work of God, that you believe in Him whom He has sent.
He calls Himself the true bread, because the only-begotten Son of God, made man, was principally signified bythe manna. For manna means literally, what is this? The Israelites were astonished at first on finding it, and asked one another what it was. And the Son of God, made man, is in an especial sense this mysterious manna, which we ask about, saying, What is this? How can the Son of God be the Son of man? How can one person consist of two natures? .
But this bread, being essentially life, (for Heis the Son of the living Father,) in quickening all things, does but what is natural to Him todo. For as natural bread supports our weak flesh, so Christ, by the operations of the Spirit, gives life to the soul; and even in corruption to the body, (for at the resurrection the body will be made incorruptible.) Wherefore He says, that He gives life to the world.
