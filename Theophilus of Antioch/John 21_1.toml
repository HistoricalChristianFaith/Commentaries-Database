Peterâ€™s girding himself is a sign of modesty. He girt himself with a linen coat, such as Thamian and Tyrianfishermen throw over them, when they have nothing else on, or even over their other clothes.
To show that it was no vision, He bade them take of the fish they had caught. Jesus says to them, Bring of the fish which you have now caught. Another miracle follows of viz. that the net was not broken by the number of fish: Simon Peter went up, anddrew the net to land full of great fishes, a hundred and fifty and three: and for all there were so many, yet was not the net broken.
In the night time before the presence of the sun, Christ, the Prophets took nothing; for though they endeavored to correct the people, yet these often fell into idolatry.
