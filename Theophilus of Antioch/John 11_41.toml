The voice which roused Lazarus, is the symbol of that trumpet which will sound at the general resurrection.(He spoke loud, to contradict the Gentile fable, that the soul remained in the tomb. The soul of Lazarus is called to as if it were absent, and a loud voice were necessary to summon it.)And as the general resurrection is to take place in the twinkling of an eye, so did this single one: And he that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with grave clothes, and his facewas as bound about with a napkin. Now is accomplished what was said above, The hour iscoming, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God, and they that hear shall live.
