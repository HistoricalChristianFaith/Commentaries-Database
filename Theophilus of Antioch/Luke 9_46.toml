Because then our Lord had said, He who is least among you all, the same shall be great, John feared, lest perhaps they had done wrong in hindering a certain man by their own power. For a prohibition does notshow the probitor to be inferior, but to be one who thinks himself somewhat superior. Hence it is added, And John answered and said, Master, we saw one casting out devils in your name, and we forbade him. Not indeed from envy, but to distinguish the working of miracles, for hehad not received the power of working miracles with them, nor had the Lord sent him as Hedid them; nor did he follow Jesus in all things. Hence he adds, because he follows not with us.
