Or they called Him a Samaritan because He transgressed the Hebrew ordinances, as that of the sabbath: the Samaritans not being correct observers of the law. And they suspected Him of having a devil, because He could disclose what was in their thoughts. When it was that they called Him a Samaritan, the Evangelist nowhere says: a proof that the Evangelists left out many things.
He honored the Father, by revenging Him, and not suffering murderers or liars to call themselves the true sons of God.
