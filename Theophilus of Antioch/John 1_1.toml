Sabellius is overthrown by this text. For he asserts that the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are one Person, Who sometimes appeared as the Father, sometimes as the Son, sometimes as the Holy Spirit. But he is manifestly confounded by this text, and the Word was with God; for here the Evangelist declares that the Son is one Person, God the Father another.
Or combine it thus: From the Word being with God, it follows plainly that there are two Persons. But these two are of one Nature; and therefore it proceeds, In the Word was God: to show that Father and Son are of One Nature, being of One Godhead.
