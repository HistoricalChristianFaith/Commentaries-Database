Our Lord remonstrates with them; Many good works have I showed you from My Father, strewing that they had no just reason for their anger.
Or, sanctified, i.e. set apart to be sacrificed for the world: aproof that He was God in a higher sense than the rest. To save the world is a divine work, not that of a man made divine by grace.
