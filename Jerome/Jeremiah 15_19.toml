It is obvious that the text above was said not by Jerusalem but by a prophet. To him the Lord responds, “If you turn from the sins of the people, I likewise will turn you from tribulation toward joyfulness, and you will stand before my face like the angels stand in the presence of God daily, beholding his face.” Also, if you separate the precious from the vile, you will become like my mouth. “Now should you think,” he adds, “that there is no reward for good works, if you distinguish my saints from the crowd of sinners in your speech, you will be as my mouth, and you will be united to my precepts. For sinners need to be imitators of you, not you of them. Nor should you fear and ask: ‘Why has my pain become perpetual and my wound worse (or incurable),’ such that I lose all hope of being healed? For I have made you like a bronze and impregnable wall, so that you can withstand all the strength of your adversaries. Moreover, you have me as a helper, and I will liberate you from the hand of the most evil (or pestilent), and I will redeem you with my blood (or with the presence of my help).” May we consider just how great a reward the speech of the teacher will have if it is able to liberate from error and to rescue from among the number of sinners! - "Six Books on Jeremiah 3.59"
