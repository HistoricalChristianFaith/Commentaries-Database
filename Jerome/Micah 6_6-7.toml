(Vers. 6, 7.) What shall I offer to the Lord? Shall I bow down before the Most High God? Shall I offer burnt offerings to Him, and yearling calves? Can the Lord be pleased with thousands of rams, or with many thousands of fattened goats? Shall I give my firstborn for my transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul? LXX: Where shall I find the Lord? Shall I seek my God on high? Shall I seek Him in burnt offerings, in yearling calves? May the Lord receive in the thousands of rams, or in the ten thousands of fat goats? If I offer my firstborn for my impiety: the fruit of my womb for the sin of my soul. God has called the people to judgment: he, knowing his own sin, does not want to contend, but to plead, and yet he has no confidence in his own prayers. For nothing is worthy to be offered to God for sin, and no humility can cleanse the stains of transgressions, because it is impossible for the blood of bulls and calves, and the marrow-burning holocaust, and the blood of rams and fat goats, to wash away the filth of the soul. Will I, he says, give my firstborn for my crime, as it is described that the king of Moab did (2 Kings 3)? Or the fruit of my womb for the sin of my soul, as Jephthah did, offering his daughter for the rashness of his vow (Judith 11)? Therefore we who are of the people of God, knowing that not every living creature will be justified in his sight (Psalm 142), and saying: I have become like an animal before you (Psalm 73:22-23), repenting for our sins, we doubt and say: Where shall I find the Lord, shall I receive my exalted Lord? How can I capture him as he flees? How much cleanliness will I be able to prepare for the Trinity's lodging? Should I seize him in burnt offerings, so that I offer myself as a whole burnt offering to him, or in one-year-old calves, so that I, deserting milk and coming to solid food, may become worthy of the acceptable food in the year of the Lord? If I offer a thousand rams, if I offer ten thousand goats, and if I spiritually understand and present all the Levitical sacrifices in myself, and if a thousand and ten thousand fall from my side, yet I will not be able to give anything worthy in which I can apprehend or receive God. If I give my firstborn for impiety, and the fruit of my womb for the sin of my soul: indeed I will give whatever is first in me, but for my sin and impiety I will offer nothing worthy to God. Therefore, even David prays and says: Wash me more and more from my iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin. For I know my iniquities, and my sin is always against me (Psalm 50, 3). Only the blood is offered worthily for the sin of the soul: and the blood, not of calves, nor of rams, nor of goats, but one's own blood is offered worthily, as the prophet says and asks: What shall I repay to the Lord for all that he has repaid to me? And afterwards, responding, I will receive the chalice of salvation and invoke the name of the Lord. Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his saints. (Ps. CXV). But we do not give the blood itself, but we give it back. And what is similar? When the righteous person died for sinners, the Son of God died for men, shall we sinners and men die for the confession of his name?
