(Verse 39) And going forward a little, he fell on his face, praying and saying: My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass away from me. Nevertheless, not as I will, but as you will. Having given the apostles the command to endure and keep watch with the Lord, he advanced a little and fell on his face, showing the humility of his mind in the appearance of his flesh, and he said in a gentle way: My Father, and he asked that, if possible, the cup of suffering pass from him, about which we have spoken above. But, he does not ask to be spared out of fear, but out of mercy for the earlier people, so as not to drink from the cup that they have offered. Therefore, he specifically does not say, let this cup pass from me, but let this cup pass, that is, the cup of the Jewish people, who cannot claim ignorance as an excuse, if they kill me, having the Law and the prophets, who daily prophesy about me. Yet, turning back to himself, what he had hesitantly declined from the perspective of a human, he confirms from the perspective of God the Son. However, not as I want, but as you. No, he says, let this not be done, which I speak with human emotion; but because of what I descended to earth by your will.
