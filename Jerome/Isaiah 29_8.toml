Truly, this life is a dream, a dream of riches; for when we seem to have them within our grasp, immediately they slip away. Isaiah expresses this same thought: “As when a thirsty man dreams he is drinking and awakens faint and dry,” so indeed are the riches of this world; while we are reaching out for them they are gone.
