“One mightier than I is coming after me, the thong of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and untie.” The meaning of the words: “He must increase, I must decrease,” is that the gospel must increase, but I, the law, must decrease. John, that is, the law in John, was clothed, therefore, in the hair of a camel, for he could not wear a tunic of the lamb of whom it is said: “Behold the lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world;” and again: “He is led like a lamb to the slaughter.” In the law, we cannot wear a tunic from that Lamb.
