If our Jerusalem were tripped up by the lies of heresy, she would take her own sons who were stronger in the faith and her own daughters who were not as strong in the faith—whether they were sons who knew certain mystical things, or whether the daughters accepted straight history—to be handed over to be devoured by demons, and when she had killed them, she believed that she had made them live and please images and be satisfied by their massacre.
