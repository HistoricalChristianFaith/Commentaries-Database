(Verse 50 and following) And Joseph had two sons before the years of famine came, whom Aseneth, the daughter of Potipherah, the priest of On, bore to him. And Joseph called the name of his firstborn son Manasseh, for God has made me forget all my toil and all my father's house. And the name of the second he called Ephraim, for God has made me fruitful in the land of my affliction. Note, however, regarding the question that will be posed shortly about Joseph's sons, that before the time of famine, when Jacob entered Egypt, Joseph had only two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim. Manasse, calling him because he has forgotten his labors. For in Hebrew, forgetfulness is called oblivio. Ephraim, because God has made him fruitful. And from this word, the increase is transferred into our language.
