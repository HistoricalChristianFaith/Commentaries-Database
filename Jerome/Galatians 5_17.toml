The “flesh struggles against the Spirit: ” that is, the literal and flat understanding of Scripture fights against allegory and spiritual doctrine.… And the carnal sense of Scripture, which cannot be fulfilled (since we cannot do all that is written), shows that we do not have it in our power to fulfill the law when even if we wish to follow the letter we are prevented by its impossibility.
