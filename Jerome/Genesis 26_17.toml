(Verse 17.) And Isaac departed from there and came to the valley of Gerar, and he dwelt there. The valley has a stream in Hebrew. For Isaac could not dwell in the valley after he became great. However, he dwelt by the stream, of which it is written: He shall drink from the brook by the way (Psalm 110:7). Also, during the time of famine, Elijah drank from that stream. But because Elijah was not perfect like Christ, therefore that stream dried up for him (1 Kings 17:7). Our Lord, indeed, was also handed over in the river: consecrating our regeneration and the sacrament of Baptism.
