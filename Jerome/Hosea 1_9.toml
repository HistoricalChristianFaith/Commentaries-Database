“For he proclaims peace to his people, and to his faithful ones, and to those who turn to him from their hearts.” I note here a threefold classification: his people, his loyal servants, and those who come back to him in hope. He proclaims peace to his people, not to the Jews of whom in Hosea he says, “You are not my people.”
