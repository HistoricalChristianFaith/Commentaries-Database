“For you shall inherit all the nations.” We pray that you be judge because you have compassion on all nations. What was the prophet’s intention in saying, “You shall inherit all the nations,” instead of, you shall have all the nations? Whenever an inheritance has been bestowed, death has preceded; hence, we are called heirs and coheirs. Heirs, the apostle said, of Christ because Christ died for us; coheirs because Christ will reign with us.
