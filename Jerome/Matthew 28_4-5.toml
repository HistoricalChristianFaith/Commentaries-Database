(Vers. 4, 5.) However, because of his fear, the guards were terrified and became like dead men. But the angel, responding, said to the women: Do not be afraid. For I know that you seek Jesus, who was crucified: He is not here, for he has risen as he said. The guards, terrified by fear, lie stupefied like dead men, and yet the angel comforts not them, but the women. Do not be afraid. Let them, he says, fear: let fear continue in those in whom unbelief persists. Furthermore, because you seek Jesus who was crucified, listen to the fact that He has risen and fulfilled the promises.
