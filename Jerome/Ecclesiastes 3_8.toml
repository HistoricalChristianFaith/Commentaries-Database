"A time
for loving and a time for hating." The time for loving God, children, wife, and
relatives is afterwards, and the time for hating those in martyrdom since
hostile piety attacks those steadfast men for the sake of the confession of
Christ. Or maybe there is a time for
loving the law, and those things that the law decrees- that is circumcision,
sacrifices, the Sabbath, Neumania [The Jewish feast of the New Moon.],
and a time for hating them when the grace of the Gospel has been lost. But we cannot say this, since now we look
through the mirror in mystery, the time for loving is the present, and in the
future there will come a time when we will see face to face and then, more
accomplished, we will begin to hate and despise what we love. [Cfr I Cor. 13, 12.] "A time for war and a time for peace. "Although we are in the present world,
it is the time for war: when we have left this world the time for peace will
come. For the place of God is in peace
and so too is our city of Jerusalem, for it is called 'chosen in peace'. Therefore no one now thinks he is safe: you
must prepare yourselves in the time of war and put on the apostles arms, so
that we may rest in peace at last victorious.
