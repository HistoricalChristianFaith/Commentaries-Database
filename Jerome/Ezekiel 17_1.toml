To no one is there any doubt that the prophet makes known one thing in words as an allegory and a parable but means something else, for even the Savior spoke to the people in parables, which he explained in secret to the apostles. Therefore we must understand the allegory and the parable for what they are. There are two eagles that are placed before us in this part of the prophecy of Ezekiel.
