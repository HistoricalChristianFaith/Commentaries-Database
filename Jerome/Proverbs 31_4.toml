The wine of the flesh does not cheer the heart of man but overpowers it and produces madness; it is written, in fact, that it is not for kings to drink wine. The apostle, too, writes that it is good not to eat meat and not to drink wine; yet we are told that wine gladdens the heart of man. This means, however, spiritual wine, by which, if one drinks, he immediately becomes inebriated.
