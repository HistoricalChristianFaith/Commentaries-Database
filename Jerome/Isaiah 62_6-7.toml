(Verse 6, 7.) I have set watchmen upon your walls, O Jerusalem, who shall never hold their peace day or night: you who make mention of the Lord, keep not silence, and give him no rest, until he establishes, and until he makes Jerusalem a praise in the earth. LXX: And upon your walls, O Jerusalem, I have set watchmen, who shall never hold their peace day or night, remembering the Lord: there is no one like you, if he corrects you, and he will make Jerusalem rejoice upon the earth. The Prophet said: 'For Zion I will not be silent, and for Jerusalem I will not rest, and so on until that place where the chapter is now completed: The bridegroom will rejoice over the bride; your God will rejoice over you.' And he had promised that he would pray day and night, so that the Savior and the Just One who had been promised would come, and like a lamp illuminate the whole world. After this, the person of God speaking to Jerusalem is introduced, that is, the Church of the early Christians, and the one that was built up in the Apostles and through the Apostles: 'I have set watchmen on your walls, who we can understand to be either angels or apostles, and all its rulers and teachers.' Those who guard the walls of the Church, lest our adversary the devil, who prowls around like a roaring lion, may seize an opportunity to devastate the flock of the Lord.  The guardians should not be silent, neither during the day nor at night, neither in times of joy nor in times of sorrow; but should always pray for the mercy of the Lord, so that His flock and the walls of Jerusalem may be guarded and strengthened by His help. Therefore, a speech is directed to the same guardians and teachers: O you who remember the Lord and tirelessly pray for His mercy day and night, be careful never to let prayer be silent in your mouth. Do not give silence to him, I imply, O Lord; but always be annoying, opportune, importune, and imitate the interruption of a harsh judge. For if he has put aside the fierceness of his mind by constant supplication, how much more will the Heavenly Father give good things to those who ask? However, you should pray for a long time, until Jerusalem, which has fallen among the Jews and is both an example and a curse, is praised throughout the whole world. And why did the Seventy wish, because of what is contained in Hebrew, that you do not remain silent about it until she establishes and places praise in Jerusalem on the earth, saying, the meaning of which does not agree with what was said before: For there is no one like you, if she corrects and makes Jerusalem rejoice over the earth. Unless perhaps by this skillful eloquence we may add, that it may be said to the guardians of the Church, that none of them will be like those who have made it through their preaching, so that she may be corrected, and all the earth may rejoice in Jerusalem.
