"And moreover, because the preacher was wise,
he still taught the people knowledge; yea, he gave good heed, and sought out,
and set in order many proverbs. The
preacher sought to find out acceptable words: and that which was written was
upright, even words of truth. "The wisdom in which Solomon judges all kinds
of men he now professes at the end, because he was not happy with the use of
the old law, but therefore immersed himself in trying to solve difficult
problems of his own accord, and in teaching people; he composed parables and
proverbs, which say one thing superficially and yet have a deeper meaning. For proverbs often have different meaning to
that which is written, and this is the method used in teaching in the Gospels,
since the Lord spoke to the people in parables and in proverbs [Cfr. Matth, 13; 15.],
but He explained them to the apostles in secret. From this we clearly get the Book of
Proverbs, and we shouldn't think that they are but simple stories with
teachings, but rather as gold still in the earth, as a seed within a nut, or as
a fruit is found inside the hairy covering of its peel. Thus we must search for another meaning in
them which pertains to God. Before this
though he mentions that he desired to know the workings of the world and the
wisdom and mind of God. He wanted to
know why one thing or another should happen, as David after the death of the
body and spirit hoped he would see the path to heaven, saying, "I will see
the heavens, the work of your fingers" [Ps. 8, 4.]. But now Solomon strives to find this wisdom,
so that he may know and understand with his human mind, though confined by the
walls of the body, the truth only known by God.
