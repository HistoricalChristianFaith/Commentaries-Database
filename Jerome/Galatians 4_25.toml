Hagar, who is interpreted as “sojourning,” “wandering” or “tarrying,” gives birth to Ishmael…. No wonder that the Old Covenant, which is on Mount Sinai, which is in Arabia and nearby to Jerusalem, is stated and alleged in writing to be ephemeral and not perpetual. The sojourning of Hagar stands in contrast with perpetual possession. The name of Mount Sinai means “tribulation,” while Arabia means “death.” –.
