(Verse 31, 32.) And immediately Jesus, stretching out His hand, took hold of him and said to him, 'You of little faith, why did you doubt?' And when they got into the boat, the wind stopped. If it is said to the Apostle Peter, of whose faith and ardor of mind we have spoken above, who confidently asked the Savior, saying, 'Lord, if it is You, command me to come to You on the water,' because he was a little afraid, 'You of little faith, why did you doubt?' What must we say, who have even the smallest portion of this little faith?
