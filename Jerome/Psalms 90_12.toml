“So make your right hand known that fettered we may gain wisdom of heart.” Some codices say “trained”; others “fettered.” “Trained” implies one thing; “fettered,” another. What, then, is the meaning of “make your right hand known”? Why have you restrained your right hand so long, God? “Why draw back your hand and keep it idle beneath your garment?” says another psalm. Here is its meaning: we are lying prostrate in sickness; we are powerless in our sins; send forth your right hand and raise us up. Why do you keep your right hand so long idle beneath your cloak? Your heart overflows with a goodly theme;37 send forth your right hand and set us free. Make known to us the mystery that has been hidden from generation to generation. “Make your right hand known.” What are you pilfering, Arius? The psalmist did not say, “Make your right hand,” for God was never without his right hand. But what did he say? Your right hand, that you have always had and that has been in your bosom, make it known to us. Because we are not able to know him abiding in his Godhead, he assumes our humanity, and in that way we know him.
