(Verse 32.) He says, because of the wickedness of the children of Israel and the children of Judah, which they have done, provoking me to anger, they themselves, and their kings, and their leaders, their priests, and their prophets, the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem. Because he had said before: In my fury and in my indignation this city has been made for me, from the day when they built it until this day, when it is taken away from my sight; and he had shown that there was no one without sin in general, now he enumerates them individually, and includes kings, and leaders, and priests, and prophets, comprehending everything in one statement: The men of Judah, he says, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem. And he did not say it beautifully: Their kings, and their rulers, and their priests, and their prophets, but because their kings, and their rulers, and their priests, and their prophets have sinned.

And they turned their backs to me, and not their faces. According to what is written elsewhere: And they turned against me the shoulder that was turning away (Zech. 7:11). For the one who prays, bowing down with a bent neck is cast down to the ground; but the one who turns his back, by that bodily gesture indicates his disregard for the one threatening him. And, he says, they were doing this.
