"A time
for killing and a time for healing." It is both the time for killing and the time
for healing, he says: "I will kill, and I will revive" [Deut. 32, 39.]. He cures, provoking one to repentance. 'I killed' has the same meaning as "in
the morning I murdered all the sinners of the Earth." [Ps. 100.8.] "A time for destroying and a time for
building. "We are not able to
build anything good unless we have first destroyed what is bad. Just as the word of Jeremiah came from God so
that he first rooted out, undermined and killed; then he built and planted. [Ier.. I, 10.]
