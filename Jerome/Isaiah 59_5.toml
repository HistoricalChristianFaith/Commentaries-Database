Because Isaiah said that “they weave a spider’s web,” he now explains why the weaving of this web profits nothing. All of their work and teaching, he says, fails to produce either a vestment for Christ or a covering to protect the soul’s nakedness, but they spend themselves in vain labor, as the same prophet says: “This people honors me with their lips, but their heart is far from me. They worship me in vain, teaching doctrines and precepts of humankind,” the following of which neglects the law of God. …Then it continues that their ways are perverse not by nature but by their own will, for everything that is perverted and crooked has been twisted from what was right into something depraved.
