All sins must be avoided, to be sure, because all sins are contrary to God, but they vary in degree. The proud, for example, are God’s enemies. “God resists the proud but gives grace to the humble.” The devil is the prince of the proud. “Lest he be puffed up with pride,” says holy Scripture, “and incur the condemnation passed on the devil,” for everyone who glorifies himself in his heart is partner to the devil, who used to say, “By my own power I have done it, and by my wisdom, for I am shrewd. I have moved the boundaries of peoples.” … All other failings deserve the mercy of the Lord because, in humility, they are submitted to the tribunal of God; pride alone, because it honors itself beyond its power, resists God. The adulterer or the fornicator does not dare to raise his eyes to heaven; in defection of soul, he looks for God’s mercy; yet this one whom conscience bows down and humbles to the ground, it also elevates to heaven. When pride and inordinate desire for glory raise up a person, they at the same time abase him, for by his sin they make him an enemy of God.
