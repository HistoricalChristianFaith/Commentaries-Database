Turn back also to Jeremiah and pay heed to what he has written of like import: “Flee out of the midst of Babylon, and deliver everyone his soul.” For “Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen and is become the habitation of devils and the hold of every foul spirit.” It is true that Rome has a holy church, trophies of apostles and martyrs, a true confession of Christ. The faith has been preached there by an apostle, heathenism has been trodden down, the name of Christ is daily exalted higher and higher. - "Letter 46.12"

The Lord’s command was given through Jeremiah: “Flee out of the midst of Babylon, and deliver every person his soul.” To the day of its death the nation never returned to Chaldea or regretted the fleshpots of Egypt or its strong-smelling meats. Accompanied by its virgin bands, it became a fellow citizen of the Savior; and now that it has ascended from its little Bethlehem to the heavenly realms it can say to the true Naomi: “Your people shall be my people and your God my God.” - "Letter 108.32"
