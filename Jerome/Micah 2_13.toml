Whoever has entered in must not remain in the state wherein he entered but must go forth into the pasture so that entering in should be the beginning, “going forth and finding pasture,” the perfecting of graces. The one who enters in is contained within the bounds of the world. The one who goes forth goes, as it were, beyond all created things and, counting as nothing all things seen, shall “find pasture” above the heavens, and shall feed upon the Word of God and say, “The Lord is my shepherd (and feeds me); I can lack nothing.” But this going forth can be only through Christ; as it follows, “and the Lord at the head of them.” .
