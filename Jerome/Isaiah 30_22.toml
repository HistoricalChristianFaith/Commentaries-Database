And your teacher will not fly away from you anymore, and your eyes will see your instructor, and your ears will hear the word behind you, saying: This is the way, walk in it, neither to the right nor to the left. LXX: And those who deceive you will never come near you again, for your eyes will see those who have deceived you, and your ears will hear the words behind you of those who deceive, saying: This is the way, let us walk in it, whether to the right or to the left. In this place there are many disagreements between the 70th edition and the Hebrew. Therefore, we will first discuss the edition of the Vulgate, and then we will follow the order of truth. When they understand and perceive with the eyes of their hearts the truth, and when they fully understand those who have deceived them before and discern the words of those who deceive from behind with educated ears, for they always hurry to deceive the blind part of the body, according to the psalm that we read: 'They shoot in the dark the upright in heart' (Ps. X, 2), they assume such authority for themselves that they do not want to examine the disciples with reason, whether they teach with their right hand or their left, that is, whether they teach good or evil, but they want to follow their predecessors. Then those who previously deceived will never again be able to approach them once they realize they have been understood. Moreover, the explanation according to Hebrew is both easy and true. For when the Lord gives those who believe a narrow path and a short distance, he will never allow that person who teaches knowledge to fly away from them; but they will always see their teacher with their eyes, and they will hear the word of the one who admonishes them from behind, saying: This is the right way, walk in it, neither to the right nor to the left, according to what is read elsewhere: We will not turn to the right or the left, we will walk on the royal road (Numbers 20:17). For whatever is excessive in either direction is a fault. And concerning the right side it is said: Be not too just (Eccl. 7:17). But there is no doubt that on the left side they should be placed among the goats and the perishable.
