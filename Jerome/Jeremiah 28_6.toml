Jeremiah wishes “May the Lord do” what the false prophet said falsely, for this is what “Amen” signifies, a word that the Lord often employed in the Gospel: “Amen, amen, I say to you.” He also has greater desire that prosperity is realized than that the truth is told. Another prophet testifies in this connection, saying, “O that I not be a man who has the Spirit and prefers to speak falsely!” Unlike Jeremiah, however, Jonah is saddened that he should tell a falsehood, in response to which the Lord proves that a false prophecy is better than the destruction of so great a multitude of people. Lest it seem that he was approving the prediction of the false prophet, he then speaks the truth by using an example from others, without utilizing harmful deception: “Yet, hear this word that I speak in your hearing and in that of all the people. The prophets who preceded me and you from the beginning also prophesied many things for the earth and for great kingdoms concerning war and disease and famine. The prophet who foretold peace, when it comes to pass, will be known as the prophet whom the Lord sent in truth.”
