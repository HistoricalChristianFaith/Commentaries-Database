(Vers. 19 seqq.) When the animals walked, the wheels walked alongside them. And when the animals were lifted up from the ground, the wheels were also lifted up. Wherever the spirit went, the wheels went there too, for the spirit of life was in the wheels. As the animals went, the wheels went, and as they stood, the wheels stood. And when the animals were lifted up from the ground, the wheels were lifted up as well, following them, for the spirit of life was in the wheels. Four animals followed the spirit, and the cloud that was in the spirit. And again, the wheels lifted themselves off the ground, not the animals, but the spirit followed, to show its own will: because the spirit of life was in the wheels. Three, however, are indicated both in the animals and in the wheels, when they stood, when they walked, when they were lifted up, which both the animals and the wheels did in common. For neither could animals that were standing walk on wheels, nor could animals walking on the ground lift themselves on wheels, but of those actions, one was rest, one was motion, and elevation. And secondly it is said, because the spirit of life was in the wheels: so that we should in no way consider the wheels as vessels, which we see in the carts of wagons and chariots, but as living beings, indeed above living beings. For the animal man does not perceive those things that are spirits. Therefore, these wheels, in which the spirit of life was, do all things in order and measure, and they have harmony with animals, following them, and through them, the Holy Spirit; indeed, having skipped the middle, they enjoy the fellowship of the Holy Spirit. All of which, according to the earlier understanding, a wise reader can fit into various interpretations.
