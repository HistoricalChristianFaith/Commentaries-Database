By calling the Ephesians “Gentiles in the flesh,” he shows that in the spirit they are not Gentiles, just as conversely the Jews are Gentiles in spirit and Israelites in the flesh. Therefore the Jews and Gentiles are subject to a fourfold division: Some are circumcised in spirit and flesh, as were Moses and Aaron.… Some have been circumcised neither in spirit nor in flesh, as were Nebuchadnezzar and Pharaoh.… A third group are circumcised only in the flesh.… Lastly come those of whom he now speaks, … believers such as today we see in the whole host of believing Gentiles around the world.
