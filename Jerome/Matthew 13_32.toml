I believe that the branches of the gospel tree that grew from the grain of mustard seed signify the different teachings whereon each one of the birds mentioned perches. Let us also take on the feathers of a dove so that, flying to the higher parts, we may dwell on the branches of this tree and make nests for ourselves from the different doctrines and, fleeing from earthly things, hasten to heavenly things.Many people read that the grain of mustard seed is the smallest of all seeds. They read what the disciples say in the Gospel: “Lord, increase our faith,” and the answer given to them by the Savior: “Truly, I say to you, if you have faith even like a mustard seed, you will say to this mountain, ‘Move from here to there,’ and it will move.” They wonder whether an apostle would ask for a small faith or they doubt the Lord concerning what he has to say about small faith. Yet Paul the apostle makes an even greater comparison than faith to a grain of mustard. In fact, what does he say? “If I have all faith so as to move mountains, yet do not have charity, I am nothing.”

(Verse 32) The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed, which a man took and sowed in his field. It is the smallest of all seeds, but when it has grown, it is greater than the herbs and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and nest in its branches. It should not be a burden to the reader if we present all the parables. For those things that are obscure should be explained more fully, lest they be more entangled by excessive brevity than expounded. The kingdom of heaven is the preaching of the Gospel, and the knowledge of the Scriptures which leads to life; and of which it is said to the Jews: The kingdom of God will be taken away from you, and given to a nation producing its fruits (Matthew 21:43). Therefore, the kingdom of heaven is like a grain of mustard seed, which a man took and sowed in his field. The man who sows in his field is understood by many as the Savior, who sows in the hearts of believers. By others, the man himself who sows in his field, that is, in himself and in his own heart. Who is this who sows, if not our understanding and our soul, who, receiving the grain of preaching, and nurturing the seed with the moisture of faith, causes it to sprout in the field of his own heart? The preaching of the Gospel is the least of all disciplines. Indeed, for the first doctrine has no faith in the truth, preaching man as God, God as dead, and the scandal of the cross. Compare such doctrine with the dogmas of philosophers and their books, the splendor of eloquence and the composition of speeches, and you will see how much smaller it is than the other seeds of the Gospel. But when it grows, it demonstrates nothing biting, nothing vivid, nothing vital, but all flabby and withered, and soft, it boils in vegetables, and in herbs, which quickly wither and fall. However, this preaching, which seemed small at first, when it is sown either in the soul of the believer or in the whole world, does not rise in vegetables, but grows into a tree: so that the birds of the sky (which we must understand as either the souls of believers or the strengths owned by God's service) come and dwell in its branches. The branches of the evangelical tree, which have grown from the mustard seed, are diverse in doctrines, on which each of the aforementioned birds rests. Let us also assume the wings of the dove (Ps. LIV), so that, flying towards higher things, we may be able to dwell in the branches of this tree, and make nests for ourselves of teachings, fleeing earthly things and hastening towards heavenly things. Many, reading the smallest seed of mustard, and what is said in the Gospel by the disciples: 'Lord, increase our faith' (Luke XVII, 6), and the Savior answers them: 'Amen I say to you, if you have faith like a grain of mustard seed, and you say to this mountain, move from this place, it will move,' they think the apostles are either seeking little faith or doubting the Lord about little faith; whereas the apostle Paul considers faith compared to a grain of mustard seed to be very great. For what does he say? If I have faith to move mountains, but do not have love, it profits me nothing (I Cor. XIII, 2). Therefore, what the Lord said about faith being able to move mountains, the Apostle teaches can be done with complete faith.
