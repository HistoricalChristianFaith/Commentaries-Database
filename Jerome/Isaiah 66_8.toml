Zion therefore gave birth, that is, the remnant of Israel and the faith of the believing apostles gave birth to the male Lord and Savior, who was generated at once throughout the entire universe. No one has either heard or told his story or taught it to anyone, so that all the nations might come to believe in a very short time and that there might be formed one Christian people from all the various peoples. This is what Paul was talking about when he said, “If any are in Christ, they are new creatures; the old has passed away and behold, they are made new,” as it is also written elsewhere, “All the families of the nations will worship before him.” … And this people was created in one day, whom the “sun of righteousness” illumined, as the Scripture says: “The Lord will be your everlasting light.” We can also correlate what is said here, “a people will arise as one because Zion bore and delivered her sons,” to that time when, on one day, three thousand and another five thousand of the Jewish people believed. Moreover, it is said in the same book of the Acts of the Apostles that there were persons in Jerusalem from all the nations under heaven, who heard one another speaking the glorious deeds of God, each in their own language. … But the meaning of the Septuagint’s text of this verse is that one people from the entire world shall arise in one moment to the preaching of the gospel. Or, in other words: I have repeatedly made this promise through many prophets, but you have not kept my promise in mind, O city full of crying, O temple vacated by the Lord, O people to whom I returned its own rejection. Is it not I who make fertile and make sterile? Did not she who was previously barren not later bear and deliver a child? Of this is it written in the Psalms: “He gives the barren woman a home and makes her a joyful mother of children.”
