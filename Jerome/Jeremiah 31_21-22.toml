(Vers. 21, 22.) Set up watchmen for yourself, make for yourself bitternesses: direct your heart to the straight path in which you have walked. Return, O virgin Israel, return to your cities. How long will you indulge in pleasures, wandering daughter? For the Lord has created something new on the earth: a woman will encompass a man. LXX: Set up watchmen for yourself, do penance, put your heart on your shoulders, the way in which you have walked. Return, O virgin Israel, return to your mourning cities. How long will you turn away, despised daughter? For the Lord has created you for salvation in a new plantation: men will surround you in your salvation. Where we say, how long will you dissolve in pleasures, Symmachus set forth, how long will you sink into the depths? But I have presented both editions in their entirety, so that I may show the most obscure passage, containing the sacraments of the Church, either unknown or omitted, from the Septuagint (or anyone else who has interpreted this prophet). The Hebrew word 'Sionim' can be translated as either 'watchers' or 'watchtowers', as Aquila and Symmachus have interpreted. I am puzzled by what the Vulgate edition intended by replacing 'Sionim' with 'Sion', which confuses the reader's understanding, making them think that after Ephraim, suddenly God's word happened to Sion and the tribe of Judah, even though the continuous speech is directed towards Ephraim, as mentioned earlier: 'I have surely heard Ephraim.' And: Son, honorable to me Ephraim, or delicate boy, to whom even now he speaks: Set up for yourself watchtowers, or spies, who may inform you of the coming of such great happiness in all things. And what follows, the bitternesses, which in Hebrew are called Themrurim (), for which Symmachus interpreted, the transformations, this indicates that he should weep either for past sins or for the greatness of joy, and with the whole mind turn to the Lord, and set, or direct, his heart on the path along which it has gone, for from there it will return. And what the Seventy said about this: 'Put your heart on your shoulders', signifies that thoughts should be joined to actions, or contemplate the shoulders of those who bear themselves, from the captivity of those bringing them back. This is more fully expressed by Isaiah in regard to camels, chariots, and dromedaries, stating that they are to be brought back (Isa. 60). 'Return,' he says, 'O virgin of Israel, return to your cities which you have deserted as a captive. How long will you be dissolved in neglect and wander in profound error?' Consider what I am about to say, and carefully consider where such great happiness is to be expected. Listen to what you have never known before. The Lord has created a new thing upon the earth. Without the seed of a man, without any sexual intercourse and conception, a woman will enclose a man in the chamber of her womb, who, as it were, by the cries of infancy and the progress of wisdom and age, will appear to grow in size; but the perfect man will be contained within the female womb for the usual months. Where Symmachus and Aquila have been interpreted according to our edition. However, what the Vulgate edition wanted to convey in this place, I could say, and find some meaning, if it were not sacrilegious to argue about the words of God with a human sense; but Theodotius, following the Vulgate edition itself, has interpreted: The Lord created a new salvation, in which salvation man will go around, using the singular instead of the plural. And at the same time, it should be noted that the nativity of the Savior and the conception of God are called creation.
