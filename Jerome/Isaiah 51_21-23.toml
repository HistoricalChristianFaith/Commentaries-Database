(Verse 21 and following) Therefore, listen to these things, poor and drunken one, not from wine. This is what your Lord and your God says, who fought for his people: Behold, I have taken from your hand the cup of slumber, the bottom of the cup of my indignation; you shall not add to drink it any further. And I will place it in the hand of those who humbled you, and they said to your soul: Bow down, that we may pass over, and you have made your body like the ground, and like a road to those passing by. LXX: Therefore listen, humiliated and drunk, not from wine. Thus says the Lord God who judges his people: Behold, I have taken from your hand the cup of ruin, the chalice of my fury; and you shall no longer drink from it. And I will deliver it into the hands of those who unjustly oppressed and humiliated you, who said to your soul, 'Bow down, that we may pass over,' and you have made your back like the ground and like a street for those who pass by. O Jerusalem, to whom I said, 'Lift up, lift up, arise, and repent,' for you have drunk from the hand of the Lord the cup of his fury; and you have drunk it to the dregs. And your sons, who were scattered throughout the whole world and led away captive, have lain prostrate in the streets and on the corners of the roads. Know that you are poor and humiliated, and drunk, not from wine, but from the fury of the Lord. Therefore, if you repent and rise lifted up, you will know the chalice of sleep and ruin: whether according to Symmachus and Theodotion, of tearing and shaking, to be taken from your hand: and that, which in this place Symmachus interpreted as a cup, you will no longer drink: but deliver it to your adversaries, who said to your soul, bow down, so that we may pass: and to those who said, you have bowed down by your own will. And you made your body like the earth, or back: or according to the Septuagint, your middle and your necks passing outside. Let this be said according to history, that if Jerusalem wants to lift itself and rise, it should not drink the cup of the Lord's fury, nor endure what it previously endured. But in order to understand it spiritually according to the Septuagint, it is said to mean a soul humbled by vices and intoxicated by disturbances, so that it may know that it has the Lord as its judge, and that it will render an account of everything. But if it were turned to better things, the cup of ruin would be taken away from his hands, and the bowl of the fury of the Lord, which contained punishments, about which Ezekiel also says to Jerusalem: You will drink the deep and wide cup of your sister Samaria, so that you may be drunk (Ezec. 23:32), should be given into the hands of those who humbled her. There is no doubt that it signifies opposing powers, which said to her souls: Bow down, so that we may pass by. In which it must also be noted that they did not bend it, nor did they force it, so that it would be inclined to the ground as before; but they left it to their own choice. However, it placed its neck or back, or its whole body, not inwardly, but outwardly, for those who trampled upon it. We also read something similar in the Gospel (Luke 13), because Satan had bent a woman for eighteen years, whom the Lord restored to her former state, so that she could say: I lift up my eyes to the mountains, from where will my help come? (Psalm 120:1); and: To you I lift up my eyes, you who are enthroned in the heavens (Psalm 123:1).
