(Chapter 5, Verse 1) Now you will be devastated, daughter of a robber: sieges have been placed upon us; they will strike the judge of Israel on the cheek with a rod. LXX: Now the daughter will be obstructed with an obstruction; distress has been placed upon us; they will strike the tribes of Israel on the cheek with a rod. Not that one tribe strikes the cheek of another, but that others strike the tribes of Israel on the cheek. Indeed, I have promised you, O daughter of Zion, that there will come a time when I will place an iron horn upon you, and your hooves will be made of bronze, and by the multitude of demons being shattered, you will offer whatever they had previously possessed to the Lord (Romans 11) of the entire earth. But because this will happen when the fullness of the Gentiles has come in and all Israel has been saved, now for the time being you are being laid waste, or as it is said in Hebrew, destroyed. For you are not called Circumcision according to the Apostle (Philippians 3), but rather cutting off: nor do I call you my daughter, but the daughter of a thief, which in Hebrew is called Bath Gedud (), that is, always ready to plunder for the devil. For you have made my house a den of thieves, you have fought against me, and your sons have laid siege against me, and against the Son, and against my Spirit. Is it not an insult to the Trinity, when by your hand the Romans struck the head of the judge of Israel with a rod and a reed, saying: Prophesy to us, O Christ, who is it that struck you (Matt. 26:60)? Or when one of your servants struck him on the cheek, saying: Is this how you answer the high priest (John 18:22)? According to the Hebrew, to which the interpretations of Aquila and Symmachus, and Theodotion, and the fifth edition agree. But according to the LXX, the meaning is much higher and is understood as if from its own beginning. Now the synagogue is obstructed by obstruction: and those who are closed in it will say: He has placed distress upon us; and subject to Roman authorities, they will be struck on the cheekbones by the three Israels. For the Lord has taken away from Judah and from Jerusalem the strong and mighty, and the wise architect, and the intelligent listener (or helper), and its ways are closed and blocked up even until today, and it cannot go out of captivity; but it is pressed down by the harshest rule (Isaiah 3:1-2). But if we want to understand the above sense as referring to the Church, let us bring forth the example from Hosea, in which the adulteress speaks: I will go after my lovers, who give me my bread, and my water, and my clothing, and my linen, my oil, and everything that is beneficial to me (Hosea 2:5). And afterwards, God, wanting to hinder her wicked thoughts, does not allow her to fulfill what she desires; but He obstructs her ways, so that she does not obtain her lovers, and no longer commits adultery. He says: Therefore, behold, I will block her ways with thorns, and I will wall her in, and she will not find her path, and she will pursue her lovers, but she will not catch them, and she will seek them, but she will not find them, and she will say: I will go and return to my former husband, for it was good for me there. (Ibidem, VI, sec. LXX). Notice how the work of the Lord has progressed: the adulteress, not finding her way, and unable to go where she wanted, is compelled by necessity to return to her former husband, and she confesses that it was better for her in the house of her former husband than it had been with her former lovers, and through the tribulations and plagues of Israel she is instructed. Therefore, God has placed tribulation upon the daughter of Israel, and the angels who are in charge of administering punishment will strike her on the cheek. Lest you should not know who the daughter is, who is obstructed by obstruction and is placed in distress, is immediately inferred and is said to be the threefold Israel. But we are the Israel, who perceive God with the mind, to distinguish whom the Apostle speaks: "See Israel according to the flesh" (I Cor. XIX, 18). For he would never call carnal Israel, unless he knew that there is also a spiritual one.
