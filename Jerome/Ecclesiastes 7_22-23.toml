"And do
not heed all words that are spoken, lest you hear your servant curse you. For often your own heart knows that you
likewise have cursed others. "Make sure to do only those things which have
been taught, and strengthened by the help of wisdom, prepare yourself for
either good or bad outcomes, and don't worry about what your enemies might say
about you, or what kind of reputation you have. 
For just as a cautious man should not hear his servant complain about
him, so he should not want to hear what is said about him in his absence, (for
if he did this he would always be troubled and incensed to anger by the
muttering of the servant). Therefore it
is befitting for a wise man to walk with wisdom following him, and not to dwell
upon unfounded rumours. But he teaches
by another example that the righteous man ought not to worry what men say,
saying, 'just as your conscience knows what you have said about others, and
that you have often maligned others, so you ought to pardon others when they
think badly of you.' At the same time he
teaches that it is difficult to judge for one who has a rod in his eye, not to
speak about the rod of another.
