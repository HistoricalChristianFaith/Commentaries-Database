We, however, who heard the Lord our Savior say that those in Judea should flee to the mountains also lift our own eyes to the mountains, concerning which it was written: “I raise my eyes to the mountains, whence comes my assistance.” And in another place [it is written], “Its foundation is in the holy mountains,” and “The Lord surrounds his people as the mountains surround them,” and “The city set upon a mountain cannot be hidden.” We must shed the skin of the letter and, ascending Mount Zion barefoot with Moses, say, “I will cross over and see this great vision.” [This is] so that we can understand those souls to be pregnant who conceived the beginning of faith from the seed of doctrine and from talking with God, who say with Isaiah, “Out of reverence for you, Lord, we have conceived and given birth, bringing the spirit of your salvation upon the earth.”

The souls of those believers are pregnant who are able to say at the beginning of faith: “From reverence for you, Lord, we have conceived and given birth.”
