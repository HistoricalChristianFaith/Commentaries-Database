(Verse 23) And when he got into the boat, his disciples followed him. And behold, there arose a great storm on the sea, so that the boat was being swamped by the waves. He performed the fifth sign when he got into a boat from Capernaum and commanded the winds and the sea. The sixth sign, when he gave power to the demons to enter into the pigs in the region of the Gerasenes. The seventh, when he entered his own city and healed a paralytic lying on a bed. Firstly, the paralytic is the son of a centurion.
