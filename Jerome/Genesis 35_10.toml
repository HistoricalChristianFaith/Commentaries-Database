(Verse 10) And God said to him, Your name shall no longer be called Jacob, but Israel shall be your name: and he called his name Israel. For a long time, his name was not given to him by an angel, but it was predicted that it would be given by God. Therefore, what is promised to happen there is taught to be fulfilled here.
