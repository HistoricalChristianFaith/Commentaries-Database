(Verse 7) And they returned and came to the well of judgment, which is Kadesh. It is said by anticipation that it was afterwards so called. But it signifies the place at Petra, which is called the well of judgment because there God judged the people. And they struck all the region of the Amalekites and the Amorites who dwelt in Hazazon-tamar. This town is what is now called Engedi, fertile with balsam and palm trees. Moreover, Hazazon-tamar, in our language, means the city of palm trees. Thamar, indeed, is said to mean 'palm'. However, it is worth noting that shortly after it says: 'And they set their battle line against them in the valley of Salt, which is called in Hebrew, the valley of Seddim (), which Aquila interprets as 'of the plains', and Theodotion as 'of the groves', signifying pleasant woods.'
