(Version 7) And I said to them: Let each one cast away the offenses of their eyes, and do not defile yourselves with the idols of Egypt: I am the Lord your God. LXX: And I said to them: Let each one cast away the abominations of their eyes, and do not be polluted with the inventions of Egypt: I am the Lord your God. Regarding the offenses, which are called 'Secuse' in Hebrew, Symmachus interpreted them as nausea, the second edition of Aquila as excisions, to signify that they should be cast away like the blemishes that hinder vision and create a sense of vomiting for those who see them. The word 'gelule' is also a Hebrew term, which the LXX invented. The first edition of Aquila was defiled; the second edition of Symmachus and Theodotion interpreted as idols, whom we also follow at present. However, he commands those who are leaving Egypt to forget the idols they have served for a long time, and indeed to cast them away from their eyes so that they do not even regard them with their sight. And those who have been defiled for a long time should no longer consent to them. I, he says, am the Lord your God; not the Egyptian portents, not the figments of various monsters. But even to us, when we come out of Egypt, it is commanded that we cast off the offenses of our eyes: lest we be delighted by those things with which we were previously delighted in the world, lest we be polluted by the idols of Egypt, namely, the inventions of philosophers and heretics, which are rightly called idols. Let us also remove our eyes from the spectacles, or rather offenses, of Egypt: the arenas, the circuses, the theaters, and all things that contaminate the purity of the soul and enter through the senses into the mind; and let what is written be fulfilled: Death has entered through your windows (Jeremiah 9:21).
