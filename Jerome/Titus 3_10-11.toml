Avoid a heretical man after one and a second admonition, knowing that such a one is subverted, and sins, being condemned by himself. The name of heresy is stated in the Epistle to the Corinthians: For there must be also heresies: that they also, which are approved, may be made manifest among you (1 Cor. 11:19). And among the works of the flesh, it is listed in the Epistle to the Galatians: Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these; Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness, Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies, Envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God. (Gal. 5:19-21). It should be carefully observed in these things, that just as the other vices, which are counted among the works of the flesh, exclude us ((Al. are excluded)) from the kingdom of God: so too heresies take away the kingdom of God from us; and it does not matter how someone is excluded from the kingdom. But what is even more remarkable seems to be that thing in the Acts of the Apostles, our faith in Christ, and Ecclesiastical discipline, already being labeled as heresy by perverse men at that time. For the Jews say to the Apostle Paul, "Neither have we received letters from you from Judea ((Al. from you... from Judea)), nor has anyone coming from the brethren reported or spoken any evil of you. But we ask to hear from you what your views are; for it is well known to us about this heresy, because everywhere it is contradicted (Acts 28:21,22)." And though the name of the heresy of Miletus is not mentioned, yet they are designated by the labours of Paul, in his address to the presbyters of the Church, 'I know that after my departure grievous wolves shall enter in among you, not sparing the flock; and of your own selves shall men arise speaking perverse things, to draw away disciples after them' (Acts 20:29-30). These remarks are made in passing, as it were, where elsewhere also heresy is spoken of. The name itself must now be fully examined. In Greek, heresy means an election, that is, everyone chooses for himself that which he thinks best. The philosophers, too, Stoics, Peripatetics, Academics, Epicureans, are called followers of this or that sect. It is needless to go through each one separately, and to enumerate the various dogmas of Marcion, Valentinus, Apelles, Ebion, Montanus, and Manichæus, seeing it is very easy for everyone to know what are the particular errors advocated by each individual. Arius and Eunomius, and the author of the new heresy, would that they were not so well known, perhaps they would have deceived fewer! Therefore, avoid a heretic after the first admonition, or as is better expressed in Greek, νουθεσία, which signifies warning or teaching rather than reproach; which is approved in Latin copies sometimes cited with approval by Pope Athanasius, to the effect that people who are wronged are not sufficient to be informed or warned once or twice, but that the second time they should be given instruction, and that every word should stay in the mouth of two or three witnesses. But why he should be avoided after the first and second admonitions, he gives the reasons, namely, that he is perverted and sins, being condemned by himself. For he who, having been corrected once or twice, does not wish to be corrected after hearing his mistake, is considered to be in error by the corrector: and on the contrary, when preparing for arguments and disputes with words, he wishes to make profit from the one from whom he learnt. Therefore, it is said to be condemned by oneself: because fornication, adultery, murder, and other vices are repelled by priests of the Church. But heretics bring judgment upon themselves, departing from the Church by their own choice: which departure seems to be a condemnation of their own conscience. They think that heresy differs from schism in that heresy has perverse doctrine, while schism separates from the Church due to episcopal dissension, which can be understood to some extent at the beginning. However, no schism does not invent some heresy for itself, so that it may appear to have departed from the Church correctly.
