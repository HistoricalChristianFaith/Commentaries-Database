Gethsemane is interpreted as the “very fertile valley” where the Lord ordered his disciples to sit down and wait for him to return while he prayed alone for everyone.

(Verse 36.) Then Jesus came with them to a village called Gethsemane and said to his disciples, 'Sit here while I go over there and pray.' Gethsemane means 'very fertile valley,' in which he ordered the disciples to sit for a little while and wait for the Lord to return, while he prayed for everyone alone.
