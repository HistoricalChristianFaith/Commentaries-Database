(Vers. 16-18.) But when evening came, they brought to him many who were demon-possessed; and he cast out the spirits with a word, and healed all who were sick. This was to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah: “He took up our infirmities and carried our diseases.” And seeing great crowds around him, Jesus gave orders to go to the other side. Everyone is healed not in the morning, not in the afternoon, but in the evening, when the sun is setting: when a grain of wheat dies in the ground in order to bring forth many fruits (John 12).
