(Verse 3, sequence) Because behold the Lord will go out from his place, and he will come down and tread upon the heights of the earth, and the mountains will be consumed beneath him, and the valleys will be split like wax before the fire, like waters flowing down a steep slope. Because of the wickedness of Jacob, all this, and because of the sins of the house of Israel. What wickedness of Jacob? Is it not Samaria? And what heights of Judah? Is it not Jerusalem? LXX: Behold, the Lord will go out from his place, and he will come down, and he will ascend upon the heights of the earth, and the mountains will tremble beneath him, and the valleys will wither like wax before the fire, and like water flowing down: because of the impiety of Jacob, all these things, and because of the sin of the house of Israel. What is the wickedness of the house of Jacob? Is it not Samaria? And what is the sin of the house of Judah? Is it not Jerusalem? O Samaria and Jerusalem, listen, and carefully heed the Lord testifying against you from His temple, and proclaiming whatever He will do. Behold, the Lord will come out from His place. For He who is humble and kind, and whose nature is mercy, is forced for your sake to assume a role of cruelty that He does not possess. And he shall come down and tread upon the high places of the earth. The descent of God is, and his majesty runs down to lower things, to tread upon the earth, and to crush even the powerful. And they shall be consumed, he says, whether the mountains waste away, and the valleys beneath him, whom we understand to be the leaders and the people. And just as nearby fire does not sustain wax, and flowing water is carried headlong: so shall the pride of all the wicked, when the Lord comes, be dissolved and flow away. But all this will happen because of the sins of the ten tribes, which Jacob and Israel called, and because of the transgression of Judah; for in the ten tribes Samaria was the metropolis, and in the kingdom of Judah Jerusalem, idolatry was practiced: this is according to the literal sense. However, the Lord will come out from his place, whom we can understand as either the Son or all the saints. For the Son himself says: I am in the Father, and the Father in me (John 14:10). And of the saints: I will dwell and walk among them, and I will be their God, and they shall be my people (Leviticus 26:12). Therefore, concerning these things, it goes forth, not that He may abandon them; for even concerning the apostles, the word of the Lord went forth to those who heard, and yet He did not abandon them. And such places, that is, those that deserve to have God as a guest, have been raised up, as if resurrected with Christ, and seated with Him in heavenly places. And it is said that he descends to those who cannot hear his teaching on the mountain. And when he descends, he will not ascend to the lowly and those who are in a low position; but those who are called high and who understand the majesty of the coming of the Lord, they will be moved. And although there are mountains, they will still fear the presence of such a charioteer and ascender. But the valleys, that is, souls inserted into earthly bodies, and not rising with the celestial man, will not be able to bear his presence; but whatever is hard in them will be dissolved, and thus flow, just as if flat waters are carried swiftly into the depths. Therefore, the terrible Lord will come to teach, that is, to move mountains, and to dissolve the low things of valleys, because Jacob has committed impiety, and Israel has sinned. The impiety of Jacob is indeed the meeting places of heretics, which are called Samaria. And the sin of Judah, that is, of him who confesses the Lord, is none other than Jerusalem, in which many crimes are found. And as for the fact that the house of Judah refers to Christ, whose Church it is, and as we have often said, let us also consider this for the present: Judah, your brothers will praise you; your hand will be on the neck of your enemies. (Genesis 49:8). It can also be understood in this way, that because of the impieties of Samaria and the crimes of Judah, the Lord went out from his former place, and said to the Jews (Matt. 23:38): Behold, your house will be left desolate for you (Luke 13:35). And he will come down from heaven, and ascend above the heights of the earth, that is, above those who, believing in the humility of the Gentiles, have deserved to be exalted. And the mountains, the doctrines of the philosophers, and the lofty kingdoms were moved, and those who remained humble were consumed and broken by the coming of the Savior and the growing Church, and by the idols falling into the depths when the mountains rose up high. Therefore the Lord has left his place, and the Church has been built among the nations, so that the mountains would tremble under his feet, and the deep valleys would be dissolved, because Jacob acted wickedly, and Israel sinned, and all the tribes denied the Lord.
