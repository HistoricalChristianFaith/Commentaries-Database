(Chapter 48, verses 1 onwards) And these are the names of the tribes: starting from the northern borders, near the path of Ethalon that goes to Emath, Atrium, Enon, the boundary of Damascus to the north of Emath, and it will have the eastern boundary, the sea. Dan is one tribe. And from the boundary of Dan to the eastern boundary, Asher is one tribe. And beyond the boundary of Asher to the eastern boundary, Nephthali is one tribe. And beyond the boundary of Nephthali to the eastern boundary, Manasseh is one tribe. And over the territory of Manasseh from the eastern border to the sea, Ephraim one. And over the territory of Ephraim from the eastern border to the sea, Reuben one. And over the territory of Reuben from the eastern border to the sea, Judah one. The description of the possession of the Holy Land is given, both according to the present prophecy of Ezekiel and according to the book of Numbers: now the possession of each tribe is described from the eastern border to the western border, that is, the sea. And first, the borders are taken from the north along the route of Ethalon to those going towards Emath, the courtyard or Aser-Enon bordering Damascus to the north near Emath, of which we have already spoken. And so it begins, the first portion goes to the tribe of Dan, the second to Aser, the third to Nephthali, the fourth to Manasseh, the fifth to Ephraim, the sixth to Ruben, the seventh to Judah, which is on the left side, completing the number seven. Then the firstfruits of the priests and the Levites, and the sanctuary of the Lord in the midst, and the holy of holies. The city itself is described on each side in a square, having four thousand and five hundred rods. The suburban areas of the priests and the Levites are also described in order, along with the possession of the prince. And again, on the right side, five tribes succeed from the region similarly to the East, all the way to the region of the West, of which the first is Benjamin; the second is Simeon, having its own possession specifically, and not mixed with Judah as before; the third is Issachar; the fourth is Zebulun; the fifth is Gad; and there are three gates of the city on each side; and the name of this city is contained on the golden plate on the forehead of the high priest. We will discuss all of these in their proper places. And it should be noted that the names of forty-eight cities which are given in the book of Numbers to the Levites for dwelling with their suburbs are omitted here, as well as the cities of refuge: of which three are on the other side of the Jordan, namely Bosor, and Ramoth, and Gaulon, which are given to two and a half tribes; and three are within the Jordan, namely Kadesh, and Sichem, and Kiriatharba. For there was no need in this mystical description and the dwelling of the saints and the perfect conversation to describe the supports of the fugitives, which Israel still needed while in the land and hastening to come to this city through many labors and dangers, and speaking in each of the saints: I am a stranger and a sojourner like all my fathers (Ps. XXXVIII, 13). And in a foreign land: I lived with the inhabitants of Cedar, my soul has traveled far.
