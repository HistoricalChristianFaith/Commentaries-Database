(Verse 37, 38.) Indeed, the harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few. Therefore, pray to the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into his harvest. The abundant harvest signifies the multitude of people, while the few laborers represent a shortage of workers. And it is commanded to pray to the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into his harvest. These are the laborers whom the Psalmist speaks of, saying: Those who sow in tears will reap with joy. Going forth, they went and wept, carrying their seeds. But when they come, they will come with joy, carrying their sheaves (Psalm 126:7-8). And to speak more plainly, the abundant harvest is the entire crowd of believers. However, the workers are few, like the apostles and those who imitate them and are sent to the harvest.
