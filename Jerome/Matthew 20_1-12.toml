Chapter 20, Verse 1 onwards: The kingdom of heaven is like a landowner who went out early in the morning to hire workers for his vineyard. After agreeing to pay them the usual daily wage, he sent them into his vineyard. Going out again at about the third hour, he saw others standing idle in the marketplace and said to them, 'You also go into the vineyard, and I will give you whatever is right.' So they went. Again he went out about the sixth and ninth hour and did the same. At about the eleventh hour, he went out and found others standing around, and he said to them, 'Why are you standing here idle all day?' They said to him, 'Because no one has hired us.' He said to them, 'You also go into the vineyard.' When evening came, the owner of the vineyard said to his foreman, 'Call the workers and pay them their wages, beginning with the last ones hired and going on to the first.' So when those hired at about the eleventh hour came, each one received a denarius. But when the first came, they thought that they would receive more; and they themselves also received each a denarius. And receiving it, they murmured against the householder, saying: These last have worked one hour, and you have made them equal to us, who have borne the burden of the day and the heat? But answering one of them, he said: This parable or similitude of the kingdom of heaven is understood from the things that have been set forth. For it is written before it: Many will be first who will be last, and the last first. Not deferring to time but to faith. And he said that the householder went out early in the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard and agreed to pay them a denarius for their work. Then he went out again around the third hour and saw others standing idle in the marketplace, and he promised to pay them what is just, not a denarius. He also did the same at the sixth hour and the ninth hour. And the eleventh hour workers also found others standing idle all day long, and sent them into the vineyard. And when it was evening, the owner of the vineyard instructed his steward to begin paying the workers, starting with the last ones hired and ending with the first ones hired; and all were equally incited against the last ones, accusing the father of the household of unfairness. Not because they received less than what was agreed upon, but because they wanted to receive more than those upon whom the steward had shown his mercy. It seems to me that the first hour belongs to the workers Samuel, Jeremiah, and John the Baptist, who can say with the Psalmist: 'You are my God from my mother's womb' (Psalm 22:11). The third hour belongs to those who began to serve God from their youth. The sixth hour belongs to those who took up the yoke of Christ in mature age. The ninth hour belongs to those who are already declining towards old age. And the eleventh hour belongs to those in their final old age. Yet all receive the same reward, although the labor is different. There are those who explain this parable in a different way. The first hour is said to represent the time from Adam and the other patriarchs to Noah; the third, from Noah to Abraham and the giving of circumcision to him; the sixth, from Abraham to Moses, when the Law was given; the ninth, from Moses to the prophets; the eleventh, from the apostles to the Gentile people, whom everyone envies. Therefore, understanding this itself after the eleventh hour, when it was near the setting of the sun and towards evening, John the Evangelist speaks: My little children, it is the last hour (1 John 2:13). And at the same time, consider that the injustice of the head of the household, which everyone equally accuses the eleventh hour workers of, they do not understand in themselves. For if the head of the household is unjust, he is not unjust in one, but in all: because the worker who was sent to the vineyard in the third hour did not work as much as the one who was sent in the first hour. Similarly, the worker who was sent in the sixth hour worked less than the one in the third hour; and the worker in the ninth hour worked less than the one in the sixth hour. Therefore, every backward calling is envied by the peoples, and is twisted in the grace of the Gospel. Hence, the Savior concludes the parable, saying: The first will be last, and the last first. Thus, the Jews are turned from head to tail, and we are changed from tail to head.
