(Chapter XL - Verses 1 onwards) 'In the twenty-fifth year of our exile (or captivity), at the beginning of the year (or in the first month), on the tenth day of the month, fourteen years after the city was struck down (or captured): on that very day, the hand of the Lord was upon me, and He brought me there. In visions (or in a vision) of God, He brought me to the land of Israel, and set me down on a very high mountain, on which was like a city-building, facing southward (or from the south).' And he brought me there: and behold a man, whose appearance was like the appearance of brass (or shining brass); and a line of flax (or masons' line) was in his hand, and a measuring reed in his hand. And he stood in the gate: and he said to me, Son of man, see with your eyes, and hear with your ears, and set your heart upon all that I shall show you (or set in your heart all that I shall show you): for you have been brought (or entered) here for this purpose, and declare (or show) to the house of Israel all that you see. If, in the fifth year of captivity or exile of King Joachin, in the fourth month, in the fifth day of the month, the heavens were opened to the prophet Ezekiel by the river Chebar, and he saw visions of God; and now it is said that in the twenty-fifth year of the same captivity or exile of Jehoiachin, at the beginning of the year, in the tenth month, the hand of the Lord came upon him, and he was brought to the land of Israel and placed on a very high mountain, where he could see the city under construction, facing south; then there is no doubt that his entire prophecy was composed over a period of nineteen years, nine months, and five days of the twentieth year. But if, according to Theodotion, who interpreted in that place where we have placed [it], at the beginning of the year, it is understood that on the new year, the tenth month (however, the new year is called the seventh month among the Hebrews, which has the name Tishri, that is, on the Kalends of the seventh month, there is the sound of trumpets, and on the tenth day of the same month, there is the day of fasting and atonement; but on the fifteenth day, when the whole circle of the moon is completed, there are the days of the booths), it is understood that on the tenth day of the Day of Atonement, the building of the city as shown to Ezekiel, the prophet. And just as he demonstrated the restoration of the people, or rather the revival in the bones of the valley under the image of the resurrection, so now the Lord promises the restoration of the city that was destroyed by the Babylonians fourteen years ago, under its description, just as the type of captivity and destruction that he had shown through the boiling pot from the face of the North, and the truth of the prophecy was confirmed by the work, so the truth of the future edification would be proven by the faith in past events and the prediction. Nor is this said of that time, as some ignorant Jews want, when under Zerubbabel and under Jesus, son of Josedech, the high priest, the temple was built, with the prophets Haggai and Zechariah prophesying. For this temple that is now described, and the order of the priesthood, and the division of the land and fertility, is much more magnificent than what Solomon built. But the temple that was built under Zerubbabel was so small, and compared to the previous one was nothing: those who had seen the previous temple, and then saw this one, would wail and testify their sorrow with tears, and the clamor of the mourners would be much louder than the sound of trumpets. Read the book of Ezra. Furthermore, what is added, in the fourteenth year after the city was struck (or captured), according to mystical understanding, it signifies fourteen generations: which completed from David to the birth of Christ, the restoration of the city is promised by him, about whom it is written: He will build my city and bring back the captivity of my people. And again: He came to proclaim release to the captives and sight to the blind, saying to those who were in chains, come out, and to those who were in darkness, be revealed. But the hand of the Lord came upon him, so that Israel in the flesh, who was situated in Babylon, would come to the land in spirit. And he would not be placed on a high mountain in a vision, but in the visions of God, on an exceedingly high mountain, about which Isaiah and Micah prophesied: Come, let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the house of the God of Jacob (Isa. II, 3; Mic. IV, 2). For it is exceedingly high, in comparison to the other mountains, about which the prophet testifies, saying: I lift up my eyes to the mountains, from where will my help come? (Ps. CXX, 1). And in another place: Mountains are around it, and the Lord is around His people (Ps. CXXIV, 2). Concerning this it is also said by Isaiah: Ascend to a high mountain, you who bring good news to Zion (Isa. XL, 9). On this mountain, the city's building is shown, according to the Septuagint and Aquila, from the region, and opposite the north, from where the prophet came to the land of Israel; but according to Theodotion and Symmachus, it faces south, where there is full light, and the sun of righteousness is positioned at the highest point of the sky. And in the Song of Songs it says: Rise up, O north wind, and come, O south wind, blow upon my garden, that its spices may flow out. (Song 4:16) For the harsh north wind is driven away by the breath of the Lord, lest the warmth of love grow cold and the flowers wither. But when it is said, 'Like the structure of a city, not truly a city, but a likeness of a city is shown,' it refers to the city about which it is written: Glorious things are said of you, O city of God. (Psalm 87:2) This is Jerusalem, built as a city, whose unity itself is in that very city, and in it the great Lord is greatly praised, in the city of our God, on his holy mountain. (Psalm 48). And in the towers of this city, God is known when he will receive it. As it is said elsewhere: The streams of the river gladden the city of God (Ps. 46:4). And: A city set on a hill cannot be hidden (Matt. 5:14), as spoken in Isaiah: I am a solid city, a city under attack (Isa. 23). It did not say that it is conquered, but under attack: it is built on a rock and is not shaken by any storm. It follows: And he led me there, as it is understood, by the hand of God. There, however, that is, to the building of the city, so that he might show me all the things that were inside. And behold, he says, a man, whose appearance or vision was like a shining bronze, specifically the one of whom it is written: Behold a man, the Rising Sun is his name (Zach. VI, 12). But he did not have the appearance of amber, as is said at the beginning of this volume, nor was he girded with a golden belt, as is stated in the Book of Revelation (Apoc. I): but he had the appearance of bronze, according to the Hebrew. For this material is more resonant than all metals and resounds with a far-reaching sound. Hence, in the Book of Daniel, the kingdom of Alexander and the Greeks is symbolized by an image made of gold, silver, bronze, and iron (Daniel. II); in order to represent the eloquence of the Greek language: through which it is clear that they still need teaching, who have not yet fully understood the mysteries of spiritually building the temple. There was also a line made of twine in his hand, as it is written in Zechariah (Zech. II), that he had a measuring line to measure the width and length of the city. And the workers of masonry, either the angels who served under God's command, or Moses, and all the prophets and apostles who build the city of God, and are helpers or ministers of the Lord's will. Hence, the Apostle Paul also said: We are God's field, God's building (1 Cor. III, 9). And what follows: And the pen of measurement in his hand signifies prophetic grace, of which it is written in the forty-fourth psalm: My tongue is the pen of a swift scribe (Psalm 44:2). And concerning John the prophet and the baptist: What did you go out to the desert to see? A reed shaken by the wind (Matthew 11:7). Those who desire to imitate this reed, are those who write iniquity, and to whom the prophet curses: Rebuke the beasts of the reed (Psalm 68:31). But he was standing at the gate; for through him we enter the Father, and without him we cannot enter the city of God, so that it may receive the worthy and cast out the unworthy. There is also judgment at the gate. Hence the prophet says: They hate those who correct at the gate (Isa. 29:21). And in another place: He will not be put to shame when he speaks with his enemies at the gate (Ps. 127:5). This man spoke to the prophet, in whose hand was a cord, and whose appearance was like bronze, and he held a reed in his hand. He spoke to Ezekiel, a true architect, whom Paul the apostle imitated, saying: Like a wise architect, I have laid the foundation (I Cor. III, 10). But he calls the wise architect, to distinguish him from the foolish one, and he is called an unworthy shepherd in Zechariah; but he spoke the following: Son of man, see with your eyes, and hear with your ears (Zech. XI): not with the eyes of the flesh, but with the spirit; not with the ears of the body, but with the soul. Lift up, he says, your eyes, and see that the fields are already white for harvest (John 4:35). And: He who has ears to hear, let him hear (Luke 8:8). The construction of the city is visible, and the order of the ceremonies and priests, and the description of the land can be heard. But it is not enough to command to see with the eyes and hear with the ears; but he added: And place your heart in all things; or, place in your heart all that I will show you. For nothing is of benefit to have seen and heard, unless you place those things that you have seen and heard in the treasure of memory. When, however, he says, 'all things that I will show you', he makes the listener attentive, and he prepares the eyes of the heart, so that he may hold in his memory those things that are to be shown to him, for you have been brought here so that all things may be shown to you. With this, he shows specifically that nothing is sweeter than theory and knowledge, which the prophet desires, saying: 'One thing I have asked of the Lord, this I will seek after, that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life.' In order to see the delight of the Lord, and to visit His temple (Psalm 26:4, 5). Hence he joins and speaks: Lord, I have loved the beauty of your house and the dwelling place of your glory. Proclaim, he says, all that you see to the house of Israel, so that those who cannot see for themselves may learn through you what is shown to you by the Lord. But to the house of Israel are those who contemplate God with their mind, such as Nathanael, who earnestly sought Christ, and deserved to hear: Behold, a true Israelite, in whom there is no deceit (John 1:47).
