I see two attributes that, by coming together, are made one. Justice and peace have kissed. All this becomes one in the mystery of the Lord Savior, the Son of man and of God who is our truth, kindness, peace, justice, in whom the justice of the first people and the mercy of the second people are joined together into one peace. The apostle says, in fact, “He himself is our peace, he it is who has made both one.” This is the mystery for which the church longs and cries out in the Song of Solomon: “Let him kiss me with the kiss of his mouth.” This is the kiss of which Paul the apostle says, “Greet one another with a holy kiss.”
