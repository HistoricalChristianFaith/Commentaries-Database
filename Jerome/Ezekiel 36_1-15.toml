(Chapter XXXVI. â€” Verses 1 and following) \"But you, son of man, prophesy over the mountains of Israel and say, 'Mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord: Thus says the Lord God, because the enemy has said of you, 'Aha! The ancient heights have become our possession,' therefore prophesy, and say, 'Thus says the Lord God: Because you have been desolate and crushed on all sides (or because you have been scattered from those around you), and have become a possession (or inheritance) for the rest of the nations, and you have risen up on the lips of the tongue, and have become a reproach to the people (or nations).'\ Therefore, O mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord God: Thus says the Lord God to the mountains and hills, to the rivers, valleys, and desolate walls (or scattered), and to the deserted and depopulated cities that have been mocked (or trampled) by (Al. and) the rest of the nations all around. Therefore, thus says the Lord God: Because I have spoken in the fire of my zeal against the rest of the nations and against all Edom, who (Vulg. who) have given my land to themselves as an inheritance with joy (Al. with the sword), and with the whole heart, and with all their soul, and have expelled it to ravage (or with hatred despising souls, to overthrow them in devastation). Therefore he says (( Vulg. he is silent, says)), prophesy over the land of Israel, and you shall say to the mountains and hills, the ridges and valleys, thus says the Lord God: Behold, I in my zeal, and in my fury, have spoken, because you have endured the confusion (or reproaches) of the nations. Therefore thus says the Lord God (or Adonai the Lord): I have raised (or will raise) my hand, that the nations which are around you, they themselves shall bear their confusion (or disgrace). But you, O mountains of Israel, shall shoot forth your branches and yield your fruit to my people Israel, for they are about to come. For behold, I am for you, and I will turn to you, and you shall be tilled and sown. And I will multiply people on you, the whole house of Israel, all of it. The cities shall be inhabited and the waste places rebuilt. And I will fill you with people and animals, and they shall multiply and be fruitful. And I will cause you to be inhabited as in your former times, and will do more good to you than ever before. Then you will know that I am the Lord. And I will bring forth (or generate) upon you, my people Israel, and they will possess you (or you), and you will be (or you will be) for an inheritance, and you will no longer be added, so that you may be without them (or and you will no longer add, so that they may make you childless). Thus says the Lord God: Because they have said of you (or to you), you are a devourer of men, and a choker of your nation: therefore you will no longer eat men, and you will no longer kill your nation, says the Lord God: nor will I cause the confusion (or shame) of nations to be heard in you (or in you) any longer, and you will not bear the reproach of peoples (or you will not bear), and you will no longer lose your nation (or your nation will no longer be without children), says the Lord God. Above is the description of the prophet's appearance, or rather his turning towards the mountain of Seir. Here the son of man speaks to the mountains, or rather to the mountains of Israel, who are commanded to hear the word of God. And to briefly delay the allegory, the overall meaning of the prophecies concerning the mountains of Israel is this: Because the enemy, that is, the mountain of Seir, has insulted you and believed that he would possess you forever, and the once high places of the Lord are now deserted and have passed into his inheritance, and not only did he say this, but he also possessed you for a considerable time, to the extent that he spoke arrogantly against you, which brought reproach upon you from all nations. Therefore, thus says the Lord God, not only to the mountain of Seir, but also to its mountains and hills, streams, valleys, deserts, and ruins, and to the abandoned cities: because he has spoken with the fire of his zeal, not only against all the nations, but especially against Edom, which, he says, has held my land in possession along with the other nations, and has possessed it with the sword, and has possessed it with all their heart, in order to drive out its inhabitants and lay waste to the land. Therefore, speak, says the prophet, concerning the land of Israel, and say to the mountains, and hills, and hills (which the Seventy interpreted as 'valleys,' which we understand as wooded areas) and valleys. Thus says the Lord God: in my zeal and fury, I will be the avenger of your reproach, and I will raise my hand, so that the nations that are around you may bear their disgrace and confusion: but you, O mountains of Israel, will bear fruit according to your former state, and produce shoots and, according to the Seventy, bring forth grapes, with which my people Israel will be satisfied. That which you may not think will happen after a long time is near, imminent, and will come. And lest this seem difficult to you, I myself will come to you, and those who had departed from you will return to you, so that you may regain your former culture and all things may be fulfilled, so that there may be many people among you, and cities, which were previously destroyed, may be inhabited. And not only will I multiply people, but also animals will multiply and increase, and I will make you dwell as in the beginning, when Moses, leading the two and a half tribes across the Jordan (Numbers 32), and under Joshua, son of Nun, the other nine and a half tribes possessed the land of Judah (Joshua 1 and 13): and I will give you much greater possessions than you had in the beginning before you experienced various captivities. And when I have done this to you, then you will know that I am the Lord. And you, O land of Israel, will be full and abundant, a possession for my people, who will inherit you. You will no longer be without children. But when your inhabitants multiply, O mountains of Israel, then your enemies will no longer accuse you of devouring men and of being a land without children. Instead, you will multiply and your descendants will be numerous. You will neither hear, he said, any longer, nor will you endure the confusion of the nations, nor will you lose your people, so that you may eventually endure captivity, because the Lord has spoken. We will say these things loosely in the Jewish manner, which they expect in the thousand-year kingdom, when they assert that the city of Jerusalem is to be rebuilt, and the temple, which is described at the end of this volume, and the happiness of all things, some of which they believe were fulfilled under Zerubbabel. But how can this be fulfilled, what is said: 'And I will make you dwell as in the beginning, and I will give you greater blessings than you had in the beginning?' For under Zerubbabel, Ezra, and Nehemiah, only a few of the people were brought back, and they themselves were obedient to the Medes and Persians, and subsequently served the Macedonians, Egyptians, and Romans, and even to this day they serve various kings of different nations, such as Titus and Vespasian. Therefore, this prophecy at the end cannot possibly be fulfilled: 'And you will no longer bear the reproach of the nations, and you will not lose your people anymore.' And because it is now lengthy against the Jewish doctrine, and the blessedness serving the stomach and throat of the Jews, who desire all earthly things, and say: Let us eat and drink, of which the Apostle also speaks: Food for the stomach and the stomach for food: but God will destroy both it and them (I Cor. VI, 13), let us now briefly explain: let us now pass on to spiritual understanding, according to which we have also interpreted the extreme parts of Isaiah. For we do not expect Jerusalem to be adorned and golden from heaven, according to the Jewish fables which they call 'second books', nor will we suffer the injury of circumcision, nor will we offer sacrifices of bulls and rams, nor will we sleep in the idleness of the Sabbath. Many of our people, especially in Tertullian's book titled 'On the Hope of the Faithful', and in Lactantius' seventh volume of 'Institutions', and in the frequent explanations of Bishop Victorinus of Pettau, and recently in our own Severus' dialogue called 'The Rooster', have also said this. And that I may mention the Greeks, and unite the first and the last, Irenaeus and Apollinarius. Therefore, we will say that the mountains of Israel are the prophets and apostles, who hear the word of God, and to whom the enemy devil insulted, saying: 'Well done, once lofty mountains, about which it is written: The mountains are round about it, and the Lord is round about His people' (Ps. 124:2), have been given to me as a possession, when they were desolated by the narrowness of persecution, and trodden down round about, and have become an inheritance to the rest of the nations, and have been blasphemed by all. Therefore the Lord speaks, having trampled upon the mountains and desolated them, not only the mountains but also the lower parts and through every step on the land of Judea, that is, on the mountain of the Church which is written: A city set on a mountain cannot be hidden (Matthew 5:14); and on the hills and torrents, whose faith is increased in the winter of persecutions and in the storm of trials. Also on these valleys, which have been brought low by humility, and on the deserted Churches and walls, and on the whole world, on the gatherings of Churches that have been abandoned, such as the persecution that took place throughout the world under Diocletian and Maximian, by which Churches were proscribed and devastated: when all the nations of the Gentiles and the heretical nations mocked the Church, because it spoke in the fire of its zeal and especially against Edom, which wanted to carry the image of the earthly, having cast aside the image of the heavenly (1 Corinthians 15). For they indeed have taken the land of God as their inheritance, and with their whole heart and soul they have persecuted the Church of the Lord, and they have cast it out from its seats, and have laid it waste. But what has it profited the nations, what has it benefited the heretical peoples to insult the land of the Lord: when the Lord speaks to it, and to its hills, and mountains, and wooded places, which were flourishing with the beauty of paradise: and to the hills of which we have spoken above, he has spoken in his zeal and fury: and he lifts his hand against the adversaries, who have persecuted the Church, to bring about their confusion and disgrace? Then, with the persecutors killed and peace restored to the Church, the mountains of Israel, namely the Apostles and Apostolic men, will bring forth their trees and extend their branches, and they will produce grapes to be trodden in the winepress of the Lord, from which new wine is poured, which will intoxicate the peoples of the believers, and the wine that brings joy to the heart of man will be pressed out (Psalm 103): so that all the fruits of the mountains, from which the bread that comes down from heaven is made, may be eaten by the people of the God of Israel. And let us not despair in persecutions, it is added: The time is near for it to come. For he will come, coming indeed, and will not delay (Hab. 2:3). From there he promises his coming to the mountains, and to those who have endured in tribulations, and he promises that after the heat of persecution the earth, previously gleaned by the ploughshare of Christ, will be cultivated, and will receive every seed of virtue, from which men will be born and multiplied, and all the house of Israel. And when the cities, that is, the churches of the believers, were inhabited again by returning crowds, not only the men who were knowledgeable in the Scriptures will be there, but also the animals, and the simple believers will multiply and grow, and the churches will be inhabited as in the beginning, that is, before the persecution arose, and they will flourish with greater blessings than they had from the beginning, crowned by the victories of the martyrs. And then they will know that He is the Lord, who restores His people to their former state, which possesses the Churches, and that the Churches themselves are the inheritance of the Churches, and no longer without children, whom He had lost in persecution. Hence the prophet is commanded to speak to the land of the gentle, the land of the living, or to the mountains of Israel, and to say: You shall no longer suffer the reproach of persecutors, nor will they insult your slaughtered people, like sheep for slaughter. With peace being restored, all reproaches will cease, and you will no longer endure confusion and disgrace among various wanderings, but you will have your nation and your people, for the truth of the promise, spoken by the Lord, has been confirmed.
