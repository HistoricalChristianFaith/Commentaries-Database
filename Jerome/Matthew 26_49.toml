(Verse 49.) And immediately coming to Jesus, he said, Hail, Rabbi! And he kissed him. Shameless indeed and wickedly confident, to call the master and to throw a kiss to the one he was handing over. Nevertheless, the disciple still has something of discretion, as he does not openly hand him over to the persecutors, but through the sign of a kiss. This is the sign that God placed on Cain, so that whoever found him would not kill him (Genesis 4).
