(Verse 27) May God enlarge Japheth, and may he dwell in the tents of Shem. From Shem come the Hebrews, and from Japheth, the people of the nations are born. Therefore, because the multitude of believers has been enlarged from the breadth, which is called Japheth, it has received the name "breadth". But what he says, "And may he dwell in the tents of Shem," is prophesying about us, who are engaged in the teaching and knowledge of the Scriptures, with Israel being cast out.
