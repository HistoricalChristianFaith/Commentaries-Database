(Ver. 8, 9.) But when the disciples saw this, they were indignant and said, “Why this waste? This could have been sold at a high price and the money given to the poor.” I know that some criticize this passage, questioning why only one evangelist, Judas, is mentioned as being upset, when it is said that all the apostles were indignant. They do not understand the figure of speech known as synecdoche, by which one person can be used to represent all, or one can be used to represent many. For even Paul, in his Epistle to the Hebrews (although many Latin writers doubt it), when he described the sufferings and merits of the saints, introduced the following: They were stoned, they were tested, they were sawn in two, they were killed by the sword (Heb. 11:37), since the Jews only admit that Isaiah the Prophet was sawn. We can also say that the apostles were truly indignant because of the poor: but Judas because of his gains. And his muttering is also attributed to the crime that he did not have care for the poor, but wanted to provide for his own theft.
