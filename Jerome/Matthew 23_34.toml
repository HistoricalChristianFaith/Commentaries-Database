(Verse 34.) Therefore, behold, I send to you prophets and wise men and scribes. Some of them you will kill and crucify, and some of them you will flog in your synagogues and persecute from town to town. And so upon you may come all the righteous blood shed on earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, whom you murdered between the sanctuary and the altar. Truly, I say to you, all these things will come upon this generation. At the same time, observe the Apostle writing to the Corinthians (1 Cor. VII), that there are various gifts of the disciples of Christ; some are prophets, who preach the coming things; some are wise, who know when they should speak; some are scribes, most learned in the Law, from whom Stephen was stoned, Paul was killed, Peter was crucified, the disciples were whipped in the Acts of the Apostles: and they were persecuted from city to city; driven out of Judea, so that they might migrate to the Gentile people.
