(Verse 46.) And Jacob said to his brethren, 'Gather stones.' And they gathered stones and made a heap, and they ate there upon the heap. And Laban called it Jegar-sahadutha, but Jacob called it Galeed. The heap is called Galeed in the Hebrew language and Jegar-sahadutha in the Syriac language, both meaning 'witness heap'. Jacob called the heap 'Galeed' in Hebrew, and Laban called it 'Jegar-sahadutha' in the language of his people. For he was a Syrian, and had changed the ancient language of his parents to the language of the province in which he dwelt.
