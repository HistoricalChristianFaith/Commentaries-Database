“Chariots and steeds lay stilled.” Let us examine this verse in its tropological significance. At last Pharaoh mounted his steeds, sank into sleep and perished. The Egyptians too had steeds, but they perished. That is the reason for the prescription found in the law4 that no Hebrew should possess a horse. Solomon, you recall, had no horses from Jerusalem or Judea but bought some from Egypt. Horses are always for sale in Egypt. “Some are strong in chariots; some in horses; but we are strong in the name of the Lord, our God.” They, in truth, who mounted horses slumbered and perished. Our Lord has horses too, and he has shining mountains besides, whereas the devil’s mountains are full of darkness. Now just as there are bright mountains and dark mountains, there are good horses and again bad horses. We have made a few remarks about bad horses; let us say something about good horses. When horsemen came to Elisha to arrest him and the servant boy went out and saw an army of Assyrians round about the city, Elisha said, “Fear not: for there are more with us than with them.” A little further on in Kings it says, “Lord, open the eyes of your servant that he may see.” And when his eyes had been opened, he saw chariots and horses. These were helpmates. You notice that it says “chariots and horses.” There were no men on the horses, only chariots and horses, in other words a multitude of angels. They were the chariots and they were the horses; the charioteer was the Lord. That is why the prophet Habakkuk sings, “Your chariots are salvation.” This is said to God. O, if only we too were God’s horses, and God deigned to ride us! But those other horses slept their long sleep and their charioteers with them.
