The cause of so many crimes is this: The people thought that there was no such thing as providence on earth and that God did not look after mortal things at all.… They either thought that there was no providence, or if there had once been any, it had forsaken its own people. Therefore, not even the eye of the Lord will spare them, nor will he have mercy.
