(Verse 17) And Jesus rebuked him, and the demon came out of him, and the boy was healed from that hour. It was not the boy who suffered, but rather the demon who ought to be rebuked. Whether he rebuked the boy, and the demon came out of him: because he had been oppressed by the demon due to his own sins.
