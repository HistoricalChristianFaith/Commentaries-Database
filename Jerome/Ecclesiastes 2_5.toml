"I made
for myself gardens and orchards and planted in them every kind of fruit
tree. "In my treasure house are not only gold and silver
dishes but even some that are made from wood and pottery. And even the gardens therefore are made on
account of certain weaker and sick men, for anyone who is sick will eat
vegetables. Trees are planted, not all
of them fruit-bearing as we have in the Latin manuscripts, but of all fruits,
that is of varied fruits and fruit-trees, because the grace of the Church is also
varied. Thus one type of tree is the
eye, one the hand and another the foot, and on those things which are most
prized we bestow our greatest glory. And
amongst those fruit-trees I esteem the wood itself to be primal in life because
it is wisdom, for unless that is planted in their midst the other trees will
dry up.
