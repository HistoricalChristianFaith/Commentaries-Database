(Verse 3.) O Tyre, you have said, 'I am of perfect beauty' (or you have said, 'I have surrounded myself with beauty') and situated in the heart of the sea. The first crime of Tyre is if it seems to have any good, to not attribute it to God, but to itself, and to value all the beauty that comes from diverse regions as its own accomplishment and virtue. For it has said, 'I am of perfect beauty' or 'I have surrounded myself with beauty,' although it is situated in the heart, that is, in the middle of the sea, and it moves like an island, and it is tossed and broken by the crashing waves. But as for the heart of the sea, it signifies the middle, and that prophetic speech demonstrates: Therefore we will not fear, when the earth is troubled, and the mountains are carried into the heart of the sea. Their waters have roared and been troubled. But our Lord is also said to descend into the heart of the earth, that is, into the middle, and to the underworld. But true and perfect beauty is found in no one but the body of Christ, which is interpreted as the Church, and is gathered by the virtues of many saints. And he himself speaks to the bride: You are all beautiful, my love, and there is no blemish in you (Canticles 4:7).
