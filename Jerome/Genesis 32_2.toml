(Chapter XXXII, Verse 2) And Sara died in the city of Arboc, which is in the valley: this is Chebron, in the land of Canaan. This that is placed here, which is in the valley, is not found in authentic codices. The name of the city Arboc has also gradually been corrupted by scribes and readers. For it should not be assumed that the Seventy Interpreters translated the name of the Hebrew city in a barbaric and corrupted manner, differently than it is said in its own language. Indeed, 'Arboc' signifies nothing at all. But it is said to be 'Arbee' (that is, four) because there Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob were buried, and also the first of the human race, Adam, as will be more clearly demonstrated in the book of Jesus.
