(v. 21) And he gave them food along the way. The word Seda, which here everyone with one voice translates as 'provisions' (ἐπισιτισμὸν in Greek), is also found in the Psalter. For where our translation reads, 'I will abundantly bless her widow' (Ps. 132:15), (although in most manuscripts it is written as 'widow,' which is χήρα in Greek, some read it as 'prey,' θήραν), in Hebrew it has Seda, which means 'provisions.' Furthermore, the word 'θήραν' can more often refer to hunting than to crops, although it is the custom of the Egyptians to also call crops 'θήραν', which is now corrupted to 'atheran'.
