(Verse 13.) Therefore, watch, for you do not know the day or the hour. I always advise the prudent reader not to rely on superstitious interpretations, and not to consider what is said in a fictitious manner, but to consider the previous, middle, and subsequent parts, and to connect everything that is written. From this, therefore, he concludes: Watch, for you do not know the day or the hour. All that he said is understood, that is, about the two in the field, and about the two grinding at the mill, and about the master of the house who entrusts his possessions to his servant, and about the ten virgins. Therefore, these parables have been given, so that because we all do not know the day of judgment, we may diligently prepare the light of good works, lest, while we are unaware, the judge comes.
