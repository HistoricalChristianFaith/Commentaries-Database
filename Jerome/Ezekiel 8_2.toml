(Version 2.) And there fell upon me the hand of the Lord God there. And I saw, and behold, a likeness as the appearance of fire from the appearance of his loins, and downward fire: and from his loins and upward, as the appearance of brightness, as the sight of lightning. LXX: And the hand of Adonai the Lord came upon me: and I saw and behold, a likeness as the form of a man from his loins, and downward fire, and from his loins, and upward as the sight of the aura, like the sight of lightning. The Hebrew language does not include the word “man.” However, we have added the mention of the vision of the divine presence, which is not found in the Septuagint, from Theodotion. And because of what we have said, the hand of the Lord fell upon me. Symmachus translated it as 'the hand of the Lord came upon me,' which in Hebrew is Tephphol (). However, the word manus signifies 'power' or 'works,' so that one may understand the mysteries of the vision. And it should be noted that he does not see the truths themselves, but a likeness of fire, for fire appeared from the loins downwards; and from the loins upwards, it appeared as a radiant appearance, like the vision of lightning. For the splendor, which in Hebrew is called Zor, transferred the aura to Theodotus, in order to reveal the refreshing presence of God in the heavens. Finally, in the book of Kings, the blessed Elijah does not contemplate the coming of the Lord in a storm and whirlwind, nor in the burning fires, but in the sight of a thin and gentle breeze, to attest to the gentleness of Almighty God. However, the works of the body, symbolized in the loins, are purified by fire from top to bottom. And the works of virtues, which rise from the loins to the upper parts, have splendor and brightness, and yet neither fire is said to reach to the feet, nor the brightness of lightning to the head, but downwards and upwards, so that, according to the diversity of merits, one reaches to this and that member, another to those members. And just as those who hold the perfection of holiness reach to the summit, so those who are in the depths of sin are believed to hold the feet of the fiery ones.
