(Verse 15.) And he said to them: What do you want to give me, and I will betray him to you? Unfortunate Judas, he believed that he could make up for the loss caused by the spillage of the ointment with the price of the master. However, he does not demand a specific amount, so that the betrayal would at least appear profitable, but rather, like someone selling a cheap slave, he put it in the power of the buyers to give as much as they wanted.
