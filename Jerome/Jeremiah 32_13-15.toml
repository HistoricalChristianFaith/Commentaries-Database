(Verse 13 and following) And I commanded Baruch before them, saying: Thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: Take these books, this sealed book, and this open book, and put them in an earthen vessel, that they may last for many days. For thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: Houses and fields and vineyards shall still be possessed in this land. To all whom the previous message has been told, both those present and those who see it, Baruch, the minister and disciple, is commanded not by the words of a teacher, but by the command of God, to take the books, one sealed and the other open, which have been kept in the custom of purchases, so that he may show the open volume to those who wish to read what the sealed book contains within: both in an earthen vessel, so they may last for many days. Therefore, the firm and long-awaited possession, which was guarded with such great care, so that neither if the books placed outside for sale were exposed to theft, nor if they were buried in the ground, would be destroyed by moisture from the earth. However, all of this was done so that those who saw it would understand once again that Jerusalem should be inhabited and lands should be possessed, which though they should have understood on their own without the words of Jeremiah, they are reminded by the words of the Lord, and it is said to them: The Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, says: Houses and fields and vineyards will still be possessed in this land. This is what Jeremiah had previously said: I understood that it was the word of the Lord; and for that reason, he bought a field that he was not going to possess.
