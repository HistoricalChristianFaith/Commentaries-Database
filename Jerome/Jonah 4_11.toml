We read of Eli the priest that he became displeasing to God on account of the sins of his children. And we are told that a man may not be made a bishop if his sons are loose and disorderly. It is written of the woman that “she shall be saved in childbearing, if she continues in faith and charity and holiness with chastity.” If then parents are responsible for their children when these are of ripe age and independent, how much more must they be responsible for them when, still unweaned and weak, they cannot, in the Lord’s words, “discern between their right hand and their left,” when, that is to say, they cannot yet distinguish good from evil?
