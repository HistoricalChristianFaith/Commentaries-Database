Shewing also thereby that He was Son of that same God whose prophet John was; and therefore He says, Repent ye.

Shewing also thereby that He was Son of that same God whose prophet John was; and therefore He says, “Repent ye.”For repentance corrects the will; and if yew ill not repent through fear of evil, at least ye may for the pleasure of good things; hence He says, “the kingdom of heaven is at hand;” that is, the blessings of the heavenly kingdom. As if He has said, Prepare yourselves by repentance, for the time of eternal reward is at hand.
