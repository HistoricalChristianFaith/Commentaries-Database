(vv. 12-14) Therefore thus says the Holy Lord of Israel: Because you have rejected this word and have put your trust in oppression and in deceit, and have relied on it, therefore this iniquity shall be for you like a breach in a high wall that is sought after and cannot be found, like a jar of clay that is broken beyond repair, so that no fragment of it is found for taking fire from the hearth or for drawing water from the cistern. For, as you have said above, 'Let the Holy One of Israel cease from our presence,' or as the Seventy translated it, 'Take away from us the word Israel'; therefore, thus says the Lord, the Holy One of Israel, and to those who are unwilling to listen, He approaches, so that you may feel the punishment of the one whom you have neglected, warning you. You have put your trust in the deceit and lies of the Egyptians, and you have relied on their tumult, their contradiction and pride, as Symmachus and Theodotion have interpreted, therefore this injustice or sin will turn against you, so that you may be like a suddenly falling wall of a strong and captured city, whose ruin will come suddenly, for thus the Seventy translated it. And the sense is similar to the Hebrew: Just as the interruption of a very high wall that has brought about a long ruin is difficult to restore and regain its former beauty, so sudden destruction will come upon you. And let me use another comparison: Just as the vessel of a potter, if it is broken by a very strong crushing, is shattered into fragments, such that only a tiny piece remains to carry a spark or a little water is drawn from a small hollow, so you, when you go to Egypt, pursued by Nebuchadnezzar, will perish completely. Heretics also rely on deceit and falsehood, and they mutter against their Creator according to the Septuagint. Therefore, their impious city will be destroyed, which Cain built, and it will face sudden destruction when it is captured by the men of the Church. It will be so completely destroyed and crushed that nothing will remain in it to reignite the extinguished fire and provide even muddy and meager water to the thirsty people.
