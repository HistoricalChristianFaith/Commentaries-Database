(Verses 22 onwards) Therefore, the Lord says to the house of Jacob, who redeemed Abraham: Jacob will not only be ashamed, but his face will also turn red. But when he sees his children, the works of my hands, in their midst sanctifying my name, they will sanctify the Holy Jacob, and they will proclaim the God of Israel. And those who wander in spirit will gain understanding, and murmurers will learn the Law. (LXX: Therefore, the Lord says about the house of Jacob, whom he overcame from Abraham: Jacob will not only be ashamed, but his face will not change now; but when he sees his children, my works, they will sanctify my name because of me, and they will sanctify the Holy Jacob, and they will fear the God of Israel, and those who wander in spirit will gain understanding, and murmurers will learn obedience, and what follows รท and those with stammering tongues will learn to speak peace. ** Note: marked with an obelus.) When the deaf hear, says he, the words of the book, and the eyes of the blind see: the Lebanus has been turned into Charmel, and Charmel is regarded as a forest, so that the meek and the poor rejoice in the Lord, and the proud and the scoffers are overcome: then Jacob, who now is not yet ashamed, will be put to shame. But this refers to the times of Isaiah. And his face will blush, so that blushing and confusion may be the occasion of salvation, especially when he sees his sons, that is, the Apostles and apostolic men, who were from the race of the Jews, performing miracles in the midst of the nations of the Lord, and preaching the name of Christ to the Gentiles, and saying: Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name (Matt. 6:9). For they shall sanctify the Holy One who was born of Jacob, and they shall teach the God of Israel among the nations, so that, the idols being abandoned, they may say: how false were the idols that our fathers possessed, and there is no power in them; and then those who now wander in spirit will understand the knowledge of God, and those who once murmured against the Lord in the wilderness will learn the Law, of which they previously had no knowledge. For if they had received Moses, they would have also received the Lord Jesus Christ, because Moses spoke of him. What we have translated in the beginning of the chapter according to the Hebrew: This is what the Lord says to the house of Jacob, who once redeemed Abraham, and brought him out from the Chaldeans, and led him into the promised land (Gen. XI), is clearly evident. However, what the Seventy translated: This is what the Lord says about the house of Jacob, which he separated from Abraham, can be understood as meaning that he has separated the Scribes and Pharisees, who blasphemed the Lord, from Abraham, who saw the day of the Lord and rejoiced (John VIII). For if they were the children of Abraham, they would do the works of Abraham. And the Apostle argues that those who have the likeness of the faith of Abraham, that is, the people of the Gentiles, who are called children of Abraham not by works but by faith (Hebrews XI).
