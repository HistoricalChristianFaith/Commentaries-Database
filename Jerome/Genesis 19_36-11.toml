(Versed. 36 seqq.) And the two daughters of Lot conceived by their father, and the firstborn son was born and she called his name Moab. He is the father of the Moabites to this day. And the younger, she also gave birth to a son, and she called his name Ammon, that is, son of my people. He is the father of the Ammonites. The name Moab means 'from the father' and has its etymology in it. But Ammon, whose name is given as if a cause, is derived as son of my race, or as it is better in Hebrew (), son of my people, so it is derived partly from the meaning of the name, partly from the language itself: Ammi, from whom the Ammonites are called, means my people.
