And it is called the city of sanctuary, for qodeš means that quality on which the city was founded. Or it is called the city of the holy one, because of the knowledge of God, or it is called the holy city because, of all the world’s cities, it alone accepted the law. Hence, after the resurrection of the Savior the bodies of many dead people appeared in the holy city, which because of blasphemy and the hands laid on the Lord could not until then have been holy.
