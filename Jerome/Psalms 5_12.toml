God is our shield, he is our crown. He protects us as if he were a shield; as God he crowns us. He is our shield; he is our crown.… Let us give thanks to God, and let us beseech him in his good will to be our shield and crown that we may never depart from him and that we may follow him and declare with Jeremiah: “I was not weary of following you.”

Does anyone really crown with a shield, you ask? Surely, he who crowns, crowns with flowers, or with gold or with other crowns. Now how does one crown with a shield? But the Lord’s shield is a crown, for he surrounds us with his protection and defends us and so crowns us.
