(Verse 7, 8.) Rise, take up your bed, and go to your house. And he rose and went to his house. And when the crowds saw it, they were afraid and glorified God, who had given such authority to men. And if the paralyzed man rises, if he recovers his former strength, he carries his bed on which he lay before, and carries it into his house of virtues.
