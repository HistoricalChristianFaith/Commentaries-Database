(Verse 8, 9.) Who are these who fly like clouds, and like doves to their windows? For the coastlands wait for me, and the ships of the sea are in the lead, to bring your sons from afar, with their silver and gold, to the name of the Lord your God, and to the Holy One of Israel, because he has glorified you. LXX: Who are these who fly like clouds, and like doves with their young to me? The coastlands have waited for me, and the ships of Tarshish in the first place, to bring your sons from afar, and their silver and gold with them, for the sake of the holy name of the Lord, and because the Holy One of Israel has been glorified. Because the Lord entered Egypt on a light cloud, and through the clouds he commanded the prophets not to rain upon Israel, the Church, to whom the truth of God had come, marvels at the first people gathered for circumcision, that a crowd of Gentiles from the whole world flies to her. And with the wings of the Holy Spirit taken up, they hasten, according to Symmachus and Theodotion, to her windows; according to Aquila, to her waterfalls, that they may enter the Church. Or the teachers with their disciples, that is, doves with their chicks, will fly to the church from the islands of the gentiles, which, according to the prophecies of the prophets, will await the Lord. The ships of Tarshish, that is, of the sea, about which we have spoken more fully in the vision of Tyre, will also bring the children of the Church at the beginning of faith, carrying gold and silver. For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation (Rom. X, 10). In the sixty-seventh psalm, it is written: 'The wings of the dove are silver, and its back is gold in brightness' (Psalm 70:14). And in the seventy-first psalm: 'The kings of Tarshish and the islands shall bring gifts, and the kings of Arabia and Sheba shall offer gifts' (Psalm 71:10). All these things are brought to the name of the Lord God and the Holy One of Israel, who has glorified him.
