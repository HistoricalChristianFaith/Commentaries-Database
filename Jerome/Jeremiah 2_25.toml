Nothing makes God as angry as when people from despair of better things cling to those that are worse. Indeed, this despair in itself is a sign of unbelief. One who despairs of salvation can have no expectation of a judgment to come. For if he dreaded such, he would by doing works prepare to meet his Judge. Let us hear what God says through Jeremiah: “Withhold your foot from a rough way and your throat from thirst,” and again, “shall they fall, and not arise? Shall he turn away, and not return?” - "Letter 122.1"
