(Vers. 14, 15.) You shall be confounded by your fruits (or by your boasting (because of the anger of the fury of the Lord (or by the reproach in the sight of the Lord). Thus says the Lord against all my wicked neighbors, who touch the inheritance which I have distributed to my people Israel: Behold, I will uproot them from their land and uproot the house of Judah (or cast them out) from among them. And when I have uprooted them, I will turn (or return) and have mercy on them, and I will bring them back (or make them dwell) man in his inheritance, and man in his land. It is said to them, to whom their own clergy and ecclesiastical order will not benefit, that they should be confounded by their own boasting and by reproach before the Lord. And it brings forth: against all my wicked neighbors, according to the letter, the neighbors of the holy land are the Edomites, Philistines, Moab, and Ammon. But according to the allegory, all heretics who are considered under the name of Christ are even more neighbors than the inhabitants of the holy land, who touch the inheritance of God and devastate it. And it is said of them that they shall be taken away from the midst of the land, and the house of Judah shall be taken away from their midst. Whoever is uprooted and freed from the jaws of the heretics will obtain the mercy of God, and they will be restored to their inheritance and their land.
