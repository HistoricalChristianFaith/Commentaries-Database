[Verse 21] is addressed either to Isaiah, as I think, or to the Lord, as many believe. This is why the order of thought is presented thus to Isaiah: “This is the eternal covenant of the gospel, that my Spirit, which is in you, and my words, which I have put in your mouth, through which you will come to preach, will depart neither from your mouth, nor from the mouth of your children nor from the mouth of their children, so that it will be demonstrated to every generation consecutively.” But the grace of the prophets will surely come to the apostles and to those who will believe through the apostles.
