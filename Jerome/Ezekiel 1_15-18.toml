(Verse 15 and following) And as I looked at the animals, a wheel appeared on the earth beside the animals, having four faces. And the appearance of the wheels and their work was like the vision of the sea, and the four of them had the same likeness, and their appearance and work was as a wheel within a wheel. They went in the four directions, and they did not turn as they walked. The wheels also had a height and a terrifying appearance, and the whole body was full of eyes all around the four of them. LXX: And I saw, and behold, a wheel was following animals four over the earth. And the appearance of the wheels and their construction was like the color of tarshish. And their appearance was in four: and their work was as it were a wheel within a wheel. They walked in their four parts, and did not turn back when they walked. And their backs and their height were to them. And I saw them, and their backs were full of eyes all around the four. Up to this point, the picture describes the four living creatures that had four faces, following the spirits and the cloud that was in the midst of the spirit, now the individual wheels are mentioned for each animal, which were not attached to the animals but followed them. Or a wheel appeared upon the Earth, which, divided into four, had as many faces as the number of animals that followed. And such was the similarity of the four wheels to the four following animals, that one wheel was truly believed. And their work and creation was like the vision of tharsis, which we turn into the sea. The eagle placed the hyacinth; which stone resembles the sky. And their appearance was like one wheel in another, so that you would not believe it was one wheel, but rather one wheel joined to another. They were moving in four directions, and they were not being dragged or turned back. For how could they turn back when they were following animals that always move towards the front? The height and size of the wheels were also so great that it amazed those who saw it. The entire body and backs were filled with light all around, so that you could not see any part that did not have the light of eyes: like the stories of the poets describe Argus, who had a hundred or many eyes, which Juno turned into a peacock for his careless watch, so that what is a miracle of God the Creator would be a punishment for adultery without recompense. All things celestial and terrestrial, and whatever falls under human understanding, are turned by the wheels of the Sun. The Sun travels through its yearly circle, with the Moon coursing through each month. The Morning Star itself, known as Lucifer, as it twinkles from East to West, tempers the darkness of the night with a small light and completes its course in two years. The four other wandering stars, called planets, and everything that shines in the sky, as well as the varieties of crops, trees, and herbs, follow their courses in four seasons on their own respective wheels; and we behold nothing that has not existed before. The spirit moves by whirling and returns to its own circles. All rivers run into the sea, yet the sea is not full (Ecclesiastes 1:6-7). Why? Because they return to their sources from the deep abyss. But of the Gospels, that is, of the four living creatures that breathe, live, and understand, if anyone considers the wheel and its course, in a short time he will see the world to be complete with the Apostolic proclamation. The wheel is also within a wheel, or the joining of the two Testaments, which indicates the ladder of Jacob (Genesis 28) and the prophetic word of Isaiah (Isaiah 6) and the double-edged sword. Or it represents the harmonious Gospels whose course and stature tend towards heaven and touch the earth only briefly, always hastening towards the heights. About which it is said elsewhere: Holy stones roll upon the earth (Zech. IX, 16); from which the celestial Jerusalem is built. I believe this signifies the same thing as what is sung in the psalm: The voice of your thunder is in the wheel (Psalm LXXVI, 19). And elsewhere: Which sets the wheel of birth on fire (James III, 6). The meaning of these testimonies in their proper places is not of this time. But whoever sees that there is nothing in the Gospels that does not shine with its own light and illuminate the world with its splendor, will approve the whole body and the backs filled with eyes, so that even the things considered small and lowly may shine with the majesty of the Holy Spirit.
