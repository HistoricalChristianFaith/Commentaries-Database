The word exterminare, so often used in the ecclesiastical Scriptures through a blunder of the translators, has a quite different meaning from that in which it is commonly understood. It is properly said of exiles who are sent beyond the boundary of their country. Instead of this word, it would seem better to use the word demoliri, 'to destroy,' in translating the Greek ἀφανίζειν. The hypocrite destroys his face, in order that he may feign sorrow, and with a heart full of joy wears sorrow in his countenance.

(V. 16) For they disfigure their faces that they may appear to men to fast. Amen I say to you, they have received their reward. The word exterminate, which is frequently used in the books of Ecclesiastic writers, has a much different meaning than is commonly understood. For it means that those who are exiled are exterminated, as they are sent beyond the borders. Therefore, we should always understand this word in this sense: which is said in Greek as ἀφανίζουσι. However, the hypocrite demolishes his face to simulate sadness; and with a strong mind rejoicing, he bears grief on his countenance.
