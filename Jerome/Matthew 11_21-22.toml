(Verse 21, 22.) Woe to you, Chorazin; woe to you, Bethsaida: for if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon, which have been done in you, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes. But I say to you, it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the day of judgment than for you. Chorazin and Bethsaida, cities of Galilee, are mourned by the Savior because despite the many signs and miracles, they did not repent, and are surpassed by Tyre and Sidon, idolatrous cities given to vice. They are preferred, however, because Tyre and Sidon have only violated natural law, whereas these, after transgressing natural law, have also disregarded the signs that were performed among them. We are inquiring where it is written that the Lord performed signs in Chorazin and Bethsaida. Above, we read: 'And he went through all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, and proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom and healing every disease and every affliction' (Matthew 9:35). Therefore, among the other cities and villages, it is to be presumed that the Lord also performed signs in Chorazin and Bethsaida.
