Jeremiah, who was sanctified in the womb and was known in his motherâ€™s belly, enjoyed the high privilege because he was predestined to the blessing of virginity. And when all were captured and even the vessels of the temple were plundered by the king of Babylon, he alone was2 liberated by the enemy, did not know the insults of captivity and was supported by the conquerors; and Nebuchadnezzar, though he gave Nebuzaradan no charge concerning the Holy of Holies, did give him charge concerning Jeremiah. For that is the true temple of God and that is the Holy of Holies, which is consecrated to the Lord by pure virginity.
