(Verse 35 and following) 'And he brought me to the gate that faced the north, and he measured it according to the higher measurements: its chamber, its facade, its vestibule, and its windows all around: it was fifty cubits long and twenty-five cubits wide. Its vestibule faced the outer court, and its palm tree engravings on its facade on both sides, and its staircase with eight steps.' And at each treasury there shall be a door in the gates (or fronts) of the doors: there they shall wash the holocaust. And at the entrance of the gate, there shall be two tables on this side, and two tables on that side, upon which the holocaust shall be immolated, and for sin, and for trespass. And on the outer side, which goes to the gate that leads to the north, there shall be two tables, and on the other side, before the vestibule of the gate, there shall be two tables. Four tables on this side, and four tables on that side: by the sides of the gate, there were eight tables, upon which they shall immolate (or used to immolate): but there were four tables for holocaust made of square stones, of one cubit and a half long, and of one cubit and a half wide, and of one cubit high, upon which the vessels were laid in which the holocaust and the victims are immolated. And their lips were a cubit long, turned inward all around; but on the tables were the flesh of the offering.» There is much disagreement in this testimony between the Hebrew Truth and the edition of the Seventy Interpreters. For what we have said: There they shall wash the burnt offering, and in the vestibule of the gate there are two tables on this side, and again: That the burnt offering and the sin offering be offered on them, is not found in the Seventy, but it is added in many copies from Theodotion. Again, when we said: And their lips turned inward by one palm's measure all around, Seventy translated it, and having the measurement of a span all around. Whether this word is Hebrew or Greek, we cannot know, except only that for 'gisum,' Symmachus and Theodotion translated it as 'lips,' Aquila's first edition translated it as 'ἐπιστάσεις' in the plural number; the second translated it as 'lips': for which in Hebrew it is written as 'Asephathaim'(). And when we say, above the tables however the meats of the offering, the Seventy put from their own, and they put coverings on the tables from above, so that they may be protected from rain and dryness. But that which they have given in Hebrew names, Thee, and Elau, and Elalamoth, and Aelam, what it signifies, and we have shown above, and our translation can show from the context: it is not necessary to often remind the reader about this, and to doubt their prudence and effort. Therefore, he is brought again to the gate that looked towards the North: but not as before to the outer courtyard, but to the inner one. For in what follows it is said: Its vestibule looked towards the outer courtyard, showing that this courtyard was inside. Through this, the progress of the one entering is shown; for in each place there are specific names and measures, and windows all around filled with the light of knowledge, showing all things, and through fifty and twenty-five cubits are the sacraments of divine sense and remission placed, as positioned in the vestibule of the inner courtyard, that we may see the exterior: contemplating knowledge of past and present, through which we may come to double palms and victories, and understand the mysteries of the eight degrees, having entered the treasuries, in which the riches of the temple are contained, and our prayers are cleansed from all the filth of sin; and tables are placed on both sides, so that the burnt offering may be first offered.

The diligent shepherd follows the custom of his father, and Gesaque, the barker of Sydon, etc., all of which the sacred fire consumes, first for sin, and finally for ignorance: whether we commit them knowingly or unknowingly. On the outer side, next to the Seventy, there was a man-made stream that carried away the ashes of the burnt offering and the harmfulness of the flesh externally: either there were two tables, and on the other side of the vestibule of the same gate there were two tables, that is, four on each side, four here and four there, and behind, or on the side of these there were eight other tables, so that they make a total of sixteen tables: by this number the mysteries of the prophets are shown, so that whatever we offer through the Gospel dispensation, we may affirm as foretold by their prophecies. And there are four tables made of square stones, and these themselves are for sacrifice and burnt offering (also called holocausts). These are living stones that are rolled upon the earth, and they have with them a corner stone, by which the walls of the old and new Covenant are held together. Now the number four signifies the Gospel sacraments, having in length and width one and a half cubits, that is, a square, which, when joined together, make three cubits, which three cubits have one cubit in height, so that the mysteries of the Trinity may preserve the measure of one cubit, that is, the divine majesty, as the Lord tells the disciples: Go, baptize all nations in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit (Matthew 28:19). The name of God, as it were, is of one (or, one) cubit in height, which encompasses three properties, and always accepts the holocaust offerings of our oblations. Above these, however, are four tables of holocausts built with living stones, the length, width, and height of which have been described; vessels are placed in them in which the holocaust of the martyrs is offered, of whom it is said: Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his saints (Ps. 116:15); and their victims, who, through self-control and the holiness of their bodies, offer their souls as a sacrifice to the Lord. I believe that the meaning of these tables is contained in the books of Matthew, Luke, Mark, and John, which are about the apostles. Above these tables there was a curved crown on the inside, encircling the edges, to contain the sacrificial offerings and prevent them from flowing freely. It also held the meat of the offering, or as the Septuagint translated: 'And the tables themselves were covered on top, because of the violence of the rain and the excessive dryness of the summer sun, so that the meat placed on top could say with the prophet: “By day the sun will not harm us nor the moon by night."' (Psalm 121:6). One of which, with excessive rains and storms, dissolves the offerings of tribulations; the other, with violent heat, dries up whatever has been offered. Forgive me, reader, for the difficulty of the places; or if you can find something better, teach us: we gladly learn what we do not know.
