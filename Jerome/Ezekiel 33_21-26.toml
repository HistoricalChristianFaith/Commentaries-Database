Jerusalem is captured and the temple is destroyed, and the poor earth of which Jeremiah wrote was left behind in Jerusalem. Those who kept vines and tilled the land live in the ruins of burned city; when they ought to repent of the things that had brought about their captivity, they blind themselves with a false hope by saying, “Abraham was only one man, yet he got possession of the land.”
