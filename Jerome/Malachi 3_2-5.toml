(Verse 2 and following) Look, says the Lord of Hosts, who can think of the day of his coming? And who will stand to see him? For he will come like a refining fire and like the fullers' soap. He will sit as a refiner and purifier of silver, and he will purify the sons of Levi and refine them like gold and silver, and they will offer sacrifices to the Lord in righteousness. And the sacrifice of Judah and Jerusalem will be pleasing to the Lord, as in the days of old and as in former years. And I will come to you in judgment, and I will be a swift witness against sorcerers and adulterers, and perjurers, and those who oppress the hired worker, the widow, and the fatherless, and those who thrust aside the sojourner: they have not feared me, says the Lord of hosts. For I the Lord do not change. Behold, he is coming, says the Lord of hosts, and who will endure the day of his coming? And who can stand when he appears? For he is like a refiner's fire and like fullers' soap. He will sit as a refiner and purifier of silver, and he will purify the sons of Levi and refine them like gold and silver, and they will bring offerings in righteousness to the Lord. And the offerings of Judah and Jerusalem will be pleasing to the Lord as in the days of old and as in former years. And I will come to you in judgment, and I will be a swift witness against evildoers, and against adulterers, and against those who swear falsely by my name. And those who cheat hired workers of their wages, and oppress widows, and orphaned children, and pervert the justice due to foreigners, and those who do not fear me, says the Lord Almighty. For I am the Lord your God, and I do not change. Above, we have read the question raised to the Lord by those who say: 'Everyone who does evil is good in the sight of the Lord, and he delights in them.' Or surely, if He is displeased, where is the God of judgment? This is where is the truth of justice? To which the Lord's response was: I will send my angel, who will prepare my way, and he will come to his temple, the ruler whom you seek, who is the judge of truth, of whom it is said in the Psalm: O God, grant your judgment to the king, and your justice to the son of the king (Psalm 71:1). For the Father does not judge anyone; but he has given all judgment to the Son (John 5:22). And that Son is the angel of the covenant whom you seek, who does not delight in evil, who does not show partiality in judgment (Colossians 3:25), who is not changed by either mercy or severity: for the cup in the Lord's hand is full of mixed wine, and he pours from one side to the other (Psalm 75:8-9), meaning that mercy tempers justice, and justice tempers mercy. So he will come immediately and swiftly to his temple, that is, the Church. And who will be able to conceive the day of his coming? If no one can conceive the day of his coming because of the power of his majesty, who will be able to endure it? And who will stand to see him, that is, who will be able to behold him in his glory with dimmed and blinded eyes, he who is the sun of righteousness, and in whose wings is healing? He will come like a consuming fire, and like the fuller's herb. For fire will burn before him, and around him will be a mighty tempest. Then He will call the heavens from above, and the earth, that He may judge His people. The rivers of fire will go before Him, and will engulf the sinners. The Lord is said to be a consuming fire (Deut. IV), that will burn up our wood, hay, and stubble. And not only fire; but also the herb of fullers, which in Hebrew is called Borith, and in the Septuagint πόαν, that is, the herb of fullers, they translate. For those who commit grave sins, it is a fire that melts and consumes; but for those who commit lesser sins, it is the herb of fullers that restores cleanliness, according to what is written in Isaiah: The Lord will wash away the filth of the sons and daughters of Zion, and will cleanse their blood from their midst, with the spirit of judgment and the spirit of burning (Isai. IV). Those who have filth need the spirit of judgment in order to be cleansed; those who are full of blood need the spirit of burning in order for the blood that is externally attached to them to be removed. And the one who sits and melts and purifies like silver, according to Ezekiel (Chapter 22), whatever is mixed in our gold and silver, that is, in our understanding and speech, in bronze, tin, iron, and lead, let it be cooked in the furnace of the Lord, so that pure gold and silver may remain. And the Lord also says in the Gospel: I came to cast fire upon the earth, and what will I but that it be kindled (Luke 12:49); and he shall purify the sons of Levi. For the time has come for judgment to begin at the house of God (1 Peter 4:17). And elsewhere it is written: Begin at my sanctuary (Ezekiel 9:6). But in the sons of Levi: understand all priestly dignity. If, however, the priests are to be purified and worshiped, so that pure gold and silver may remain, what is to be said of the others? When they have been cleansed and purified, then they will offer righteous sacrifices to the Lord, and their sacrifice will be pleasing, which they offer for Judah and Jerusalem, that is, for those who confess the Lord and contemplate His peace with their minds, as in the days of old and the years of ancient times, so that just as they pleased God in the beginning, they may begin to please Him again after sin and repentance, having been cleansed from all the filth of sins. And I will approach, he says, to you in judgment, and I will be a swift witness. How great is the fear of judgment, when he himself is witness and judge. He is a witness against all wrongdoers and adulterers, for these crimes are committed in secret and therefore are brought to light, so that they may not remain hidden for long. After the wrongdoers come the adulterers: after the adulterers come the perjurers: after the perjurers come those who falsely accuse for the payment of a hireling, and they refuse to repay for the labor of their work that they owe. Widows and orphans are also understood to be falsely accused, and they oppress the stranger and foreigner, or at least the catechumen, who has not yet become a citizen of the city of Christ. And if they have not done all these things, it is enough for them to be punished, because they did not fear the Lord. Therefore, we should not consider perjury, not giving wages to the laborer, slandering the widow and the orphan, and oppressing the foreigner and the stranger as light sins: which are compared to wickedness, sorceries, and adultery. We understand this both according to history and according to metaphor, so that what was said at that time to the rulers of the Jews may now be said to the rulers of the Churches. And that which follows: I am the Lord and I do not change, he states this because he had said earlier: he is like a consuming fire, and like the soap of fullers, so that we do not think that he changes his divine nature, since he is called an angel, or fire, or Borith for us.
