For those who believe, salvation is in Mount Zion and Jerusalem. In the latter days, the Lord will gather the called remnant from the people of Judah, who with the apostles and through the apostles believed. He will return the captives of Judah to Jerusalem. He is the one who came to preach sight to the blind, forgiveness to the captives and freedom to those who confess the Lord and abide in the church, in which is the vision of peace. He will gather all the nations who are unwilling to believe, however, and throw them into the valley of Jehoshaphat. The Greek renders kataxō, which is true to the Hebrew, that is, “I will lead you downwards, and drag you down from the highest heights to the lowest depths.”
