It is true that a festival such as the birthday of Peter should be seasoned with more gladness than usual; still our merriment must not forget the limit set by Scripture, and we must not stray too far from the boundary of our wrestling ground. Your presents, indeed, remind me of the sacred volume, for in it Ezekiel decks Jerusalem with bracelets.

(Verse 11.) And I adorned you with ornaments. Now he lists the ornaments in general, which he enumerates in the following sections: bracelets and necklaces, earrings and crown, and other ornaments which he gave to Jerusalem, and it is said in Isaiah that she lost everything due to her own fault. For it is written: Because they were lifted up, that is, the daughters of Jerusalem became proud and walked with a haughty neck (Isa. III, 16, 17), and the rest: instead of a belt, they were girded with ropes, and instead of a head ornament, they were disfigured with baldness, and instead of beautiful and soft garments, they were surrounded with the roughness of sackcloth.


And I gave bracelets into your hands. LXX: And I surrounded your hands with bracelets. When God gives us good works, He surrounds our hands with bracelets. Hence it is said that it is likened to the hands of the prophets (Hosea 13), and we often read in the hand of Haggai or Jeremiah and the rest (Haggai 1). In Job, the lip of the dragon is pierced by a bracelet, and all his venomous hisses, which are understood in perverse doctrines, are pierced by the circle of good works (Job 40).


And a chain around your neck. Regarding the chain, which we have interpreted according to the second edition of Aquila and Symmachus, the Septuagint and Theodotion translated it as κάθεμα, which is written not only here but also in Isaiah: The Lord will take away the glory of their garments, their hairnets, their bangles, their crescent ornaments, and their κάθεμα (Isaiah 3:18). But I believe κάθεμα is said by them to refer to various gems descending from the necklace on the chest of women, which is also a most beautiful adornment of women.
