"Better
is one handful of pleasantness than two fistfuls of labour and vexation of the
spirit." It is better to have modest power, than great riches of
sins. And in Proverbs it says, "To
receive a little through righteousness is better than gaining much by
injustice." [Prov. 16, 8.] Justice rightly has rest, injustice
toil. And since a single number is
always seen in a good context and a dual seen as wickedness, therefore one fist
has rest, and two hands are full of toil.
