(Verse 6) But when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper. About to suffer for the whole world and redeem all nations with his blood, he stayed in Bethany, the house of obedience, which was once Simon the leper's. Not that he remained a leper at that time, but he who was formerly a leper was cleansed by the Savior, with his former name remaining, so that the power of the healer may be apparent. For in the list of apostles, with his former vice and occupation, Matthew is called a tax collector, who had certainly ceased to be a tax collector. A certain Simon, a leper's house, they want it to be understood as a part of the people, which has believed in the Lord, and has been cured by him. Simon himself is also said to be obedient, who can be interpreted in another sense as the world, in whose house the Church is healed.
