(Verse 19 onwards) And as they were departing from Jericho, a great crowd followed him. And behold, two blind men sitting by the roadside, heard that Jesus was passing by, and they cried out, saying: Lord, have mercy on us, Son of David. But the crowd rebuked them, telling them to be silent. Yet they cried out even more, saying: Lord, have mercy on us, Son of David. There were many robbers in Jericho who used to attack and harm those who were coming in and going out of Jerusalem; therefore the Lord came to Jericho with his disciples, to heal the wounded and to bring a large crowd with him. Finally, after they want to leave from Jericho, a large crowd followed him. If he had stayed in Jerusalem and never descended to the lowly things, the crowd would still be sitting in darkness and in the shadow of death until today. But there were also two blind men by the road. He calls blind those who could not yet speak: In your light we will see light (Ps. XXXV, 10). Along the road, because they seemed to have knowledge of the Law: but they were ignorant of the way, which is Christ: whom most understand as the Pharisees and Sadducees, and others as both the people, the old Testament and the New: because one, following the written Law, was blind without Christ. Because they could not see by themselves, they heard the proclamations of the Savior, and confessed him as the son of David. But if both blind men are referred to the Jewish people, what follows, 'The crowd rebuked them,' should be understood in relation to the Gentiles: whom the Apostle warns not to boast and be arrogant against their own root (Rom. 11); but since they themselves were grafted in by the error of those before them from the wild olive tree into the good olive tree, they should by no means envy the salvation of those before them. Have mercy on us, O son of David. They are reproached by the crowds, and yet they do not remain silent: but rather they repeat the same thing more frequently, so that they may show the desire for the fullness of true light.
