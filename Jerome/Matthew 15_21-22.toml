(Verse 21, 22) And Jesus went out from there and withdrew to the parts of Tyre and Sidon. And behold, a Canaanite woman came out from those territories and cried out to him, saying. He leaves behind the scribes and the Pharisees who accuse him, and he goes into the parts of Tyre and Sidon, in order to care for the Tyrians and Sidonians. But the Canaanite woman goes out from her former territories, in order to fervently plead for her daughter's healing. Note that in the fifteenth place, the daughter of the Canaanite woman is healed.



Have mercy on me, Lord, son of David. For He knew how to call upon the son of David, because she had already gone out of her borders, and had abandoned the error of the Tyrians and Sidonians by changing their place and faith.

My daughter is being tormented by an evil spirit. I think the Canaanite people believed that those who were tormented by evil spirits were ignorant of the Creator and worshipped stones.
