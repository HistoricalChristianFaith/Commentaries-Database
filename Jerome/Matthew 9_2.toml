They brought to him, as we said before, a second paralytic lying on a pallet because he was unable to enter. “And Jesus, seeing” not the “faith” of him who was brought forward but of those who were bringing him forward, said to the paralytic, “Take heart, my son, your sins are forgiven you.” O wonderful humility! He addresses as “son” this abject and infirm paralytic with disjointed members whom the priests did not stoop to touch. A son, indeed, because his sins are forgiven him. In line with the biblical metaphor, a soul lying in its body with all the strength of its members gone is brought for healing to the perfect Doctor, the Lord. If the soul is healed through his mercy, it will receive strength enough to immediately take up its pallet.
