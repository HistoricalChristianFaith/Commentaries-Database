It could be argued that both should be referred to both, that is, both grace and peace apply no less to God the Father than to our Lord Jesus Christ. Or it could be argued that each should be referred to each, so that grace is referred to God the Father and peace to Christ. It is more likely the latter, since the words immediately following are to the praise of the glory of God’s grace. Thus the “grace” of the Father lies in his willingness to send the Son for our salvation, while the “peace” of the Son lies in the fact that we are reconciled to the Father through him.
