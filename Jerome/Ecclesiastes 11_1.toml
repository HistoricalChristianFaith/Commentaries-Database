"Send
your bread upon the waters, for after many days you will find it." He
encourages to mercy since it must be given to all that seek wisdom, and work
well. For just as he sows over the
well-watered fields and awaits the produce of his seed, so too he who is
generous to the needy does not sow the grain of his seed, but bread itself. And he waits for it to grow into his future
profit; and when the day of judgement comes much more will be found to have
grown than was at first sown. 
Differently: in each and every man you can see this water, about which
is said, "rivers flow from his stomach, the waters of life" [Ioh. 7, 38.],
lest it should trouble you to display the bread of life, the bread of
reasoning, and of speech. For if you do
this many times you will find that you have not sown the seeds of doctrine in
vain. I think that this is what is
written in Isaiah too: "blessed is he who sows across the water, where the
ox and ass trample" [Is. 32, 20.]. This is also because that teacher (about whom
we have already spoken), is held to be worthy of blessing, because he sows
across the well-watered hearts of his listeners, the hearts of the Jews, as
those of the gentiles in the gathered congregation.
