The same allegorical interpretation applies both to Christ and to the church, that Adam is to prefigure Christ and Eve the church. For “the last Adam was made a lifegiving spirit.” Just as the whole human race is born from Adam and his wife, so the whole multitude of believers has been born of Christ and the church.
