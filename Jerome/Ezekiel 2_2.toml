(Vers. 2.) And the Spirit entered into me after He spoke to me and set me on my feet. And I heard Him speaking to me, saying: Son of man. LXX: And the Spirit came upon me, and took me up, and raised me, and set me on my feet: and I heard Him speaking to me, and He said to me: Son of man. The divine word had commanded the prophet and had said: Stand on your feet (Psalm XXXIX, 3); but he could not stand without the help of God and the coming of the Holy Spirit: therefore, the Spirit enters into him, or assumes and raises him up, so that he may stand firmly and be able to say: He set my feet on a rock (Ephesians VI, 14). We do not read of any sinner standing, but it is said to the saints: Therefore, gird your loins. However, the sinner deserves to hear what is written in Deuteronomy: The sole of your foot shall have no steadiness  (Deut. XXVIII, 56) . It is frequently said to Ezekiel: Son of man  (Matth. VIII, 20) , and rarely to Daniel: both referring to the one who said: The Son of Man has nowhere to lay His head, He consoles the captive people, and draws them towards repentance.
