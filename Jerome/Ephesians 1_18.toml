His phrase “eyes of the heart” clearly refers to those things we cannot understand without sense and intelligence.… Faith sees beyond what the physical eyes see. Physical eyes are in the heads of not only the wise but the unwise.

It is not without effort that we come to “know the hope of our calling and the riches of God’s inheritance in the saints.” This effort in fact comes in response to that renewing gift which God himself gives in the glorious resurrection of his own Son. This gift he gives not once but continually.… Every day Christ rises from the dead. Every day he is raised in the penitent.
