(Verse 30, 31.) Astonishment and wonders were done on the earth. The prophets were prophesying falsehood (or wickedness) and the priests were applauding with their hands. And my people loved such things. What then will you do in the end? As it was said before: Shall I go to the nobles and speak to them? Perhaps they knew the way of the Lord, but behold, they have broken the yoke and burst the bonds. Now he describes who the nobles are, namely the prophets and priests: some of whom prophesy future events, and others decree what must be done according to the law. And behold, he said, when they, the false prophets, prophesied falsehood, the priests applauded with their hands. And in order to show that even the people are not without guilt, being led astray by such things, it is written: And my people loved such things: once mine; but after they loved such things, they ceased to be mine. So what will they do when the last time of judgment comes, or the necessity of captivity? Hence the astonishment and marvels, that neither among the rulers nor among the people was there found anyone who understood what is right.
