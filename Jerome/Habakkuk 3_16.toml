He who is cautious and wary can avoid sins for a while, but he who is secure in his own justice opposes God, and deprived of his help, he is subject to the snares of the enemy. “Let rottenness,” says Habakkuk, “enter into my bones and swarm under me, that I may rest in the day of tribulation, that I may go up to my people that are girded.” He prays earnestly for tribulations and trials and affliction of soul so that, in the next world, he may join the company of those who are already reigning with Christ. It is clear from all this that here, in this life, there is strife and contention, and, in the next world, there is victory.
