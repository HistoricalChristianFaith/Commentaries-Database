It is commanded by the law that we do no servile work on the sabbath, that we not light a fire, that we remain seated in one place and that we perform only those works that pertain to the salvation of the soul. Yet, should we receive this according to the letter, it would not be able to be fulfilled perfectly. For who is able to do this, sitting in one place for the entire day and night without moving even slightly, lest he become a transgressor of the law? From this one commandment, therefore, which is impossible to fulfill literally, we are also compelled to understand the others in a spiritual manner, lest we destroy the liberty of the soul by doing servile work. For “whoever commits sin is a slave to sin”; so let us not bear a burden on the sabbath, as did the one who said, “My iniquities have been raised above my head and are on me like an unbearable burden.” Neither should this iniquity that weighs more than lead have power over us, nor should the lustful desire of the body inflame us, for the hearts of all adulterers are like furnaces. …But this promise, “Honor your father and mother, and you will live a long life on the land,” is hardly able to stand according to the letter. For many honor their parents and die quickly, whereas others who commit patricide live for a long time. But that we may know with certainty that this land of which he speaks lies above, let us recall briefly the thirty-sixth psalm, in which it is written, “The meek will possess the land and rejoice in an abundance of peace,” which is followed by “Wait upon the Lord and keep his ways and he will elevate you to possess the land,” about which it is sung in another place, “The just will possess the land and live on it forever.” But this is impossible. For even if the land in which we currently dwell passes over, how will the just live on it forever? Hence, we learn from this that the land in question must be situated above.…
So also in the resurrection, “they neither marry nor are given in marriage but are like the angels because they are sons of the resurrection.” The apostle likewise says about food and the stomach: “Food is made for the stomach and the stomach for food, but God will destroy both of them.” Thus, how will we, with incorrupt and spiritual and immortal bodies, seek again the vices of the former flesh, which was corrupt and mortal? We say these things not to deny the glorification of the body’s substance but thoroughly to eradicate the former works of those who are like the angels. By contrast, we who imitate angelic virtues while still in this body, through fasting and continence and perpetual chastity and charity, nevertheless do not lose the substance of our bodies.

(Verse 13.) If you turn your foot away from the Sabbath, and do your own will on my holy day, and call the Sabbath a delight, and holy to the glorious Lord, and honor him by not doing your own ways, nor finding your own will, nor speaking idle words. LXX: If you turn your foot away on the Sabbaths, so as not to do your own desires on the holy day. And you shall call the Sabbaths delightful and holy to the Lord: you shall not lift up your foot for work, nor shall you speak a word ÷ in anger from your mouth. To whom he had said above: Is not this the fast that I have chosen? loose the bands of wickedness, undo the bundles that oppress, and the like: even now he promises rewards if he will do what follows (Exod. 20); that is, that he restrain his foot on the sabbaths, and not do his own will, and that he profane not the holy day of the Lord with his own will (or lusts). It is written in the law, that we should not do servile work on the sabbaths, nor kindle fire, nor sit in one place only, but that we should do those works only which pertain to the salvation of the soul. But if we take it literally, it cannot be completely fulfilled. For who can do this, that sitting all day and night on the Sabbath, does not move from one place, indeed, does not even move slightly? And if he does, would he not be a transgressor of the law? Therefore, from one commandment, which is impossible to be taken literally, we are compelled to understand the rest in a spiritual sense, so that we do not perform servile work and lose the freedom of the soul. For whoever commits sin is the servant of sin (John 8): let us not bear the burden on the Sabbath, such as the burden borne by him who says, My iniquities are raised above my head: they are like a heavy burden pressed down upon me (Psalm 38, 5). Let not the wickedness that sits upon the talent of lead have power over us; nor let bodily pleasure and lust prevail. (Zech. 5); For they all commit adultery, and their hearts are like an oven. (Hosea 7); And the fiery darts of the devil are cast, to shoot straight at those with a righteous heart in darkness. (Ps. 10); It is also commanded to us that, having taken hold of the plow, we do not look back; that, ascending the height of the roofs, we do not wish to come down to remove the garments of the world. (Luke 9); but rather that we hear with Moses, 'But you stand here with me' (Exod. 34, 2); and that we sit with the Lord, weary on the way of this world, by the well of the Samaritan woman, desiring the conversion and salvation of the erring. (John 4); that we hear the Apostle admonishing, 'Stand firm and immovable' (1 Cor. 15, 58); that we not suffer what Judas, the traitor, suffered, who lost his place of ministry, and became a transgressor, and that we always remember his words: 'If the spirit of the one who has power ascends over you, do not abandon your place' (Eccles. 10, 4). Here lies one who rests on the Sabbath, washing his hands among the innocent, not moving his feet to carry out his own desires: this person celebrates the delicate Sabbath of the Lord. Sabbath-keeping, as written in the Letter to the Hebrews, is promised to us in heaven, and glory is prepared (Hebrews 4): so that while we do not follow our own ways on the Sabbath, and our own will is not found, we may speak words by which we do not sin in deed or in speech. Otherwise, if these things are only prohibited on the Sabbath, then on the other six days freedom is given to us to commit wrong. But if it is foolish to believe this, it remains that the Sabbath, which is interpreted as rest, should be sanctified at all times by the faithful, while they do the will of not the flesh, but the soul. And what is added, according to the Septuagint, 'in wrath from your mouth', is not found in the Hebrew. For this Sabbath, to be celebrated with all festivity, the Savior calls us in the Gospel, saying: Come to me, all you who labor and are burdened, and I will give you rest (Matthew 11:28); for this signifies 'I will refresh you', so that laying aside the burdens of sins, we may rest in Christ, and say: He has set my feet upon a rock (Psalm 40:3), and avoid that which the holy one says he almost endured: My feet were almost moved (Psalm 73:2).
