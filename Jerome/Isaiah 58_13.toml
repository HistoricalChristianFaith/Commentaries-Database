It is commanded by the law that we do no servile work on the sabbath, that we not light a fire, that we remain seated in one place and that we perform only those works that pertain to the salvation of the soul. Yet, should we receive this according to the letter, it would not be able to be fulfilled perfectly. For who is able to do this, sitting in one place for the entire day and night without moving even slightly, lest he become a transgressor of the law? From this one commandment, therefore, which is impossible to fulfill literally, we are also compelled to understand the others in a spiritual manner, lest we destroy the liberty of the soul by doing servile work. For “whoever commits sin is a slave to sin”; so let us not bear a burden on the sabbath, as did the one who said, “My iniquities have been raised above my head and are on me like an unbearable burden.” Neither should this iniquity that weighs more than lead have power over us, nor should the lustful desire of the body inflame us, for the hearts of all adulterers are like furnaces. …But this promise, “Honor your father and mother, and you will live a long life on the land,” is hardly able to stand according to the letter. For many honor their parents and die quickly, whereas others who commit patricide live for a long time. But that we may know with certainty that this land of which he speaks lies above, let us recall briefly the thirty-sixth psalm, in which it is written, “The meek will possess the land and rejoice in an abundance of peace,” which is followed by “Wait upon the Lord and keep his ways and he will elevate you to possess the land,” about which it is sung in another place, “The just will possess the land and live on it forever.” But this is impossible. For even if the land in which we currently dwell passes over, how will the just live on it forever? Hence, we learn from this that the land in question must be situated above.…
So also in the resurrection, “they neither marry nor are given in marriage but are like the angels because they are sons of the resurrection.” The apostle likewise says about food and the stomach: “Food is made for the stomach and the stomach for food, but God will destroy both of them.” Thus, how will we, with incorrupt and spiritual and immortal bodies, seek again the vices of the former flesh, which was corrupt and mortal? We say these things not to deny the glorification of the body’s substance but thoroughly to eradicate the former works of those who are like the angels. By contrast, we who imitate angelic virtues while still in this body, through fasting and continence and perpetual chastity and charity, nevertheless do not lose the substance of our bodies.
