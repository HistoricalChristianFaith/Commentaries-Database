(Verse 27, 28.) And when the wicked turns away from his wickedness that he has done and does judgment and righteousness, he shall keep himself alive. For he considers and turns away from all his transgressions that he has committed; he shall surely live, he shall not die. On the other hand, it says, the people of the nations who do not have knowledge of God and the wicked, if he turns away from his wickedness, which he previously practiced in idolatry, and does the things that are commanded by the law of Israel, he who was previously dead will give life to his soul. And seeing that he has perished in the injustices he has wrought, he will believe in him who says: I am the way, the truth, and the life (John, XIV, 6): he will live and not die.
