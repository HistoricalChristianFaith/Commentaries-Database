(Verse 22.) And the sons of Lotan were Hori and Homam, and Lotan's sister was Timna. This is Timna, of whom it was said above. And Timna was the concubine of Eliphaz, the firstborn son of Esau, and from her was born Amalek. Now it is worth noting that the Horites, because the firstborn sons of Esau took their concubines as wives. And as for the names that are mentioned, Teman and Kenaz and Amalek, and so on: we will learn later the regions of the Edomites from which these names were derived.
