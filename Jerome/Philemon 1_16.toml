No one is an eternal owner of his slave; for his power and the status of both persons are terminated by death. But Onesimus, who has been made eternal from his faith in Christ, after receiving the spirit of freedom, begins to be no longer a slave, but a brother in place of a slave, a most dear brother, and eternal brother of Philemon.
