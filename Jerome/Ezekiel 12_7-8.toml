(Vers. 7, 8.) So I did as he commanded me: I brought out my belongings like the belongings of someone going into exile during the day, and in the evening I dug a hole in the wall with my own hands. In the darkness I went out, and on my shoulders I carried myself in their sight. LXX: And I did exactly as he commanded me: during the day I brought out my belongings like the belongings of a captive, and in the evening I dug a hole in the wall with my own hands, and I went out in hiding. I was carried on the shoulders in their sight. He testifies that he has completed the work that was ordered above, and does not need interpretation according to both opinions, as has been explained above. However, it should be noted that at the same time, Jeremiah prophesied in Jerusalem, and Ezekiel in Babylon, and his prophecy was sent to the captives; and the prophecy of the former was sent to those who lived in Jerusalem; so that by the providence of God, the unity of the two could be proven in different regions, and those who heard it would understand that whatever happened to the people was not by the power of idols, but by the command of the Lord.
