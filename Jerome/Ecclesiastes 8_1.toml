"Who is like the wise man? And who knows what things mean? A man's wisdom lights up his face, and the
boldness of his face is transformed. "He had taught above that it is hard to find
a good man, and he had answered the question to the contrary, saying that men
are made good by God, but that they fall into sin because of their own free
will. Now he lists what qualities God
has given to a good man, to show his glory: wisdom obviously, and reason and
providence, and he knows that the secrets that are hidden by God enter his
heart. But he is also talking about
himself here indirectly, because no one was as wise as Solomon was, and none
answered the problems he set. And
because his wisdom was praised by all, wisdom which he not only carried on the
inside, but also wore on the surface of his skin, and which shone from his
face, he moreover imbued all men with the wisdom which shone forth from his
visage. Where we have, 'who is like the
wise man?' the Septuagint reads: "who knows wise men?" and where we
read, 'the boldness of his face is transformed', the Septuagint has, "and
the unwise is disliked by his face". 
And although in fact there are many, who engage themselves in the
pursuit of wisdom, it is found with great difficulty, but he is able to tell a
wise man though from those, who only seem to be wise. Though too there are even many more, who say
that they are able to let themselves tell the secrets of the Scriptures, it is
not common however, that one will actually find the true answer. But what follows- "the wisdom of a man
will light up his face and the wicked is hated by his face" - can be
explained in the way that Paul explains it: "but we all see the glory of
God with our face uncovered" [II Cor. 3, 18.]. The writer of the Psalms also says, "the
light of your face shines down upon us, O Lord" [Ps. 4,7.]. But he says that the wisdom of man is not
different from the wisdom of God. 
Although it is the wisdom of God, it then begins to be also a part of
the human faculty, but only when it is in him who merits wisdom. Every heretic, who defends his false
doctrines, shows his foolishness on his face. 
Then Marcion and Valentinus say that they are of a better nature than
the Creator himself! This can be seen in
another way, if they contend to hope for this wisdom, but do not already
possess it.
