"All
this have I seen; and I applied my mind to see every deed that is done under
the sun: there is a time when one man rules over another to his detriment. And then I saw the wicked buried and newly
come while those who had done right were gone from the Holy place and were
forgotten in the city. This too is
vanity! Because the sentence for
wrong-doing is not executed quickly- that is why men are encouraged to do evil. "I have dedicated my heart, he says, that I should see
all that is done under the sun, and this too, that man takes up arms against
man, so that he afflicts and condemns those whom he wants. And so when I began to look upon those things
I saw that the impious were dead by such belief and buried, and were deemed
holy in the earth, but those who were living were thought to be worthy of the
Church, and the temple of God, the bombastic walking above were praised for
their wickedness. "For the sinner is praised for the laxity of his soul,
and he who is wicked is blessed" [Ps. 9,24.]. But this happens moreover because no one
dares to confront sinners and God does not immediately give punishment for
crimes, but rather postpones, so that we must await our repentance. But since those who sin are not immediately
arrested and accused, they think with little regard that their judgement will
be in the future, and continue in their crime. 
We can see how this evidence pertains to certain bishops, who come to
power in the Church, and speak ill of those, which had taught and had urged
them to follow better pursuits. These
men are very often praised after death in the Church, and blessed for those
things, which they in all likelihood did not even do, or openly are warned by
their successors or the congregation. 
And even this is vanity, since while they live they do not heed advice
and are not immediately visited for their sins, (since none dares accuse his
superior), besides they act as if holy and blessed, and as if they are walking
in the precepts of the Lord, and they increase their sins one on top of
another. Such an accusation of a bishop
is difficult. For you see, if he has
sinned, it is not believed, and if he is accused, he is not punished.
