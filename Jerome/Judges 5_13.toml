(Judges 5:13) Then the remnants of the people were saved. This sentence is to be connected to the previous sentence, which says: Where the righteousness of the Lord is told, the strength of Israel's mercy; because then the remnants of the people were saved. The Lord fought in the strongholds. In Hebrew it is written: The Lord fought for me in the strongholds. And this is the voice of all the people of Israel; for He fought for them against the Egyptians and against the other enemies of Israel. Unde et sequitur.
