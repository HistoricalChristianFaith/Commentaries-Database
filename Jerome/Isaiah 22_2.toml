(Version 2.) Full of cries, a bustling city, a rejoicing community. The city is filled with those crying out, the bustling city is rejoicing. The teaching of the heretics is not in meaning, but in many words and clamor. Therefore, because of the multitude of the deceived, the city is called bustling and rejoicing, because of their pride. For they are inflated and boast that they have found more sacred things.

Those who were killed were not killed by the sword, nor did they die in battle. Seventy: Those who were wounded were not wounded by the sword, nor did your dead die in battle. The majority, without any struggle or disagreement, is taken in by the deceptions of the heretics, and this is the very large crowd. Therefore, those who were killed, or as the Septuagint translated, those wounded in the valley of Zion, were not killed, and those wounded by the sword, but of their own free will, they went over to the heretics, and in comparison to those who were defeated after the battle, he who surrendered willingly was more unfortunate, and he was wounded and killed. How much more in martyrdom is he who, after suffering punishment, gave his hand, a lesser punishment than he who, without any necessity and pain of torment, denied Christ.
