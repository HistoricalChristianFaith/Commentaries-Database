(Verse 54) But the centurion and those who were with him, guarding Jesus, when they saw the earthquake and the things that were happening, were very afraid, saying: Truly, this was the Son of God. In another Gospel, after the earthquake, a more clear cause of the centurion's miracle is explained: when he saw him breathe his last, he said: Truly, this was the Son of God. For no one has the power to dismiss the spirit except the one who is the creator of souls. But in this place, let us understand spirit as the soul, either because it constitutes a spiritual and vital body, or because the substance of the soul itself is a spirit, according to what is written: 'You will take away their spirit, and they will die' (Psalm 103:29). And it should be considered that the centurion, before the cross, truly confesses the Son of God in the scandal of his passion, while Arius preaches a creature in the Church.
