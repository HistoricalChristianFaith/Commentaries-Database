(Chapter 49, verse 3) Reuben, my firstborn, you are my strength and the first of my sons, tough in bearing and tough in insolence and injury, like water that does not boil. You went up on your father's bed, then you defiled it when you went up. In Hebrew it is written: Reuben, my firstborn, you are my strength, and the first in power among my sons. Greater in carrying, and greater in strength. You are poured out like water, do not exceed. For you have ascended the bed of your father and defiled the couch in his ascent. The meaning here is: You are my firstborn, greater among the children, and you were supposed to receive, according to the order of your birth, the inheritance that was rightfully due to the firstborn, and to receive the priesthood and the kingdom. This is clearly demonstrated by the burden you carry and your mighty strength. However, because you have sinned, and like water that cannot be contained in a vessel, you have been poured out by the force of pleasure. Therefore, I command you not to sin further and to be among your brothers, enduring the punishment for the sin that you have committed, which is the loss of your status as the firstborn.
