(Verse 32 and 33.) I will pass through all your flock today: separate from it all the variegated and discolored animals: and all the animals of one color will be lambs and the variegated and discolored ones will be goats, they will be my reward: and my justice will be answered to me the next day, when my reward comes before you: everything that is not variegated and discolored among the goats and lambs, will be considered as theft to me, and so on. The meaning of this passage has been greatly confused among the Septuagint Interpreters, and until today I have not been able to find any clear explanation from our scholars regarding what is meant in this passage. I will serve you, Jacob, he said, seven more years, do what I demand. Separate all the speckled and spotted, both the sheep and the goats, and give them into the hands of your sons. And from the entire flock, the white and the black animals, that is, of one color, give them to me. So if anything speckled or spotted, which are of one color, is born, it will be mine; but if anything of one color is born, it will be yours. I ask for a not difficult thing. Nature makes it so that white offspring are born from white animals, and black offspring are born from black ones: my justice will be with me, as long as God looks at my humility and labor. He eagerly seized the opportunity given by Laban, and, doing as Jacob requested, separated Jacob and his sons with a three-day journey, so that no deceitful child would be born from near the flock. Therefore, Jacob devised a new strategy and fought against the natural order of white and black livestock with his cunning. For he made three rods, of poplar, almond and pomegranate, even though the Seventy had storax, walnut and plane tree rods, partly stripping the bark, to create a variety of rod colors, so that wherever he left the bark on the rod, the ancient color would remain; but where he removed the bark, a bright color would be revealed. So Jacob observed that at the time when the flocks were mating, and after the heat of the day, when they were thirsty and eager to drink, he would place the discolored rods in the troughs. And as the rams and goats came to drink, driven by their intense desire, he would make them mate, so that from this double longing, as they eagerly drank and were mounted by the males, they would conceive offspring resembling the shadows of the rams and goats as they ascended from above in the mirror of the water. For when men and women have experienced those of varied color in the bedding, it is not surprising that this is the nature of women, that they give birth to offspring resembling those they have seen or imagined in the heat of extreme pleasure; this is said to also happen among herds of mares in Spain. And Quintilian, in a controversy where a matron was accused of giving birth to an Ethiopian, argues in defense of her that this is the nature of conceptions, as we have mentioned above. But when the kids were born, and various lambs of different colors from white and solid color herds, Jacob separated them and made them be far from the original flock. But if any were born of one color, that is, white or black, he would give them into the hands of Laban's sons, and he would place the peeled rods in the troughs where the water was poured out, and they would come to drink opposite the animals, so that they would conceive at the time when they came to drink.
