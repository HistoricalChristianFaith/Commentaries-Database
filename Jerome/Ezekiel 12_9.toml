(Verse 9) And the word of the Lord came to me in the morning, saying: Son of man, did not the house of Israel, the house of rebellion, say to you, 'What are you doing?' Say to them: Thus says the Lord God. If the rebellious house, they say, asks you, 'Why are you doing this?' Or even if they do not ask, you go, so that they may know why you have done these things. Say to them: Thus says the Lord God.
