(Verse 13 and following) But the Levites shall have a portion like the priests, consisting of twenty-five thousand cubits in length and ten thousand cubits in width; the whole length shall be twenty-five thousand cubits and the width ten thousand cubits. They shall not sell any of it or exchange it, nor shall the firstfruits of the land be taken away from it, for they are holy to the Lord. The remaining five thousand cubits in width, along the twenty-five thousand, shall be for common use by the city for dwellings and common land, and the city shall be in the middle of it. What we translate as 'profane', Aquila translated as 'βέβηλον', Symmachus and Theodotion translated as 'λαἳκὸν'; the LXX used 'προτείχισμα' which can also be translated as 'antemurale'. 'Profane' and 'laicum' are both secular, that is, common, and can be used by all people everywhere. However, what the LXX said: 'It will not be measured, nor will it be taken away,' is clear that it does not have the same meaning as what we said: 'It will not be changed, nor will it be transferred.' The possession of the Levites is also described, which is indeed adjacent to the territories of the priests, and it has the same dimensions in length and breadth according to the number of Levites, which has the same number as the priests, but it uses its own boundaries and understands itself to be separate from the priestly rank: to remove the pride of the ministers, who, ignorant of the humility of their position, swell up beyond the priests, that is, the elders, and think of themselves as having dignity not by merit, but by wealth. Certainly, the one who is the first among ministers, because he preaches to the people individually and does not depart from the side of the Pontiff, considers it an injury if he is ordained a presbyter. And he does not remember that he is a minister of the altars and widows, entrusted not only to the service and ministry of the priests, but also to the widows and the poor. And they shall not sell, he says, nor exchange, so that the eternal possession of the Levitical distribution may remain, nor shall the worthiness of dignity be overcome by price, nor shall we transfer from one to another: for what has been sanctified to the Lord belongs not to those to whom it has been given, but to Him in whose name it is possessed. However, the remaining five thousand in width, by twenty-five thousand, is understood to be the length, will be profane of the city: so that it is lawful for all the Israelites and every member of the people to dwell there; not because they are unclean or because anything in the habitation of the holy land is contaminated, putrid, and filthy; but because, apart from the priests, it is permitted for everyone to dwell in them. By this we understand that all the things we refer to as sensations, that is, bodily pleasures that we perceive by sight, hearing, touch, smell, and taste, are profane and do not have the sanctity of the temple, nor do they have the privilege of the priesthood, but rather they belong to the realm of the laity and commoners. However, the city will be in the middle, concerning which it is written: The stream of the river makes the city of God glad (Ps. 46:4). And: A city set on a hill cannot be hidden (Matthew 5:14): of which we will speak in the following. Προτείχισμα, which means a fortification, and διάστημα, which means a space, which the LXX translated as suburbs, we do not know the meaning they have in this place.
