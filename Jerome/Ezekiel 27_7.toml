(Verse 7.) Fine linen woven from Egypt was made into a veil for you, to be placed in a chest. Hyacinth and purple from the isles of Elisha became your covering. LXX: Fine linen woven with variety from Egypt was made into a bedspread for you, to surround you with glory, and to cover you with hyacinth and purple. Your coverings were made from the isles of Elisha. Because Tyre had said, 'I am perfect in beauty,' she is accused of receiving things from various regions, according to the Scripture: 'What do you have that you did not receive?' But if you have received it, why do you boast as if you have not received it? Therefore, it is described what each province should send, according to that passage from Virgil's Georgics, book I.

India sends ivory: the soft Sabaeans their frankincense: hard iron from the Chalybes, and men from Pontus skilled in beaver-traps, etc. In Egypt, linen is produced in great abundance, from which the sail of the Tyrian ship is woven, which is hung from the mast, and its covering, which provides shade for sailors and passengers in the heat and calm of the sun, is made of hyacinth and purple; these are from the Elisa Islands, which are so called from the Ionian Sea. Furthermore, next to the Septuagint, they weave in layers of linen, and they cover the Tyrian ship with veils, so that it may be more glorious with these coverings, and it may have a more beautiful appearance being surrounded by a garment. But linen is made from the earth, because it originates from the earth, and the hyacinth from the air, the purple from the sea from which it is produced, with the addition of double-dyed scarlet, with which the vestments of the Pontiff are woven, we often remind that they signify the four elements: earth, fire, air, and water, from which all things consist, which Tyre assumes for itself, not using them with gratitude as creatures of God, but saying: I am the perfect beauty: or, I have surrounded myself with beauty.
