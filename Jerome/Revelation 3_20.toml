On the other hand, God may permit us also to be kings of the earth, “kings of earth” in order to rule over our own flesh. In this connection the apostle says, “Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body.” In another part of Scripture it is written, “The king’s heart is in the hand of God.” … The kings, therefore, are the saints, and their hearts are in the hand of the Lord. Let us beg God to make us kings that we may rule over our flesh that it be subject to us. The following words of the apostle are appropriate here: “But I chastise my body and bring it into subjection, lest perhaps after preaching to others, I myself should be rejected.” May our soul be in command, our body in subjection; then Christ will come at once to make his abode with us. What does he himself say in the New Testament? “Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If any man listens to my voice and opens the door to me, I will come in to him and will sup with him.” Every day, Christ stands at the door of our hearts. He longs to enter. Let us open wide our hearts to him. Then he will come in and be our host and guest. He will live in us and eat with us.
