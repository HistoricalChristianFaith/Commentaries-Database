(Verse 5.) And in the midst of it is the likeness of four living creatures, and this is their appearance: the likeness of a human in them. And what follows, And there is a brightness in it, should be noted with a mark. Unless the Scripture had added, saying: That is, from the midst of the fire, because of the ambiguity of the word, we might have erred and thought that the appearance or vision was of lightning in the midst of the wind or of a spirit. Therefore, it should be understood that in the midst of the fire and torments of God, there is a likeness of lightning, which is more precious than gold and silver. So after judgment and torments, which seem sad and hard to those who endure them, the more precious brightness of lightning appears, while the providence of God governs all things, and what is thought to be punishment is actually medicine.
