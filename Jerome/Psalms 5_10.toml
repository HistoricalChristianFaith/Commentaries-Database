Those who refuse to know the Father, let them experience the Judge.… And how? The answer follows: “Let them fall by their own devices.” … Excellently said, … for heretics change or alter their doctrine from day to day. In fact, if a theologian learned in the Scriptures contends with them, overwhelming them with proof from the sacred books, what do they do but straightway look around in search of a new doctrine? They do not seek knowledge for the sake of salvation but look around for new doctrine to vanquish the opponent.… Let them fall by their own countless contrivances, and let them have but one recourse, you, my God.… You are, O Lord, sweet by nature, but sinners and heretics change the sweetness of your nature into bitterness of their evil devices.
