(Verse 24 and following) 'And he led me to the south gate, and behold, there was a gate that faced south. And its frontispiece and vestibule were measured according to the upper measurements, and its windows and vestibules all around were like the other windows. It had a length of fifty cubits, and a width of twenty-five cubits, and it was ascended by seven steps, and there was a vestibule in front of its doors, and palm trees were carved on it, one on one side, and the other on the other side in front of it.' And the entrance of the inner court was on the south side, and it measured from entrance to entrance on the south side, one hundred cubits. And he brought me to the inner court by the south gate, and he measured the south gate according to the same measurements, its rooms, its doorway, and its vestibule, with the same measurements. And the vestibules all around the court were fifty cubits in length and twenty-five cubits in width. And a vestibule in a circular shape, with a length of twenty-five cubits and a width of five cubits. And its vestibule was towards the outer court, and its palm trees were on its front, and it had eight steps by which it was ascended. Seventy agree in the same words, except for thee, elau, elamoth, and elam, which in Hebrew is ulam. But thee is interpreted as threshold or front; elau, around it or supports; elamoth, entrance or vestibule; ulam is πρόπυλον, that is, before the doors. But what we have placed next to the Hebrew, that is, the vestibule or πρόπυλον, is not found in the Septuagint. But it should also be noted that in the southern gate it is not called a road according to the Septuagint, but simply 'and he led me to the south,' and behold, a gate that faced south. Therefore, through each entrance, Ezekiel, whose name means 'God strengthens,' is led. And from the northern gate, he goes to the southern gate, whose fronts, thresholds, τροπύλαια, or vestibules, and windows had similar measurements around, twenty-five cubits in length and five cubits in width. And it was ascended by seven steps, that is, to the southern gate and its vestibule, which is called elamoth, in front of its doors. Also, two carved palm trees, which we mentioned in the gate of the northern region. And let this be enough to remind you, that whatever is presented there, according to the more common understanding, that is, according to the literal sense, we understand at the south gate according to the spiritual sense. For in the same lines, both history and tropology run: but the former is lowly, the latter is sublime: the former clings to the earth, the latter soars to the heavens. And all things were filled with light around through the windows. For each problem has its own limits, and through them the light of faith enters the soul of the believer, especially if the length of his life has been extended to fifty years, that is, to the mystery of jubilee, and he is able to reach the breadth of a more divine understanding. In this latitude and on these streets, wisdom moves confidently, and with a lofty voice she exclaims: she climbs seven steps in order to reach the vestibule, and through the palms of her purpose and efforts, she holds eternal victory. And lest we think there is only one atrium to the south, it is said about the second atrium: And the entrance of the inner atrium is on the southern road: and it is measured from the entrance to the entrance on the southern road one hundred cubits; so that after a week and the sacraments of the old covenant, she may reach the good land and the grace of the Gospel. Not only is there a second atrium in the southern gate, but also a third, which is now called: 'And he brought me to the inner atrium at the southern gate, and he measured the gate according to the upper measurements, etc. For each atrium has its own measurements and arrangement, and in these measurements there is a different grace, as we know the same things differently at the beginning, in progress, and at the end. However, what is not found in the Septuagint, and the vestibule, or πρόπυλον, around twenty-five cubits long and five cubits wide, seems to raise a question, because it was not placed in the ancient interpretation, how twenty-five cubits and five are placed after the progress of the third step.' But it removes the ambiguity that follows: And its vestibule is towards the outer courtyard, and its palms are at the front; so that this courtyard, which had a length of twenty-five cubits and a width of five, belongs not to the inner courtyard but to the outer courtyard, so that the width of the former courtyard, that is, twenty-five cubits, is possessed by the length of the outer courtyard, and it holds a width of five cubits. These measurements, that is, twenty-five and five, we refer to the same senses, namely sight, hearing, taste, smell, and touch, which if we ascend to higher things, we double by fivefold and make them spiritual from carnal senses, as it is written: Lift up your eyes and see that the fields are already white for harvest (John 4:35), and: He who has ears to hear, let him hear (Luke 8:8). And: Taste and see, for the Lord is sweet (Psalm 33:8). And: We are the good fragrance of Christ to God among those who believe (2 Corinthians 2:15). And in the Epistle of John it is said: That which we have heard and seen, and our hands have touched, concerning the Word of life (1 John 1:1). And finally, in no way are only seven degrees sufficient in the northern region: but after seven, the number eight is added, as we move from the Synagogue to the Church, from the old covenant to the new, from earthly things to heavenly things.
