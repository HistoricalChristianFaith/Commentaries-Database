Some understand this passage to be about the Savior in particular, because he was deeply saddened for a while over the sins of the world, saying, “My soul is sorrowful to the point of death.” And the Father struck him, who said through Zechariah, “I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.” … God also averted his face from the Savior, so that he could accept the “form of a servant” for a time and walk in sadness, mourning the sins of the people and deploring and lamenting Jerusalem. Because the Father saw the road he was traveling, he healed him who was “forsaken among the dead.”
