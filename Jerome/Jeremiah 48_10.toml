“Awake, lyre and harp.” O psaltery, O harp, you were made and fashioned to give praise to God; awake my harp and give praise; why do you lie idle? O monk, you are standing there in body; why is your soul listless, why are you not chanting praises to the Lord? “Cursed is one who is remiss in doing the Lord’s work.” If you are a psaltery, if you are a harp, why are you so mute and not glorifying God? “I will wake the dawn.” There is not blessing and praising God in darkness but only in light. I am going to say something startling. Even if we arise in the nighttime, we are blessing God in light. For the Christian, it is never night; for the Christian, the sun of justice is ever rising.
