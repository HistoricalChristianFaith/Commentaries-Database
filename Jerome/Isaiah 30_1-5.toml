(Chapter 30, Verse 1 and following) Woe to the rebellious children, says the Lord, who make plans that are not from me, who weave a web without my Spirit, adding sin upon sin. You who walk to go down to Egypt, without consulting me, hoping for help from Pharaoh's strength and relying on the protection of Egypt's shadow. But Pharaoh's strength will be your shame, and the trust in Egypt's shadow will bring you disgrace. For there will be princes in Tanis, and your messengers have reached Hanes. All are confounded over a people that cannot profit them: they were not a help, but for confusion and for a reproach. Woe to the rebellious children, saith the Lord, who have taken counsel, and not of me; and have made a league, but not by my spirit, that they might add sin to sin: Who walk to go down into Egypt, and have not asked at my mouth; to strengthen themselves in the strength of Pharaoh, and to trust in the shadow of Egypt. There will be protection from Pharaoh for you, but it will lead to confusion; and those who trust in Egypt will be put to shame. For there are princes in Zoan, and their messengers are evil. They will labor in vain to help the people, for it will not benefit them. Instead, it will bring confusion and shame. After the prophecy against Ariel and everything that has been discussed up to this point, now begins another prophecy, which is proven to have been fulfilled after one hundred and fifty years between Isaiah and Jeremiah. For he predicts that story which we read in the volume of Jeremiah (Jer. XLI), when Jerusalem was overthrown and all its wealth and princes were transferred to Babylon, a leader of royal descent was appointed over those who remained in Judah, Godolias son of Ahicam. But after he was killed by trickery with the help of the Chaldean allies, all the leaders of the warriors, and Johanan son of Carai, and Jechoniah son of Hosea, and the rest of the people from small to great, approached the Prophet Jeremiah and said to him: Let our plea fall before you, and pray to the Lord your God for all these remaining ones. Because we are few out of many, as your eyes look upon us; and let the Lord your God announce to us the way by which we must go, and the word that we must do (Jeremiah 42:2, 3). And after ten days Jeremiah responded to the word of the Lord, saying: Thus says the Lord God of Israel: If you remain quiet in this land, I will build you up and not tear you down, I will plant you and not uproot you, for I am appeased by the evil that I have done to you. Do not be afraid of the face of the king of Babylon, whom you fear in your cowardice (Ibid., X, 11). And after a little while: But if you say, 'We will not dwell in this land,' and you set your face to go to Egypt and go to live there, the sword that you fear will overtake you there, and the famine about which you are anxious will cling to you in Egypt, and there you shall die (Ibid., XLII, 13, 15, 16). The proud men answered, saying to Jeremiah: You speak lies: the Lord our God did not send you, saying: Do not go to Egypt, to live there; but Baruch the son of Neriah incites you against us, to deliver us into the hands of the Chaldeans, to kill us and make us be carried away to Babylon (Jeremiah 43:2, 3). In the end, all the leaders of the people, gathering together with the women and the little ones and the daughters of the king, not heeding the voice of the Lord, entered Egypt, taking Jeremiah and Baruch with them, and they came to Tahpanhes, so that Jeremiah prophesied as a sign of the future captivity against the disobedient people, the things contained in his book. Therefore, what was going to happen afterwards, many years before, was predicted, and they are called deserters and betrayers, the sons who, abandoning God's counsel that they had received through Jeremiah, followed their own will, and they wove a web, not by the spirit of God, which resounded through Jeremiah's mouth. But he metaphorically placed the woven web, in order to demonstrate the wicked counsel, and they did this in order to increase their past sins with the sin of contention and pride. He said, 'You who go down to Egypt, and have not asked my advice. Not that they have not asked, but that they have not wanted to listen to the counsel of the Prophet, hoping for assistance in the strength of Pharaoh, and having confidence in the protection, or shadow, of Egypt. Regarding the strength of Pharaoh, which is mentioned twice in this passage, it is written as 'Maoz' in Hebrew. We make this note so that when we read in the book of Daniel (Dan. II) about the vision of God as 'Maozim', we understand it to mean not as Porphyry imagines, the God of the village of Modim, but rather a mighty and powerful God. But Pharaoh among the Egyptians is the name of royal power; and each one is called by a special name, like Pharaoh Nechao, and Pharaoh Vafres (or Vafre): just as we use the proper names of kings for Caesar and Augustus. And it shall be, he says, that the strength of Pharaoh will be to you for confusion, and the confidence in the shadow of Egypt for shame. The same Jeremiah writes that in the city of Taphnis in Egypt he buried stones in the gateway of Pharaoh's house, and said to the men of Judah: Thus says the Lord God of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will send and take Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, my servant, and I will set his throne upon these stones which I have hidden, and he shall set his throne upon them. And it shall happen, as he strikes the land of Egypt, those destined for death, to death; those destined for captivity, to captivity; and those destined for the sword, to the sword. And he shall kindle a fire in the temples of the gods of Egypt, and he shall burn them, and he shall lead captives away. And the land of Egypt shall be made desolate, as a shepherd wraps himself in his cloak and departs from there in peace. And what follows: Your princes will be in Tanis, and your messengers have reached Hanes, to be read with mockery and emphasis, because they have rejected God's counsel and sent their princes to the city of Tanis in Egypt, where the royal house of Pharaoh was, and under Moses many signs and wonders were performed, as the Psalmist says: He did miracles in the land of Egypt, in the field of Tanis (Ps. LXXVII, 43). And the same Isaiah speaks against Egypt: Where are your wise men now? They will announce to you and say what the Lord of hosts has planned against Egypt. The princes of Tanis have failed, as Isaiah mentions that they failed at that time when the Lord entered Egypt on a light cloud. However, we do not read about the city of Hanes in any other place in Egypt, but from what is said: Your messengers have reached Hanes, we understand that it is the farthest city in Egypt near the Ethiopians and Blemmyas (also known as Blembas), for which the Septuagint translates as: The worst messengers will labor in vain, those who trusted in the Egyptian people, who could not help them, and became an eternal disgrace. Some people think that this place, contrary to the ten tribes in Samaria, was written because when they asked for help from the Egyptians, they were captured by the Assyrians. According to tropology: All those who, despising the religion of God, return to their own vomit, and with the name of children lost, are called shameless dogs, they make a plan, not through the Lord, and they make a pact, not through the spirit of the Lord, and they add sins to sins: so that, being overcome by enticing vices, they also receive the corruption of dogmas, and they descend into the darkness of Egypt, seeking help from Pharaoh, who reigns in Egypt, whose protection leads to everlasting disgrace and reproach. For indeed there are in Tanis, to be sure in a humble and dejected command, its worst messengers, who labor in vain over a people who cannot benefit them. For just as the salvation of the disciples helps the holy teachers, so the perdition of the seduced ones destroys their patriarchs who have turned to the aid of Egypt.

The burden of the beasts of the south. In Hebrew it is called Massa Beemoth (Al. Behemoth) of the Negeb, which the Septuagint translated as 'The Vision of the Quadrupeds in the Desert'. The superior explanation, which we have extensively explained through the replication of the historical text, is the interpretation of this place, according to the prophetic custom, that the burden, that is, the weight and burden of torment and punishment, not only came upon Babylon and the Philistines, and Moab, and Damascus, and Egypt, and the desert sea, but also upon Edom and Arabia, and the valley of Zion, and finally Tyre; but it also came upon the beasts of the south, which the Septuagint translated as quadrupeds in the desert. But the tribe of Judah, which is situated in the southern part, is bordering the wilderness; and those who rejected Jeremiah's prophecy, upon the capture of Jerusalem, refused to dwell in Judah; but they fled to the Egyptians through the desert. And rightly are they called the beasts of the South, or the quadrupeds in the wilderness, because they rejected the knowledge of God, and despising His command, fled to the idols of Egypt, having hope in Pharaoh, to whom whoever leans on, is like one leaning on a reed, which, if broken, will wound the hand of the one leaning on it. Concerning these kinds of animals, the sons of Korah spoke in the psalm: When a man is in honor, he does not understand; he is compared to the foolish animals and becomes like them (Ps. 49:13). And what follows: This is their way; their folly leads them astray, which can rightly be understood in relation to the present chapter, that their way through the desert led to their ruin. I have read, I know, that the animals of the south and the quadrupeds in the desert, who left the borders of Judah and fled into the darkness of Egypt, are referring to the spiritual wickedness in heavenly places; and the rulers of these darknesses, who lost all the wealth and former riches of Egypt in their desire. He said this. We say, according to tropology, that all those who, having abandoned the Creator, have given themselves to the errors of the world, are like quadrupeds in the desert of this age, from which they hope in vain for help, since they have abandoned the true help of God.
