(Verse 9.) The Lord of hosts has thought of this, to take away the pride of all glory: and to bring into contempt all the glorious ones of the earth. For as he had said above: Who hath thought the former Tyre, crowned by the ancients, that such a thing should be done? Now he himself speaks: Not of the fates, as foolish men imagine, are these threads spun: not by the turning of fortune's wheel, but by the judgment of God and his own will, is all this accomplished, who resists the proud, and gives grace to the humble (James 4): and it warns the arrogant of their condition, that they may learn his power through misery, whose mercy they refused to feel through benefits.
