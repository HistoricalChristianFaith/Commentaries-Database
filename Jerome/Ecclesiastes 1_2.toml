If everything that God made is very good, then how can everything be vanity—and not only vanity, but even vanity of vanities? As one song in the Song of Songs is shown to excel above all songs, so also is the magnitude of vanity demonstrated by the expression “vanity of vanities.”

"Vanity of vanities" said Ecclesiastes", Vanity of vanities, all is vanity." If all things that God made are truly good
then how can all things be considered vanity, and not only vanity, but even
vanity of vanities? Just as Song of
Songs means a song that stands out from amongst all songs, so we see that in
"vanity of vanities" the degree of vanity is shown. It is also written similarly in Psalm 38.6:
"Nevertheless every living man is vanity." If living man is vanity then a dead man must
be vanity of vanities. We read in Exodus
that Moses' face is glorified so much that the children of Israel are not able
to see him [Cfr Ex. 34, 30-35.]. Paul the apostle said that his glory was not
really glory when compared to the glory of righteousness: "For even that
which was made glorious had no glory in this respect, by reason of the glory
that excelleth."  [II Cor. 3, 10.] We are therefore able to say that even we in
this respect, heaven, earth, the seas and all things that are contained within
its compass can be said to be good in themselves, but compared to God they are
nothing. And if I look at the candle in
a lamp and am content with its light, then afterwards when the sun has risen I
cannot discern anymore what was once bright; I will also see the light of the
stars by the light of the setting sun, so in looking at the world and the
multitudinous varieties of nature I am amazed at the greatness of the world,
but I also remember that all things will pass away and the world will grow old,
and that only God is that which has always been. On account of this realisation I am compelled
to say, not once but twice: Vanity of
vanities, all is vanity. Instead of
"vanity of vanities" the Hebrew text reads 'abal abalim' which all
manuscripts excepting that of the Septuagint translate similarly in Greek as "atmos atmidon "or" atmon "which we are able to translate as 'a breath' and 'a light
wind which is quickly dispersed'. In
this way it is shown to be vain and in no way universal by this phrase. For those things which seem to be temporal,
in fact are; but those which do not are eternal. Or since that which will give rise to vanity
has been exposed, he groans and is anxious and awaits the revelation of the
sons of God, and "now we know in part, and we prophesy in part"  [I Cor. 13, 9.]. All things are and will be vain, until we
find that which is complete and perfect.
