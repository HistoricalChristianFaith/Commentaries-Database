(Verse 36.) And all who were sick approached him, and they begged him to touch the fringe of his garment. And whoever touched it, they were healed. But those who were sick should not touch the body of Jesus or the entire garment, but only the edge of the fringe, and whoever touched it, they would be healed. Understand the fringe of his garment, or at least understand this commandment: whoever breaks it will be considered the least in the kingdom of heaven (Above, III). And through the assumption of the body, by which we come to the Word of God, and afterwards enjoy His majesty.
