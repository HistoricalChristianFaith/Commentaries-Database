(Judges 5:1) And Deborah and Barak son of Abinoam sang. Barak is said to have been a man of Deborah the prophetess. Barak himself is also called Barak son of Lapidoth. For Lapidoth means lightning, and Barak, thunder. Lightning, therefore, because before he avenged Israel against the Canaanites, there was a lightning shining among the people, by merit and prerogative of his deeds: but after he avenged Israel against the Canaanites, he was called Thunder, that is, striking.
