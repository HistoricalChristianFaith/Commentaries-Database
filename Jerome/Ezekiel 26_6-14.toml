(Verse 6 onward.) For thus says the Lord: Behold, I will bring against Tyre (or against you, O Tyre) Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, from the north, the king of kings, with horses, and chariots, and horsemen, and a great gathering of people. He will kill your daughters in the field with the sword, and he will surround you with fortifications, and he will build up a siege mound against you, and he will lift up a shield against you, and he will temper vineyards, and rams (or spears), against your walls, and he will destroy your towers in his armor. The inundation of his horses will cover you with their dust; your walls will shake at the sound of the horsemen, chariots, and wheels. When he enters your gates, they will be broken down as if by the entrance of a ravaged city (or as if entering a city from the field). His horses will trample all your streets; he will kill your people with the sword, and your noble statues will fall to the ground (or the wealth of your strength will be brought down to the ground). They will plunder your wealth, destroy your businesses, and tear down your walls. They will overthrow your magnificent houses and throw your stones, wood, and dust into the midst of the waters. I will silence the multitude of your singers and the sound of your harps will no longer be heard. And I will make you a very clear (or shining) rock. You will be the drying up of the snares, and you will not be built up any longer, because I have spoken, says the Lord God. I have joined together the two editions according to custom, and I have joined together from the side those things in which they disagree, providing brevity of volumes. Therefore, what he had said, I will make many nations ascend to you as the fluctuating sea ascends, and Tyre will be a plunder for the nations, then it makes it more evident that the Lord will bring King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon from the North, the king of kings, with horses and chariots, and with an infinite multitude of armies, who will first overturn the cities and fortresses subject to Tyre on the seashore, and afterwards will cause Tyre to be besieged, and he will attack it with an army, and with a wall, and with fortifications, and with ropes, and with battering rams and destroy the walls, and his cavalry will be such a multitude that the foundations of the city will be moved by the dust of the cavalry and the sound of the howling army, and the noise of the wheels and the neighing of the horses, and thus he will enter the city with the walls scattered, as if he were entering safely from the field, and there will be such security for the conquering army that the hooves of the horses will trample the streets of Tyre and all the people in the middle of the city will fall down, and the once noble statues or all the substance will fall to the ground, and none of the former riches will be preserved in the captured city, but even the noble houses will be destroyed along with the walls, and the cruelty of the victors will be so great that the remaining wood and stones that were burned will be thrown into the middle of the sea, and either Nebuchadnezzar or the Lord himself will cause all the joy of the city to cease, which used to resound in songs and psalms, and even the ground will be dried up. And what follows: You shall not be built up any more, seems to raise the question of how it is that we see today the most noble and beautiful city of Phoenicia, Tyre, which was not built thereafter. But how can they maintain that Tyre will suffer these things in the final time, if afterwards it is not to be built? But how can they preserve the person of Nebuchadnezzar, especially since we read in the following passages that Nebuchadnezzar besieged Tyre, and did not receive the reward of his labor, and therefore Egypt was delivered to him because he served the purposes of God in the siege of Tyre? They say that the Greeks and Phoenicians, especially Nicolaus of Damascus, and others among the Barbarians who contradict this history, have read histories and found nothing about the siege of the city of Tyre by the Chaldeans, even though we can prove that many things are said in the Scriptures that are not found in Greek volumes; and we should not acquiesce to their authority, whose treachery and lies we detest. Therefore, what is said, 'you shall be no more,' can be understood to mean that the queen of nations will no longer exist, nor will she have her own sovereignty, as she had under Hiram and other kings; but she will be subject either to the Chaldeans, or the Macedonians, or the Ptolemies, and finally to the Roman kings. But there is no doubt that by anagoge, Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon who came from the North, is understood to be the devil, who, although he is a very harsh and adverse wind, is called by the name of the right hand, presuming for himself the dignity of the name. He is the king of kings and of all kingdoms, which he shows to the Lord, and he said to him: All these things have been given to me, and I will give them to you if you fall down and worship me (Matthew 4:9). He has horses and chariots, of which it is written: The deceitful horse is for salvation (Psalm 32:17). And: All those who mounted the horses fell asleep (Ps. LXXV). And in another place: He threw the horse and rider into the sea (Exod. XV, 1). This man kills the daughters of Tyre, souls placed in distress and in a certain prison of sin, in the wide field and countryside, and surrounds Tyre with his fortifications, so as to hold her captive, and no one from the kingdom of Babylon can escape his rule. He will destroy the walls and topple the towers, and whatever he had by way of doctrines, he will shake in terror with the onslaught of his horses, the sound of the riders' horses and chariots, and he will enter her gates without any hindrance, and the streets of the city: For wide and spacious is the way that leads to destruction (Matth. VII, 13), his horses' hooves will trample, and all the substance or noble statues, with which they fashioned false images for themselves, about which it is written: O Lord, you will scatter their images in your city (Ps. LXXII, 20), he will cast down to the ground, and with the walls destroyed, even the noble houses that he prepared for himself will be overthrown, in which he rejoiced, and he will come to such great desolation, that its stones and the wood with which he built the walls, and the cement he made, will be cast into the depths, and his songs and music, on which he relied in the wisdom of this world, and every sound of the lyres will no longer be heard, and his fishing will cease, and he will be made low, like the drying of reeds, and will no longer be rebuilt, because according to the judgment of the Lord, Nabuchodonosor has been utterly destroyed, as the Apostle also says: I have handed them over to Satan, so that they may learn not to blaspheme (I Tim. I, 20). The places are difficult, and the wise and diligent reader should forgive my effort. Or if he can find something better, I will adopt his opinion: provided he knows the leniency he will grant me, and that he will receive it from others.
