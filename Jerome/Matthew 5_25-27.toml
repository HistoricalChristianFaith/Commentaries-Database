(Verse 25 onwards) Be reconciled quickly with your adversary while you are on the way with him, lest your adversary deliver you to the judge, and the judge deliver you to the officer, and you be thrown into prison. Truly I say to you, you will not get out of there until you have paid the last penny. You have heard that it was said to the ancient ones: 'You shall not commit adultery.' But I tell you that everyone. Because what we have in Latin codices is 'consentiens,' it is written in Greek as 'Εὐνοῶν,' which means benevolent or kind. From the preceding and subsequent passages, it is clear that our Lord and Savior, while we run on the path of this world, encourages us to peace and harmony, according to the Apostle, who says: If possible, as far as it depends on you, live at peace with all men (Rom. XII, 18). For in the preceding chapter, he also said: If you bring your gift to the altar and there remember that your brother has something against you: and when this is finished, he immediately adds: Be reconciled to your adversary, etc. And in the following he commands: Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who persecute and slander you. When this is clear and the consequent understanding, many think it is said about the flesh and the soul, or about the soul and the spirit, which is not entirely correct. For how can the flesh be sent to prison if the soul does not agree, since both the soul and the flesh must be imprisoned together? And the flesh can do nothing except what the mind commands, or the Holy Spirit dwelling in us can deliver judgment to the flesh or the soul that resists, since he himself is the judge. Others, according to the Letter of Peter saying: Your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, goes about seeking whom he may devour (I Peter 5:8), and the rest, interpret the adversary as the devil, and they want to command from the Savior that, as long as it is in our power, we may be benevolent towards the devil, who is an enemy and avenger, and not make him suffer punishment on our behalf. For since he himself supplies the incentives of vices, and even to us who sin willingly, if we agree with him who suggests vices, he must also be tormented on our behalf. And they say it is a kind act for each saint to sustain his adversary, if he does not make him endure torments for himself. Some say more forcefully that in Baptism each person enters into a pact with the devil and says: I renounce you, devil, and your pomp, and your vices, and your world, which is in the evil one (1 John 5:19). Therefore, if we keep the pact, we are kind and consenting to our adversary, and by no means are we to be shut up in prison. But if we have in fact transgressed anything of what we promised to the devil, we will be handed over to the judge and the officer, and we will be thrown into prison, and we will not be released from it until we repay the last quarter. A quarter is a type of coin that has two minutes. Hence, in another Gospel, that poor and widowed woman is said to have sent a quarter into the treasury (Mark 12), and in another, two minutes (Luke 21). Not that the Gospels are in disagreement, but that one quarter has two minute coins. This is therefore what he is saying: You will not leave the prison until you have paid even the smallest sins.
