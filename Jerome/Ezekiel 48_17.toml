(Verse 17.) The suburbs of the city on the north side shall be two hundred and fifty cubits in length, on the south side two hundred and fifty cubits in length, on the east side two hundred and fifty cubits in length, and on the west side two hundred and fifty cubits in length. As for the suburbs, which are called "Magras" in Hebrew, they have again transferred the distance of seventy times seventy cubits, that is, a space. And what is said, two hundred and fifty on each side, is understood to refer to reeds, which are six cubits and one palm in length, and on each side they make six hundred and seventeen and a little less steps, and in total one thousand reeds, making two thousand four hundred and sixty-eight steps: these spaces surround the walls of the city in a circle, so as to divide the city from the rest. From this it is shown that none of these spaces have the right to engage in the work of the city and to gather its fruits, but rather to be free from the use and work of men, so that the areas around the city walls, with their naturally growing shrubs and herbs, and other things that the land produces, may have beauty.

But the remaining length, according to the holy area, shall be ten thousand cubits toward the east and ten thousand toward the west: and it shall be over against the holy sanctuary. And the fruits thereof shall be for food, and the leaf thereof for medicine. And the workers of the city, that work therein, shall serve it out of all the tribes of Israel. All the fruits thereof shall be for the service of the holy city, and the priests of the sanctuary, who shall go in and out of the house of the Lord, shall eat it. And it shall be a place for a habitation unto them. And the separated cities shall be in the midst of that which shall be for the possession of the prince: and the possession of the holy place shall be in the midst of the portion of the Levites. He wants to designate the remaining part of the firstfruits of the sanctuary, ten thousand baskets extending towards the East, and another ten thousand baskets extending towards the West, to be allocated to those who work for the city for various purposes, whatever the city needs: so that the workers who build or restore the city walls, when necessary, may be nourished from the crops that grow on this land, and so that the city may have its adornment and the repaired roofs be restored. And this, not only in Israel or in the possession of the Holy Land, is contained spiritually in the mystery of the Church, but we also approve that it happens under Roman authority, so that certain villas belong to the rights of cities, either through royal generosity or through the inheritance and donation of many, so that buildings are not gradually ruined and public buildings, which are an ornament to the city, are not long neglected. But the workers, he said, or those who serve in the works of the city, will be from all the tribes of Israel: so that no one may consider themselves exempt from the work of the city, but all may eagerly build up the Church. This is also what we read was done in the tabernacle, that for the diversity of strengths, one offers gold and silver, scarlet, fine linen, and purple, and various and diverse coverings: others offer skins and the hair of goats: and although there were different gifts according to the quality of the substance, the reward of those who gave was one: indeed, greater than those who offered little, but more according to their abilities, as an example of the poor widow, who sent two small coins as gifts to the treasury; she was praised by the judgment of the Lord, saying: Truly I say to you, this widow, poor as she is, has put in more than all the others. For they have all contributed from their surplus wealth to the offerings of God, but she, from her poverty, has offered her whole livelihood. Therefore, as we have said about the works of the city, it must be briefly stated that all the first fruits of the sanctuary, and the possession of the city calculated together in a square, amount to two thousand four hundred and sixty-six, and a third part. For if twenty-five thousand reeds, which have six cubits and one palm, make ours, that is, Roman sixty, and one thousand, and six hundred and sixty-seven paces; there is no doubt that these, when multiplied by four, exceed the previous number. From which we understand that all things are to be understood spiritually, the possession of the Church is much broader than it was in Judea, who did not even receive a part of the holy land: but from each tribe they received forty-eight cities, not the full possession, but habitation and hospitality: so also the laity themselves, although they have not reached the priestly and Levitical degree, if they work in the city of the Lord, they may partake of the holy land, the land of meekness, and the land of believers, of whom one said: I believe to see the good things of the Lord, in the land of the living (Ps. 27:13).
