"It is
better to go to the house of mourning, than to go to the house of feasting: for
that is the end of all men; and the living will take it to his heart. "It is more useful to go to the rites of a funeral than
to the house where there is a party, since at the house of mourning we are
warned of our creator and of our mortality on account of seeing the dead
body. But in the happiness of a party,
even if we seem to have any fear, we lose it. 
Symmachus interpreted the last verse by saying, "and he who lives,
will look back in his mind". There
is proof in these verses, in that God is seen to approve food and drink, but
not seen to prefer desire to all these things, with the result that many men
value them wrongly. But in comparison
with avarice and too much sparing, feasting is allowed in a small way, or
allowed to him, who enjoys his work completely every moment. For he had never preferred the sadness of
mourning to the enjoyment of a party, if he had thought at any moment to drink
and eat.
