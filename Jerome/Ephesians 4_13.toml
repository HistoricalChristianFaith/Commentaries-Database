We must ask: Who are the all whom he speaks of “coming together in the unity of faith”? Does he mean all the people of God or all saints? Or rather all who are capable of reason? He seems to me to be speaking of all the people of God because there are so “many winds of doctrine” blowing about them. When these blasts and billows are aroused, people in general are carried here and there by diverse errors, uncertain of their course.

According to the traditions of the church and the apostle Paul, our resurrection will “be into a mature man and the stature of the fullness of Christ.” This is the state in which the Jews claim that Adam was created and in which we have read that the Lord rose.
