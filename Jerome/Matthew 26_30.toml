(Vers. 30.) And having sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives. This is what we read in a certain psalm: All the fat of the earth have eaten and adored (Ps. XXI, 30). According to this example, whoever is satisfied with the Savior's bread and intoxicated with the chalice can praise the Lord and ascend to the Mount of Olives, where there is refreshment from labors, consolation from sorrow, and knowledge of true light.
