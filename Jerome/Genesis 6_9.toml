(Verse 9) Noah was a righteous and blameless man in his generation, pleasing to God. Specifically, it says 'in his generation' to show that his righteousness was not according to the perfected righteousness, but according to the righteousness of his generation. And this is what is said in Hebrew: Noah was a righteous man, blameless in his generations, he walked with God; that is, he followed in his footsteps.
