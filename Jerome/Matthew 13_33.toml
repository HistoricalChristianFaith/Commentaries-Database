The 'satum' is a kind of measure in use in Palestine containing one modius and a half.

Or otherwise; The woman who takes the leaven and hides it, seems to me to be the Apostolic preaching, or the Church gathered out of divers nations. She takes the leaven, that is, the understanding of the Scriptures, and hides it in three measures of meal, that the three, spirit, soul, and body, may be brought into one, and may not differ among themselves. Or otherwise; We read in Plato that there are three parts in the soul, reason, anger, and desire; (R. P. iv. 439. λογιστιχὸν, ἐχιδνμπτιχὸυ, θνμοειδὲς) so we also if we have received the evangelic leaven of Holy Scripture, may possess in our reason prudence, in our anger hatred against vice, in our desire love of the virtues, and this will all come to pass by the Evangelic teaching which our mother Church has held out to us. I will further mention an interpretation of some; that the woman is the Church, who has mingled the faith of man in three measures of meal, namely, belief in the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit; which when it has fermented into one lump, brings us not to a threefold God, but to the knowledge of one Divinity. This is a pious interpretation; but parables and doubtful solutions of dark things, can never bestow authority on dogmas.

The woman who took the yeast and mixed it with three measures of flour until the whole batch of dough was fermented signifies to me either the apostolic preaching or the church, which is made up of different nations. She takes the yeast—namely, the knowledge and understanding of the Scriptures—and mixes it with three measures of flour so that the spirit, soul and body blended into one might not differ from each other but intermingle, obtaining from the Father whatever they ask for. This point is examined also elsewhere. We read in Plato, and it is the teaching of famous philosophers, that there are three passions in the human soul: one, which we may interpret as rational; another, which we call full of anger or irascible; a third, which we call desire. This great philosopher believed that our rational part resides in the brain, anger in the gall bladder and desire in the liver. Therefore, if we accept the evangelical yeast of sacred Scripture that we spoke about, the three passions of the human soul are blended into one, so that in reason we possess prudence, in anger we possess hatred toward vice, in desire the aspiration for virtue. And this all happens through the gospel teaching that holy mother, the church, offers us.

(Verse 33.) And he spoke another parable to them. The kingdom of heaven is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal, until it was all leavened. The stomachs of different people are different: some are pleased with bitter, some with sweet, some with more harsh, and some with more gentle foods. Therefore, as we have already said, the Lord presents various parables, so that there may be different remedies according to the varieties of wounds. That woman, who took the leaven and hid it in three measures of flour until it was all leavened, seems to me to be the apostolic preaching or the Church, which is gathered from diverse nations. She takes the leaven, namely the knowledge and understanding of the Scriptures, and hides it in three measures of flour, so that the spirit, soul, and body, brought together as one, do not disagree with one another; but when two or three come together, they obtain from the Father whatever they ask for (Matthew 18). This place is being discussed, and in another way. We read in Plato, and the common teaching of philosophers is that there are three passions in the human soul: the rational, which we can interpret as reason; the spirited, which we can call full of anger or irascible; the appetitive, which we name concupiscible. And that philosopher thinks that our reason dwells in the brain, anger in the gall, and desire in the liver. And so, if we accept the fermentum of the Evangelical holy Scriptures, about which it was said above, the three human passions will be brought together into one, so that we may possess prudence in reasoning: in anger, hatred against vices; in desire, longing for virtues; and all this will be accomplished through the Gospel teaching, which our mother Church has provided for us. I will also mention a third interpretation for some, so that the curious reader may choose from among many what pleases them: They interpret this woman and the Church itself, which has mixed the faith of man with enough flour for the belief of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. And when it has been fermented into one, it leads us not to the threefold God, but to the knowledge of one divinity. Likewise, three sown grains of wheat, while there is not a different nature in each, draw substances toward unity. Indeed, pius quidem sensus, but never can the understanding of parables and the interpretation of obscure enigmas proceed to the authority of doctrines. Now, the sown grain is a measure, according to the custom of the province of Palestine, holding one and a half modius. Other things are said about this parable, but it is not the purpose of this material to speak about everything.
