“And they said to him, ‘Thus says Hezekiah,’ ” not “thus says the king,” not swelling pridefully with political power. “This is a day of tribulation, of punishment, and a day of blasphemy,” of our tribulation, of God’s punishment, of the enemies’ blasphemy. And he drew an analogy to a woman suffering the pains of childbirth—who has come to the point of delivery but is unable to give birth—to say, “We have conceived from fear of you, Lord, and we suffered, and we gave birth to the spirit of salvation.” Hezekiah continues: “Perhaps the Lord your God heard the words of the Rabshakeh.” We do not dare to call the Lord of all “our Lord,” whereby we would suffer such wrath, but we say “your Lord.” And we have confidence in [God’s] punishment because the living God is being blasphemed by the worship of idols of the dead. “And they will chastise with the words which the Lord your God heard. Lift up a prayer, therefore, not for all the people who have already perished, but for the remnant who are besieged.”
