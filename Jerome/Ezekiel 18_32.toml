“I do not want you to die.” He did not say “turn,” unless those who were once with God and afterwards deserted his company and “live” through penitence, you who are dead through sin. Therefore Israel is believed to be dead because it does not turn back to its original state.

(Verse 32) Because I do not want the death of the one dying (or, the sinner), says the Lord God: return and live. I do not want, he says, for you to die, whom I have begotten for salvation. For I have begotten sons, and I have exalted them, but they have rejected me (Isaiah 1:2). Therefore, return and live. It is said to return, only to those who were previously with God and have later abandoned his company. And live through repentance, who are dead through sin. Therefore, Israel, because it does not return to its former state, is believed to be dead.
