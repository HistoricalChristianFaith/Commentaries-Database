(Verse 8) Now I will pour out my anger upon you and vent my fury against you; I will judge you according to your ways and bring upon you all your abominations. If we calculate from the fifth year of the exile of King Jehoiachin to the ninth year of the reign of King Zedekiah, when Nebuchadnezzar came and besieged Jerusalem, it will be three years in total. Therefore, it is rightly said: Now I will pour out my anger upon you. I will by no means foretell to you what is to come, nor will I threaten you with things that are far off in the future: now I will unleash my fury upon you. This fury and anger is by no means without judgment: but it is to return your ways upon your own head, and to make you feel all your abominations. Moreover, we can also speak of the ultimate captivity, that after the killing of Christ, when their end came and sin awoke against them, that was fulfilled which was written: Now the wrath of God has come upon them to the end (1 Thess. 1:16). When Titus and Vespasian surrounded Jerusalem, and its desolation arrived, and it was fulfilled: Behold, your house will be left abandoned to you (Matthew 23:38). Then they were judged according to their ways and the blasphemies with which they denied the Lord; and they felt the fury of God, and all His indignation was poured out upon them, and they received their crimes, so that the destruction of the temple might endure until the end.
