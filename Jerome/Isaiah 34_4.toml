“You have spread out the heavens like a tent cloth.” The prophet means to say that from the beginning God spread out the heavens, just as if he were unfolding a scroll and rolling it back again, as it is written in Holy Scripture: “And the heavens shall be rolled up like a scroll.” You have constructed your palace upon the waters, as similarly in Genesis, there were waters above the firmament and, likewise, below the firmament. “You travel on the wings of the wind.” This typifies the presence of God everywhere.
