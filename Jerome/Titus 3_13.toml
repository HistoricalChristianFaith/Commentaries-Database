Send Zenam, the learned in the law, and hasten to send Apollo, so that nothing may be lacking to them. This is the Apollo of whom mention is made in the epistle to the Corinthians: Every one of you saith: I indeed am of Paul; and I am of Apollo; and I am of Cephas (1 Cor. I, 12). He was an Alexandrian man, a Jew, very eloquent, and skilful in the scriptures; he was the bishop of the Corinthians; and he is supposed to have gone to the island of Crete with Zenas, the doctor of the law, and to have returned thence to Corinth, after having there regulated the Christian church by his preaching; as Paul too had done by his epistle. But we cannot say who the old testament lawyer was from another passage of scripture, except only this, that he himself, as an apostolic man, had the same work which Apollo exercised: to establish the churches of Christ. Therefore, Titus commands that since they were about to sail from Crete to Greece, he should not allow them to be in need of the bare necessities, but should have what is necessary for a journey.
