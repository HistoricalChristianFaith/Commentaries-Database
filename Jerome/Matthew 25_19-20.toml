(Verse 19, 20.) After a long time, the master of those servants came and settled accounts with them. And he who had received the five talents came forward, bringing five more talents, saying, 'Master, you delivered to me five talents; here, I have made five talents more.' It is a great time between the ascension of the Savior and his second coming. But if the apostles are going to give an account and be judged with fear, what should we do?
