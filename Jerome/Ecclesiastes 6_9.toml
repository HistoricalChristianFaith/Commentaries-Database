"Better
is what the eyes see than what is imagined. 
That, too, is futility and a vexation of the spirit." Symmachus interpreted this clearly, he says: "it
is better to make provision, than to walk about as it pleases you". That is, it is better to do all things
according to what you know to be right in your mind, which is the eye of the
soul, than to follow the desire of your heart. 
For this is to wander in spirit, just as Ezekiel says: "he who
walks by the desire of his heart" [Ezek. 11, 21.]. For indeed he denounced that man is proud and
only pleases himself and says he is better, who makes provision for all days,
than he, whom nothing pleases, unless he has made it himself. Nothing is worse than him, and more vane than
any breath. And again here
"vexation of the spirit" has been interpreted by Theodotion and
Aquila as 'suffering of the soul'. 
Symmachus too has "affliction of the spirit". More precisely we must remember that in
Hebrew 'spirit' and 'breath' are similar in usage - that is "ruha".
