The souls that were in the desert by yielding to faults are moved to words of repentance, so that leaving those faults they become the habitation of God.

The desert was the church that, at first, had no children. By the preaching of Christ, this wilderness “was shaken” and “came to labor and gave birth, and there was born in a single day an entire nation.” She who before was called the “wilderness of Cades,” the desert of holiness—inasmuch as she had been barren of virtues—begins “to bring forth stags” and send out in throngs holy people who kill the serpents on earth, contemptuous of their poisons. While they are running throughout the world proclaiming the gospel of Christ, “in his temple all say ‘Glory’ ” to God!
