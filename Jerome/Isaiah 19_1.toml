Behold, the Lord has entered the Egypt of this world on a soft cloud, the Virgin. “He led them with a cloud by day.” Beautifully said, by day, for the cloud was never in darkness but always in light. “And all night with a glow of fire.” “For you darkness itself is not dark, and night shines as the day.” “And all night with a glow of fire.” “The Lord our God is a consuming fire.” A consuming fire. The psalmist did not say what the fire is consuming; he left that to our intelligence. - "Homilies on the Psalms 11 (Psalm 77)"

“The Lord is riding on a swift cloud on his way to Egypt.” Appreciate what that means: the Lord comes, the Lord and Savior, into the Egypt in which we live; the Lord comes into the land of darkness where Pharaoh is. But he does not come save riding on a swift cloud. Now what is this swift cloud? I think it is holy Mary with child of no human seed. This swift cloud has come into the world and brought with it the Creator of the world. What does Isaiah say? “The Lord will enter into Egypt upon a swift cloud; and the idols of Egypt shall be shattered.” The Lord has come, and the false gods of Egypt tremble violently, crash together and are destroyed. This is the cloud that in Alexandria destroyed Sarapis; no general did it, no mortal man, but this cloud that came into Alexandria. - "Homilies on the Psalms 24 (Psalm 96)"

We must think of that swift cloud as befitting either the body of the Savior, because his body was light, not weighted down by any sin; or certainly holy Mary, who was heavy with child by no human seed. Behold the Lord has entered the Egypt of this world on a swift cloud, the Virgin. - "Homilies on the Psalms 11 (Psalm 77)"
