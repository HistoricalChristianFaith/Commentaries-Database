It was a nice touch for Paul to write here that Christ gave gifts to humanity, when what is written in Psalm  is that “he received gifts among humanity.” Why this difference? Since in the psalm the act had not yet occurred but was promised in the future, the phrase was accordingly he received. But the apostle is seeing this as a promise earlier given and later fulfilled. At this time of writing, Christ has already made the gift and churches have been established throughout the whole world. Accordingly he is said to have already given to humanity rather than received gifts among humanity. .

We believers in Christ, having been gathered from the Gentiles, had been taken captive by the devil, though we were creatures of God. We were sold out to the demonic powers. Into this circumstance our Lord Jesus Christ came bearing the baggage of captivity, as Ezekiel says, and, covering his head so that his adversaries would not know him, preaching remission to those who had been taken captive and release to those held in chains…. After Christ freed us, we were snatched out of an old captivity into a new freeing captivity [to Christ], as he led us with him into heaven. .
