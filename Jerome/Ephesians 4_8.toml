Therefore, he says: 'Ascending on high, he led captivity captive, he gave gifts to men.' For he had said above, 'To each one of us grace has been given according to the measure of the gift of Christ,' so that he might confirm these very gifts, which he also enumerates a little later, saying: 'And he gave some to be apostles, others to be prophets, others to be evangelists, others to be pastors and teachers,' and the rest. From the Savior, who gave them, he took testimony from the sixty-seventh Psalm, that we might know that the spoils that Christ the conqueror purchased are distributed to men. For ascending on high, he led captivity captive. We believers in Christ, gathered out of the Gentiles, when we were God's creatures, were captured by the devil and distributed among his followers. Then our Lord Jesus Christ came, bearing with him the vessels of captivity spoken of by Ezekiel (Ch. IX and XII), and with his head veiled so as not to be recognized by his adversaries, he preached remission to the captives and release to them who were held in chains. And he freed us from the chains of the enemy and the fetters of the old captivity, and led us with himself into heaven. And to those whom he delivered from the hand of the enemy as the victor, he gave different gifts of grace. And elegantly, he placed here, 'he gave gifts to men,' whereas in the Psalter it is written, 'he received gifts from men' (Ps. LXVII, 19). But there, because it had not yet happened, but was promised for the future, it is said, 'he received.' Here, however, since the Apostle writes that he had already given, and the Church was established throughout the world, he does not write 'received,' but 'gave.' Some have explained this passage such that our Lord Jesus Christ ascended victoriously to heaven so that he might send from there angels and other powers to guard his churches. And while this place on earth is unworthy to have the presence of sublime powers, in a certain way they endured captivity. For he ascended on high, that he might captive captivity and give gifts to men. And the Apostle repeats this whole thing to teach that since he had already said, 'bearing with one another in love, eager to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace,' he might show that in the various gifts of the Church, there might be harmony, and that there might not be immediately given occasion for schisms and dissensions, because according to the measure of the gift of Christ, each one of us received gifts, not the same but in one body and in one spirit, all of us called, that is, so that just as there is one Lord, one faith, one baptism, and one God the Father, so also we might be one in charity, keeping the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace.
