Let the Jews perceive that they have not prevailed against me, but that it is your will that I suffer. Besides, I desired to suffer; that is why I say in my human nature: “To do your will, O my God, is my delight.” It was your will and mine that I suffer; not their plottings and power did it, but you and I desired it. You, in truth, struck your Shepherd, and the sheep have been scattered.… That I suffer was your will and mine also. What you desired, I also desired.
