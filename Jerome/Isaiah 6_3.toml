Because they cry out one to another or, according to the Hebrew, this one to that one, that is, mutually, they are exhorting each other to the praise of the Lord. And they say “Holy, holy, holy, Lord of hosts,” that the mystery of the Trinity in one divine nature might be displayed. They also declare that no longer is it true only of the temple of the Jews, as before, but the whole earth is filled with the glory of him who deigned to assume a human body for our salvation and descend to earth. Moreover, when Moses had prayed to ask the Lord to spare this sinful people who had worshiped a calf, the Lord responded, “I will forgive them. Yet I live, and my name lives, for all the earth will be filled with my glory.” And the seventy-first psalm sings, “All the earth will be filled with his glory.” For this reason also did angels call to the shepherds, saying, “Glory to God in the highest and peace on earth to men of good will.” It is impious, therefore, to understand the two seraphim to be the Son and the Holy Spirit. Let us teach instead, according to John the evangelist and the apostle Paul, that the Son of God and the Holy Spirit are said to be seen reigning in majesty. Some of the Latin [commentators] understand the two seraphim to be the Old and New Testaments, which speak only of the present age. Thus they are said to have six wings and to cover the face and feet of God, and earnestly to provide a witness of the truth. Everything that they cry reveals the mystery of the Trinity. They also express wonderment to each other that the Lord of the sabbath who was in the form of God the Father accepted the form of a servant and humbled himself unto death, even death on a cross, that no longer only those in heaven would know him, as before, but also those on earth.
