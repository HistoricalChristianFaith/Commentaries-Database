“I will not give my glory to another.” This means that the idols should not be thought to oppress the people of God. Or indeed when [Isaiah] says, “I will not give to another [Christ],” he shows that he has already given it to another. For “another” is used to distinguish from the first. Many of our translators … assert that he here prophesies about the advent of Christ that would come suddenly and unlooked for; that Christ would show his very stubborn people his presence, to those whose ears God never opened since their heart was coarse and they are hard of hearing, in that as soon as the Lord came from the virginal womb he was called “sinner” and “unrighteous” as the people sought to kill him.
