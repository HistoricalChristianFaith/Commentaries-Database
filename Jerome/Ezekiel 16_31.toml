We can compare this with every single Christian soul who deserts the worship of God, indulges in vices and luxury and follows secular life, lest it does anything fruitful, and goes so far as destroying the riches of religion and does not even accept the riches of the world. There is no difficulty in her debauchery, for she herself rushes to her lovers.
