(Verse 30 and following) And the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah, saying: Send to all the exiles, saying: Thus says the Lord to Shemaiah of Nehelam: Because Shemaiah prophesied to you, though I did not send him, and made you trust in a lie, therefore thus says the Lord: Behold, I will punish Shemaiah of Nehelam and his descendants. He shall have none of his own people sitting in the midst of this people, and he shall not see the good that I will do to my people, declares the Lord, for he has spoken rebellion against the Lord. The false prophet Semeias, truly a Neelamite, who had taken foreign and turbid waters from the stream, becomes angry because he had written the truth about Jeremiah against his own lie, and he sends letters to the priest Sophonias. He desires that the prophet be imprisoned so that he cannot speak. He also secretly accuses the prophet Sophonias while reading the letter of the liar, and boasts that he has an accusation against him. The more of a crime are those who defend false prophets, and foster lies, and make other people's evil acts their own sins! Let the false prophet hear, let the priest understand what he deserves to hear from him: Thus says the Lord: Behold, I will visit Semeiah. The Lord speaks this, not the prophet, that he might visit Semeiah the Neelamite, not for healing, but for punishment of the liar, according to what is written: I will visit their iniquities with a rod, and their sins with scourges (Psalm 89:33). He not only visits the false prophet himself, but also his followers, whom he has deceived with his error. There will be, he says, no man seated in the midst of this people. Let the wicked brood be erased from the council of the saints, and let him not sit among the quiet ones, who, when he could not stand with those who stand, neither heard this: 'If he had stood in my substance' (Jer. XXIII). And although the Lord promises the perfection of all virtues at the end of a set time, he will not see the good that he claimed for himself in the present time. However, all this will happen because he has spoken rebellion against the Lord, saying that those captured by sins will return to Jerusalem; to whom the Apostle threatens: You are already full, you have already become rich, you have reigned without us; and I wish you would reign, so that we could reign with you (I Cor. IV, 8)!
