I linger long in the land of the midday sun, for it was there and then that the spouse found her bridegroom at rest and Joseph drank wine with his brothers once more. I will return to Jerusalem and, passing through Tekoa the home of Amos, I will look on the glistening cross of Mount Olive from which the Savior made his ascension to the Father. Here year by year a red heifer was burned as an offering to the Lord, and its ashes were used to purify the children of Israel. Here also according to Ezekiel the cherubim after leaving the temple founded the church of the Lord.
