Three times above we read that the apostles were “reputed.” … And so I was wondering what this word meant. Now he has delivered me from all doubt when he describes them as those “who appeared to be pillars.” Therefore it means the apostles, and above all Peter, James and John, two of whom were deemed fit to go up the Mount with Jesus. One of these introduces the Savior in the Apocalypse saying “He who has overcome I shall make him a pillar in the temple of my God.” This teaches us that all believers who have overcome the enemy can become pillars of the church.
