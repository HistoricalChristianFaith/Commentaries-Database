"There
is an evil that I have observed in the world as if it were an error proceeding
from the ruler: folly is placed on lofty heights, while rich men sit in low
places. I have seen slaves on horses and
nobles walking on foot like slaves. "Where we read "as if it were an error
proceeding from the ruler" Aquila, Theodotion and the Septuagint have
interpreted this as "as if not of their own will", that is "hos akousian", from the face of the
ruler. Symmachus agrees with this,
saying, "the fool is placed in great elevation, but humble riches remain
fixed." And he remembers that he has
seen this wickedness in this time, because the judgement of God seems to be
unjust. And it happens either through
not knowing, or without his will, that either in the rulers of the world, or in
the leadership of the Church, often these men, who are rich in words and
wisdom, rich too in good deeds, remain ignoble and foolish holding a position
in the Church. But this happens in front
of his face, he who has power in that time, while he oppresses the powerful and
learned men, and he does not let them come out in public, but those whom he
knows to be foolish in the Church he makes greater, so that the blind are led
by the blind into pitfalls. The
following verse also has this meaning: "I have seen slaves on horses and
nobles walking on foot like slaves". 
Because these men are slaves of vices and sins, or are so humble, that
they are thought to be slaves by other men, they are suddenly inflated by the
devil's pompousness, and they wear out the public roads with their ponies [Cfr. Horat. Epod. IV, 14.]. And each noble or wise man that is oppressed
by poverty takes the road and occupation of slaves. The Hebrew seems to say that ignorance seems
to leave the face of the powerful and rulers. 
He explains this as God, because men think that in this inequality of
matter He is not acting justly, and judging as is correct. More precisely, some men believe as their
predecessors do that there must be judgement so that He himself is powerful, a
topic that is mentioned before these verses: if a ruler comes up against you,
do not give way. Should we not be sad
therefore if we seem to be humble in this world, and know from the face of the
devil, that the foolish are raised and the rich thrown down? If we know that
slaves have the ranks of their masters and rulers do the work of their
slaves. Remember though that this horse
is seen in a good context, just as in the verse, which says, "and riding
will be your salvation". [Hab. 3, 8.]
