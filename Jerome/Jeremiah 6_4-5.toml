(Verse 4, 5.) Woe to us, because the day has declined, because the shadows in the evening have become longer (or have failed). Arise and let us ascend in the night, and let us scatter its houses (or its foundations). They say: Arise, and let us ascend at noon, and let us fight in the clear light. Those respond: Woe to us, because the shadows in the evening have become longer. According to that line from Virgil (Eclogue I):

And now the tops of the distant villas smoke: And the shadows of the mountains fall higher. And the meaning is: If we suffer these things during the day, what will we suffer at night? And again, those who spoke before, saying: Sanctify war upon it, and rise up, now challenge themselves to fight, saying: Arise, and let us ascend in the night: so that our adversaries may know that victory is not a matter of time, but of strength: and let us scatter the houses, which are vainly fortified by the strength of walls.
