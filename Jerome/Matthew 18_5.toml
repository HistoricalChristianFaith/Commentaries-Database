Whoever receives one such child in my name receives me. Whoever lives so as to imitate Christ’s humility and innocence, in him Christ is taken up. And he is careful to add—so that when the apostles heard of it, they would not think that they had been honored—that they would not be taken up for their merit but for the honor of the master.

(Verse 5.) And whoever receives such a little child in my name, receives me. And whoever is such, that he imitates the humility and innocence of Christ, in him Christ is received. And wisely, lest when it is reported to the apostles, they should think themselves honored, he added that they should be received not through their own merit, but through the honor of the master.
