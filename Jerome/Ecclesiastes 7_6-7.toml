"It is
better to hear the rebuke of the wise, than for a man to hear the song of
fools. For as the crackling of thorns
under the pot, so is the laughter of the fool: this too is vanity. "For it is better to be rebuked by a wise man, than to
be deceived by flattering praise. 
Similar to this is the passage which says, "better are the wounds
of a friend, than the free kisses of an enemy" [Prov. 27, 6.]. Just as the sound of sharp thorns under the
pot gives out a harsh sound, so the words of a flattering teacher are not of
any use, or the worries of the world, which are interpreted as 'thorns', or the
sound of one who encourages his listeners, or of one who prepares them for the
fire which is to come. Let us look at
what Symmachus has to say about the passage that we have as "since just as
the soundâ€¦fool." Understanding the
meaning which we have already explained above, he says, 'for a man is bound in
chains by the voice of the ignorant". 
This means that one listener is tied up to the word of such teachers,
while the chains of his sins restrain another.
