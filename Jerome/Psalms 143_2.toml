It is clear from all this that there are two kinds of perfections in holy Scripture, and two kinds of justices and two kinds of fears. The first kind of perfection, and its comparable truth, and perfect justice and fear, which is the beginning of wisdom, are compatible with the virtues of God; but the second kind of perfection, which befits not only human beings but also every living creature, and our weakness, according to what is said in the Psalms: “In your sight no one living shall be justified,” is the kind of justice that is called perfect, not in comparison with God but according to the knowledge of God. Job, Zachariah and Elizabeth are called just, according to this latter type of perfection, which can change on occasions into injustice, and not according to the former type, which can never change, of which it is said, “I am God, and I change not.”

Atticus: From this5 it is clear that people are called righteous and said to be without fault; but that, if negligence comes over them, they may fall. [It is also clear] that a person always occupies a middle place, so that he may slip from the height of virtue into vice or may rise from vice to virtue. He is never safe but must dread shipwreck even in fair weather. Therefore, a person cannot be without sin. Solomon says, “There is not a righteous person on earth that does good and sins not.” Likewise in the book of Kings [2 Chronicles]: “There is no one that sins not.” So, also, the blessed David says, “Who can understand his errors? Cleanse me from hidden faults, and keep back your servant from presumptuous sins.” And again, “Enter not into judgment with your servant, for in your sight shall no one living be justified.” Holy Scripture is full of passages to the same effect.
