(Verse 42) When I bring you into the land of Israel, the land that I raised my hand to give to your ancestors, then you will know that I am the Lord. I will bring you into the land of Israel, the land that I raised my hand to give to your ancestors, and which they lost due to their own fault. But you, you have received it not by your own merit, but by my mercy.
