(Verse 57, 58.) And when it was evening, there came a rich man from Arimathea, named Joseph, who was also a disciple of Jesus. He went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded the body to be given. The mention of Joseph being rich is not to boast of the writer, but to show why he was able to obtain Jesus' body from Pilate. It would not have been possible for a poor and unknown person to approach Pilate, the governor of Roman authority, and obtain the body of someone who had been crucified. In another passage of the Evangelist (Luke 23), Joseph is called βουλευτὴς, that is, counselor, and some believe that the first psalm was composed about him: Blessed is the man who does not walk in the counsel of the wicked, and so on.
