(Verse. 45 seqq.) Your mother Hethaea (also spelled Chethaea), and your father Amorrhaeus, and your older sister Samaria: she and her daughters who live on your left. But your younger sister, who lives on your right, is Sodom and her daughters. But you did not walk in their ways, nor did you commit crimes like theirs, but rather, you committed even more wicked things in all your ways. LXX: Your mother Chethaea, and your father Amorrhaeus, your older sister Samaria: she and her daughters who live on your left, and your younger sister, who lives on your right, is Sodom and her daughters: and even so, you did not walk in her ways, nor did you act according to her wickedness, but rather, you transgressed against them in all your ways. He had said above: your father is Amorrhæan, and your mother Chethæan; here with the order and number changed: Your mother is Chethæan, and your father is Amorrhæan. For when they have advanced in wickedness, they are divided into parts; and deserted unity, they make progress into a tumult and multitude, which is not able to ascend to the mountains with Jesus. But Jerusalem is the sister of Samaria, and Sodom, of which one is on the left, the other on the right, even according to the carnal understanding, if you look from the temple at Jerusalem towards the East, you will approve. Majorca is said to be Samaria, because it sinned first and was led into captivity by the Assyrians; and Minor and younger Sodom, which is related to a multitude of nations. Otherwise, at that time Sodom was not there, which we read about before in the Scriptures, with Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboiim, it was destroyed by divine fire (Gen. 19). However, in between the two sisters, Jerusalem, which is also called Judah, was led into Babylon by the Chaldeans; and Jerusalem sinned much more wickedly than Samaria and Sodom, worshipping the idol of Baal in the temple, and later killing the Son of God. Furthermore, according to tropology, Samaria and Sodom, that is, heretics and the Gentiles, often commit less serious sins than those who are considered Jerusalem, that is, the Ecclesiastics. Therefore, it is said to the Corinthians, who indeed believed in Christ but were oppressed by evil works: Certainly there is heard among you fornication, and such fornication that not even among the Gentiles, so that one has his father's wife (I Cor. V, 1), and so on. The heretics, however, who still accept the old Testament, understand three natures from this place: spiritual, animal, and earthly. And they refer the spiritual to Jerusalem; the animal to Samaria; the earthly to Sodom. Let us briefly ask them how the three natures, spiritual, animal, and earthly, which are certainly distinct from each other, are said to have one mother and one father? This does not correspond to their fabrication. And how will the animal and earthly nature be restored to their original state, that is, the spiritual state, according to this same prophet? This is contrary to their own reasoning. Moreover, the understanding that Samaria refers to heresies is confirmed in the prophet Hosea and many other places, especially by this testimony: Woe to those who despise Zion and trust in the mountain of Samaria, they have taken the firstfruits of the nations (Amos 6:1). For all heretics despise Zion, which is interpreted as a watchtower, and is referred to the Church; and they trust in themselves on the mountain of Samaria, namely in the pride of perverse doctrines, which they think are sublime, and through these fraudulent preachings, they plunder and pillage the beginnings of nations, so that, through the wonder of teachings, they may draw even the powerful ones of the Gentiles into heretical error.
