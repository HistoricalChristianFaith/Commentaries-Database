(Verse 18, 19.) Behold, a certain ruler came forward and worshipped him, saying: My daughter has just died; but come, lay your hand upon her, and she will live. And Jesus arose and followed him, and so did his disciples. The eighth sign is in which the ruler asks for his daughter to be raised, not wanting to be excluded from the mystery of true circumcision; but a woman who had been flowing with blood enters, and is healed in the eighth place, so that the ruler's daughter comes as the ninth, according to what is said in the Psalms: Ethiopia will stretch out her hands to God (Psalm 67:32). And so, all Israel will be saved; as it is written: 'The Deliverer will come out of Zion, and He will turn away ungodliness from Jacob; for this is My covenant with them, when I take away their sins.' (Romans 11:25-26).
