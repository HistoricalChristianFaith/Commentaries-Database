(Chapter 10, Verse 2.) The sons of Japheth were Gomer, Magog, Madai, Javan, Tubal, Meshech, and Tiras. Japheth, son of Noah, had seven sons who possessed the land in Asia from Mount Amanus and Mount Taurus to the mountains of Syria Coele and Cilicia, all the way to the River Tanais. In Europe, they journeyed as far as Gades, leaving names to places and tribes: many of these were later changed, but others remain as they were. Gomer became the Galatians, Magog became the Scythians, Madai became the Medes, Javan became the Ionians, also known as the Greeks, hence the Ionian Sea. Thubal the Iberians, who are also called Hispani, from whom the Celtiberi, although some suspect they are Italians. Mosoch, the Cappadocians, from whom the city is still called Mazaca among them. (Furthermore, the Septuagint interpreters consider the Cappadocians to be the Caphthorim.) Thiras, the Thracians, whose name has not been sufficiently changed. I know that someone named Gog and Magog, both from present location and from Ezekiel, recently related a story of the Goths who were recently reveling in our land, which is demonstrated to be true by the end of the battle itself. And certainly all the educated Goths, more accustomed to call the Getae than Gog and Magog. Therefore, these seven nations, which I mentioned came from the line of Japheth, inhabit the northern part.
