(Verse 29.) But I say to you, I will not drink from this fruit of the vine from now on until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom. He transitions from the physical to the spiritual, citing that the vineyard transplanted from Egypt is the people of Israel, to whom the Lord speaks through Jeremiah: I planted you a true vine, but how you have turned into the bitter fruit of a foreign vine (Jeremiah 2:21). And the prophet Isaiah sings in a song to his beloved, and the entire Scripture testifies accordingly. He says, therefore, that he will in no way drink of this vine until the kingdom of his Father comes. The kingdom of the Father, I believe, is the faith of believers, as the Apostle also confirms: The kingdom of God is within you (Luke 17:21). Therefore, when the Jews have received the kingdom of the Father (notice that he says Father, not God), every Father is named the Son. When, I say, they have believed in God the Father, and the Father has brought them to the Son, then the Lord will drink of their wine, and, reigning in Egypt in the likeness of Joseph, he will be intoxicated with his brothers (Genesis 43).
