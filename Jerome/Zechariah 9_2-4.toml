(Vers. 2 seqq.) Emath quoque in terminis ejus, et Tyrus et Sidon: assumpserunt quippe sibi sapientiam valde. Et aedificavit Tyrus munitionem suam, et coacervavit argentum quasi humum, et aurum ut lutum  platearum. Ecce Dominus possidebit eam, et percutiet in mari fortitudinem ejus, et haec igne devorabitur. LXX: Emath in finibus ejus Tyrus et Sidon: quoniam sapientes fuerunt nimis, et aedificavit Tyrus munitionem suam, et congregavit argentum ut humum, et aurum ut lutum viarum. Therefore the Lord will possess it, and strike its strength in the sea, and it will be consumed by fire. Emath, which is interpreted as 'wrath,' that is, indignation, is the one which received the name Epiphania from Antiochus Epiphanes, and now it is the city of Coele Syria. And thus, both Tyre and Sidon will be in the borders of Damascus, or in the borders of the land of Adrach, so that they may believe in the Lord Savior, to whom it was said by the Father: Ask of me, and I will give you the nations as your inheritance, and the ends of the earth as your possession (Ps. 2:8). The daughters of this Tyre, that is, the souls of those who believe in Christ, will bring gifts to the king, so that what is written may be fulfilled: The daughters of Tyre will worship him with gifts (Psalm 44:13). And when the city of God, the Church, is built, of which the Psalmist sings: Glorious things are said of you, O city of God (Psalm 86:2), then the following will immediately come: Behold, foreigners, Tyre, and the people of Ethiopia, these were born there (ibid., 56:4). In two psalms it is said of aliens: Aliens serve me, or are subject to me. In the prophet Zephaniah we read about the Ethiopians: From beyond the rivers of Ethiopia my worshipers, my dispersed ones, will bring me offerings (Zep. 3:10). And in the Psalm: Ethiopia will stretch out her hands to God (Ps. 68:31). But the Gospel speaks of Tyre: Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes (Matt. 11:21). That Canaanite woman from the territory of Tyre and Sidon, whose daughter was badly possessed by a demon, encountered the Lord and Savior (Mark VII); and she dedicated the first fruits of faith of the Tyrians and Sidonians, so that those who did not believe at the time of Christ because they had not yet seen signs and wonders, would later see them through the apostles and believe, and be partakers of that blessedness which the Lord promised, saying: Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed (John XX, 29). But Tyre and Sidon (of which one signifies 'narrowness', that is, constraint; the other 'hunting', that is, hunting, according to interpretation) took for themselves such great wisdom, that they proposed to Solomon, that is, the peaceful king, their enigmas, along with their sophisms and the nets of the dialecticians and the intricate web of the sophists, which the Scripture records as their fortifications. They amassed for themselves their silver, which is the brightness of eloquence, and their gold, which is cunning of the senses, gathered together like dust and mud in the streets and roads, in order to possess the kingdom of idolatry which they had fortified. But the Apostle speaks against these fortifications: For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but powerful to God, for the destruction of fortifications: destroying thoughts and every height that exalts itself against the knowledge of God (II Cor. X, 4, 5). And in the persona of Nineveh, which is interpreted as adorned, or beautiful (for nothing is more adorned than the world), God speaks through the prophet against the people of the world: And you will be drunk and despised, and you will seek help from your enemy: all your fortifications, like figs with their clusters, if they are shaken, they will fall into the mouth of the eater. And so the Lord will possess both Tyre and Sidon, when he strikes down their strength in the most salty and bitter sea of this age, and nothing of their former wisdom remains, that is, their swelling foolishness, through which they acquired weak fortifications, and silver and gold similar to clay. He will burn them with fire and purify them completely, as the Savior speaks of in the Gospel: I have come to send fire on the earth, and how I wish it were already kindled (Luke XII, 49), according to what is written in Mark: Everyone will be salted with fire (Mark IX, 48).
