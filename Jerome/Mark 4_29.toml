For the seed is the word of life, the ground is the human heart, and the sleep of the man means the death of the Saviour. The seed springs up night and day, because after the sleep of Christ, the number of Christians, through calamity and prosperity, continued to flourish more and more in faith, and to wax greater in deed.
But when He says, “Heknoweth not how,” He is speaking in a figure; that is, He does not make known to us, who amongst us will produce fruit unto the end.
That is, fear. For “the fear of God is the beginning of wisdom. Then the full corn in the ear;” Or because we must not only put forth leaves by obedience, but also learn prudence, and, like the stalk of corn, remain upright without minding the winds which blow us about. We must also take heed to our soul by a diligent recollection, that, like the ears, we may bear fruit, that is, show forth the perfect operation of virtue.
The sickle is death or the judgment, which cuts down all things; the harvest is the end of the world.
