(Verse 17.) All hands will be dissolved, and all knees will flow with water. And they will gird themselves with sackcloth, and terror will cover them. For knees flowing with water, Seventy have moved, thighs are polluted with moisture. But when all are trembling, and fleeing to the mountains, all hands will be dissolved, and no one will be able to resist the enemies, and with the magnitude of fear, urine will pollute the knees: and the bladder will not be able to contain the flowing waters. They will gird themselves with sackcloth, and trembling will possess all things. This happened among that people, not only under the Babylonians, but also under the Romans, when the wrath of God came upon them to the very end. Moreover, it happened in our own Judea, where the confession of the Lord is, when iniquities have multiplied and the love of many has grown cold, all the hands of good works will be dissolved, and all knees, or thighs, will flow with the waters of those who have sought unlawful unions, and who, in the law, are called eunuchs, that is, those sustaining a flow of semen and are called unclean by Scripture. Whereas those who are such, should gird themselves with the hairshirts of repentance, and fear the impending judgement. And whoever does this, will merit to hear Isaiah saying: Strengthen the weak hands, and make firm the feeble knees (Isaiah 35:3).
