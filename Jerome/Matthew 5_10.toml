For righteousness' sake He adds expressly, for many suffer persecution for their sins, and are not therefore righteous. Likewise consider how the eighth beatitude of the true circumcision is terminated by martyrdom.

(Verse 10.) Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness' sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Notice that it explicitly adds (or, says), for righteousness' sake. For many endure persecution for their own sins and are not righteous. Also, consider that the blessedness of true circumcision is ultimately achieved through martyrdom.
