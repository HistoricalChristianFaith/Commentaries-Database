(Vers. 8 seqq.) And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house, and his hands shall finish it: and you shall know that the Lord of hosts hath sent me to you. For who hath despised the day of small things? and they shall rejoice, and shall see the tin in the hand of Zerubbabel. These seven are the eyes of the Lord, which run to and fro through the whole earth. LXX: And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house, and his hands shall complete it. And you will know that the Lord Almighty has sent me to you. For who has despised the day of small things? They will rejoice and see the plumb line in the hand of Zerubbabel: these seven eyes of the Lord, which scan throughout the whole earth. Many things are said by the Hebrews and by our own people, some of whom follow them and others reject them. Let us bring forth what pleases us, preserving the truth of history, so that from this we may recognize the one who is prophesied through history. The hands of Zerubbabel, the leader of the Jews who returned from Babylon, laid the foundation of the temple, and his hands will also complete it, reaching up to the pinnacle of the temple. They will fulfill what they began and will construct everything that was started. We read in Ezra that the temple was started and completed by Zerubbabel (1 Esdras 4 and 6). And when, says the prophet Zechariah, you see the pinnacle placed on the temple that you are now building, then you will understand that I have been sent by the Lord and that everything I have spoken, I have spoken at his command. For who despises small days? Who here is received as rare, according to that: Who do you think is a faithful and wise steward (Luke XII, 42)? And, Lord, who shall dwell in your tabernacle, and who shall ascend to your holy mountain (Psalm XIV, 1)? Therefore, rare is the one who despises the small days of this age, and thinks royal power is worth nothing. When we see the powerful of the age shining with gold, purple, and gleaming with gems, surrounded by an army, let us say within ourselves: who, do you think, despises small days? And so Jacob, understanding the brevity of human life, said: 'They are short and the worst days of my life' (Gen. XLVII, 9). Therefore, those who despise the short days (which refers to royal power, as a reminder to Zerubbabel, Joshua, and the people building the temple of God, not to fear their adversaries but to listen to the Lord encouraging them) will rejoice and see the help of the Savior, who is promised from the lineage of Zerubbabel, and is called the cornerstone and the stone of tin: For which it is written in Hebrew as Abdil (Al. Abdel), because it is the wall and strength and firmness of the believers. For just as tin protects other metals from fire, and although copper and iron are extremely hard by nature, if they do not have tin, they become consumed and burnt; so too, the strength of every angel and human, if they do not have the help of the Savior, is revealed as weak and fragile. But this stone, that is, the mass, which is called Abdil among the Hebrews, that is, tinstone, is etymologically derived from the word ἀποχωρίζων, that is separating and segregating, just as tin separates and dissociates mixed and adulterated metals through fire. Thus the true Lord, the assayer and refiner, separates good works as gold and silver from vices as lead, so that pure gold and silver may remain. In other words, ἀποχωρίζων is written as 'separating' in the Gospel: Whose winnowing fork is in his hand, and he will thoroughly clean out his threshing floor, and gather the wheat into his barn; but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire (Luke 3:17), he who speaks through Jeremiah: What have straw to do with grain? says the Lord (Jeremiah 23:28). Many of us interpret Zerubbabel, who laid the foundation of the temple and completed it, as Christ. And if we accept this, we will be forced to explain what the stone of tin in the hand of Zerubbabel means. For indeed in the hand of Christ, is Christ to be approved? For although certain people have received a stone-like body of the Lord, which was not defiled by any stains of sins, nor called lead, but the purest tin. However, we have previously explained that the seven eyes that roam throughout the whole earth and judge all things are the seven spirits: and that nothing escapes God's knowledge, who is conscious of past, present, and future events, and renders to each person according to their deeds, especially when he comes in the person of the one who separates the good from the evil, and the inflator.
