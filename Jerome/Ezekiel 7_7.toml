(Ver. 7.) The time has come, the day of slaughter is near, and not the glory of the mountains. The Hebrew word Adarim, which we have divided into two words, first Ad, second Arim, according to Theodotion, we have translated as the glory of the mountains. Symmachus translates it as the restoration, and he said: And the time is near: the day of hastening, not of restoration. Moreover, the LXX translates it as: The time has come, the day is approaching, not with disturbance, nor with pains. Theodotio: The time has come, the day of hunger is near, and not the day of glory for the mountains. It is also a time of slaughter, and even now it is evident among the Jewish people, who have no prophets or the word of God to nourish the souls of believers. But understand, O mountains, you who have knowledge of the Scriptures. As it is said elsewhere: 'You shine forth wondrously from the eternal mountains' (Psalm 75:5). Furthermore, the Seventy who said 'not with disturbance, and not with pains' signify that they have such great ignorance of God and blindness of soul, that they are not troubled by their sins, and are not tormented by the pains of repentance.
