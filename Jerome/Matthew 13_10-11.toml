(Verse 10, 11.) And the disciples came and said to him, 'Why do you speak to them in parables?' He answered them, 'To you it has been given to know the secrets of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it has not been given. For to the one who has, more will be given, and he will have an abundance, but from the one who has not, even what he has will be taken away. This is why I speak to them in parables, because seeing they do not see, and hearing they do not hear, nor do they understand.' It is necessary to inquire how the disciples approach him while Jesus is sitting in the boat, unless it is understood that they had recently boarded the boat with him and there, standing, were asking about the interpretation of the parable.
