(Verse 9.) Our Father, who art in heaven. By calling Him Father, let them confess themselves to be His sons.

Hallowed be thy name. Not in you, but in us. For if because of sinners the name of God is blasphemed among the nations (Rom. VIII), on the contrary, because of the righteous it is sanctified.
