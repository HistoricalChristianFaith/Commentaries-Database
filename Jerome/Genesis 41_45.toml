Verse 7. "And the overseer of the eunuchs imposed names upon them, calling Daniel Belteshazzar (Balthasar), and Hananiah Shadrach, and Mishael Meshach, and Azariah Abednego." It was not only the overseer or master of the eunuchs (as others have rendered it, the "chief-eunuch") who changed the names of saints, but also Pharaoh called Joseph in Egypt Somtonphanec (Genesis 41:45), for neither of them wished them to have Jewish names in the land of captivity. Wherefore the prophet says in the Psalm: "How shall we sing the Lord's song in a strange land?" (Psalm 137:4). Furthermore the Lord Himself changes names benignly, and on the basis of events imposes names of special significance, so as to call Abram Abraham (Genesis 17:5), and Sarai Sarah (Genesis 17:15). Also in the Gospel, the former Simon received the name of Peter (Mark 3:16), and the sons of Zebedee are called "sons of thunder" (Mark 3:17) - which is not boanerges, as most people suppose, but is more correctly read benereem.

(Verse 45) And Pharaoh called Joseph's name Saphaneth Phanee, and he gave him Aseneth, the daughter of Potiphera, priest of Heliopolis, as his wife. Although this name sounds like the revealer of hidden things in Hebrew, because it is Egyptian, it must have its own meaning in that language. Therefore, it is interpreted in the Egyptian language as Saphaneth Phanee, or as the Seventy wished to translate it, Psomthom-Phanech, the Savior of the world, because he delivered the world from impending famine. It should be noted, however, that the Lord once took the daughter of His owner as a wife, who was the high priest of Heliopolis in that place. For it is not right for the priests of that idol to be without eunuchs, so that the suspicion regarding what we have already said may be confirmed.
