"Let us hear the conclusion of the whole
matter: Fear God, and keep his commandments: for this is the whole duty of
man. For God shall bring every work into
judgement, with every secret thing, whether it be good, or whether it be
evil. "The Hebrews say that although it used to be among other
writings of Solomon in the past, they have not persisted in memory; and this
book seems as if it ought to have been omitted, because it asserts that all
God's creations are vain and that he thinks everything is done for nothing, and
he prefers food and drink and transient pleasures to all things; thus he takes
his authority from this one title, so it is now included in the number of
divine books, because he argues well and lists many things like "anakephaiosei, "and he said that his
speeches are the easiest to hear, and to understand; let us therefore fear God
and carry out his commandments. For man
is born for this purpose and, understanding his Creator, he reveres Him in fear
and respect, and in the work of his commandments. And when the time of judgement comes whatever
we have done will stand before the judge and for a long time we will await our
judgement which could go one way or the other, and we will receive our just
rewards, whether they be good or bad. 
But where we read, "with every secret thing", Symmachus and the
Septuagint have interpreted, "from all contempt", or even "from
all unknown", which even brought by reluctant words, not by will, but by
ignorance, we will be returned to reason in the day of our judgement. Differently: since fear is more appropriate
to slaves, and perfect love involves no fear, and fear in the divine Scripture
is used to denote those embarking on and those completing education [Cfr. I. Ioh. 4, 18.]. Now I think he talks about the fear inherent
in virtues, according to the passage, which says, "nothing is lacking from
those who fear Him" [Ps. 33, 10.]. Or even, since until now he is a man and has
not yet taken the name of God, he has this reason of his wealth, so that he
fears God while he is still alive. Since
every single deed is judged, that is, God leads all men into judgement about
all things, either good or bad, which are done and said differently than by
Him. For indeed, "woe to those who
say wicked is good, and good is wicked" [Is. 5, 20.].
