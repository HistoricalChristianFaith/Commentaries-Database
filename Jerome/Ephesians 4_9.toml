But what is it that ascends except that which also descends into the lower parts of the earth? He who is said to have ascended, ascended because he had descended before. This means: 'But what is it that ascends except that which has also descended.' Therefore, we must look into that which is written elsewhere: 'No one has ascended into heaven except he who descended from heaven, the Son of Man' (John 3:13), how did he ascend before descending? For when he spoke these words, he had already descended from heaven and was showing how he had once ascended to heaven. Similarly, we must consider how the descent and ascent are to be understood. Whether it was a physical descent and ascent or a spiritual one, or perhaps both. The lower parts of the earth refer to hell, into which our Lord and Savior descended in order to bring with him the souls of the saints who were held captive there, triumphantly leading them to heaven. This is why, after his resurrection, many bodies of the righteous were seen in the holy city (Matthew 27:52-53). That hell is located in the lower part of the earth is confirmed by the Psalmist who says: 'The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, and covered the company of Abiram' (Psalm 106:17). This is further explained in the Book of Numbers (Chapter 16). We also read elsewhere: 'Let death come deceitfully upon them; and let them go down alive into Hell' (Psalm 55:15).
