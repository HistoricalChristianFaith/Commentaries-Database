(Verse 17, 18.) Truly I say to you, many prophets and righteous men desired to see what you see, and did not see; and to hear what you hear, and did not hear. Therefore, listen to the parable of the sower. It seems that this passage is contrary to what is said elsewhere: Abraham desired to see my day, and he saw it, and rejoiced (John 8:56). However, it is not said that all the prophets and righteous men desired to see what you see, but many. Among many, it can happen that some have seen it, while others have not seen it: although even in this interpretation is dangerous, as we seem to make any discretion among the merits of the saints. Therefore Abraham saw in an enigma, he did not see in form: but you hold him in the present, and you have your Lord, and you question him at will, and you dine with him.
