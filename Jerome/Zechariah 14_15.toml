(Verse 15) And so there will be the destruction of horses, and mules, and camels, and donkeys, and all the livestock that were in those camps, just like this destruction. LXX: And this will be the destruction of horses and mules, camels and donkeys, and all the livestock that were in those camps, in accordance with this destruction. And the Jews strive to fulfill this, according to their carnal interpretation. Truly, the strength of the Lord is great, so that the horses, mules, camels, and donkeys, and all their livestock fall in the enemy camps, just as the men had fallen (or will fall). Great triumph, glorious victory, beasts are defeated by God fighting. Let us therefore say, according to the beginning of tropology: so that all the evils that previously fought against the Church may fall, so that the goods may suddenly arise. Finally, he who was previously a horse neighing after the wife of his neighbor (Jeremiah 5), and was carried away by lust, and lay in the filth of pleasures: when he begins to follow chastity, it will be said to him: Rise, let us go from here (John 14, 31). And: Arise, come, my love (Song of Solomon 2:10). And in the Apostle: Awake, thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light (Ephesians 5:14). And when those horses rise up that have fallen before, and have offered their soft backs to the Lord to sit upon, they shall say to God: Mount upon thy horses, and thy riding is salvation (Habakkuk 3:8). According to this sense, let us consider mules, which are barren and do not produce offspring; but they indulge in pleasure: of whom the Psalmist speaks: Be not like to horse and mule, which have no understanding (Psalm 31:9). So just as those who are inclined to lust are called horses, so we shall rightly call those who are virgins in the flesh and not in the spirit, mules. And those who are castrated not for the sake of the kingdom of heaven, but for the pleasure of men. Therefore, when these mules and eunuchs have been turned into offspring and have begotten spiritual children, they will hear through Isaiah: 'And let not the eunuch say: Behold I am a dry tree.' For thus says the Lord to the eunuchs, who keep my Sabbaths and choose the things that please me and hold fast to my covenant: I will give them a place in my house and within my walls, a name better than sons and daughters; an everlasting name will I give them, that shall never be cut off (Isaiah 56:3-5). The kings of Israel, especially David, are said to have had many male and female donkeys, which is related to Christ (2 Kings 13 and 1 Kings 3). If we understand what the running and rising horses and donkeys are, let us move on to camels, a ruminant animal that does not have a divided hoof (Leviticus 11). And let us say that all the sinners of the earth are like camels, who are weighed down by the heavy burden of sins, and they seem to read the holy Scriptures to themselves, but they do not have a divided hoof, rumination the divine words and neglecting what is written. But a camel can more rightly be called the people of the Jews, who themselves meditate upon the Law of God, and chew it over and turn it in their hearts, but do not split the hoof, so that they may believe in the Father and in the Son; and in this they are unclean, because they never separate the letter from the spirit, the shadow from the truth, and they bear the burden of the Law, and they hear through the prophet: Woe, sinful nation, people full of offenses (Isaiah 1:4). Concerning this kind of camel who chews and does not split the hoof, it is said in Proverbs as if to a son: Whoever forsakes the discipline of his father will meditate on evil speeches (Proverbs 21). Let us cross over to the donkey, who once was carried unbridled and unclean, and had many masters, and slid down the steep slopes, so that he would rise up suddenly when falling, and carry the Lord Savior, and enter into holy Jerusalem, and be received by a crowd of believing children triumphantly (Matt. XXI and John XII). It is said that the Savior tied this donkey to the vine and the vineyard (Gen. XLIX, 11), of which it is written in the Psalms: You brought the vine out of Egypt, and drove out the nations, and planted it (Ps. LXXIX, 9). To which the vinedresser himself says: I planted you a fruitful vineyard, a wholly true (Jer. II, 21). Likewise, all the beasts and animals, which the prophet comprehends under one name, are to be interpreted according to the nature of each one, and this is more fitting for the Son of God than for those things which the foolish people of the Jews presume to prophesy.
