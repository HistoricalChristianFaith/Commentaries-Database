"Guard
your foot when you go to the House of God; better to draw near and hearken than
to offer the sacrifices of fools, for they do not consider that they do
evil." He gives some general precepts for life, and does not
want to offend us, who go to church. 
Since it is praiseworthy in his view, not just to enter the House of
God, but to enter without offence. And
if it was intended for all who are in the church of God to hear this passage,
he would never have added, "and approach so that you might hear". But then it was only Moses who approached near
to God to hear [Cfr Ex. 24, 2.],
the other men were not allowed. For the
foolish commit sins, not knowing that there is a remedy; they think that they
can satisfy God with the offering of gifts, and do not know that this is also
evil and a sin; for they want to make correction for what they have done, not
with obedience and good work, but with gifts and sacrifice. What others have said elsewhere agrees with
this too: "obedience above sacrifice" [I Reg. 15, 21.]. And "I want pity and not
sacrifice". [Os. 6, 6.]
