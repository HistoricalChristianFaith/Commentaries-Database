(Verse 17, 18.) Then Jesus began to preach and say, 'Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is near.' And as Jesus was walking by the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon called Peter and his brother Andrew, casting a net into the sea; for they were fishermen. And he said to them. When John was handed over, he begins to preach rightly: as the Law ends, the Gospel arises accordingly. But if the Savior preaches the same things that John the Baptist had foretold before, he shows himself to be the Son of the same God, whose prophet John was.
