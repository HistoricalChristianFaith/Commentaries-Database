“Has not this house, in which my name is invoked, been made a den of thieves before your eyes? I who am, I have seen it, says the Lord.” I believe that it was from here that the Gospel took: “It is written, ‘My father’s house will be called a house of prayer,’ but you have made it a den of thieves,” or, according to another Gospel, “a house of trade.” The church of God is turned into a den of thieves when robbery, murder, adultery, perjury, sacrilege, heretical inventions and other evils are practiced within it. When its leaders burn with greed and when cheap or not so cheap palliums [the distinctive mantle worn by archbishops] possess the riches formerly of kings. Hence, he infers, “I who am, I have seen it, says the Lord.” In other words, “My eyes have beheld what you thought was hidden. The darkness of your treasures do not escape my consciousness.” He who, though he was rich, became poor for our sake, is now ashamed at our riches and says, “Woe to you wealthy, who have your consolation now!”
