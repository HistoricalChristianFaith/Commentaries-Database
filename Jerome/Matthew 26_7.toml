(Verse 7) A woman came to him with an alabaster jar of expensive perfume, which she poured on his head as he was reclining at the table. No one should assume that she who poured the perfume on his head is the same as she who poured it on his feet. For she washes with her tears, wipes with her hair, and is clearly called a prostitute. However, nothing of this sort is written about her. For the prostitute could not immediately become worthy of the Lord's favor. Another Gospel writer placed the precious perfume in an alabaster jar (which is a type of marble), and called it pure and without deceit, to demonstrate the faith of the Church and the Gentiles.
