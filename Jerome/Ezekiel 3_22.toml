And notice this, that, standing himself in the middle of those who sat as captives, the prophet did not see the glory of God.

(Verse 22.) And there, the hand of the Lord came upon me and He said to me: rise up, go out into the field, and there I will speak with you. This phrase, \"there,\" which we have translated from the Hebrew and is not found in the Septuagint, is intentionally placed and undoubtedly signifies a specific location. For earlier we read: And I came to the captivity at Tel-abib, to those who dwelt near the river Chebar (Ezekiel 3:15). And rightly so, the one to whom he spoke, sat down, is commanded to rise up. And he who had entered into transmigration hears, 'Go forth, not into rugged valleys, not onto steep cliffs, but into the width of the fields that can contain the glory of the Lord.' Hence it is also said to the Corinthians: 'Be enlarged' (1 Corinthians 6:13). When he enters to capture the captives, of whom it is said that they are insane and persecute him, perhaps he needs a strong hand in order to resist and endure the fury of those who pursue him. But when he goes forth into the field, surely the hand of the Lord is upon him: for without his help he could not go forth, but strength is not added. For he goes out to see the glory of God, not to fight. And it should be noted that while sitting among the captives, the Prophet himself did not see the glory of the Lord.
