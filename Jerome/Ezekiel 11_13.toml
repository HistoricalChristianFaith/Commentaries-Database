(Verse 13) And it came to pass, while I was prophesying, that Phaltias son of Banajae died. And I fell on my face, crying out with a loud voice, and I said, Alas, alas, alas, Lord God, are you making an end of the remnant of Israel? As the prophet prophesied, one of the two chief princes, Phaltias son of Banajae, dies. He is interpreted as falling ruin, and he is the son of a builder or mason, for οἰκοδόμος cannot be translated into our language otherwise. Another prince is preserved unharmed, Jezonias son of Azur. Jezonias serves as his ears, that which is subaudible to the soul. Azur, on the other hand, serves as his support or help. Therefore, he who falls away from the Lord, and was in a state of very bad construction, falls rightly, as prophesied by him, whom God strengthened. But he who obeys the commands of God, and is sustained and supported by his help, rightly remains in the leadership of the people. We read in Exodus (Chapter II), after Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, died, the sons of Israel groaned from the works of mud, straw, and bricks, and cried out to the Lord, whom they could not cry out to while he was alive. Isaiah also (Chapter VI), after the death of King Uzziah, who was leprous, saw the Lord sitting on a high and lofty throne, and the Seraphim standing around him; and understanding that his lips were unclean, and he dwelt among a people with unclean lips, he deserved to have a hot coal sent from the altar, and his lips were cleansed of impurity. In this situation, with the strength of God prophesying, the prince who had turned away from the service of the Lord falls in order to be elevated by Christ. For if the resurrection is of the Lord, then the downfall is of the devil. In this, it is sought how it is spoken of the Savior. Behold, here He is placed in ruin, and the resurrection of many in Israel (Luke II, 34). In the ruin of those who were standing wickedly, and in the resurrection of those who had fallen. When the prophet saw this, he fell on his face, not by the merit of sinning, but by the affection of lamenting; and with a loud voice, which came from great fervor of faith, he cried out three times, and said, Alas, alas, alas, O Lord God, are you bringing about the consummation of the remnant of Israel? And there is this understanding: Even the remnants themselves, which seemed to exist in the people, are destroyed when you are displeased.
