(Vers. 10 seqq.) Because this is what the Lord says: When seventy years are completed in Babylon, I will visit you, and I will fulfill my good word to bring you back to this place. For I know the thoughts that I think towards you, says the Lord, thoughts of peace and not of affliction, to give you a future and a hope. Then you will call upon me, and you will go and pray to me, and I will listen to you. You will seek me and find me when you search for me with all your heart, and I will be found by you (or I will appear to you), says the Lord. Do not, he says, believe in false prophets, diviners, and dreamers of yours, who promise you the return to Jerusalem soon. For unless seventy years are completed, while Cyrus, the king of the Persians, releases the captives, you will not return to your homeland; and then I will fulfill my promises, to bring you back to this place: For I know the thoughts that I think about you, says the Lord. It is said that we know what he thinks, but they, together with their prophets, gods, and dreamers, are ignorant. The knowledge of the future, therefore, belongs only to God. 'I will give you,' he says, 'an end and patience: the end of captivity and the patience of present struggles, or the hope of the future. Then you will call on me and go to Jerusalem: and you will pray, and I will hear you. Certainly, without the invocation and prayer of the captives, the Lord could fulfill what he promised; but he encourages them to pray, so that they may deserve to receive what was promised. You seek me, and you will find me, when you seek with all your heart; according to that Gospel: Ask and you shall receive, seek and you shall find, knock and it shall be opened to you (Matt. VII, 7). According to the anagoge, we are immersed in the confusion of this world as long as we merit to receive the rest of the sevenfold number, and having received penance, may God fulfill what He has promised, and may we be restored to our place in the Church. Therefore, the Lord has seemed to strike us in order to heal us: He will give us an end to our labor and patience: and we will call upon Him, and return to the Church, and we will pray, and be heard: we will seek and find Him when we have sought Him with all our heart, and then He will appear to us. Some interpret seventy years according to what is written: The days of our years in them are seventy years (Psalm 89:10), which when completed, we shall return to the Lord with all our heart, and we shall be heard, and the end of our labor and patience shall come: for now we possess all things in shadow and in image.
