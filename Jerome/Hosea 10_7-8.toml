"He made his king pass like foam over the face of the water of Samaria, and the high places of idols shall be destroyed, the sin of Israel." LXX: "He has cast out his king from Samaria as a brand on the face of the water, and the altars will be removed." For "foam," which the LXX and Theodotion translated as φρύγανον, that is, "brand," Symmachus has placed ἐπίζεμα, wanting to show the upper waters of boiling water, and the foam and bubbles rising, which the Greeks call πομφόλυγας. Therefore, just as spume over the water dissolves quickly, so the kingdom of the ten tribes will quickly end, and the lofty places, that is, Bamoth, will perish, of which it is written: "Nevertheless, the people still sacrificed and burned incense on the high places" (3 Kings 22:44). But these lofty places are idols, or Aven, that is, idols, which are interpreted as "useless," which is a useless idol and a sin for Israel. But when the idol and its lofty places are dispersed.
