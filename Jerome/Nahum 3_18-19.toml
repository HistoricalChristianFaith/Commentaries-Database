(Verse 18 onwards) Your shepherds have fallen asleep, O king of Assyria; your princes shall be buried, your people are scattered on the mountains. There is no one to gather them, your injury is not hidden, your wound is severe. All who hear of your downfall clap their hands over you, for against whom has your evil not passed continually? Septuagint: Your shepherds have fallen asleep; the king of Assyria has fallen asleep, your strong men have gone away, your people have gone up to the mountains, and there was no one to support them, and there is no cure for your injury, your wound is swollen. All who have heard your message will applaud you, because against whom does your malice never attack? It is not surprising if your shepherds have fallen asleep, O king of Assyria, who ruled over Nineveh, and may they be buried or wander, your princes, the little kings and the rulers of all nations who once served you: when the women of your people are in the midst of your city; and the gates of the city are open to your enemies, and a multitude sits on the wall like a swarm of locusts, which flees at the approach of the scorching sun, so will Nebuchadnezzar flee from the fortifications and turn his back on the enemy, and no place will be found for him. Therefore, angry with God, because you devastated His people, O Assyria, and exalted yourself even to the heavens, where you are said to have great understanding, your city is destroyed. And with all the princes slain, who could resist your adversaries, the rest of your people, weak and ignoble, are scattered in the mountains, and there is no leader to be found who can gather them together, and from those scattered, gather an army again. Your wound is not hidden, nor is it such a blow that can be healed by the hand of physicians. All those who hear of the destruction of Nineveh and the defeat of the Assyrian king, and the once powerful city and its wounded and half-dead king, lying in his own blood and rolling around, will either be amazed at the greatness of the event and the unexpected news, and they will clasp their hands or, certainly, they will rejoice greatly and applaud you with their hands and make a joyful noise. For there is no one who can grieve over you and give tears to your destruction and wounds, because there is no one whom your malice does not always pass over. And it passes over beautifully: for the malice of the Assyrian king cannot always remain in his bones. Thus far let the order of the story be the text. But we must also, according to the Hebrew, before we discuss the Septuagint edition (for in that the meaning is far different and diverse), ascend a little from the story to the sublime, and teach that in the last prophecy of Nahum, a turning away is made to the devil, a great sense, the prince of the Assyrians, who once proudly said: By my strength I will do it, and by my wisdom I will remove the boundaries of nations, and I will break their powers, and I will shake the cities that are inhabited (Isaiah 10:13), and let it be said to him: O Lucifer, who used to rise in the morning, who used to send your flames to all the nations: how you have fallen to the earth, and you are shattered (Isaiah 14:12, 13)? Your beautiful and powerful city, Nineveh, has been destroyed, in which you presumed to have so much power that you dared to say to the Son of God: All these things have been given to me: if you fall down and worship me, I will give them to you (Matthew 4:9). Your shepherds and rulers slumbered, who did not feed the people for their salvation, but nourished them for your destruction, so that you could devour fatter sacrifices. Your entire population and the multitude of nations that once worshipped you have deserted you and your city, and have fled to the mountains, seeking refuge among the hiding places of the apostles of Christ and the learned, and in the meantime, none of your leaders are able to call back your once loyal followers. Your wound and your plague have spread throughout the whole world: all who were once deceived by your treachery have insulted you; for there is no one, or very few, whom you have not deceived at some point, and through whom your malice has not passed. And it should be noted that wherever the malice of the devil has stood, it cannot mock his downfall and wound, since it is from the shepherds and people of the king of Assyria; but wherever it passes, let it mock him, and let it resound upon his good and righteous works, as if the hands were clapping over him. And appropriately, according to the Hebrew, it has been said about the destruction of the world: in the end, it is also said about the devil himself, who was the prince of the world. For the world is placed in wickedness, it is proclaimed as a wound and a plague. But in the Septuagint it is still said to be mixed, that is, a mixture of the world, because its shepherds have slept and have been lulled to sleep by the Assyrian king; and thus it happens that while it is described among them what the Assyrian does among others, and not what he himself suffers, there is silence about the wound, plague, and killing of the devil. Woe therefore to those who are masters of perverse doctrines in Nineveh. And it is rightly said to them: Your shepherds have slumbered (Ps. CXXXI): for they have given sleep to their eyes, and slumber to their eyelids. And therefore they have not found a place for the Lord, nor a tabernacle for the God of Jacob. They have not heard of Ephrata, that is, the fruitful Church; nor have they found her in the thickets of the forests. But not only have the mixed shepherds of this generation, and the locusts, which, with impending frost, sit on the hedges, slumbered; but even the king of the Assyrians himself has been put to sleep. For the Assyrian king knows that he cannot deceive the sheep unless he first puts the shepherds to sleep. It is always the devil's endeavor to put to sleep vigilant souls. Finally, even in the Passion of the Lord, he oppresses the eyes of the apostles with a deep sleep, whom the Savior awakens and says: Watch and pray, lest you enter into temptation (Mark 14:38). And again: What I say to you, I say to all: Watch (Ibid., 13:37). And because he never stops putting to sleep those who are vigilant, whomever he deceives, and bewitches as with a sweet and pernicious song of the Sirens to make them sleep, the divine word awakens and says: Rise, you who sleep, and arise from the dead, and Christ will enlighten you (Ephesians 5:14). Therefore, with the arrival of Christ and the word of God and the teaching of the Church, and the destruction of Nineveh, once a beautiful prostitute, the people who had previously been asleep under their masters will be raised up and will hurry to the mountains of Scripture. There they will find the mountains of Moses and Joshua son of Nun; the mountains of the prophets; the mountains of the apostles and evangelists of the New Testament. And when they take refuge in such mountains and become skilled in their reading, if they do not find someone to teach them (for the harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few, Matt. IX, 37), then their zeal will be proven because they have sought refuge in the mountains, and the laziness of their teachers will be exposed: for they bring forth fruits, but there was no one to receive them. It follows: There is no healing for your fracture, your wound swells. Therefore, the mixed people of Nineveh cannot be healed, because they do not cast off their pride, and the wound is always fresh, and they are struck by the devil daily. And after all this, there is no healing for their fracture: although he may seem to be healthy, his soul is broken and crushed, struck by the hammer of the whole earth from above, and he is not healed, because he is always standing erect. But if he humbles himself and submits to Christ: God does not despise a contrite and humble heart (Ps. 50:19); And: The sacrifice acceptable to God is a broken spirit. In the end it is said: All who have heard of you will clap their hands over you. Against whom does your wickedness not always rush? When it begins, O shameless one, to endure punishments, all who have heard of it, with harmonious clapping and vocal sound, and (so to speak) with the sound and harmony of actions, will insult you and rejoice. For there is no one, or certainly very few, into whom your malice has not rushed or  has not come upon. For if the city of Nineveh has mixed shepherds and strong ones, and every false doctrine and deceitful opinion of knowledge comes from the mixture, it must be feared that there is no one upon whom the malice of the mixture has not come. And carefully observe, because it does not say: Into whom your malice has not entered, O mixture, but into whom it has not come upon. For often false dogmas shoot their arrows at us, and they desire to enter into the secret of the soul: but with us closing the gates, there certainly comes σύμμικτος (a mixed thing), and as much as it can, it rushes forth, and it always does this: but with the help of Christ the Lord, and with all watchfulness guarding (or preserving), our heart (Prov. IV), it does indeed rush forth, but it cannot enter.
