(Verse 8) But foolish women say to the wise: Give us of your oil, for our lamps are going out. They show that their lamps shine in part, and yet they do not have an inexhaustible light, nor perpetual works. Therefore, if anyone has a virgin soul and is a lover of chastity, they should not be satisfied with mediocre things that quickly fade away and wither when the heat is turned on. Instead, they should pursue perfect virtues, so that they may have eternal light.
