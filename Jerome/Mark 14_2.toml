Let us now sprinkle our book, and our thresholds, with blood, and put the scarlet thread around the house of our prayers, and bind scarlet on our hand, as was done to Zarah . For the Evangelist, being about to speak of the slaying of Christ, premises, “After two days was the feast of the Passover, and of unleavened bread.”.
But iniquity came forth in Babylon from the princes, who ought to have purified the temple and the vessels, and themselves according to the law, in order to eat the lamb. Wherefore there follows: “And the Chief Priests and the Scribes sought how they might take Him by craft, and put him to death.”Now when the head is slain, the whole bodyis rendered powerless, wherefore these wretched men slay the Head. But they avoid the feast day, which indeed befits them, for what feasting can there befor them, who have lost life and mercy? Wherefore it goes on: “But they said, Noton the feast day, lest there be an uproar of the people.”
