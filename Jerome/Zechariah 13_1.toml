(Chapter 13, Verse 1) On that day there will be a flowing fountain for the house of David and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, for cleansing from sin and impurity. LXX: On that day there will be an open fountain for the house of David and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, for transformation and purification. Concerning this fountain, which is said to flow out from the house of David, it is written in the prophet Ezekiel (Ezekiel 47) that the fountain shall burst forth in the house of the Lord and become a river, which is called the water of forgiveness and indulgence; and it shall flow to the desert and the sea, which is now called the Dead Sea, and it shall give life to all kinds of fish, and trees of various kinds shall grow on both banks, bearing abundant fruit every month. And so that we may know that the house, that is, the temple of God, is itself the house of David, which in Ezekiel is called the house of God, and in Zechariah is called the house of David: this fountain, coming forth from the house of God, is brought back to the Church and to the knowledge of the Scriptures, so that we may all be reborn in Christ, and in the water of baptism our sins may be forgiven to us. Nothing is more unclean than a menstruating woman, who makes whatever she touches unclean: and yet these impurities of Christ are washed away by baptism. For the ablution of sins and menstruation, the LXX translated it as transference and sprinkling: that we may go from the Law to the Gospel, from the letter to the spirit, from the shadow to the truth, that the future and eternal may succeed the brief and present. Moreover, sprinkling signifies the blood of the Lord, about which Peter the Apostle also speaks: Grace to you and peace be multiplied, in obedience and the sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ (I Peter 1:2). And again: Knowing that you were not redeemed with corruptible things like silver and gold, but with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot (1 Peter, 18), with which whoever is sprinkled and redeemed, can say with the prophet: You shall sprinkle me, O Lord, with hyssop, and I shall be cleansed: You shall wash me, and I shall be made whiter than snow (Psalm 50, 9).
