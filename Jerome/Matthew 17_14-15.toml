(Vers. 14, 15.) Lord, have mercy on my son, for he is a lunatic and suffers greatly: for he often falls into fire and frequently into water. And I brought him to your disciples, but they could not heal him. This is why the devil, observing the course of the moon, seizes upon men and strives to defame the Creator through His creatures, as we have said above. But it seems to me, according to the spiritual interpretation, that the lunatic is one who is constantly changing to vice in the moments of the hours, not persisting in what he has begun, but growing and diminishing: and now he is carried to the fire, by which the hearts of adulterers are inflamed (Hosea VII): now to the waters, which cannot quench charity. But when he says, 'I brought him to your disciples, and they could not heal him,' he secretly accuses the apostles, since the inability to heal sometimes refers not to the weakness of those who are healing, but to the faith of those who are being healed, as the Lord says, 'Let it be done to you according to your faith' (Mark 5:34, and 10:52).
