That he hides it, does not proceed of envy towards others, but as one that treasures up what he would not lose, he hides in his heart that which he prizes above his former possessions.

Or, That treasure in which are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge (Col. 2:3.), is either God the Word, who seems hid in Christ's flesh, or the Holy Scriptures, in which are laid up the knowledge of the Saviour.

(Verse 44) The kingdom of heaven is like a hidden treasure in a field, which a man found and hid; and for joy over it he goes and sells all that he has and buys that field. Hindered by frequent obscurities of parables, we surpass the literal interpretation, so that we seem to have transitioned from one kind of interpretation to another. This treasure is either all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge hidden, or God's Word, which is seen hidden in the flesh of Christ (Colossians 2), or the holy Scriptures, in which the knowledge of the Savior is preserved: and when someone finds Him in them, they should consider all the benefits of this world as nothing in order to possess Him whom they have found. But what follows: When a man finds it, he hides it, is said not because he does this out of envy, but because out of fear of losing it, he hides it in his heart, which he preferred to his former abilities.
