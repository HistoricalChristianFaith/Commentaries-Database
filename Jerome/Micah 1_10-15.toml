(Vers. 10 seq.) In Geth, do not announce, do not weep with tears, sprinkle yourselves with dust in the house of dust: pass by, you inhabitants of Saphir (Beautiful), confused with disgrace, she who dwells in Sennan (Exit) has not come out. The lament of the house of Asel (Neighboring) will receive you: she who stood for herself, because she is weakened in good, she who dwells in Maroth (Bitterness): for evil descends from the Lord to the gate of Jerusalem. The tumult of chariots has amazed the inhabitants of Lachish, the beginning of sin is the daughter of Zion: for in you were found the wickedness of Israel? Therefore, He will send messengers over the inheritance of Gath: the houses of falsehood for deceit to the kings of Israel. Yet I will bring the heir to you, O inhabitant of Mareshah; to Adullam the glory of Israel will come. LXX: Those in Gath, do not boast; those in Beth-leaphrah, do not rebuild the house of mockery: sprinkle your mockery on the land, you who inhabit the towns! The inhabitant of Sennacherib has not come forth. Mourn for the house near her; it will receive a blow of sorrow, who has taken for good what dwells in sorrow? For evils have come down from the Lord upon the gates of Jerusalem. The sound of chariots and horsemen is heard in Lachish: the prince of sin is the daughter of Zion: for in you have been found the iniquities of Israel. Therefore, he will give emissaries to the inheritance of Gath: empty houses: they have been in vain for the kings of Israel: until I bring heirs to you, who dwell in Lachish, the inheritance will come as far as Odollam. The Hebrew greatly disagrees with the Septuagint translation, and both translations are involved in such great difficulties, both mine and theirs, that if at any time we are in need of the Spirit of God (but we always need His coming in the interpretation of holy Scriptures), now especially we desire Him to be present and to unfold what He has said in the prophets, so that it may also be understood about us, as He deigns to promise elsewhere: Open your mouth, and I will fill it (Ps. LXXX, 11). Moreover, as the history of the kingdom also testifies (1 Samuel 17), Gath is one of the five cities of Palestine, near the border of Judah, and as one travels from Eleutheropolis to Gaza, it is now just a small village or even a large hamlet, where that Philistine giant Goliath, whom David killed in battle, was from. Therefore, because the prophet, or rather the Lord through the prophet, had said, 'I will mourn and wail, I will go stripped and naked; I will make a lament like the dragons and mourn like the ostriches,' since the wound of Samaria is despairing and incurable and had come even to Judah, and had touched the gate of my people Jerusalem, therefore in a voice still lamenting I command: 'Do not announce it in Gath, lest the enemies hear and rejoice; do not weep with tears, that is, do not let even the pain burst forth into sobs; suppress your weeping, lest the adversaries rejoice, lest they have tears in their mouths while their hearts have sorrow; do not go out, but rather sprinkle yourselves with the dust of the ruins in your house, and scatter yourselves with the falling ashes.' Pass through (Al. Passes through) to you, the dwelling of Saphir (which is called beautiful in the Syro-Hebraic language). For Samaria is situated in the most beautiful part of Judaeaea, and is also abundant in resources. It is said to her: O you who dwell in the most fertile region, because you are disgraced and confused, pass through like this, be led into captivity in such a way that, because of the magnitude of your evils, not even a foreigner will hear your voice. Furthermore, what follows: She has not gone out who dwells in Sennam, which means exit, or as Symmachus translates, the abundant dwelling has not gone out, it is said of the same Samaria which is within the gates of Assyria's captivity, and as soon as it moves from its borders, it enters hostile land. The dwelling, as we said above, is abundant and beautiful. Therefore, she who resides (or resided) did not leave by her own will, but was led by force into Assyria. Hence, the neighboring house on the side, which is interpreted as Asel, namely the kingdom of Judah, will receive lamentation from you, which now, in the meantime, after Samaria was captured, has been restored and had God as its defender. But she received lamentation, and she is struck with fear, and her prosperity is weakened, who dwells in Maroth (or Ramoth), that is, in bitterness, or as Symmachus translates, a dwelling that incites bitterness, i.e. a dwelling that causes bitterness; which in Hebrew is called Josebeth Maroth, because of the captivity of the neighboring tribes, for evil comes down from the Lord to the gate of Jerusalem, for the Assyrians, having laid waste Samaria, also came to Jerusalem, at the time when Rabshakeh was sent to insult, of whom the fourth book of the Kingdoms (2 Kings 18) and Isaiah (Isaiah 36) write more fully. Where it is said that the Assyrian king sent from Lachish to Jerusalem, and afterwards, after Lachish was captured, he passed over to besiege Libnah. Therefore, the city of Lachish, dedicated to idols, will come, and to you the chariot and horsemen of the Assyrians, because the crimes of Israel were also found in you, and you were the beginning of idolatry in Judah: for through you, as through a gate, the impiety of the ten tribes migrated to Jerusalem. But not only will there be tumult over Lachish and chariots, but also over Gath, the metropolis of Philistia, of which I have spoken above: Do not announce it in Gath: for the Assyrian will send his robbers, whom he calls messengers, and will possess the house of idolatry and the city of deceit, which was a snare for the kings of Israel. But as for what follows: 'I will still bring an heir to you, who dwells in Maresa,' he beautifully alluded to the name. For Maresa, which means 'inheritance,' he called the arrival of the enemy against the heirs, and he will come to the city of Odollam, which is Judah, Maresa, that is, inheritance. And Odollam is glorious in its cities of Israel. Finally, Symmachus translated it as follows: 'I will still bring an heir and a dwelling to you in Maresa, until the glory of Israel comes to Odollam,' that is, I will still bring an heir to you and a dwelling in Maresa until the glory of Israel comes to Odollam, that is, you who are glorious among the cities of Israel. And where it is said 'of glory', the genitive case should be in the singular number, 'of this glory', and not in the nominative case, 'of these glories'. Or certainly understand it thus: The captivity of Israel which came to Lachish, and Gath, and Mareshah, will also come to Odollam. And the phrase 'the glory of Israel' should be read more closely, so that the meaning of κατὰ ἀντίφρασιν, 'shame' or 'devastation', may be felt. Furthermore, what we have interpreted above as the inheritance of the city of the prophet Micah, let the reader know in the same verse which we have set down: Therefore He will send envoys over the inheritance of Gath, in Hebrew instead of the inheritance of Gath, Maraseth Gath (also called Morasseth) is placed. Thus far, according to the Hebrew, as much as we were able and as it seemed to us, certainly as we heard from the Hebrews, we have steered our little boat between rocks and sharpest cliffs, which whether it has entered the harbor or is still floating on the sea, it is for the reader's judgment. Now, let us continue with your prayers to other waves, and with the imminent danger of shipwreck on all sides, if we can, let us escape. 'Geth' is interpreted as a press, so those who are in Geth, that is, in a press, thinking that they have gathered the fruits of life and squeezed the juice from the vine of Sorek, are lifted up in pride, not knowing that the cluster of the land of Judah is not found in the borders of foreign nations. Do not boast, says the Lord, you who are in the wine presses: For your vineyard is of Sodom, and your offspring of Gomorrah: And your grapes are of bitterness, and your clusters of gall to you, and the wine of fury of dragons is your wine, the fury of invincible asps. For if you also produce fruit (since your vineyard is not only from Sodom and Gomorrah, but also from Egypt and other enemy nations) the Lord will give your fruit to rust, and your labors to locusts, and He will destroy your vineyards with hail, and your mulberry trees with frost. Do not let the appearance of wine deceive you, and do not say that sweet is bitter: taste your wine carefully, and you will find that it is like the wine of Sorec, the fury of dragons and the venom of asps. Therefore, do not be proud, but humble yourselves under the mighty hand of the Lord, and go to that winepress from which I, who am coming from Edom, am red in my speech, as Isaiah the prophet says: I have trodden the winepress alone, and there is no man from the nations with me. Again, there are those who speak of aliens and others (for the province of the Allophylians has many regions and cities) who, through their evil works and contrary senses, speak against God: 'We have been destroyed, but let us rebuild that which has been destroyed.' Hence they are called the boundaries of impiety, and the people whom the Lord is angry with. It is said to them: 'Do not build with derision from the house in Bachim.' Bachim () in our language means lamentation and weeping. Finally, with the exception of the Septuagint, all have translated κλαυθμὸν, which means weeping. So, who are you then in such works and sentiments that are worthy of tears, do not build up a bad edification, nor consider your understanding as the construction of God, nor build upon sand (Matt. VII), lest when the storm comes and your house collapses, your futile labor may provide laughter for onlookers. Rather, understanding that your edification is worthy of ridicule, sprinkle your heads with its ruins and dust, and repent for wanting to build a house without counsel. It follows: Those who dwell well in their own cities have not gone forth dwelling in Senna. This seems to me to have this meaning: You, who boast in Geth and in Bachim, attempt in vain to build a house worthy of laughter: sprinkle yourselves with dust and repent, because you desired to crush detestable wine and to build a construction contrary to God. But the Church of Christ, which dwells well and possesses churches in the whole world, is joined together by the unity of the Spirit and has the cities of the Law, the Prophets, the Gospel, and the Apostles. It has not gone forth from its limits, that is, from the holy Scriptures; but it retains the possession that it began; because it dwells in Senna, which is interpreted, as we said above, by Symmachus as abundance; for it has the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit, with whom all spiritual graces and abundant virtues are. And it is said to her: Let peace be made in your strength, and abundance in your towers (Psalm 121, 7). But you, who dwell near Sennan, that is, near the abundant Church, oh heretics, oh contrary teachings, lament yourselves, because you have built a house for yourselves in mockery, and you have pressed the winepress in pride, not in the Scriptures, but in the vicinity of the Scriptures, a house worthy of not laughter, but lamentation, and you have built it with tears. Where it is joined, lament the house which is next to it, that is, next to Sennan. But also this which is added, it shall receive from you a blow of sorrow, it is said to the same heretics, to whom it is commanded to lament the neighboring house of the Church, that the enemy and avenger devil, to whom they are to be handed over for punishment, himself may inflict blows on them, and may extract from them the pain of wounds for the purpose of evil edification. Which are therefore inflicted, so that they may feel the sins which they have committed, may do penance, and may make the habitation of sorrows an occasion for good things. Whether the Church is indicating its grief because it laments its former sons, and is itself the cause of the salvation of heretics if they wish to return to their mourning mother. Furthermore, what is brought forth: For evils have descended from the Lord upon the gates of Jerusalem: and the Marcionites and Manichaeans use this scripture, because the God of the Law is the creator of evils. Let us say that evils have descended from the Lord, just as the Savior speaks in the Gospel: I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven (Luke X, 18). For just as Lucifer, who rose in the morning (Isaiah 14), fell from heaven and was crushed upon the earth, so too these evils that have fallen from the Lord and have come to the gates of Jerusalem were not evils before they fell; but because they have fallen from the Lord, they have become evils. And so that we may know the snares of evils: they came, he says, to the gates of Jerusalem, which, because they are secure and made of adamant, are closed off by the apostles, to whom the keys of Jerusalem have been entrusted; before these gates the enemies lurk, and those whom they see leaving, they kill. If someone is from Jerusalem, who lives well in his own cities, he does not go out when he dwells in abundance; but he always remains within, and does not go out of its gates, for whoever goes out of them is killed: he is killed by those who rise up in Geth, and dwell in Bachim, and build a house for mockery. Finally, the evils that have descended from the Lord to the gates of Jerusalem only have the noise of chariots and the tumult of horses, and a confused sound in place of the gates of Jerusalem, so that they will kill with their spear anyone they see wandering. After this was written: You who dwell in Lachish are the chief of sin for the daughter of Zion. Lachish is interpreted as 'walk' or 'journey'. And those who went up in their chariots and had horses, and made only empty noise and sound, concerning whom she who dwells well in her cities spoke: these are in chariots and these are on horses: but we will invoke in the name of the Lord our God (Ps. XIX, 8); for they have moved their feet, and have been carried about by every wind of false doctrine (Ephesians IV), and they desired to go out of the Church, which is interpreted as 'watchtower', that is, Zion, the chiefs of sin were the daughters of Zion. And in the same, that is, in Latin, were found the impieties of Israel, which separated the people of God from their former kingdom. Therefore, the leader of sin is the daughter of Zion, who dwells in Lachish, that is, in the worst way of life, constantly wavering in her steps, and the impieties of Israel are found in those who always move their feet and are said to dwell in Lachish. There will also be emissaries sent to the inheritance of Gath: Gath, the worst and the press of poisons, which is built against the house of God, where there are vain houses that have been built for ridicule. And these vanity homes, made in vain, were among the kings of Israel. As far as history is concerned, these are the kings whose sins are written in the Books of Kings and Chronicles: but as far as the anagoge is concerned, they are the princes of heretics and leaders of perverse doctrines; for these homes are vainly built and in vain. And as long as they persevere, until the heirs who are to be brought by the Lord possess them. After this follows: You who dwell in Lachish, the inheritance will come all the way to Odollam. The word 'testimonium' here is interpreted as the act of drawing or taking in water. In Greek, it is more significantly called 'μαρτυρία ἀντλήσεως', meaning the testimony of their drawing. We read in Proverbs: 'If you are wicked, you will alone drink in evil' (Prov. IX, 21). So, what dwells in Lachis, that is, in a very difficult situation, will come to the point of complete exhaustion, which it will completely drain and drink according to the measure of its works. Or certainly it should be distinguished in this way, that what is said, 'you who dwell in Lachis,' refers to the things above, and the order and meaning are as follows: I will bring your heirs from the Church, you who dwell in Lachis, because you will be of the inheritance of the Lord when you have drawn and received what you deserve. I beg the reader at the end of this chapter not to think of it as a necessity, a desire, or a lengthy explanation, but rather to marvel at finding something in such difficult places and not overlooking anything that needs to be said.
