(Chapter 23, Verse 1) The burden of Tyre. Howl, ye ships of the sea; for the house is laid waste, from whence they come: from the land of Chittim it is revealed to them. Be silent, ye inhabitants of the island; thou merchants of Sidon, that pass over the sea, have replenished thee. And by great waters the seed of Sihor, the harvest of the river, was her revenue; and she became the mart of nations. Therefore, thus says the Lord God: Behold, I am against you, O Tyre, and will bring up many nations against you, as the sea brings up its waves. They shall destroy the walls of Tyre and break down her towers; I will scrape her dust from her and make her like the top of a rock. (Ezek. 26:2-4) As for the many nations that will overflow Tyre like the overflowing sea, in the following verses it is specifically stated: Behold, I will bring against Tyre Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, from the north, with horses, chariots, horsemen, and a great army and people. He will kill your daughters who are in the field with a sword; and he will surround you with fortifications; and he will gather a rampart around you and raise a shield against you; and he will temper vineyards and battering rams against your walls; and he will destroy your towers with his weapons; and other things that follow to the end of the vision. For in another prophecy, which is seen against the Egyptians, the same Scripture conceals: Son of man, Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon made his army serve with great servitude against Tyre: every head was shaved, and every shoulder was shaved, and there was no payment given to him, nor to his army from Tyre (Ezek. XXIX). Through which it signifies that a mound was built up over a long time by the army of Babylon, so that what Alexander later did, uniting an island to the mainland, he attempted to do first. (Quint. Curt. lib. IV). Therefore, just as we read above about the Babylonians, Philistines, Moabites, Egyptians, Edomites, and Ishmaelites, that they insulted the captivity of his people, so too now a prophecy is hidden against the enemy Tyre, an insulter and overthrower of Jerusalem, that it also must be destroyed by the same enemy. We read the histories of the Greeks, especially those who describe the wars of the Assyrian people; and there we find that after the captivity of Jerusalem, the Palestinians, Arabs, and Damascenes were subverted. As for the fact that these nations, especially Tyre, have always attacked Israel and rejoiced in its overthrow, the prophet Amos explains this at the beginning of his book (Amos. I), and the Psalmist briefly declares praises to God, saying: O God, who is like you? Do not be silent, nor be restrained, O God. For behold, your enemies have made a noise; and those who hate you have lifted up their heads. They have devised a wicked plan against your people, and have plotted against your saints. They have said, 'Come, let us destroy them from being a nation, that the name of Israel may be remembered no more.' For they have consulted together with one consent; they form a confederacy against you: the tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites, Moab and the Hagrites, Gebal, Ammon, and Amalek; Philistia with the inhabitants of Tyre (Psalm 83:1-8). From all of these things we learn that the weight of God's anger came upon the harlot Tyre, who here is described under the guise of a prostitute in the translation of Ezekiel (Ezek. XXVI). Howl, says he, ye ships of the sea. For this in the Septuagint we read Carthage: and it is found in the Hebrew Tharsis (): of which I have discussed in Jonah the prophet, and in a certain letter. But we can, because Carthage is a colony of Tyre, understand in the present place Tharsis, not the sea in general, but also Carthage: that by no means from Africa do ships come to Tyre, nor from the land of Chittim, which some interpret as Cyprus: even to this day there is a city called Citium among them, from which Zeno, the founder of the Stoic sect, arose as a heretic: although most of our people, and especially the leaders of the Maccabees, consider Chittim to be the islands of Italy and Macedonia. For this Scripture recalls that Alexander, the king of the Macedonians, set out from the land of Cethim. And by naming the island, it does not lie: for afterward it became part of the mainland at the time of Nabuchodonosor or Alexander, on account of the many embankments constructed in the narrow strait. It also mentions the trading of Sidon, according to the following verse, in which it says: Be ashamed, Sidon. For the histories recount that Tyre was a colony of Sidon.

(Chapter 23, Verse 1) The Word of Tyre. As for our view on the burden or word and assumption of Tyre according to the Hebrews, we have already explained it in the book of ten Historical Visions. Now we will briefly go through every prophecy against Tyre according to the interpretation and version of the LXX. Tyre is called 'angustia' in the Hebrew language, and it is translated into our language as 'narrowness'. Therefore, every soul occupied by vices and evil thoughts can be called 'angustia'.


Ululate the ships of Carthage, for they have perished, and they will not come again. From the land of the Citians, a captive has been led. To whom the inhabitants of the island, the merchants of Phoenicia, who cross the sea in many waters, are similar, the seed of merchants like the harvest brought in, the merchants of the nations. For Carthage is written in Hebrew as Tharsis, which all have likewise translated. But Tharsis is interpreted as contemplation or exploration of joy. They are also called Chetim in Hebrew, which means the freezing sea, and in their language it is called Sidon instead of Phoenicia. Therefore, those who are surrounded by a crowd of evil thoughts are accused, and those who desire to become rich, as the Apostle said, fall into temptations and snares of the devil, and into many harmful and destructive desires, which lead people into destruction. And they are told to wail, knowing that all the dealings of this world are perishable, and that the contemplation of joy and happiness must be turned into mourning and tears. For this sea will no longer be navigable; but everything will freeze: and the Tyrian colonies will be led away as captives to punishment. For there are no others like them who inhabit this island, except for traders or translators who are carried around on every wind of doctrine, and who pass from one vice to another. But we dwell on an island, as long as we are beaten by the temptations of this world: and from every side our island and our little ship are struck by the waves of the sea. But the merchants of this island are from Sidon, which means huntress, and many hunters live there. Of them it is written: He will deliver you from the snare of the hunters (Ps. 90:3). And in another place the saint rejoices because he was delivered from their snares, saying: Our soul has been rescued like a sparrow from the snare of the hunters (Ps. 123:7). But all the merchants of the nations are compared to crops that wither quickly, or to harvests of a river that do not have rain from the sky but from the earth: therefore they are doomed to perish with the nations. Where we read, seed of business, in Hebrew it is written, seed of sior, which is understood as Nile, because it has turbid waters with which the crops of Egypt are irrigated.
