“For it is written, ‘I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.’ ” Zechariah the prophet says the same thing, only differently; and if I am not mistaken, God is addressed in the person of the prophet: “Strike the shepherd that the sheep may be scattered.” In harmony with these words is the psalm, which is recited in its entirety to the Lord: “For they persecute him whom you have struck.” The good shepherd is struck, however, that he may lay down his life for his sheep and that out of many flocks of wandering sheep there may be one flock and one shepherd.

(Verse 31.) Then Jesus said to them: All of you will be scandalized by me in this night. He predicts that they will suffer, so that when they have suffered, they will not despair of salvation, but by repenting, they will be freed. And he specifically added, in this night you will be scandalized; for just as those who get drunk, get drunk at night: likewise those who are scandalized, endure in the night and in darkness (I Thess. 5). But let us say: The night has passed, and the day is at hand (Rom. 13:12).
