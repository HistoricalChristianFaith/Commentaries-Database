(Verse 12-14) Truly I tell you, wherever this Gospel is proclaimed in the whole world, what she has done will be told in memory of her. Then one of the twelve, who was called Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests. In the whole world, not so much this woman, as the Church is preached, that she has buried the Savior, that she has anointed his head. And pay attention to the knowledge of the future, that he will suffer in two days and die, and his Gospel will be celebrated in the whole world.
