"A time
to be born and a time to die. A time to plant and a time to uproot that which
has been planted." No one doubts that men are born and die, and
God knows that what he has planted will grow full and well; for to pull out
what has been planted is to die. But
since we read in Isaiah [Is. 26, 18.]
"we have conceived, laboured with and given birth out of a fear for
You", this must be said, because when a man is ready, that man in
particular, who was born from fear, will die as soon as he has begun to love
God. Since indeed "perfect love
sends fear outside" [I. John. 4, 18.]. The Hebrews understand all that he has
written about the contradiction of times, (until it says " a time for war
and a time for peace") as concerning Israel. Because it is not necessary to go through
each verse in turn here, commenting on how they are to be interpreted and what
they mean, I will list them briefly, leaving a more detailed study to the
reader's discretion. There was a time for growing and planting in Israel, a
time for dying and leading it into bondage. A time for killing them in Egypt,
and a time for freeing them from Egypt. A time for destroying the Temple under
Nebuchadnezer, and a time for rebuilding under Darius. A time for bewailing the plundering of the
city and a time for laughing and dancing under Zorobabel, Esdra, and
Nehemiah. A time for dissemination from
Israel and a time for gathering them together again. A time like a belt or harness put around the
Jews by God, and a time for leading them into bondage in Babylon and there for
them to rot across the Euphrates. Read "perizoma" of Jeremiah [Cfr Ier.. 13, I-II.]. A time for seeking them out and rescuing, a
time for losing and a time for forsaking. 
A time for schism in Israel and a time for reunification. A time for hushing the prophets, now when in
Roman bondage and a time for proclaiming them aloud, when even in enemy lands
they weren't lacking in God's presence or comfort. A time for loving, in which He loved those
men before our fathers, a time for hating, since they threw their hands up
against Christ. A time for war, only not
for those who are doing repentance for themselves and a time for peace in the
future, when all the tribes return, and all Israel will be safe.
