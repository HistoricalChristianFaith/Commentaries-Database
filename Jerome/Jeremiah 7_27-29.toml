The wrath of the Lord, therefore, is just. It is kindled and poured out on a contemptuous and stiff-necked people who are unwilling to hear the words of God. Yet, as we said above, how God continued to send prophets to them all day long and even through the night!

“Have no doubt,” he says, “that they are stiff-necked and that their works are worse than those of their ancestors. Behold, I give them a place of penance. I do not speak that they may repent, but I only predict what is coming. In any event, you will now speak my word to them and they will not listen to you, and you will call them and they will not answer you, for they are so prideful that when you ask them for a hearing, no one will even bother to respond. And you should then say to them: This is the generation who did not listen to the voice of the Lord their God or accepted his discipline.” It is beautiful, as I said before, not that he calls his own people, but that he calls the human race. For, although at the time of the prophets, it was done in part and as a foreshadowing, it was only fulfilled in Christ, when they refused to accept discipline and despised the voice of their Lord. Thus, Jeremiah has the apt phrase: “faith has perished”—which is distinctive of Christians—“and was removed from their mouth,” clearly referring to the confession of faith of the child of God.
