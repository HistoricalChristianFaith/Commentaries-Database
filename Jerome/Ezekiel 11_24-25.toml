(Verse 24, 25.) And the spirit lifted me up and brought me to Chaldea for the transmigration in a vision in the spirit of God, and the vision that I had seen was taken away from me. And I spoke to the transmigration all the words of the Lord that he had shown me. Because we have translated from the Hebrew truth: And the vision that I had seen was taken away from me, the LXX translated: And I ascended from the vision that I had seen. Both of which signify not that the prophet was physically transported from Jerusalem to Babylon, but in spirit, the vision that had led him in spirit to Jerusalem was taken away, and he returned to himself and spoke to the transmigration all that had been shown to him, namely, about those of whom it is written above: I was sitting in my house, and the elders of Judah were sitting beside me, and there the hand of the Lord God fell upon me, and I saw (Above, VIII, 1). And in a marvelous manner, while these people who had come to visit were seated, the prophet saw mystical visions and was absent from those who were sitting in front of him, present in body but without spirit. And everything happens so that those who were captive may receive consolation, because they will be brought back to the land of Israel and will walk in the commandments of the Lord, and they will be his people and he will be their God. But those who do not turn to repentance and continue to walk in their abominations will receive the consequences of their actions. But we often mention that words in the Holy Scriptures are often used for things.
