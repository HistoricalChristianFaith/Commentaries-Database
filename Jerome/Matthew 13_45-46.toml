(Verse 45, 46.) Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant in search of fine pearls. Upon finding one exceedingly precious pearl, he went and sold all that he had and bought it. In other words, the same thing as was said above. The good pearls that the merchant seeks are the Law and the Prophets. Listen, Marcion; listen, Manichaeus: the good pearls are the Law and the Prophets, and the knowledge of the Old Testament. But there is one most precious pearl, the knowledge of the Savior, and the sacrament of his passion, and the mystery of his resurrection. When a person, like the apostle Paul, discovers it, they despise all the mysteries of the law and the prophets, and the practices of their former life, in which they were blameless, as worthless filth and rubbish, in order to gain Christ (Philippians III). Not that the discovery of a new pearl condemns the old pearls, but by comparison, every other gem is worthless.
