The calling of the nations is demonstrated clearly when Scripture says, “Hear the word of the Lord, nations, and announce it to the distant coastlands.” What do they announce to the distant coastlands? They announce that “the same Lord who scattered Israel will gather him,” showing that it was never in the power of his enemies to scatter Israel, but only in the will of the Lord, “and guard Israel as a shepherd guards his flock,” since “the good shepherd lays down his life for his sheep,” “for the Lord redeemed Jacob with his own precious blood and freed him from the hands of those who were more powerful or stronger.” … “They will come,” it continues, no doubt referring to those who were liberated from the hand of the powerful, “and praise their liberator on Mount Zion,” that is, in the church, “and stream to the goodness of the Lord of all abundance,” which is known not in the fruits and foods of this flesh but in a diversity of virtues.
