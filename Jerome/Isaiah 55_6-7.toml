(Vers. 6, 7.) Seek the Lord while he may be found; call upon him while he is near. Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts; and let him return to the Lord, and he will have compassion on him, and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon. LXX: Seek the Lord: and when you have found him, call upon him. And after he has drawn near to you, let the wicked forsake his ways and the unrighteous man his thoughts and return to the Lord; and he will obtain mercy, for he will abundantly forgive your sins. Therefore, since, as we have said before, you refused to accept the eternal covenant and the faithful mercies of David, which the multitude of Gentiles, unwilling as you were, received, I warn you, my fellow countrymen, I am a Prophet and I call upon you, while there is still time, to repent. Turn to him who now speaks to you through the prophets, who will speak to you in person later. Seek him while he can be found, while you are in the body, while there is a place for repentance, and seek him not only in place, but in faith. However, how God is to be sought is more fully explained in another place: 'Taste and see that the Lord is good; blessed is the man who seeks refuge in him. Fear the Lord, you his saints, for those who fear him lack nothing' (Psalm 34:8-9). Therefore, knowing this saying about sinners, 'Those who are far from you will perish,' let us speak to the Lord: 'Where can I go from your Spirit? Where can I flee from your presence? If I go up to the heavens, you are there; if I make my bed in the depths, you are there' (Psalm 139:7-8). And let us call upon Him while He is near, so that He does not withdraw far from our faults and sins. For He draws near to those who draw near to Him, and He joyfully meets His son returning after a long time. Therefore, the saint sings in the psalm: But for me it is good to cling to God (Ps. LXXII, 28). And Moses alone approached the Lord (Exod. XX). And God speaks through Jeremiah: I am the God who draws near, and not from afar (Jer. XXIII, 33). Approaching those who approach me with faith, and distancing myself from those who depart from me in disbelief. For this reason it is said to believers: Draw near to God, and he will draw near to you. And lest we think this is enough, immediately he adds: Resist the devil, and he will flee from you (James 4:8). Regarding this, he said previously: Your adversary the devil prowls around like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour. Resist him, firm in your faith (1 Peter 5:8-9). It is not enough to seek the Lord, and while it is the time of penance, to find and invoke Him when He is near, unless the wicked person has abandoned their former ways and the old thoughts by which they had turned away from the Lord. For then we will return to the Lord, who will have mercy on us, and to the most merciful Father, who is abundant in mercies and ready to forgive, when we have abandoned our former thoughts and ways, so that we may deserve to hear afterwards: Blessed are those whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered (Psalm 32:1).
