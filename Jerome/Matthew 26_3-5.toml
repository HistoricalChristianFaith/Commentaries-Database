(Ver. 3 and following) Then the chief priests and the elders of the people gathered in the courtyard of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas, and they plotted to arrest Jesus by trickery and kill him. But they said, 'Not during the feast, lest there be an uproar among the people.' Now those who were supposed to prepare the Passover sacrifices, cleanse the walls of the temple, sweep the floors, purify the vessels, and be ritually purified according to the Law in order to be worthy to eat the Passover lamb, were gathered together to devise a plan on how to kill the Lord, not fearing rebellion, as the simple words show; but careful that they were not hindered by the help of the people.
