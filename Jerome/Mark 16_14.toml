As he showed them real hands and a real side, so he really ate with his disciples; really walked with Cleophas; conversed with men with a real tongue; really reclined at supper; with real hands took bread, blessed and broke it, and was offering it to them. … Do not put the power of the Lord on a level with the tricks of magicians, so that he may appear to have been what he was not, and may be thought to have eaten without teeth, walked without feet, broken bread without hands, spoken without a tongue, and showed a side which had no ribs.

In some copies, and especially in the Greek codices, it is written according to Mark at the end of his Gospel: “At length Jesus appeared to the eleven as they were at table.”
