Similarly, with holy habits, not inciting, not serving much wine; teaching well, that they may instruct young women towards chastity, that they may love their husbands, that they may love their children: modest, chaste, having diligence of the house, kind, submissive to their husbands, that the word of God may not be blasphemed. Although the apostle Peter has commanded that husbands should give honor to their wives as to a weaker vessel, nevertheless it is not to be judged that a wife, who has a weak vessel of the body, is at once weaker also in soul. Hence they are now commanded that also in them that of the Apostle may be fulfilled: Virtue is made perfect in weakness (2 Cor. 12:9), and it is said that they may have all things, which are commonly commanded to old men, in that namely which he says: Similarly the aged women, that is, as elderly men, in all things honorable, sober, modest, healthy in faith, and charity, and patience, and for their gender this may have as their own, that they may be with holy habits, or as it is read better in Greek, ἐν καταστήματι ἱεροπρεπεῖς, that even their own conduct and movement, expression, speech, silence, they may prefer a certain sacred dignity of decorum. And because this type of woman is usually talkative, in accordance with that: "And at the same time they also learn to be idle and wander around from house to house. Not only are they idle, but also gossips and busybodies, saying things they shouldn't" (1 Tim. 5:13): therefore He wishes that they not be provocative, that is, not accusers, not such that they please others, and speak ill of others. Or certainly because they have already crossed adolescence themselves, they argue about the ages of young girls, and say: "She is adorned thus, she combs her hair thus, she walks like this: she loves him, she is loved by him": and even if these things are true, they should not accuse others so openly, but rather correct themselves in secret with the love of Christ, and teach more to not do rather than publicly accuse them of what they did. These ages usually indulge in bodily lust (although there are many who are not shy about their gray hairs, and trembling young girls are composed before a flock of grandchildren), giving themselves up to wine for pleasure; and when they have appeared wise and eloquent to themselves between cups, they assume a kind of morality, speaking this which they see in themselves, and not remembering what they were. And let old women be prohibited from too much drinking of wine, because what in young women is desire, in old women it is drunkenness. And how can an old woman teach young girls chastity, when if she herself has imitated the drunkenness of an old woman, she cannot be chaste? And he expressed emphatically: Do not be enslaved to much wine. For it is a kind of slavery and a miserable condition for a person's senses to be occupied by wine, and not to be one's own, but that of the wine. Therefore, because he taught what kind of old women they should be at first, and after those things which are common with old men, he also exposed their own particularities, that they may be full of honest and holy decorum: neither accusers, nor detractors of others, nor having their senses occupied by wine. Now, following his doctrine, he allows them the reins, so that when they are such, they may have the freedom to teach the good things. For although he said elsewhere, "But I do not allow women to teach" (1 Tim. 2:12), it is to be understood that for them the doctrine should be removed. However, they should teach young girls as if they were their own daughters. First, chastity: because the enemy fights more fiercely against it in the flourishing age, and all its virtue is directed against women in the womb; then that they may love their husbands, care for their children. Which doctrine is to love their husbands; is it not established in the heart of the lover rather than in the speech of the teacher? She wants to love her husband chastely: she wants a chaste love between man and woman, so that, with modesty, and reverence, and as if compelled by the sex, she may rather give her due to her husband than demand it of him, and she believes that she must perform the work of her children before the eyes of God and the angels: thus she will not even be ashamed of her secret bedroom, and the darkness of the night, and her closed bedroom, when she has considered that all things are open to the eyes of God. But they love their children thus, if they educate them in God's discipline. Moreover, not wanting to sadden them by teaching what is good, and granting them the freedom to sin ((or of sinning)), is not loving one's children, but hating them. Young girls, too, are to be educated to have diligence in the house. And because it could happen that the diligence of the house is governed with severity, and thus by this precept of the Apostle, the matron becomes severe towards her servants: therefore, he coupled kindness: so that then she would believe that her husband was ruling the house well if he commanded the servants with kindness, not in fear. And also [women] subject to their own husbands: lest perhaps they remember not God's sentence, and by occasion of riches or nobility, despise the divine ordinance, whereby they are subject to their husbands. For he saith: 'Thy will be to thy husband, and he shall have dominion over thee' (Gen. 3:16). The prudence to be observed in the Holy Scriptures is that the Lord did not speak to the man, saying, "You shall rule over your wife," but to the woman herself, that she might leave to her obedience the reward, since it is in her power, if she desires to obey the precepts of God, to serve her husband and to be subject to him as to a husband, so that it might be in some way a free servitude, full of love, serving her husband while she fears offending him. For indeed, man was not created for the sake of woman, but woman for the sake of man. And while the head of the woman is the man, the head of the man is Christ. Whatever wife does not submit herself to her husband, that is, to her head, is guilty of the same offense as the husband who does not submit himself to Christ, his head. But the word of the Lord is blasphemed, either when the first sentence of God is despised and considered of no account, or when the Gospel of Christ is defamed, while it desires, contrary to the law and faith of nature, that which is Christian and subject to the law of God, to command the husband. Even pagan women serve their husbands according to the common law of nature.
