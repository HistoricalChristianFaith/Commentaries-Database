The flight of the prophet may also be referred to that of man in general, who, despising the commands of God, departed from him and gave himself to the world, where subsequently through the storms of ill and the wreck of the whole world raging against him, he was compelled to feel the presence of God and to return to him whom he had fled. Therefore we understand that those things also which men think for their good, when against the will of God, are turned to destruction. And help not only does not benefit those to whom it is given, but those who give it are alike crushed. As we read that Egypt was conquered by the Assyrians because it helped Israel against the will of God, the ship is imperiled which had received the imperiled. A tempest arises in a calm; nothing is secure when God is against us.
