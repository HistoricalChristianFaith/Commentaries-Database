(v. 8-10) And the fishermen shall mourn, and all those who cast the hook into the river shall lament, and those who spread the net over the face of the water shall wither away. And those who work with flax, twisting and weaving fine fabrics, shall be put to shame; and its pools shall be dried up, and all those who make fishing-gear for catching fish shall mourn. And consider this in two ways: that when Egypt is devastated and the entire province is dried up by drought, the fishermen shall mourn, and those who cast the hook into the river and those who work with nets and traps and weave various types of baskets made from reeds, that is, princes and those of royal blood, and rulers. And also, when Christ comes, all the wicked fishermen of different kinds, who against Apostolic discipline capture men for destruction and weave nets and traps with foolish wisdom to ensnare the condemned, shall be confused, and in the land of Egypt there shall be no such fisherman, or if there is, they shall be rare. In this work we see fulfilled what the triumphs of the Churches rise, and idols have fallen in all of Egypt.
