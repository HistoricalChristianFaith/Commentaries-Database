(Verse 15.) And Canaan begot his firstborn Sidon, and the Hittites, and the Jebusites, and the Amorites, and the Girgashites, and the Hivites, and the Arkites, and the Sinites, and the Arvadites, and the Zemarites, and the Hamathites. From Canaan, Sidon was born, from whom the city of Sidon in Phoenicia is named. Then the Arkite, who founded Ark, a town situated opposite Tripolis at the roots of Mount Lebanon. Not far from there was another city named Sini, which, after various events of war, was destroyed and only retained its original name. There are Aradians, who possessed the island of Aradu, separated by a narrow strait from the Phoenician coast. The Samaritans, to whom Emesa, a noble city of Coele Syria, belongs. Amath, up until our time, is called by both the Syrians and the Hebrews, as it was called by the ancients. The Macedonians, who ruled in the East after Alexander, called it Epiphania. Some believe that Antioch was called by that name. Others, though not truly, yet consoling their opinion with a seemingly plausible word, think that the first dwelling of Emath, as they journeyed from Antioch, was called Edessa: and that it is the same as Emach, which was called by the ancients.
