(Chapter 38â€”Verse 5) And she added, and gave birth to a son, and called his name Shelah; but she was in Chezib when she gave birth to him. The Hebrew word here is used in place of a geographical name, which Aquila translated as a thing, saying: And she called his name Shelah. And it came to pass that she lied in childbirth after she gave birth to Shelah. For after she gave birth to Shelah, her childbirth ceased. Therefore, Chezib is called not a place name, but a deception. And elsewhere it is written: 'The work of the olive tree will fail, that is, it will not produce fruit.' (Habakkuk 3:17).
