(Verse 23.) The sons of Aram were Us, Ul, Gether, and Mes. Us founded Trachonitis and Damascus, and he held the principality between Palestine and Coele-Syria. From him, the Seventy Interpreters translated the land of Us, the region of Ausitis, as if it were Usitis, in the Book of Job where it is written in Hebrew. Ul is the ancestor of the Armenians; Gether is the ancestor of the Acarnanians, or the Carians. And Mes, whom the Seventy Interpreters called Mosoch, are now called Maeones.
