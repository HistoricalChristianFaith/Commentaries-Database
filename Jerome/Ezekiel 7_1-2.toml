(Chapter 7, Verses 1, 2.) And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: And you, son of man, thus says the Lord God of the land of Israel: The end has come, the end has come upon the four corners of the earth. These corners of the world we have interpreted as the East and the West, the South and the North. Concerning these corners, Isaiah also speaks: Lord, from the corners or ends of the earth, we have heard wonders (Isaiah 24:16), which were accomplished throughout the whole world by the apostles. And it is written of the saints: 'If you sleep among the clergy of the silver dove's wings, and their backs are pale with gold' (Psalm 67:14). Therefore, when the Lord approached and saw Jerusalem, he wept and said, 'How often have I desired to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, and you were not willing?' (Matthew 23:37). This is the one who, in the song of Deuteronomy, spread his wings and received them, and carried them on his shoulders (Deuteronomy 32). Certain spiritual wings of the earth, by which we fly upward to the heavenly, He places into four types of believers: the house of Aaron, and the house of Levi, and the house of Israel, and those who fear the Lord. Concerning them, the Psalmist also sings: House of Israel, bless the Lord: house of Aaron, bless the Lord: house of Levi, bless the Lord; you who fear the Lord, bless the Lord (Psalm 134:19-21). In Aaron, the priesthood; in Levi, the priests and ministers; in Israel, the whole people; in those who fear the Lord, the understanding of proselytes. But we think that it needs to be simply explained, that after the commination of the mountains of Israel, the prophetic discourse is directed to all the land of Israel, whether ten or twelve tribes: and that the prophet does not predict future events, but sees the impending captivity. For in the fifth year of Sedecias, Ezechiel began to prophesy to the captives in Babylon; and in the ninth year, Nabuchodonosor came and besieged Jerusalem: and he captured it in the eleventh year of Sedecias. From which it is evident that the end has come and drawn near, not over mountains and hills and rocks and valleys, but over the four corners of the earth from every part of Israel: not all the earth: if he had said that, it could be believed of the whole world; but the earth simply, which signifies Israelites. For thus he had begun: Thus says the Lord God of the land of Israel: The end, the end has come upon the four corners of the earth.
