(Verse 28.) Truly I say to you, there are some standing here who will not taste death until they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom. He wanted to heal the terror of the apostles with the hope of promised things, saying: The Son of Man is coming in the glory of his Father with his angels. Moreover, with the authority of a judge added: and he will repay each one according to his works. The silent thought of the apostles could bear such a scandal: you now say that killing and death are coming, but what you promise to be present in the glory of the Father with the ministry of angels and the power of a judge, this will be in the future, and will be delayed for a long time. Therefore, foreseeing what the knowers of secret things could object, he counterbalances present fear with present reward. For he says: There are some of those standing here who will not taste death until they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom; so that the manner in which he will come afterwards may be shown to you at the present time, because of your unbelief.
