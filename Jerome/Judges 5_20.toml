(Judges 5:20) There was a battle fought against them from heaven. Because in the forty thousand men of Israel a shield and spear could not be found, therefore the Lord fought for them from heaven with hailstones and fire against their enemies. Just as it is also written in the book of Joshua: The stars remained in their order and fought against Sisera (Joshua 10:11). The stars are understood to be the angels who fought against Sisera from heaven.
