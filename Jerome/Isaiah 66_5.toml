This is the meaning of the Hebrew text, as it appears to me: Listen, apostles, listen, my disciples, who tremble at the word of the Lord, for I will tell you what your brothers say who hate you and cast you out and judge you to be alien; this is not on account of any evil you have done but on account of my name, for they regard all from their ranks who believe in me as they do unclean Gentiles, to whom they say: “depart from me, for you are impure.” … But then it immediately adds, “and they shall be confounded,” namely, those who speak such things, who do not understand the mysteries of the Scriptures, who utilize its power for their own evil and who hold humility in contempt.

(Verse 5) Hear the word of the Lord, you who tremble at his word. Your brothers who hate you and cast you out because of my name have said: Let the Lord be glorified, that we may see your joy; but they will be put to shame. LXX: Hear the word of the Lord, you who tremble at his word. Say to your brothers who hate you and despise you, that the name of the Lord may be glorified, and appear in their joy; and let them be put to shame. About which he had already said before: On whom shall I look, unless on him who is humble and quiet, and who trembles at my words? He commands them to pass over to his worship, despising the sacrifices of the Jews and disregarding the arrogance of the Scribes and Pharisees, whom they did not want to hear when he called them, and whom they despised and did evil in his sight. Not content with the end of these precepts, he also commands them to love their enemies, to do good to those who hate them, and to pray for their persecutors, and to imitate the clemency of the Father, who makes his sun rise on the just and the unjust, so that, seeing your works, they may glorify your Father who is in heaven. What is specifically commanded to the general understanding of the apostles and apostolic men, that they should love their Jewish persecutors and those who abhor them, and have them in the place of brothers, saying with Peter: Men, brothers and fathers, listen; and with the Apostle Paul: I have great sorrow and unceasing grief in my heart for my brothers, who are Israelites (Romans 9:2). But the name of the Lord is glorified when men see the fierceness of the persecutors broken by our patience and the hand of the one who strikes, confounded by the downfall of another evil. In the Gospel, it is commanded: Let your light shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father who is in heaven (Matt. 5:16); and in the Apocalypse of John: Fear God, and give glory to Him (Rev. 14:7). Paul also writes to the Corinthians, urging them to chastity: That you may glorify God in your body (1 Cor. 6:20). And again: Whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God (1 Cor. 10:31). And the Lord did not curse those who cursed him (1 Peter 2); and he prayed for his persecutors. But what he commands: 'Say to your brothers' (Matthew 28:10), should not be taken simply, otherwise many call themselves brothers, yet do not preserve love in their hearts, of whom the Apostle writes: They confess to know God, but deny him by their works (Titus 1:16). Concerning them, the Lord also spoke: Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven (Matthew 7:21). And this statement can stand: No one says, 'Jesus is Lord,' except in the Holy Spirit (1 Corinthians 12:3). For when the heretics say, 'Lord Jesus,' and many will say at the resurrection, 'Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many mighty works in your name?' The Lord will answer them: 'Depart from me, you evildoers. I never knew you.' Therefore, it is not merely saying with words, which is easy, but it is proven by one's attitude and actions. From these we learn that the Lord of both Testaments commands us, that if we see the beast of our enemy fall under its burden, we should not pass by, but should lift it up with him, and if we find a wandering ox or donkey, we should return it to him (Luke 15, Matthew 18). According to the Septuagint, it seems to me that the meaning is: Listen, Apostles, listen, my disciples, who tremble at the word of the Lord, I will tell you what your brothers who hate you say, and separate you, and consider you strangers, not because of your evils; but because of my name, they think all the unclean ones of their own nation who believe are unclean, and say: Get away from me, for you are unclean. What, therefore, is it that he reminds them of having said: Let the Lord be glorified, and we shall see in your joy? The meaning of this little verse is: Why do you introduce to us a humble God? why a crucified man and a man acquainted with sorrows, and knowing how to bear infirmities? we desire to see him reigning in his (as you say) majesty: we are unable to see him humble and abject. And immediately he adds: But they shall be confounded, implying those who speak such things, who do not understand the mysteries of the Scriptures, and who interpret his power by their own evil, having despised him on account of his humility.
