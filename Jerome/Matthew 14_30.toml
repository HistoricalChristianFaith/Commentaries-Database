(Verse 30) But when he saw the strong wind, he was afraid. And when he began to sink, he cried out, saying: Lord, save me. The faith of his soul burned, but human frailty dragged him into the deep: therefore a little is left to temptation, so that faith may increase, and he may understand that he is not saved by the ease of his request, but by the power of the Lord.
