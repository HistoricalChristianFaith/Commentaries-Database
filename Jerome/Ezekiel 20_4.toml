(Verse 4) If you judge them: if you judge, O son of man. LXX: if I avenge them with vengeance, O son of man: They have indeed come to interrogate me, desiring to know about those things about which they are in doubt, and the future; but you, O son of man, judge them, so that the prophet's response may not be, but rather the sentence of the judge for the injustices they have committed, and for following the crimes of their fathers. Or certainly, if I avenge them with vengeance, it can be understood in this sense: They are so covered in wickedness that they are not even worthy of correction and reproof, according to what is said by the prophet: I will no longer visit your daughters, and your daughters-in-law, when they commit adultery (Hosea 4). Wherefore sinners, who have descended into the depths of sin, are forgiven to fulfill the desires of their hearts (Prov. XVIII).

Show them the abominations of their fathers, and you shall say to them: 'LXX: Rebuke them for the iniquities of their fathers, and you shall say to them: If the sins of the fathers do not flow over to their children, why are the abominations and iniquities of the fathers now placed upon the elders? Clearly it is for this reason, that similar actions may be shown to be done by their parents, and that they may drag the longest rope of inherited evils, so that they may fear the punishments of those whose vices they imitate.'
