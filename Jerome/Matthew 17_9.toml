The preview of the future kingdom and the glory of his triumph had been shown on the mountain. So he does not want this to be told to the people in case it should be deemed incredible because of its greatness and also so that after such great glory the event of the cross that follows should not cause untaught minds to stumble.

(Verse 9) And as they were coming down the mountain, Jesus commanded them, saying: Tell no one the vision, until the Son of Man rises from the dead. The anticipation of the coming kingdom, and the glory of the triumphant one, had been shown on the mountain. Therefore, He does not want this to be preached to the people, lest it be regarded as unbelievable for the greatness of the matter, and lest the cross, following such glory, would become a stumbling block to simple minds.
