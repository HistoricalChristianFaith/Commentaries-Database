Physicists and those whose concern it is to argue about the heavens say that the moon does not have its own light but is illuminated by the sun’s rays. For it always shines completely on that portion of its orb that is closest to the sun and is not obscured by the shadow of the earth, as the poet demonstrates in one verse: “Nor is the moon liable to rise in the rays of her brother.” If this is true, then we are also able to say tropologically that the church, which grows and declines in peace and in persecutions and receives pure light after enduring the oppression of dark temptations, possesses its splendor from the Sun of righteousness and is that reality that was spoken: “The moon will shine like the sun.” Its righteous inhabitants will also “shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father.” Throughout these months, the seed of the Lord, which is established eternally, comes to his solemnities that the saint sings with a mystical mouth, saying: “I had eternal years in mind as I meditated in the night.” …In relation to what follows, namely, “all flesh will come to adore the Lord in my presence in Jerusalem,” it should be noted that “Jerusalem” is not written in the Hebrew text, thus enabling us to shake off the arrogance of the Jews, but only “in my presence,” so the word of the Lord may be fulfilled by he who says in the Gospel: “Truly, truly, I say to you that the hour will come when you will worship the Father neither in this mountain nor in Jerusalem.” For “all flesh” signifies not the Jewish people but every human race, in accordance with what is said above: “All flesh will see your salvation.” This is also found in Joel: “I will pour out my Spirit on all flesh, and your sons and daughters will prophesy,” and in Zechariah: “Let all flesh revere the face of the Lord,” and in the Psalter: “All flesh will come to you,” which another psalm expresses differently: “All the peoples whom you have made will come and worship in your presence and glorify your name, O Lord.” This “from month to month and from sabbath to sabbath,” in which “all flesh will come to adore the Lord,” is given a ridiculous interpretation by the chiliasts, however, whom we can call millenarians, such that all who are in the area come to Jerusalem each sabbath and all who are farther away come every month and those who live at a great distance come for Passover every year, this because of what was said in Zechariah: “Each one shall go up from year to year to worship the Lord, the King of hosts, and to celebrate the feast of tabernacles.” Moreover, providing their audience with still further reason to laugh, because it is written in the last chapter of the same prophet that “there will be no merchants any longer in the house of the Lord of hosts,” they understand this to mean that all salespersons will cease to exist for one thousand years, for everything will be generated in every location, such that we will neither be in need of a sweet pepper nor will an Indian desire a mint leaf from us.
