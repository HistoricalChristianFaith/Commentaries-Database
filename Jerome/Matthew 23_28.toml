Sepulchres are whitened with lime without, and decorated with marble painted in gold and various colours, but within are full of dead menâ€™s bones. Thus crooked teachers who teach one thing and do another, affect purity in their dress, and humility in their speech, but within are full of all uncleanness, covetousness, and lust.
