For they had the Lord as trailblazer who gathered them, the God of Israel to make one flock from the whole earth, to fulfill what the Lord said in the Gospel to his Father, “Grant that just as I and you are one, so they also may be one in us,” as they in one mind and one opinion, rebutting vices and leaving behind disagreements among them, would grasp one unique virtue. For they do not run after vices and disputes, since here it only speaks about their virtues in which there is neither too much nor too little, but all is moderate.
