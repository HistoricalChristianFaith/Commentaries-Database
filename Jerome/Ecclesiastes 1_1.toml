Solomon is here given the Greek name Ecclesiastes [Heb Qōhelet], for he gathers the assembly [qāhāl], that is, the church. But we can call him the Preacher because he speaks to the people and his word is directed not only to one person but to everyone.

"The words of Ecclesiastes, son of David, King in Jerusalem." The
Scriptures state very clearly that Solomon was known by three names: 'Peace-making', that is 'Solomon'; 'Yedidia',
that is 'beloved of Yahweh'; and the name used here 'Qoheleth', that is
Ecclesiastes. He is called Ecclesiastes
in Greek because he gathered together a crowd of people, "a congregation", which we can call a demagogue because he spoke to
the people and his sermon was not addressed specifically to one man but more
usually to all men. Moreover he is
called 'peace-making' and 'beloved of Yahweh' because there was peace during
his reign and the Lord loved him. For
also Psalms 44, and 71, are known by titles connected with love and
peace-making. Although these psalms
pertain to Christ and the Church they exhibit Solomon's joy and strength, and
according to tradition were composed concerning Solomon.

He also produced an equal number of titles to the three volumes: "Proverbs", "Ecclesiastes", and "Song of
Songs". He teaches for children in "Proverbs" and gives instruction in the
form of maxims almost with a sense of duty, and his sermons here are repeated
continually to his son. In "Ecclesiastes" he teaches a man of mature
age that he should not think anything in the world to be perpetual, but that
all things that we perceive are in fact vain and fleeting. In "Song
of Songs" he embraces an elderly man in the covenant, who has already been
prepared in spurning his times. For
unless we first abandon our moral failings and renounce the pomposity of our
world, and prepare ourselves so we are ready for the arrival of Christ, we will
not be able to say: "let him kiss
me from the kiss of his mouth" [Cant. 1,1.]. Philosophers educate their followers in a
manner similar to this type of instruction: first of all they teach ethics,
then explain physics, and then anyone whom they see to excel in these first two
they then go on to teach theology. 
Moreover even this should be examined more closely because Solomon is
named differently in the three books. In
"Proverbs" for example he is thus
named: "The Proverbs of Solomon, the son
of David, King of Israel." [Prov. 1,1.] But in Ecclesiastes: "The words of Ecclesiastes, son of David, King of Jerusalem. "'Israel'
in fact is unnecessary here because it is not found in the Greek or Latin
manuscripts. But in "Song of Songs" he is neither named 'son of David', not 'King of
Israel' or 'King of Jerusalem', but only as "The
Song of Songs of Solomon". This is
just as the Proverbs and the crude arrangement pertain to the twelve tribes and
to the whole of Israel. And although the
contempt of the world only comes to city-dwellers, these are the inhabitants of
Jerusalem, therefore Solomon intends "Song
of Songs" particularly for those who desire spiritual enlightenment. To those readers just embarking on their
education paternal honour and the authority of the king are claimed in their
own merit, but to those who have completed their learning, and in the case
where the disciple has been enlightened not by fear, but by love, his own name
suffices. Then, he is equal to his
teacher and he is unaware that he is a king. 
This is the case here. But in a
more spiritual understanding Solomon was peace making and beloved of the Lord
God, and Ecclesiastes can be seen as our Christ too, who destroying the inner
wall and expelling evil from his flesh, makes each of them one, saying -
"I give you my peace, I relinquish my peace to you" [John 14, 27.],
about which the Lord says to his disciples "This is my chosen son whom I
love: listen to him"  [Matt. 3, 17.],
and that is he who is father of the Church. 
Speaking by no means to the Synagogue of the Jews but to the crowd of
people the King of Jerusalem (that which was built out of the living rocks, not
that about which he says "Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you that kill
prophets"  [Matth. 23, 37.],
and "Look, let your empty house be left for us"  [Matth. 23, 38.]),
but that by which it is forbidden to swear because it is the city of a great
king. This is the son of David, to whom
the blind cried out in the Gospel: "pity us, son of David"; and the
whole crowd sang out in unison: "Hosanna to the son of David". Then there is the fact that the word of God
does not come to him as is the case with Jeremiah and the other prophets, but
on account of his being rich, being a king, holding power, his wisdom and his
other virtues, he speaks to the men of the church himself, and he speaks words
to the apostles about which Psalm 18.5 tells us: "their sound went out to
the whole world and their words went to the ends of the earth". Some scholars think wrongly, therefore, that
we are tempted into desire and luxury by this book, when it teaches quite to
the contrary: everything we perceive in the world is vain; nor is it fitting
for us to seek those things eagerly which perish while we possess them.
