You put in the front of your letter what would be pleasing, that it is written in the book of 1 Kings [Samuel]: “Samuel served as a boy before the Lord, girded in a linen ephod and having a small duplicate cloak which his mother had made for him and would bring to him day after day when she went up with her husband to offer sacrifice on the day of sacrifice.” Thus you inquire about this linen ephod with which the coming prophet will also be girded, namely, whether it will be a girdle, or, as many believe, some type of clothing. And if you clothe him, how will it be bound together? And why is the adjective linen added after the ephod? You also wrote down to be read the following: “And a man of God came to Eli and said to him, ‘Thus says the Lord: “I revealed myself to the house of your father when they were in the land of Egypt serving in the house of Pharaoh and I chose the house of your father from all the tribes of Israel to be my priest, that they might go up to my altar and burn incense and wear ephods.” ’ ” You took as an exemplar of the entire order of the book to follow that passage where Doeg the Edomite killed the priests at the king’s command. “Doeg of Syrus turned,” the Scripture says, “and fell upon the priests of the Lord and killed on that day three hundred and five men,” or, as the Hebrew reads, “eighty-five men,” all wearing ephods.And Nob, the city of priests, he killed with the edge of the sword, men and women, infants and toddlers, calves and foals and sheep, all to the edge of the sword. But Abiathar, one of the sons of Ahimelech, son of Ahitub, was saved and fled after David. I will not delay now except to anticipate the textual problem where we read “all wearing ephods,” but the Hebrew has “all wearing linen ephods.” You will learn in what follows why I say this. And add this to it: Abiathar, son of Ahimelech, fled to David and went down with David to Keilah, having the ephod in his hand. Then, Saul abandoned his pursuit when David came to Keilah, where, because it was feared that Saul would arrive and besiege the city, David said to Abiathar, “Bring down the ephod of the Lord.” These are excerpts from the book of Kings [Samuel] pushing you to transcend the book of Judges, in which Micah from Mt. Ephraim gave eleven hundred pieces of silver to his mother, which he had promised, who is said to have made graven and molten images out of them. Notice also that in a short while it is called ephod and teraphim, since surely if it is a girdle or a type of clothing, it cannot also be a graven or molten image. Acknowledge the error of almost all Latin thinkers who allege that the ephod and teraphim, named later, were part of the molten images made from this silver which Micah had given to his mother.
