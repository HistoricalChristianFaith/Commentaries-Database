“What is good.” … Abraham did not have good things because he was rich but because he used his riches well. And Lazarus, who later rested on Abraham’s bosom, did not suffer the pains of sickness and bear evils on the grounds of natural necessity; rather, he was pursued by evil people who thought truly good things were to be found in the world. Hence, the rich man of noble standing received good things in his life—which were food to him who thought they were good. Conversely, about Lazarus it is not said, “He received his own bad things in his life,” but rather “he received evil things in his life,” since they were not evils to him who suffered but seemed that way to others. Blessed Job has offered us an example of each, since he neither in good things nor in bad was overcome but endured all things with firm equanimity.
