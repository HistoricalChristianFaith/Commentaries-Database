(Verse 2, 3.) Shake off the dust; arise, Jerusalem! Loose the bonds of your neck, captive daughter Zion. For thus says the Lord: You were sold for nothing, and you shall be redeemed without money. LXX: Shake off the dust; arise, Jerusalem! Loose the bonds of your neck, captive daughter Zion. For thus says the Lord: You were sold for nothing, and you shall be redeemed without money. By no means does the word of the Prophet refer to Jerusalem, that is, to the ruins of its stones, and to the ashes and cinders, but it refers to the people who dwell within it. And it is called the daughter, because of the weakness of its spirit, as the following verse shows, in which it says: Loose the bonds of your neck, captive daughter Zion. Truly, the people of Judah are captives, who still bear the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar to this day, and are bound by the ropes of their sins and blasphemies. They were sold for nothing, and have done nothing deserving of redemption. As it is said above: 'Behold, you were sold for your sins, and I have dismissed your mother because of your iniquities.' And it gives the reasons why they were sold, why they were rejected. For, he says, I came and there was no man; I called and there was no one who would listen. From which it is clear that they were handed over to error and demons because they had not heard the one shouting: Come to me, all you who labor and are burdened (Matthew 11:28). But those who want to believe will be redeemed, not with silver and money, but with the precious blood of Christ, so that they may hear through the apostles: Grace to you and peace (Romans 1:7). For we are reconciled to God, not by merits, but by grace and faith in Christ. It is also said of the soul, which, defiled by the filth of vices, had lost the brightness of its former conduct, that it shakes off the dust with the Apostles, who clung to His feet (Matthew 10). For it could not be that the soul, which had submitted its neck to those passing by and had mingled with the earth, saying, 'My soul is humbled even to the dust, my belly has adhered to the earth' (Psalm 43:25), should receive the likeness of the earth. From which the Apostle calls us back, saying: As we have borne the image of the earthly, let us also bear the image of the heavenly (I Cor. XV, 49). Therefore those who are in the flesh cannot please God (Rom. VIII). Not that the nature of the flesh is condemned, of which God is the creator, and in which many have pleased God and reign with Christ: but that the works of the flesh are rejected, of which the same Apostle speaks: But I am carnal, sold under sin (Rom. VII, 14). Finally, he says to people like this: When there is envy and rivalry among you, are you not carnal and walking according to human standards (1 Corinthians 3:3)? And on the contrary to the saints: But you are not in the flesh; indeed, the Spirit of God dwells in you. Therefore, dust is expelled, as it is written: Will dust confess to you, or declare your truth (Psalm 30:9), so that the chains of our neck may be loosened; and may we not hear: Your neck is an iron sinew; but may we deserve to hear as a bride: How beautiful are your cheeks, like doves; your neck, like jewels (Song of Solomon 1:9). And again: I surrounded your wrists with bracelets, and a necklace around your neck; so that, liberated from heavy burdens and receiving your former adornments, we may cease to be captives, redeemed by him who came to proclaim remission to the captives. And of whom it is written (Isaiah 45:13): 'He shall build my city and bring back the captivity of my people, not with price nor with gifts.' To this meaning also agrees the Apostle Peter: Knowing that you were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain conversation, received by tradition from your fathers, but with the precious blood of the spotless Lamb (1 Peter 1:18).
