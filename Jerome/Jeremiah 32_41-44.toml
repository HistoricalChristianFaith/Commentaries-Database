(Verse 41 onwards) What does the Lord say about this: just as I brought upon this people all this great evil, so I will bring upon them all the good that I promise to them. And the fields in this land, of which you say it is deserted because no man, nor animal, remains, will be possessed. The fields will be bought with money, and recorded in a book, and sealed with a seal, and witnesses will be present in the land of Benjamin, and around Jerusalem, in the cities of Judah, and in the mountainous cities, and in the cities of the plain (or Shephelah), and in the cities of the Negev (which are to the south). For I will restore their captivity, says the Lord. These things, although they may have happened literally after the return from the Chaldeans, when the people returned to Judaea under the reign of Cyrus the king, are more truly and fully fulfilled spiritually in Christ and the Apostles. Then both men and animals were brought into the Church, according to what is written: 'You will save men and animals, O Lord, both rational and simple.' Then fields were bought with money, so that we could make friends for ourselves with the unjust mammon, who would receive us into eternal tabernacles (Luke 16). And it is written in the book, without doubt concerning the living. And it is imprinted with the sign of the banner of the Cross of the Lord and of Victory; and witnesses have been called, the Martyrs, and the chorus of all the saints. In the land of Benjamin, where the strength of the Lord exists, and in the vicinity of Jerusalem, where the vision of peace and eternal security resides: in the cities of Judah, where the true confession of Christ is found. And in the mountainous cities, of which there is one, about which it is said: a city cannot be hidden, when it is situated on a mountain (Matthew 5). And in the countryside cities, which are called Sephela in Hebrew, so that from the depths and depressions through the equality of the fields we may rise to the highest point. And in the cities that are to the south, which the LXX translated as Nageb, where the noon and the full light of truth are. But when all these things are accomplished, what is written will be fulfilled: I will turn their captivity, says the Lord, of whom it is written: ascending on high, he led captivity captive (Psalm 67:19). He received, or (as the Apostle says) he gave gifts to men (Ephesians 4:8).
