(Verse 26.) We will not become empty glory-seekers, provoking one another, envying one another. The Greek word κενόδοξοι, translated by the Latin interpreter through a circuit of three words, expresses how many definitions and meanings glory has, as well as the countless books by philosophers and the two volumes written by Cicero on the subject. However, because we strive not to discuss the etymology of words but the sense of Scripture, we will therefore connect this passage with the previous ones: If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by the Spirit, not by the Law, but by serving one another in love. We should not argue about the interpretation of Scripture and say, 'Circumcision is better,' no, but 'uncircumcision.' History should be disregarded, and allegory should be followed, rather allegory is empty and shadowy, and fixed on no truth roots. Thus it happens that envy is born among individuals. For they want to exclude you, saying that you should imitate them, not desiring to teach the truth of the Law, but to win. But so that we do not completely omit the word of glory untouched, leaving their foolishness to the philosophers, let us retract something from the Scriptures. The opinion of the crowd, and the praise sought by favor of men, sounds like the name of glory, where it is said: But all their works they do for to be seen of men (Matt. XXIII, 5). And elsewhere: How can ye believe, which receive honour one of another (John V, 44)? Furthermore, in a positive sense in the same place: and seek not the glory that comes from the only God. From which we understand that the same word sometimes signifies virtue, sometimes vice. If I seek glory from men, it is vice; if from God, it is virtue, who also encourages us to true glory, saying: But I receive not testimony from men (John V, 34), and They that honour me, I will honour (1 Sam. II, 30). The glory in divine Scriptures signifies something else, when it presents itself to the gaze of humans as more majestic and divine. The glory of the Lord was seen in the tabernacle and in the temple built by Solomon (1 Kings 8), and on the face of Moses when he did not realize that his face was glorified (Exodus 40). About this glory of the face, I think the Apostle also says: But we all, with unveiled face, beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, just as by the Spirit of the Lord (2 Corinthians 3:18). And the Savior himself, called the brightness of glory and figure of the substance of God (Heb. I). Stephen also saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing at his right hand (Acts VII). But in order that we may also presume the liberty of inventing names for ourselves, since new things require new names (as someone has said), it has been said here: Let us not become desirous of empty or vain glory; let us assert that those who desire the glory of God and the praise worthy of their virtue, and who display something more divine in their appearance, are eager for full glory. And in many places. Our people have transferred majesty for glory. Now for a long time, I desire to burst forth into words, but I am held back by the fear of speaking. Nevertheless, I will speak, and I will not remain silent about my passion, a passion almost common, not about wealth, not about power, not about beauty and the attractiveness of bodies; for these things are clearly called the works of the flesh. If almsgiving is done for praise, the glory is empty: a long speech, followed by paleness from fasting. The words are not mine, but belong to the Savior in the Gospel (Matthew 6). Chastity itself also often seeks human applause in marriage, widowhood, and virgins. And what I have long feared to say, but must be said, even martyrdom, if it is done for the sake of admiration and praise from brethren, is in vain. Let the Apostle speak, let the vessel of election speak: If I give my body to be burned, but have not charity, it profits me nothing (1 Corinthians 13:3). He who said: I know a man in Christ, fourteen years ago (whether in the body, I do not know; or whether out of the body, I do not know, God knows), was caught up to the third heaven (2 Corinthians 12:2). And after a little while: Caught up into paradise, he heard secret words, which it is not permitted for a man to speak: to him, I say, who exerted himself more than all, so that the greatness of the revelations would not exalt him, a thorn in the flesh was given to him, an angel of Satan, who slapped him, so that he would not be exalted. And indeed, three times he asked the Lord to depart from him; but it was said to him: My grace is sufficient for you: for power is made perfect in weakness. What work of God is so necessary as to read the Scriptures, to preach in the Church, to desire priesthood, to minister before the altar of the Lord? But even these, unless someone guards his heart with all diligence, arise from the desire for praise. You may see many (as even Cicero says) inscribe their books with titles about despising glory, and for the sake of glory, note the titles of their own names. We interpret the Scriptures: often we translate the style: what is worthy of reading, we write; and unless they are done for the cause of Christ, but for the memory of future generations and the reputation among people, all the labor will be in vain: and we will be like a resounding cymbal and a clanging cymbal (1 Corinthians 13). You may see many people arguing about the Scriptures: making the word of God a sports bench: they provoke each other, and if they are defeated, they envy: for they are eager for empty glory. I know from the Latin manuscripts in that testimony which we have set forth above: If I deliver my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing; but because of the similarity of the word, which in Greek is θερμανθήσομαι and θαυμασθήσομαι, only a part of a letter distinguishes it, an error has crept in among our people. But even among the Greeks themselves there are different copies.
