"Rejoice, O young man, in your youth; and let
your heart cheer you in the days of your youth, and walk in the ways of your
heart, and in the sight of your eyes: but know, that for all these things God
will bring you into judgement. Therefore remove sorrow from your heart, and put
away evil from your flesh: for childhood and youth are vanity. "
