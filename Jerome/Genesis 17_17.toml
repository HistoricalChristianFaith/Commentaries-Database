(Verse 17.) And Abraham fell upon his face and laughed. And he said in his heart, Shall a child be born unto him that is an hundred years old? and shall Sarah, that is ninety years old, bear? And after a little while: And thou shalt call his name Isaac. Different opinions, but there is one etymology why he is called Isaac. For Isaac is interpreted as laughter. Others say that Sarah laughed, therefore he was called laughter, which is false. Others indeed say that Abraham laughed, which we also approve. After Ishmael was born, Isaac was born, and then we read about Abraham and Sarah laughing. However, it should be known that in the Old Testament, four people were called by their names before they were born, without any disguise: Ishmael, Isaac, Solomon, and Josiah. Read the Scriptures.
