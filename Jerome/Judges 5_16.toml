(Judges 5:16) Why do you dwell between two boundaries, to hear the hissing of flocks? It is not read in Hebrew, 'between two', but rather 'between your boundaries', namely the boundaries of your neighboring tribes, to hear the hissing of flocks; as if to say: You desire to preserve the flocks with which you abound, and fear losing them, and you take greater pleasure in hearing their hissing than in striving with your brothers to conquer the enemies of Israel. And because you do this, you proudly resist the command of the Lord. And so it follows the same thing as above: after the division of Reuben, a dispute of the magnanimous is found: because he did evil, despising the authority of the Lord and being proud.
