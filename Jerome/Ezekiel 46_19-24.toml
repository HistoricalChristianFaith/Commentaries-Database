(Verse 19 and following) And he led me through the entrance that was on the side (or behind) the gate into the treasuries of the sanctuary, to the priests (or into chambers and rooms) that faced north. And there was a place there that faced west (or the sea: and as the LXX translated, separated). And he said to me: This is the place where the priests boil for the offense and for the sin (or for ignorance and therefore) where they boil the sacrifice (or the manna and the offering) so that they do not carry it out into the outer court, and the people may be sanctified. And he led me into the outer courtyard, and he led me around the four corners of the courtyard. And behold, there was a smaller courtyard in the corner of the courtyard, with a smaller courtyard in each corner of the courtyard. In the four corners of the courtyard, the smaller courtyards were arranged, forty cubits in length and thirty cubits in width. The measurements of each were the same: and a wall surrounded the four smaller courtyards in a circle. And kitchens were built underneath the colonnades around (or near) the dining areas, which Aquila interpreted as recesses, Symmachus as enclosures, and Theodotion put the Hebrew word Turoth itself. And he said, 'This is the house of the kitchens, where the ministers of the house cook the sacrifices of the people. For in Hebrew, Zeba means a man who holds a reed in his hand and a string of a mason, with which he measures the building. He led me, he says, through the entrance, which was on the side of the gate or behind the gate. He did not specify which gate, whether eastern, southern, or of another direction, but left it uncertain so that I would go to the place of the sanctuary, and to the treasury, or to the chambers of the priests, which faced north and the sea, namely, to the north and west. Holy Scripture has the custom of always calling the sea the west, according to the position of the land of Judaea. And it is to be noted that the place of the priests, where they cook sacrifices for transgressions, or ignorance, and for sins, so that they are not offered raw, is situated in the outer court facing north and west, from where the coldest wind arises and where the light of the sun sets. From this it is evident that whatever pertains to food is either for error or for sin. But if a sacrifice is offered also for ignorance, how much more for the consciousness of a transgression! Hence, Job offered a daily morning sacrifice for his sons, fearing that they had transgressed in ignorance. But what follows, 'So that they do not offer in the outer court, and the people who were not prepared for sanctification may be sanctified,' means that we should not lightly give holy things to those who are not sanctified, nor should we cast pearls before swine, nor give what is holy to dogs, as the Gospel says. Finally, Moses wished the people to be sanctified for three days from all impurity and from the embrace of their wives, so that they might approach Mount Sinai and receive the holy things when they were sanctified. But if they were commanded to be sanctified from their wives in order to approach and receive the words of God, it is clear that it is contained in the Law of the Apostles: 'Do not defraud one another, unless by consent for a time, so that you may give yourselves to prayer.' And with consent, we must abstain from our wives so that we may give ourselves to prayer. After this, it is written, 'And he led me into the outer court and led me around the four corners of the court. And behold, there was a small courtyard in the corner of the court, with small courtyards placed in each corner of the court, arranged in the four corners of the court.' That man, whom he often mentions, led him out from the place of the priests, which faced north or was separate, where the priests cook for transgressions, sins, or ignorance, and led him into the outer court. From this we understand that the court from which he went out was inside, and there were many courts in the Holy Scriptures, about which we read, 'You who stand in the house of the Lord, in the courts of the house of our God.' And in John, 'And I have other sheep that are not of this fold, and it is necessary that I bring them also, and they will hear my voice, and there will be one fold and one shepherd.' For this in Greek is called αὐλὴ, which the simple Latin translation rendered as a sheepfold. But when he says, 'of this fold,' he shows that there is another one, which is either demonstrated in the multitude of the nations for the distinction from Israel or in heaven for the separation of the earthly fold. And according to the quality of merits, each office is assigned to a particular court, about which we have spoken more fully earlier. But this court that is now being discussed had small courtyards at each of its four corners, which the Seventy call minor, and we have called them small courtyards for the sake of easier understanding. They were forty cubits long and thirty cubits wide. Concerning these numbers, I remember that I have discussed in this same work that one refers to tribulations and narrowness, the other to perfect age. For forty days, Moses, Elijah, the Lord and Savior fasted in the wilderness, and they reach the priestly office not after the twenty-fifth year of age, but after the thirtieth. Therefore, the Lord was thirty years old when he came for baptism, and in this same work, the thirtieth year is mentioned at the beginning. Wherever there is food, there is also distress and temptation through which provisions are obtained. And when we reach the perfect age of man, everything must be trampled upon, and we must say, 'Having food and clothing, let us be content with these.' And, 'If the Lord gives me food to eat and clothes to cover me.' Or certainly, 'Food for the stomach and the stomach for food, but God will destroy both it and them.' For we will not eat or drink in the future, but we will be nourished by the bread that descends from heaven, about which it is sung in the Psalms, 'Man ate the bread of angels.' And, 'My food is to do the will of him who sent me.' But concerning the measure of the small courtyards, which possessed the corners of the large court, it signifies the four regions of the world. For in the sweat of our faces we eat bread, and every laborally profiting conduces to the stomach. Those four small courtyards or one wall surrounded, and kitchens were built underneath the colonnades all around, or they had nearby alcoves, so that where there is food, there is also the preparation of measures. And lest the prophet might not know what these things that he saw were, he said to him, 'This is the house of the kitchens, where the ministers of the Lord cook the sacrifices of the people.' Indeed, the sacrifices of the people, which are offered for transgressions, sins, and ignorance, are the food and refreshment of the priests, so that they remember not to seek anything else when the meats are also prepared for their refreshment in the temple.
