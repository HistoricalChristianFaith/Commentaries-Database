(Verse 15) But when the chief priests and scribes saw the wonderful things that he did, and the children crying out in the temple and saying, 'Hosanna to the Son of David', they were indignant and said to him, 'Do you hear what these are saying?' Many believe that the raising of Lazarus is the greatest sign, that the blind man received sight from birth, that the voice of the Father was heard at the Jordan, and that he showed the glory of the triumphant one when he was transfigured on the mountain. Among all the signs that he performed, it seems more amazing to me that one man, at that time considered despicable and exceedingly lowly to the point of being crucified later, could drive out such a multitude with a whip of cords, overturn tables, break chairs, and do other things that an infinite army would not have done. For a fiery and heavenly radiance shone forth from his eyes, and the majesty of divinity shone upon his face. And though the priests dared not lay hands on him, they nevertheless plotted against him, and they twisted the testimony of the people and children who cried out, 'Hosanna to the son of David,' into a slander: for it is clear that this can only be said of the Son of God alone. Therefore, let the bishops and all holy men see with what danger they allow these things to be said of themselves, if the Lord to whom this was truly said is accused of a crime, since the faith of the believers was not yet solidified.
