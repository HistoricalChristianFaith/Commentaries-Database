(Verse 26.) Then rising up, he commanded the winds and the sea: and there was a great calm. And from this place we understand that all creatures feel their Creator. For those whom he rebukes, and those whom he commands, feel the one who commands: not by the error of heretics, who think that all things are animate; but by the majesty of the creator, which to us is imperceptible, but to them is perceptible.
