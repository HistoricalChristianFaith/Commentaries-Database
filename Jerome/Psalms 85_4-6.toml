“Restore us, O God of our salvations.” Why did the psalmist not say “our salvation” instead of “our salvations”? If we sinned just once, we would need only one salvation; but we have sinned many times and, therefore, are in need of many salvations. “Will you not instead, O God, give us life?” Until the Lord restores us to life, we are dead. “Show us, O Lord, your kindness, and grant us your salvation.” The Savior’s descent is the work of God’s mercy. He would not have come as a physician if most people were not sick. Because so many were sick, he came as Physician; because we were in need of compassion, he came as Savior.
