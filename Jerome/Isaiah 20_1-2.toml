“And the Spirit entered me and set me upon my feet and spoke to me, saying, ‘Go and enclose yourself within your house.’ ” Unable to bear the glory of the Lord standing before him, he fell on his face, only to be raised up by the indwelling Spirit. When the Spirit set him upon his feet and spoke, saying, “Go and enclose yourself within your house,” this is what he meant: “Because you were strengthened by the appearance of the Lord’s majesty, you should neither fear nor be terrified of anything, but return to your house (either to tend to the needs of the body, as some think, or to signify the future siege) and, as a barefoot, naked Isaiah announced for three years the coming captivity and nakedness of the people, so also your own enclosure in the house will itself be a prophet announcing the siege of the city of Jerusalem.”
