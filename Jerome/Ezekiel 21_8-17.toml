(Vers. 8 et seq.) And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: Son of man, prophesy and say: Thus says the Lord God, speak: A sword, a sharp sword, has been sharpened and polished, to slaughter victims; it has been sharpened, and polished, to shine: you who move the scepter of my son, you have cut down every tree. And I have given him to be polished, to be held in hand: this sword has been sharpened, and this sword has been polished, to be in the hand of the one who kills. Cry out and wail, son of man, for this has happened in my people, it has happened to all the leaders of Israel. Those who fled were delivered over to the sword along with my people. Therefore, strike your thigh and clap your hands in applause, for he has been tested and when he overturns the scepter, it will not be. This is what the Lord God says. As for you, son of man, be a prophet and strike hand against hand, and let the sword be doubled and tripled for the slayers. This is the sword of great slaughter that makes them astonished, causes their hearts to melt, and multiplies ruins. In all their gates I have given confusion of sharp and polished swords to flash: clothed for slaughter. Go to the right or to the left, wherever your desire leads your face. Indeed, I will applaud hand to hand, and I will fulfill my indignation, I, the Lord, have spoken. It is much if I present both editions, and the length of the books is extended, especially where there is either no distance or a small one. Therefore, I will present some things that differ. For this reason, what we said: 'Whoever moves the scepter of my son, cut down every tree,' they translated as: 'Kill, despise, reject every tree.' And again, where we said: 'Those who fled were handed over to the sword,' they translated as: 'My guests, or inhabitants.' And where we said: 'Applaud on the thigh,' they put: 'Strike with the hand.' And where we translated: 'And when he overturns this with the scepter, the edition belongs to them: Three are repelled.' However, he speaks to the sword of Nebuchadnezzar, that it may come against Jerusalem, to be sharpened and polished, for there are many to be slain; and he addresses Nebuchadnezzar himself. You are the one who moves and overturns the scepter of my son, the dominion of the people of Israel, and you cut down every tree, the entire multitude of the people. I have given, he says, this sword, that it may be held in the hand of Nebuchadnezzar; and let it be in the hand of a mighty man. Therefore, O prophet, cry out and wail, and with a voice filled with dire words, bear witness to the imminent calamity. This sword spared no one, nor left anyone untouched by the impending evils. It was made among the people, made among the leaders of Israel, made among my guests and priests who lived in my temple. Therefore, strike your thigh or your hand and put on the attire of one who mourns. For this sword has been tested by me, and it will overthrow my scepter and kingdom, which will no longer exist, and it will end with King Zedekiah. Again I command you, prophet, that you strike not only the thigh in astonishment and miracle, but also the hands, so that not only once, but a second and third time, the sword may come to kill. For first came Nebuchadnezzar, when he took Jehoiachin, and secondly, when Jehoiakim reigned, and thirdly, when Zedekiah. And this is the triple sword, when a great slaughter occurred and it multiplied ruins to such an extent that they were amazed in their minds and their hearts wasted away, and it caused disturbance in all their gates. Therefore it is ordered to him, that is, with a sharp and polished sword for flashing, and with a cloak and unburdened, and ready for slaughter, that he may go either to the right or to the left. Wherever, he says, it pleases your face, boldly enter, having me as your leader, me as your helper. I will applaud hand to hand, so that I may encourage you against my adversaries who rage against you, as if I were your supporter and instigator. Do not doubt, do not fear, and do not be afraid to suffer what Sennacherib has suffered: I am the Lord who has spoken, you are the minister of my will, fulfill my plan. We can, by way of anagoge, take up a sharp and ready sword for the slaughter of the devil, concerning whom the Apostle says: Deliver this kind of Satan unto the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved (I Cor. V, 5). And in another place: Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I have delivered unto Satan, that they may learn not to blaspheme (I Tim. I, 20). And it is written in the Psalms: He sent forth his wrath and indignation and distress, a mission by the agency of wicked angels (Ps. LXXVII, 49). Some think that this sword was in the hand of an angel when Jerusalem was struck under David (2 Kings 24). Others suspect that it is said of the same sword in the Gospel: I did not come to bring peace on earth, but a sword (Matthew 10:34); and to divide among themselves every affection of kinship, so that the wicked may fall and the holy may rise. But it is impious to believe this of the sword of the Savior, and rather this should be believed of the devil, who overturns the scepters of the Lord in the Church, who kills all in the people, and the leaders, and the guests of God; and then is approved by the Lord, when he overthrows Judas the traitor and his like (John 13). After he had eaten the morsel, Satan entered into him. And the sword of those who were killed doubled and tripled, in order to forgive the sin of Jerusalem, because it had taken upon itself its own double sins from the hand of the Lord. But the Lord rejoices and exults, and encourages the raging sword to go either to the right or to the left, and wherever its desire takes it, so that the evil may be killed and the good may remain, and fulfill what is written: What are chaff to wheat? The Lord says (Jeremiah 23:32).
