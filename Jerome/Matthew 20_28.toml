(Verse 28) Just as the Son of Man came not to be served, but to serve. Note that we have frequently said that the one who serves is called the Son of Man.

And to give his life as a ransom for many. When he assumed the form of a servant, in order to shed his blood for the world (Philippians 2). He did not say that he would give his life as a ransom for all, but for many, that is, for those who would be willing to believe.
