(Verse 12.) For whoever has, more will be given to him, and he will have an abundance; but whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken away from him. Those who have the ability to judge are given more, and those who do not have it, lose even what they seem to have: but what the apostles have in Christ, namely faith, is granted to them even if they have fewer virtues. But to the Jews who do not believe in the Son of God, even what good they possess by nature is taken away. For those who do not have wisdom, they cannot understand anything wisely.
