(Verse 6.) Searching the wall, and magnificent upon the mountain: and Elam took the quiver, the chariot of a man on horseback, and uncovered the shield the shield stripped the wall. The army of Babylon is described as entering the city, occupying the temple, and proudly advancing through the streets with chariots. And the fact that it uncovered the golden posts and the walls adorned with marble crusts, the shield that is used to cover others, elegantly resonates in Hebrew, and the meaning is most beautiful, that it did not protect anyone, but uncovered. This is because through the strength of the soldiers all resources have been plundered. But if the Elamites are mentioned in battle, which city is of the Assyrians: it cannot be referred to the times of the Roman overthrow, unless perhaps we interpret everything allegorically.
