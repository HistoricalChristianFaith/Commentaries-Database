(Verse 13) And the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners before God exceedingly. This addition, "before God," is superfluous in the Septuagint interpreters, since the inhabitants of Sodom were wicked and sinners among all people. However, a person is said to be a sinner before God, who can appear righteous among people, just as it is declared in the proclamation of Zachariah and Elizabeth that they were both righteous before God (Luke 1:6). And in the Psalter it is said: 'No living creature shall be justified in your sight.' (Ps. 142:2)
