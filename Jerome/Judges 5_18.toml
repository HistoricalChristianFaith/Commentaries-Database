(Judges 5:18) Zebulun and Naphtali offered their lives unto death in the region of Morome. In Hebrew, it is 'super regionem Morome'. The meaning is that while the other tribes were unwilling to go, these two tribes offered their lives unto death. In the region of Morome. For Morome is interpreted as 'exalted': they are said to have offered their lives for the sake of the exalted region, that is, for God, and therefore they are praised, while the other tribes are criticized.
