(Verse 8, 9.) He is near who justifies me: who will contradict me? Let us stand together. Who is my adversary? Let him come near to me. Behold, the Lord God is my helper: who is he that will condemn me? Behold, all of them shall wear out like a garment, the moth shall eat them up. LXX: He is near who justifies me: who is he that will judge me, stand up against me together? And who is he that will enter into judgment with me? Let him come near to me. Behold, the Lord is my helper, who shall afflict me? Behold, all of you shall grow old like a garment, and like a moth shall eat you. If anyone, says He, thinks that I am justly addicted to the cross and have committed some sin, let him resist me. Who is there to be judged with me, so as not to be overcome by the power of my majesty, but by reason? However, he is judged with the Lord, not by the authority of the reigning, but by the comparison of virtues: just as the apostles judged the twelve tribes of Israel, and the Ninevites, and the queen of Sheba judged the people of the Jews. According to which sense, it is said to Jerusalem: Sodom is justified by you (Ezech. XVI, 52). Therefore, since no one can be justified in the presence of the Lord, all will grow old like a garment (Ps. CI). And what grows old is close to ruin. And it will consume them like a moth, it says. Clearly the conscience of sinners; and the zeal of the saved gentiles. About which it is said at the end of this volume: Their worm will not die. And in Micah against perverse princes: I will take away their goods like a moth devouring, and walking on the standard on the day of speculation (Micah VII, 4, sec. LXX). And in Proverbs: The moth of bones has understanding of the heart (Prov. XIV, 30, sec. LXX). For tinea, in this place Symmachus interpreted it as rust: while Aquila as worm.
