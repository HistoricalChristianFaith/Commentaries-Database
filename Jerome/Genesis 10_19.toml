(Verse 19.) And the boundary of the Canaanites was from Sidon, as you come to Gerar, as far as Gomorrah, and Admah, and Zeboiim, to Lasha. These are the cities of Sidon and Gerar, and Sodom and Gomorrah, and Admah and Zeboiim, which are known to all, but it is important to note that Lasha itself is now called Callirhoe, where the hot springs flow into the Dead Sea.
