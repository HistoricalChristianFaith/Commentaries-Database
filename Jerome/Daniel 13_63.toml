Verse 63. "But Helcias and his wife praised God for their daughter Susanna..." Like true saints they praise God after a worthy fashion, not simply on the ground of Susanna's deliverance from the clutches of the elders - for that would hardly be sufficient matter for praise or of any decisive importance, even if she had not been so delivered - but rather on the ground that no immorality was found in her.
