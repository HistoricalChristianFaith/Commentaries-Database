He fell, for his dwelling place was always in heaven. He is the one to whom the words of Ezekiel are addressed: “You were stamped with the seal of perfection.” Notice exactly what the prophet says: “the seal of perfection.” He did not say to the devil, you are the sign of perfection, but the seal of perfection. God had set his impression on you and made you like to himself, but you afterwards destroyed the resemblance. You were created in the image and likeness of God.
