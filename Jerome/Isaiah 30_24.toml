(Verse 24) And rain will be given to your seed wherever you sow it in the land, and the bread of the earth will be most abundant and rich. LXX: Then rain will be given to the seed of your land, and the bread of the earth will be plentiful and rich. It is written in the Book of Kings (3 Kings 18) that after the false prophets were killed by Elijah, rain was given to the land of Israel. And the bread of Elisha and later the Savior was most abundant and richest, and it had such abundance that many thousands of people were satisfied from it (4 Kings 4; John 6). And in the present place, rain will not be given to the spiritual seed, and the earth's most abundant and richest bread, unless the silver and gold idols have been broken and considered as dung. For unless vices have departed, virtues do not enter.
