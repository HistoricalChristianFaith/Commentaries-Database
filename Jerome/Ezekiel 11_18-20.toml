I will gather you from the peoples, and I will return the land of Israel to you. When you have entered and taken away all the idols that caused offences to God, I will give you one heart, to fear and serve the Lord, so that you stop serving any kind of idols, even if they are different from the ones you had; and I will put a new spirit in your innermost being.
