(Verse 6.) For even your brothers and the household of your father themselves fought against you, and they cried out after you with a loud voice: do not believe them when they speak good things to you. To such an extent, he says, you will be overwhelmed by the most violent waves of the Jordan, and the multitude of horsemen coming from afar will devastate you, so that even your brothers from the Edomite lineage, and the household of your father, who are descendants of Lot, Moab and Ammon, themselves will fight against you in times of necessity and distress, and will insult you (Genesis 19). Beware of trusting them and having hope in kinship, through which they may rage against you more than your enemies. This can also be understood in reference to Jesus, that his brothers and the household of his father fought against him and cried out loudly, saying: Crucify him, crucify him: we have no king but Caesar (John 19:15).
