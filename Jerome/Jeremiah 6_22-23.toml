(Verse 22, 23.) Thus says the Lord: Behold, a people comes from the land of the north, and a great nation will rise from the ends of the earth. They will take hold of the bow and shield (or javelin); they are cruel (or shameless) and will not show mercy. Their voice will sound like the sea, and they will ride on horses, prepared like a man for battle against you, daughter of Zion. This is specifically prophesied about the Babylonians, who will come against the people of Jerusalem, and the entire order of their armament is described, as well as the attack of the fighters, so that, shaken by the terrifying sound, they may repent and please the most merciful God. Finally, the opportunity to ask arises, as it were, against you, daughter of Zion. We can use this testimony during the time of persecution, when the rage of the devil is stirred up against us, and there is no mercy: and like the most violent waves of the sea, they overwhelm those who resist.
