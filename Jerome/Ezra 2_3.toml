A type of these events previously occurred in Zerubbabel and Ezra, when the people returned and the city was begun to be built on its heights and religion observed in the temple, all of which are contained in Ezra‘s own book. But this was more fully and more perfectly completed in the Lord and Savior and his apostles, when the city was built on its heights—about which it is written, &#8213;A city set on a hill cannot be hidden&#8214;—and the temple was founded in accordance with its order and ceremony, so that whatever was done carnally by the people in the past would be completed spiritually in the church.

Theodoret of Cyrus:
 
“And Josue the son of Josedec rose up, and his brethren the priests, and Zorobabel the son of Salathiel,” Now this is the man who after the return was in charge of the people.  From them Christ the Lord was descended according to flesh. [Commentary on Ezekiel 17:23]

Many think that this (Jer. 32:37-41) was fulfilled in the time of Zerubbabel the son of Shealthiel and Jeshua the son of Josadek the high priest, when Haggai and Zechariah prophesied under Ezra the priest, when the temple was rebuilt and when the walls surrounding the city were repaired under Nehemiah.  According to this view, the people who formerly were driven out of Jerusalem in God's anger, wrath and great indignation, being dispersed into the whole world, were afterwards to be brought back and made to dwell securely, so that they would be God's people and the Lord would be their God, as Scripture describes. [Commentary on Jeremiah, 32:37-41]
