(Verse 13 and following) Then Pilate said to him: Do you not hear how many testimonies they speak against you? And he did not respond to him with any word, so that the governor wondered greatly. Now it was customary for the governor to release one prisoner to the people on the solemn day, whom they desired. Indeed, it is a Gentile who condemns Jesus, but he refers the matter to the Jewish people. Do you not hear how many testimonies they speak against you? But Jesus refused to respond, in order to not diminish the accusation from the governor, and to prevent the delay of the usefulness of the cross.
