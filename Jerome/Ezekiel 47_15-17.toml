(Versed. 15 seqq.) This is the end of the land on the northern side, from the great sea, for those coming from Ethalon, Sadada, Emath, Berotha, Sabarim, which is between the middle of Damascus and the border of Emath: the courtyard of Thicon (Vulg. house of Atthicon), which is near the borders of Auran (or Auranitis). And the boundary will be from the sea to the courtyard of Enon (or Seraranan), the boundary of Damascus, and from the North to the North the boundary of Emath on the northern side (Vulg. and the boundary of Emath; on the northern side). Concerning the description of the land of the holy twelve tribes, commanded by Joshua the son of Nun, and which is now ruled by Ezekiel, it is worth noting that there the land is divided among the tribes by lot, as ordained by the Lord. In the Book of Numbers (Num. XXXIV), which divides the entire promised land into four regions in a brief discourse, the description of the northern region is as follows: Starting from the north, that is, the northern border, they will begin from the Great Sea, reaching up to the highest mountain, from which you will come to Hamath, to the borders of Zedad, they will go to Ziphrona and the town of Enam, also known as Aser Enon. And the Hebrews say that the northern region begins from the Great Sea, which extends along the coasts of Palestine, Phoenicia, the region called Coele Syria, and Cilicia, and stretches through Egypt to Libya. And when it says, 'The borders shall reach to the highest mountain' (Numbers 34:7), the same Hebrews interpret it to mean either Mount Amanus or Mount Taurus, which we think is more likely. From there, it is said, one will come to Emath, which is now called Epiphania, with the name changed by Antiochus, the most cruel of tyrants: for he had the surname Epiphanes. He says, 'They will go to the boundaries of Sadada, a place that is currently mentioned in the reading of Ezechiel, and they will reach the borders of Zephrona, which is today called Zephyrium, a town in Cilicia. And the next part, 'And the village of Enam,' is written in Hebrew as 'Aser Enon,' or 'Enan,' and the present location is included in this. And for now, it suffices to briefly summarize the historical context, and to connect the description in both Numbers and Ezechiel: so that a discerning reader understands in which places they mentioned the same, similar, or different things. Now that we have interpreted the names of each, let us follow the anagoge and discuss what seems to us in each, with the Lord providing. Ethalon is interpreted as the cradle of sorrow. Sadada, his side, understand not in terms of width but in terms of the side. Emath, fury, which is called in Greek, χόλος. Berotha, of the well. Sabarim, circuit of mountains. Damascus, blood of the bag and the kiss, or cup. But the house, or atrium Thicon, Symmachus interprets as the middle atrium, which extends to the borders of Auran. Therefore, Thicon, the middle one, resounds: Auran, which in Greek translates to Auranitidis, anger. Aser, however, Enon, which is the boundary of Damascus, is called the atrium of the fountain in our language. Therefore, the northern region begins from the great sea through the way of Ethalon, which means the cradle of sorrow, and through repentance it comes to Sadada, where there is a decline on the side. For we understand the impending Emath upon us, which is the wrath of God; or Emath, the truth being known, the wells of Berotha are opened for us, which were dug by the patriarchs, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob: and after a long circuit we come to the mountains of Sabarim, which are located between Damascus, that is, the blood of the cilice, and the border of Emath, as we have said above, the truth. For just as we turn away from approaching evils through fear and avoid them on one side, so after the shedding of blood and the sackcloth of a bloody life, before we come to the borders of Emath, we circumscribe and arrive at the mountains, of which it is written: Mountains surround it, and the Lord surrounds his people (Psalm 124:2). This place is called the court of Thicon, that is, the middle court, as Symmachus has interpreted, near the borders of Auran, which means wrath, and let us say with the prophet: I will endure the wrath of the Lord, because I have sinned against him (Micah 4:9). And from the sea as far as the borders of Damascus; in which also the Apostle Paul (Acts IX) saw the light in blindness from the Jewish fury and the shedding of Ecclesiastical blood, and having taken up the sackcloth of old persecution, he preached the Gospel in order to reach the courtyard of the eternal fountain, and being placed in the North, he grasped the boundary of truth.
