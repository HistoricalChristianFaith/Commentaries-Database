“You shall eat it with its head and shanks and inner organs.” To me, the head seems to be that of the Lamb, written of in St. John’s Gospel: “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God; and the Word was God; he was in the beginning with God.” The shanks represent the human nature that he deigned to assume for our salvation. Another interpretation, however, is also possible. The head may be taken to signify spiritual understanding; the shanks, historical narrative; the inner organs are whatever lies hidden within the letter, whatever is not perceived on the surface but is brought to light by exegetes only after they have well considered it in painstaking investigation.
