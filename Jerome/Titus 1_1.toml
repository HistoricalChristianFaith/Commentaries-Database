When he says, “An apostle of Jesus Christ,” it seems to be as if he had said, “commanding officer of the praetorian guard of Augustus Caesar, master of the army for Tiberius Caesar.” Just as secular judges are seen as more noble in accordance with the kings whom they serve and are assigned a name from the dignity by which they are elevated, so by establishing his great dignity among Christians as an apostle, he has designated himself with the title of apostle of Christ, that he might strike awe into his readers by the authority of the name. Thereby he indicates that all who believe in Christ are to be in submission to him.
