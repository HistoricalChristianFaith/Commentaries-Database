"Paul the servant of God: an apostle however of Jesus Christ." In the Epistle to the Romans he begins thus: “Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle,” but in this one he calls himself “a servant of God,” while he is “an apostle of Jesus Christ.” For if the Father and the Son are one, and he who believes in the Son, believes also in the Father, that servitude of the Apostle Paul is to be referred, indiscriminately, either to the Father or to the Son. But, however, this servitude is not that of which the Apostle says himself: “For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear, but ye have received the spirit of adoption, whereby we cry Abba, Father” (Romans 8:15), but it is a noble servitude, of which David speaks to God: “Behold, oh Lord, I am thy servant; I am thy servant, and the son of thy handmaid” (Psalms 116:16), and of which the blessed Mary speaks to the angel: “Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word" (Luke 1:38). Moses had this bondage, of whom the Lord said to Joshua the son of Nun, 'Moses, my servant, is dead' (Joshua 1:2). And in another place, 'Moses, the servant of the Lord, died on the land of Moab according to the word of the Lord' (Deuteronomy 34:5). It is to be far from thinking that Moses and Mary had the spirit of servitude in fear and not in love for God. It is not surprising that although called holy men, they were nobly called servants of God, as the Father speaks to the Son through the prophet Isaiah: 'It is great for you to be called my servant, my child' (Isaiah 49:6), which is said in Greek: μέγα σοὶ ἐστι τοῦ κληθῆναί σε παῖδά μου. But we sought after 'my child' in Hebrew and found it not written, but 'my servant,' that is, Abdi. Hence, Obadiah the prophet, whose name means 'the servant of the Lord,' received his name from serving God. If anyone is moved when he hears that the Lord and Savior, who created the universe, is called a servant of God, he will not be moved if he listens to the apostles speaking to themselves, 'Whoever wills among you shall be the greatest, let him be the servant of all,' and 'The Son of Man came not that he should be served, but that he should serve' (Matthew 20:27-28). He did not only seem to teach this with words, but also demonstrated it through example. For once, he took a towel, girded himself, and filled a basin with water and washed the disciples' feet (John 13). It is not therefore impious to believe that he who assumed the form of a servant did those things which were the duty of a servant, so that he should be said to have served his Father's will by serving his own servants. But this servitude is of charity, by which we are commanded to serve one another. And the Apostle himself, though free from all, made himself the servant of all (1 Cor. 9). And in another place: "Your servant for Christ's sake." He is the servant of God who is not the servant of sin. For everyone who commits sin is the servant of sin (John 8:34). Therefore, the Apostle, who was not the servant of sin, is rightly called the servant of God the Father and of Christ. Furthermore, when he says, "The Apostle of Jesus Christ," it seems to me to mean the same as if he had said, "The appointed prefect of the emperor Augustus, the commander-in-chief of the army of Tiberius Caesar." For just as judges of this world, in order to appear more noble, take their titles from the kings they serve and from the dignity with which they are inflated, so the Apostle, claiming for himself a great dignity among Christians, designated himself by the title of Apostle of Christ, so that he might inspire terror in those who read his name itself, indicating that all who believed in Christ should be subject to him. Moreover, what we have just written in Romans: "The servant of Jesus Christ" does not differ from his saying, "The servant of wisdom, the servant of righteousness, the servant of sanctification, the servant of redemption, for Christ became for us from God the Father, wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, and redemption (1 Cor. 1:30).
