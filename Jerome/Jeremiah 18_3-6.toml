Whatever is discerned by the eyes arrives to the judgment and understanding of the soul through every other sense, through hearing, smelling, tasting and touching, but is retained even more so by the mind. Thus, the prophet was commanded to go to the potter’s house and there to hear the instructions of the Lord. “When,” he says, “I arose and went down to the potter’s house, he was making something on the wheel,” which the Seventy translated with the ambiguous and misleading word “stones,” for abanim and organum, both meaning “potter’s wheel,” are sometimes called stones, depending on the region and local dialect. “When,” he continues, “I discerned that the vessel that he was making out of clay suddenly fell apart,” this occurred by the providential agency of God, that the artisan’s hand, unwittingly, would create a parable by its mistake. Then the potter who had destroyed his clay vessel on the turning wheel made of it something else, as seemed to him the thing to do. And immediately the Lord said to the prophet, “If this potter has such power that he can remake something out of the same clay that disintegrated, am I not able to do the same for you who seem to have perished?” Moreover, that he might signify thereby the freedom of the will, the Lord said that he would announce punishments and rewards to the nations and to this king or that king. It was not that these events that he had predicted were to happen, but rather that good may be brought out of evil if they repented, or evil brought out of good if, after their resolutions, they returned to sin. Our point here is not that God was ignorant of what the nations and kings would do, but rather that he had endowed the human person with his own will, so that he would receive either a reward or a punishment on the basis of his own merit. Yet, what happens is not entirely dependent on a person, but also the grace that God has bestowed on all, for the freedom of the will must be restrained so that the grace of the Giver would excel in all things, according to the prophecy: “Unless the Lord builds the house, its builders labor for nothing; unless the Lord keeps the city, do the guards watch over it in vain.” For “it is not of the one who wills or of the one who runs, but of the God who has mercy.”
