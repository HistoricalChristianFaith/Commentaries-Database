(Verse 10.) The likeness of their faces, the face of a man and the face of a lion on their right side, and the face of an ox on their left side, and the face of an eagle above them. The faces represent the beginning of the Gospels, in which the human and lion symbolize the birth of Christ and the voice of the prophets thundering in the wilderness on the right side. The ox, which represents the sacrifices and the priesthood of the Jews, is on the left side, which was abolished and passed on to the spiritual priesthood, as it is written: You are a priest forever after the order of Melchizedek (Psalm 110:4); so that all things may belong to him and be counted as one body. But the eagle, which is both about the birth and the prophecy, which is fulfilled by the Lord's coming, and about the priesthood that has passed, and beyond all these things, referring to the spiritual birth, how the Father is in the Son, and the Son is in the Father. Concerning which it is rightly said: Who shall declare his generation (Isaiah 53:8)? These are, according to the Apocalypse (Chapter 4), as we have already said, four living creatures full of eyes before and behind, of which one is like a lion, and the second like a calf, and the third has the face of a man, and the fourth is like a flying eagle. There they are said to have the form of Seraphim with six wings, two covering their face and two covering their feet, and two flying, and they do not rest day or night, saying: Holy, holy, holy, the Lord God Almighty, who was, and who is, and who is to come (Rev. 4:8).
