Those who write against the Gospels suppose that it is out of ignorance that the disciples of Christ have interpreted the eclipse of the sun (a phenomenon which usually happens at certain, established times) in accordance with the resurrection of the Lord, whereas an eclipse of the sun normally occurs only at the rising of a new moon. Now there is no doubt that at the time of the Passover the moon was full. Lest we believe that the shadow of the earth or the movement of the moon’s orb across the sun had produced a brief twilight, a duration of three hours is specified in order to preclude all other explanations. I am persuaded that this happened in fulfillment of the prophecies: “The sun will set at noon, and the light in the day will become dark over the earth,” and in another place, “The sun set when it was still the middle of the day.” And it seems quite clear to me that the light of the world (this is a greater heavenly body) had held back its beams so that neither would the Lord be seen hanging nor would the wicked blasphemers take any delight while the sun was still shining.

(Verse 45) But at the sixth hour, darkness came over the whole land until the ninth hour. Those who wrote against the Gospels suspect a solar eclipse, which usually occurs at certain fixed times, as the reason for the disciples of Christ being misunderstood about the resurrection of the Lord: since a solar eclipse only occurs when the moon is rising. However, there is no doubt that during the time of Passover, the moon was full. And so it would not seem that the shadow of the earth, or the opposite side of the moon, made brief and rusty darkness, is placed in a space of three hours, so that every opportunity of causing harm is removed. And I think this was done in order to fulfill the prophecy, saying: The sun shall go down at noon, and it shall be dark over the earth in broad daylight (Amos 8:9); and in another place: The sun went down while it was still day (Jeremiah 15:9). And it seems to me that the most radiant light of the world, that is, the greater luminary, withdrew its rays so as not to see the Lord hanging, or so that the wicked blasphemers might not enjoy their own light.
