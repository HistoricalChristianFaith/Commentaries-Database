(Verse 8 and following) Behold, you trust in yourselves with words of falsehood (or lies) which have not benefited you. To steal, to kill, to commit adultery, to swear falsely, to offer sacrifices to Baal, and to follow foreign gods that you do not know. And you have come and stood before me in this house, in which my name is invoked, and you have said: We are delivered (or we have ceased): because we have done all these abominations. They vainly have confidence in the temple, as the following sins show. For what profit is it to boldly enter the threshold of God's house, standing with erect neck: and not only to have a polluted heart, but also hands defiled with theft, homicide, adultery, perjury, sacrilege, and worship of those gods whom you do not know? No one doubts that these things happen spiritually in the Church, when considering the happiness of the present time, they do not consider their own sins: and they think that God is hidden, because punishment does not immediately follow; rather, they break forth into such madness, that they think themselves freed, because they have also turned away from the worship of the Lord after evil deeds.
