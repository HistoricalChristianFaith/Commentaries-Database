But what can I do, I who can only wish for peace and have no power to bring it about? Even though the wish may win its reward with God, its futility must still sadden one who cherishes it. When the apostle said, “as much as lies in you, live peaceably with all,” he knew quite well that the realization of peace depends on the consent of two parties. The prophet truly cries, “They say Peace, peace: and yet there is no peace.” To overthrow peace by actions while professing it in words is not hard. To point out its advantages is one thing, and to strive for it another. People’s speeches may be all for unity, but their actions may in fact enforce bondage. I wish for peace as much as any one else; and not only do I wish for it, I ask for it. But the peace that I want is the peace of Christ; a true peace, a peace without rancor, a peace that does not involve war, a peace that will not reduce opponents but will unite friends. How can I term domination peace? I must call things by their right names. Where there is hatred, there let people talk of feuds; and where there is mutual esteem, there only let peace be spoken of. For my part I neither tear the church apart nor separate myself from the communion of the fathers. From my very cradle, I may say, I have been reared on Catholic milk; and no one can be a better churchman than one who has never been a heretic. But I know nothing of a peace that is without love or of a communion that is without peace. In the Gospel I read, “If you bring your gift to the altar and there remember that your brother has anything against you, leave your gift there before the altar and go your way; first be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift.” If then we may not offer gifts that are our own unless we are at peace with our brothers; how much less can we receive the body of Christ if we cherish enmity in our hearts? How can I conscientiously approach Christ’s Eucharist and answer the Amen if I doubt the charity of him who ministers it? - "Letter 82.2"

Do not believe the false prophets who say, “Peace, peace, and there is no peace”; who are always repeating, “The temple of the Lord, the temple of the Lord.” “Your prophets have seen for you false and foolish things; they have not laid bare your iniquity that they might call you to repentance—those who devour God’s people like bread have not called on God.” Jeremiah announced the captivity and was [punished] by the people. Hananiah, the son of Azzur, broke the bars of wood for the present but was preparing bars of iron for the future. False prophets always promise pleasant things, and please for a fee. Truth is bitter, however, and those who preach it are filled with bitterness. For with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth the Lord’s Passover is kept, and it is eaten with bitter herbs. - "Against Jovinianus 2.37"
