(Verse 24) He is Ana, who found Jamin in the desert, while feeding the donkeys of his father Zebeon. Much and varied is debated among the Hebrews about this chapter: for indeed, both the Greeks and our own are silent on this. Some believe that Ajamim () is a name for the seas. For the same letters are used to write seas as are used in the present discourse. And they say that he, while feeding the donkeys of his father in the desert, found gatherings of water, which are called seas in the Hebrew language: namely, that he discovered a lake, the discovery of which is difficult in the wilderness. Some people believe that hot springs near the border of the Punic language, which is adjacent to Hebrew, are signified by this word. There are those who think that wild donkeys have bred with female donkeys through this act, and thus the fastest offspring known as Jamim are born. Many believe that he himself was the first to ascend the herds of female horses with donkeys in the desert, so that new animals contrary to nature, mules, would be born from there. Eagle translated this passage as follows: He is Ana, who discovered it with the mimics. And Symmachus likewise translated the mimics, which signifies a plural number. However, the Seventy and Theodotion translated it equally, saying: the mimi, which indicates a singular number.
