(Verse 24) Depart from me, you who practice iniquity. Therefore, everyone who hears these words of mine and does them will be like a wise man who built his house on the rock. He did not say, 'you who have practiced iniquity,' so as not to seem to take away repentance, but rather 'you who practice,' that is, those who, up until the present hour, when the time of judgment comes, though they do not have the power to sin, still have the inclination.
