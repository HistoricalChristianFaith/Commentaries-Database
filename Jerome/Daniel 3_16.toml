Verse 16. "King Nebuchadnezzar, we ought not to render thee answer concerning this matter." In the Hebrew original there is no vocative "King" as there is in the Septuagint, lest they should seem to address the ungodly man with servile flattery or to term him a king who was trying to force them to wickedness. But if it be contended that the reading, "O king!" should be included, then we may say that the youths were not impudently challenging the king to shed their blood but rendering him due honor so as to avoid injury to the true religion of God. But as for their statement. "We ought not to render thee answer concerning this matter," the meaning is: "Thou hast no need to hear words from men whose bravery and firmness thou wilt presently test by actual deeds."

Let us turn our thoughts to the three boys in the fiery furnace in Babylonia, and listen to what they say when Nebuchadnezzar summons them before him and compels them to worship Bel. What is their answer to Nebuchadnezzar? “King, there is no need to defend ourselves.” … Look at their faith! We believe, it says, that he is able to save us; but if it should be that our sins prevent him, we still believe in him who will not deliver us. We do not believe in this life but in the future life; nor do we believe in him in order to escape burning here but in order to escape passing from this fire into another fire. Go ahead, then, prepare your furnace; this heat, this fire, is our purgation. Happy is he whose help is the God of Jacob!
