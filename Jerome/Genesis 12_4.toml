(Chapter 12, Verse 4) Now Abram was seventy-five years old when he departed from Haran. There arises an unsolvable question: for if Terah, the father of Abram, when he was still in the land of the Chaldeans, at seventy years old begot Abram, and afterwards died in Haran at the age of two hundred and five: how is it now mentioned that Abram, after the death of Terah, when departing from Haran, was seventy-five years old? Since from the birth of Abram until the death of his father, it is said that one hundred and thirty-five years passed. Therefore, that tradition of the Hebrews, which we mentioned above, is true: that Thara went out with his sons from the fire of the Chaldeans, and that Abram, surrounded by the Babylonian fire, was liberated by the help of God because he refused to worship it; and from that time, the days of his life, and the reckoning of his age, are considered from when he confessed the Lord, rejecting the idols of the Chaldeans. However, it is possible that because the Scripture left it uncertain, a few years ago Thara set out from Chaldea and came to Haran, where he died. Certainly, after the persecution, he came to Haran and stayed there for a longer time. Therefore, if anyone is opposed to this explanation, they will seek another solution and then rightfully reject what we have said.
