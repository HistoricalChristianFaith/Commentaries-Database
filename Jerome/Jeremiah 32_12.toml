(Verse 12.) And I gave the book of possession to Baruch the son of Neriah, the son of Maaseiah, in the sight of Anameel my cousin, and in the sight of the witnesses who were written in the book of purchase; in the sight of all the Jews who were sitting in the prison courtyard. Although the possession was to be immediately given up, indeed to be bought back by later generations, and to be bought back by one who did not have children (for he had not taken a wife), nevertheless, obeying the command of the Lord, he duly carried out everything: and Baruch the son of Neriah, the son of Maaseiah, gave the sealed book of possession. Baruch is called blessed in our language; he was the son of Neri, which means 'my light', as the Prophet says: 'Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path' (Psalm 119:105). Neri was also the father of Baruch, the son of Maasiah, meaning 'the work and the operation of the Lord'. Let us now consider the great privileges of virtue that the disciple Baruch rendered to Jeremiah, as David says: 'He who walks in the way of integrity, he shall minister to me' (Psalm 101:6). And so, Elisha, the servant of Elijah, pleased God so much that after the translation of his master, he also merited to receive a double spirit (2 Kings 2). I say this as a warning to those who abuse the ministries of evil men and do not dare to reject those whom they know are bound to them by a guilty conscience. And it is handed down that the book of Baruch was sold to such a man, Anemeel, with witnesses who signed, and their names were kept in the book of purchase. And, in the sight, he said, of all the Jews who were sitting in the courtyard of the prison: those who had come either to console the Prophet, or out of a desire to hear the words of the Lord in fear and reverence of God.
