"All torrents flow into the sea but the sea is not filled. To the place from which the torrents come,
there they return to go." Some men believe that the fresh waters that
flow into the sea are either dried up by the burning sun above, or are feed for
the salt-thirsty sea. Here our Ecclesiastes,
the creator of the very waters, says that they return to the heads of the
springs by means of hidden passages, and always boil out from their deep
channels into their springs. The Hebrews
believed that the rivers or sea had more significance in the metaphor of man,
because they return to the earth, whence they originated. They are also called torrents not rivers
because they flow that much more forcefully, yet the earth however is not
filled with a great number of dead men. 
More precisely if we go down to the deeper parts, the turbid waters
return to the sea where they used to remain. 
And unless I am mistaken, apart from the additions to the text, nowhere
is the word 'torrent' found in a good context. 
For "you will drink those with the torrent of your desire"  [Psalms 35, 9.],
although "of desire" is written in an addition. On the contrary the Saviour was taken to the
brook Cedron [John 18,1.],
and Elisha at the time of persecution hid away in the brook of Chorat, which
even dried up. But the sea is not filled
up completely, in the same manner as the bloodthirsty daughters in Proverbs [Prov. 30, 15.].
