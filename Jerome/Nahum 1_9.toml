(Verse 9) What are you planning against the Lord? He himself will bring about the consummation: there will not arise a double tribulation. LXX: What are you planning against the Lord? He himself will bring about the consummation: he did not avenge twice on the same in tribulation. Symmachus more openly: They will not withstand the attack of a second distress: Theodotion, A second tribulation will not arise. However, he speaks according to the tropology against Marcion, about whom we have spoken above, and all the ancient heretics, who, inventing some unknown good God, say that he himself will bring about the consummation of the world, and they accuse the God of the Law as if he were cruel, because he punishes many and inflicts tortures for sins. What then, he says, do you propose against the Lord? He who created the world will also bring about its consummation. But if it seems cruel, strict, and bloody to you that he destroyed the human race in the flood, rained fire and sulfur upon Sodom and Gomorrah (Gen. 7), submerged the Egyptians in the waves (Exod. 14), and cast down the bodies of the Israelites in the desert (Num. 32), know that he has inflicted these punishments in the present so as not to punish eternally. Certainly, what the prophets say is either true or false. If what they seem to say about his severity is true, they themselves said: 'The Lord will not take vengeance twice on the same in tribulation.' But if what they say is false, and this statement is false: 'There will not be a double tribulation,' then his cruelty, which is described in the Law, is also false. And if it is true, as they cannot deny, with the prophet saying: 'The Lord will not take vengeance twice on the same in tribulation,' then those who have been punished will not be punished afterwards. But if they are punished afterwards, Scripture lies, which is unthinkable to say. Therefore, those who perished in the flood, the Sodomites, the Egyptians, and the Israelites in the wilderness received the punishment they deserved in their lives. Someone may ask here, if a faithful person caught in adultery is beheaded, what will happen to them afterwards? Either they will be punished, and this statement is false: 'The Lord will not punish twice for the same thing in affliction.' Or they will not be punished, and it is to be wished that adulterers, in the brief and quick pain of the present, frustrate their eternal torments. To this we will respond that God knows the measures of all things, as well as those of punishments, and that the judgment of the judge cannot be anticipated, nor can the power to exercise punishment on the sinner be taken away from him thereafter, and that great sin can be cleansed by great and lasting torments. If someone is unpunished, like the one in the Law who cursed the Israelites and gathered wood on the Sabbath (Leviticus 24): such people are not punished afterwards because their light fault has been compensated by immediate punishment. The Hebrews explained this passage as follows: What do you think, O Assyrians, plotting wickedness against the Lord, that he himself would destroy the people of Israel, that is, the twelve tribes, completely? There will not be a double trouble, that is, he will not deliver Judah and Israel to you, as he delivered the ten tribes and Samaria.
