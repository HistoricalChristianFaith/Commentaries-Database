(Verse 12) The Lord commanded against Canaan, to crush its strong ones. He showed that there is a sea, upon which the Lord stretched out his hand, saying: He commanded against Canaan. For Tyre was founded in the land of Canaan. Read the Scriptures, especially the Gospel (Mark 7), where the Syrophoenician woman, interceding for her daughter, comes out of the land of Canaan, which is called the Canaanite woman. And at the same time, because he had said: He stretched out his hand, lest you believe that the Lord was working with his limbs and physical function, he added that it was commanded, that it was done by God's order.

(Verse 12) The Lord of hosts commanded to destroy its strength from Canaan, and they will say: 'You shall not add to do harm and injustice to the virgin daughter of Sidon. Tyre and Sidon are in the land of Canaan, and as we have shown above, presenting the testimony of the Gospel in which it is read that a Canaanite woman or a Syrophoenician went out from the borders of Tyre and Sidon and met the Lord and Savior. But every soul that is placed in the waves of the world and is carried about by every wind of doctrine is to be called Canaan, which is interpreted as fluctuation or commotion.' Therefore, it is beneficial for Tyre and its distress for the Canaanite to perish, so that it may be said to its inhabitants that they are no longer able to do harm, and to oppress the virgin daughter of Sidon through wickedness. Whoever is captured by the devil in the various disturbances of vices and is handed over to the insults of ignominy, in order to pollute the body with pleasures and filth, that person is the son or daughter of Sidon. And it should be known that 'sabaoth' is not found in Hebrew, and, on the contrary, 'virgo' is added from Hebrew.
