Entering a new town, the apostles were unable to know what kind of persons they were meeting. Therefore a host must be chosen according to his reputation and the judgment of his neighbors. Otherwise the dignity of the message preached might be tainted by the ill repute of the recipient. Since they must preach to all, only one host is to be chosen; and they are not to bestow favor on persons with whom they stay but to receive it.

(Verse 11) Whatever city or town you enter, inquire who in it is worthy, and stay there until you leave. Concerning the appointment of bishops and deacons, Paul speaks; They must also have a good testimony from those who are outside. (1 Timothy 3:7). When the apostles entered a new city, they could not know what kind of person he was. Therefore, a host should be chosen by the reputation of the people and the judgment of the neighbors, so that the dignity of the preacher is not tarnished by the infamy of the recipient. When everyone should preach, one guest is chosen, not giving a favor to the one who is going to stay, but receiving it, for it is said, who is worthy in her, so that he may know himself more to receive grace than to give it.
