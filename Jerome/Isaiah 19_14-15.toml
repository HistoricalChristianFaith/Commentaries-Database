(Verse. 14, 15.) The Lord mixed in its midst the spirit of dizziness: and he caused Egypt to wander in all its work, like a drunkard and a vomiter: and Egypt will have no work that it does, bending and restraining head and tail. First let us speak about the interpretation, and afterwards we will discuss what is written. The spirit of dizziness can also be interpreted as the spirit of error. In addition, in what we have translated as bending and restraining, we can say bending and lascivious, so that we understand old man and child. However, when we swiftly translated the Hebrew word Agmon (), we were deceived by ambiguity, and we said restraining, which Aquila translated more significantly as στρεβλοῦντα, that is, one who does nothing rightly, but everything crooked, in order to signify a child. Therefore, the sense is: The princes of Taneos have become foolish, and the wise counselors have given foolish advice to Pharaoh, and the princes of Mempheos have become bewildered, and they have deceived Egypt, the corner of nations, because the Lord has mixed into them a spirit of error and confusion, causing them to not know what they are speaking and to make Egypt go astray. And just as a drunkard, when he vomits what he has eaten and does not know where it is, but lies in a state of alien mind, so Egypt will have no work or counsel that has a head, or an end, or is suitable for the elders or the children, some of whom are foolish and delirious due to extreme age, while others are ignorant of their own insolence and infancy. But whether you want to receive this in relation to the devastation in Babylon, or in relation to the coming of Christ, and both literally and spiritually, it will have significance.
