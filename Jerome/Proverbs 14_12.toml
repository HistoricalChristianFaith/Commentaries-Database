We read in Proverbs, “There is a way that seems just to men, yet the end of it leads to the depths of hades.” You see, ignorance is also clearly condemned in this text, since man thinks otherwise and he falls into hades, seemingly having the truth. “There are many thoughts,” he says, “in the heart of man.” But still, it is not his will, which is uncertain and doubtful and changeable, that prevails but the counsel of God.
