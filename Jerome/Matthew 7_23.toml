(Verse 23.) And then I will confess to them, because I never knew you. He said explicitly, I will confess, because he had pretended to speak a long time ago: I do not know you. The Lord does not know those who perish. However, observe why he added, I never knew you, if, according to some, they have always lived among rational creatures.
