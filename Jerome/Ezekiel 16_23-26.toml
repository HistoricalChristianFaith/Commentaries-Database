(Verse 23 and following) And it came to pass after all your wickedness: woe, woe to you, says the Lord God. And you built yourself a brothel, and made for yourself a prostitute in all the streets. At every head of the road you built a sign of your prostitution, and you made your abominable beauty, and you spread your feet to everyone passing by, and multiplied your fornications. And you fornicated with the sons of Egypt, your neighbors with great flesh, and you multiplied your fornication to provoke me. LXX: And it came to pass after all your evils, woe, woe to you, says the Lord God. And you built for yourself a dwelling of prostitution, and you made for yourself prostitution in every street. And in the beginning of every way you built your prostitution: and you corrupted your beauty, and spread your legs to every passerby, and multiplied your prostitution: and you committed adultery with the sons of Egypt your neighbors, who are of great flesh, and you committed adultery in many ways, to provoke me to anger. What is said second, woe to you, the Vulgate edition does not have, but it has been added from the edition of Theodotion. And again, where we said: And you built for yourself a brothel, which the Seventy translated as: And you built for yourself a dwelling place of fornication, Symmachus and Theodotion interpreted as πορνεῖον; Aquila, wishing to express the etymology of the Hebrew word Gob (), put βάθυνον, which we can say means pit: to indicate a foul and deep den where the lust of prostitutes dwells. And what follows: And you have made for yourself a brothel in every street, for which Seventy translated ἔκθεμα, in Hebrew it is called Rama: and both Aquila and Symmachus and Theodotio have interpreted it as high or lofty. Finally, in the following passages, where it is written: To every head of the road you have erected a sign of your prostitution, as a sign and fornication, again in Hebrew it is called Rama (), which we have interpreted as either brothel or sign, since among the Hebrews it is one word. However, this is stated because it is lofty; so that for those who desire to fornicate, the place of fornication may be far away and there is no need to search for it. What we have said once and again and again, let it suffice to have said it forever, that under the guise of a woman, after many benefits from her husband, describing the fornication of Jerusalem, how she has departed from God and joined with idols, and was not satisfied with hidden fornication; but rather built herself a brothel and placed a sign on every street for those passing by, so they would come to the prostitute and satisfy their lust, not only their own, but also the one who has spread her legs for every passerby, and has defiled the greatness of beauty with the greatness of fornication: and among other things, she has also been bowing down to the Egyptians, her neighbors, in a love of great flesh. And in order to demonstrate every kind of ugliness, it was deformed by various forms of filth. But there is no doubt that Palestine is near Egypt, as the Lord said to Abraham: I will give you all the land from the river of Egypt to the great river Euphrates (Gen. XV, 18), so that on one side it includes the Egyptians, and on the other side it includes the Assyrians, with whom it is said to have committed fornication in later times. But the fornication of Jerusalem with the Egyptians is an imitation of their idolatry. But against our Jerusalem, whether the Church or the souls of the believers, if they are negligent and exposed to all vices, a double curse is pronounced, so that they may hear: Woe, woe to you, says the Lord God, according to what is written in the Apocalypse of John: Woe to all the inhabitants of the earth (Apoc. 8:13). For if the holy one says: I am a stranger and a sojourner like all my fathers (Psalm 38:13): why is it not said that the sinner is an inhabitant of the earth? However, he builds for himself a brothel, who sins with complete freedom of the forehead; according to what is written: When the sinner comes into the depths of wickedness, he despises (Prov. XVIII, 3). And he constructs the highest place in all the streets: For wide and spacious is the way that leads to death. And at every head of the street he builds; so that he leaves behind no types of sins; but imitating the prostitute of Proverbs, he openly invites foolish young men into his embraces in the streets and in the corners of the streets, and pollutes the beauty of their souls, which they obtained as a benefit from God the creator (Prov. V and VII). And all his journeys are full of filthiness, and he opens his heart to all thoughts that supply the incentives of vices, and he spreads his legs and fornicates with his Egyptian neighbors, whose examples he follows, namely the pagans, who glory in their filthiness, and it is so wicked that it even surpasses them in filthiness. And he does all these things to provoke God to anger. Moreover, the Egyptians are said to have large genitals, either because of the magnitude of their filthiness or because of the deformity of their sins. Wherefore the saint says, 'The flesh of little children, which daily decreases in it, and is attenuated by virtues, so that it is not called flesh, but spirit, and speaks in the psalm: My soul has thirsted for you, O God, how many ways does my flesh long for you (Psalm 62:2): or (as some copies have) how my flesh has been consumed: in a desert and impassable and waterless land, I have appeared to you in the saint (1 Corinthians 5).' Therefore, the Corinthian fornicator is condemned to the destruction of the flesh, so that the spirit may be saved. Concerning this flesh, it is written: All flesh is grass, and all its glory is like the flower of the field. The grass withers, and the flower falls, but the word of the Lord remains forever (Isa. XL, 6, 7). The Apostle also spoke about this: Flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God (I Cor. XV, 50). And in Genesis, God speaks: My spirit shall not abide in man forever, for he is flesh (Gen. VI, 3). And it is said to the believers: Those who are in the flesh cannot please God. But you are not in the flesh, but in the spirit (Romans VIII, 8, 9). But there is another flesh of the saints, of which it is written: All flesh shall see the salvation of God (Isaiah XL, 5).
