Of this miracle we have a type in Jonah, who while all are in danger is himself unconcerned, sleeps, and is awakened.

From this passage we understand, that all creation is conscious of its Creator; for what may be rebuked and commanded is conscious of the mind commanding. I do not mean as some heretics hold, that the whole creation is animatec—but by the power of the Maker things which to us have no consciousness have to Him.

But if any shall contend that it was the disciples who wondered, we shall answer they are rightly spoken of as 'the men,' seeing they had not yet learnt the power of the Saviour.
