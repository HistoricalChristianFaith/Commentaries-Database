(Verse 44.) And whoever falls on this stone will be broken; but on whomever it falls, it will grind him to powder. It is one thing to offend Christ through evil works, another to deny Him. Whoever is a sinner, yet believes in Him, falls indeed on the stone and is broken, but is not utterly crushed; for he is preserved through repentance for salvation. But on whomever the stone falls, that is, on whom the stone itself will crash down, and who completely denies Christ, it will grind him to powder, so that not even a shard remains, in which a little water could be poured.
