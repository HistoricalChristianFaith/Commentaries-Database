It is asked whether he says “the gospel of peace” to distinguish it from another gospel. Or is it rather the distinguishing property of the gospel that it may be called “the gospel of peace?” If anyone therefore has peace, he is shod with the gospel of Christ. With this footwear he is prepared to walk. Being prepared, however, he does well not to imagine himself already perfect. Rather he merely is prepared to press on and by pressing on hopes to arrive at the goal.
