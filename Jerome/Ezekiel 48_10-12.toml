(Verse 10 and following) These will be the firstfruits of the sanctuary for the priests: towards the north, a length of twenty-five thousand [cubits], and towards the sea, a width of ten thousand [cubits]; but also towards the east, a width of ten thousand [cubits], and towards the south, a length of twenty-five thousand [cubits]. And the sanctuary of the Lord will be in the midst of it. It will be a sanctuary for the priests from the descendants of Zadok, who have kept my statutes and have not strayed as the children of Israel strayed, as the Levites strayed. And there will be offerings from the first fruits of the land of the Holy of Holies, according to the boundary of the Levites. The four offerings of the sanctuary are described, which do not pertain to the common people or the lower class Levites, but specifically to the worship of the priests: namely the offerings of the North, West, East, and South. And the order of their arrangement is described in parts, as we leave behind the cold of the North and come to the West: so that our vices may perish and we may then move to the East, where the sun of justice rises for us, and finally come to the South, where the light is most bright and perfect. And both from the North to the sea and from the East to the South, let there be twenty-five thousand in length and ten thousand in width: so that the same measure of length and width is preserved everywhere. However, the sanctuary, that is, the Temple of the Lord, will be in the midst of the firstfruits of the priests, and it will be surrounded on all sides by an equal wall. And what he had said, 'These shall be the firstfruits of the sanctuary of the priests,' was to prevent all the priests from claiming the possession of this place and the special ceremonies to be observed by a common name, specifically stating: 'The sanctuary shall be for the priests of the sons of Zadok,' which means 'righteous.' This is said of him: 'The Lord is righteous, and he loves righteousness; his face beholds the upright' (Psalm 11:7). Regarding this, Sadoc, the Septuagint writes Sadduc. This Sadoc speaks in the Gospel: For the Father judgeth no man, but hath given all judgment unto the Son (John 5:22). And concerning this, under the name of Solomon, the Prophet sings mystically: Give thy judgment to the king, O God, and thy justice to the king's son (Psalm 71:1). But those priests of the Lord shall possess the sanctuary, and shall keep the ceremonies thereof: who have not erred when the children of Israel and the Levites erred, of whom it was discoursed in the foregoing. They do not offer victims, but being content with the privilege of their name and the humility of their error, they always speak from the heart: I acknowledge my wickedness, and my sin is always before me (Psalm 50:4). Let him hear this priestly order, and, overcome by the fury of the Arian persecution, and subsequently submitting his neck to the power of the true faith, so that he may not lack resources, if he is not expelled from the temple, let him hold a certain shadow and image of his former name, and let him not, lying on his back, belch out delights, as if he were immaculate and pure, let him not belch forth the nausea of his ignorance and barbaric babbling from his lofty throne. They shall be, he says, the first fruits from the first fruits of the earth, that is, for the priests: and those who did not go astray, when the sons of Israel and the Levites went astray. But the first crop from the first crops, like the tenth of the tithes, and the holy of holies, according to the boundary of the Levites: for indeed the Levites have the precincts of the priests, but they cannot hold the center, that is, the middle of it, and the actual possession.
