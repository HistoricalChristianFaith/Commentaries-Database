(Verse 37) And taking with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, he began to be sad and sorrowful. What we have said above about the passion and pre-passion is also shown in the present chapter, that the Lord, in order to prove the truth of his assumption as a man, was truly saddened, but so that the passion would not dominate his soul, he began to be saddened through pre-sorrow. For it is one thing to be saddened, and another thing to begin to be saddened. But He was saddened not by the fear of suffering, for which He had come, that He might suffer; and He had reprimanded Peter for his timidity; but on account of the most unfortunate Judas, and the scandal of all the apostles, and the rejection of the Jewish people, and the destruction of miserable Jerusalem. Hence Jonas also, grieving over the withering of a gourd or a ivy, was grieved (Jonah 4), unwilling to lose his former shelter. But if the sadness of the soul is interpreted by the heretics not as the affection of the Savior towards those who are about to perish, but as the suffering, let them answer how they explain that which is said through Ezekiel in the person of God: And in all these things you have saddened me (Ezekiel 16, Septuagint version).
