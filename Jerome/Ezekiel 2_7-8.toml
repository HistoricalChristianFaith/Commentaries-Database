(Vers. 7, 8.) And you shall speak my words to them: if perhaps they will hear, and be afraid, or be quiet, since they are provokers. But you, son of man, hear what I speak to you. Therefore, you must not cease, although they are wicked to whom we speak; indeed, according to the Apostle (II Tim. IV), we must preach the word of God opportune and importune, because it is possible that even a stubborn person may be corrected to gentleness, and someone who is obedient, with a change of will, may not hear.


Do not be exasperating, as the house is exasperating. Once we said to put exasperation, or irritation, seventy bitterness. Therefore, what he says is this: You should not imitate those whom you are sent to correct, lest you deserve a similar sin and punishment.

Open your mouth and eat what I give you. Be worthy, he says, to my words, and receive spiritual food, so that as it is said in the Gospel: He who has ears to hear, let him hear (Luke 8:8); and here it is said: He who has an open mouth to eat, let him eat. Hence the Lord speaks to the Psalmist: Open your mouth, and I will fill it (Psalm 81:10). And he responded: I opened my mouth and drew in the spirit (Psalm 119:131). And the Apostle Paul, who had in himself the treasures of wisdom and knowledge, and in whom the Lord Christ spoke, writes to the Corinthians: My mouth is open to you, O Corinthians (2 Cor. VI, 11). And Matthew reports about the Savior: Opening his mouth, he taught the disciples (Matt. V, 2).

And I saw, and behold a hand was sent to me. For the hand that is sent, they translated it as extended in the Septuagint. It is sent and extended to those who receive blessings. But it is contracted by those to whom the prophet speaks: 'Has the hand of the Lord been shortened and contracted?' (Isaiah 50:2). And in the Psalm: 'Why do you withdraw your hand and your right hand from your bosom to the end?' (Psalm 73:11). Finally, he stretched out his wings in suffering, he received the disciples, and he carried them on his shoulders, and he spoke: 'All day long I have spread out my hands to a disobedient and opposing people' (Isaiah 65:2), to gather the children of Israel, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings. And by the stretching out of Moses' hands, Israel overcame Amalek (Exodus 17).
