Sabatha, from which the Sabatheni, who are now called Astabari, are derived. However, Regma and Sabathaca gradually lost their ancient names, and what they now have in place of the old names is unknown.

(Verse 7.) The sons of Regma are Saba and Dadan. Saba is spelled with a Sin (), but above it with a Samech (), from which we said they are called Sabaeans. Now Saba is interpreted as Arabia, for in the seventy-first psalm, where we have, 'The kings of the Arabians and Saba will offer gifts,' it is written in Hebrew, 'The kings of Saba and Saba,' the first name with Sin, the second with Samech. Dadan is a nation of Ethiopia in the western region.
