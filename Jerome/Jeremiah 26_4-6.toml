(Vers. 4 seqq.) And you shall say to them: Thus says the Lord: If you do not listen to me and walk in my law, which I have given you, and listen to the words of my servants the prophets whom I have sent to you, rising up early and sending them, and you have not listened: I will make this house like Shiloh and this city a curse to all the nations of the earth. Therefore, it is within our power to do or not to do: provided that whatever good work we desire, strive for, and accomplish, we attribute it to the grace of God, who has given us both the will and the ability to do (Phil. 2). But if it sufficed to walk once in the law, which was given to us by Moses, as a foolish sect suspects, how did he add: 'That you may hear the words of my servants the prophets.' Who, indeed, were sent after the law, and not once, but frequently: not leisurely and without care, but always and with concern. 'I have sent,' he says, 'to you my servants the prophets daily, and rising by night: if you will not listen to them, I will give this house, that is, the temple of God, as Shiloh, where the tabernacle was.' And when the temple will have been destroyed, consequently the city will be cursed by all the nations of the earth. Just as when the temple was built in the area of Ornan, and on Mount Moriah, that is, the place of vision, where it is narrated that Abraham offered his son Isaac, the religion of Shiloh ceased, and no sacrifices were celebrated there afterwards: so when the Church was built, and the spiritual victims were offered in it, the ceremonies of the Law ceased (2 Chronicles 3); and the city of the Jews was given over to curse by all the nations of the earth: from which the Lord has delivered us, as the Apostle says: Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the Law, being made a curse for us (Galatians 3:13).
