(Verse 7, 8.) And as you go, preach, saying: 'The kingdom of heaven is at hand.' Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse the lepers, cast out demons. Freely you have received, freely give. And let no one among the rural and uneducated people doubt, for those who promise the kingdom of heaven are given the power to heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, and cast out demons, in order to prove the greatness of the promises by the greatness of the signs. And because spiritual gifts (if the reward is of medium value) always become less valuable, condemnation of greed is added.

Freely you have received, freely give. I, as the master and Lord, have bestowed this upon you without cost, and you give without cost, so that the grace of the Gospel is not corrupted.
