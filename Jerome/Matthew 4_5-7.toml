Took him, not because the Lord was weak, but the enemy proud; he imputed to a necessity what the Saviour did willingly.

In the several temptations the single aim of the Devil is to find if He be the Son of God, but he is so answered as at last to depart in doubt; He says, Cast thyself, because the voice of the Devil, which is always calling men downwards, has power to persuade them, but may not compel them to fall.

This verse we read in the ninetieth Psalm (Ps. 91:11.), but that is a prophecy not of Christ, but of some holy man, so the Devil interprets Scripture amiss.

The false Scripture darts of the Devil He brands with the true shield of Scripture.

It should be noted, that the required texts are taken from the book of Deuteronomy only, that He might show the sacraments of the second Law.
