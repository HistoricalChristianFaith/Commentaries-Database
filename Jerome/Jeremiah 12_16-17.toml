(Verse 16, 17.) And it shall come to pass, if the learned ones have learned the ways of my people, to swear in my name, as the Lord lives: just as they taught my people to swear by Baal, they shall be built up in the midst of my people. But if they do not listen, I will uproot that nation with destruction and annihilation, says the Lord. If those who have been translated from heresy into the Church have learned the ways of the people of God, and have sworn in the name of the Lord, and not in the name of the idols they themselves imagined, they shall be built up by the Lord, and they shall be a part of his people. But if those who have been translated into the Church hold on to the remnants of perverse doctrines and do not heed the words of the Lord, that people shall be uprooted from the midst of God's people, through perpetual destruction and removal, so that not a single place of repentance is left for them. We see this happening every day, and we have evidence that heretics, in order to deceive the simple-minded, pretend to uphold the truth of the faith, not so that they themselves may convert to the faith, but rather to lead the faithful into disbelief.
