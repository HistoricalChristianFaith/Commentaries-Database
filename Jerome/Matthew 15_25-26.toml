(Verse 25, 26.) But she came and worshiped him, saying: Lord, help me. He answered and said: It is not good to take the bread of the children and throw it to the dogs. The faith, patience, and humility of the Canaanite woman are preached in this remarkable passage. Faith, by which she believed that her daughter could be healed. Patience, by which she persevered in prayer even when rejected. Humility, by which she compared herself not to dogs, but to puppies. However, the ethnic dogs are called such because of their idolatry, being given to the consumption of blood and carried away by the corpses of the dead into madness. Note that this Canaanite woman persistently called first David her son, then the Lord, and finally worshipped Him as God.
