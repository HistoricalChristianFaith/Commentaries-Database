As Fabiola was not ashamed of the Lord on earth, so he shall not be ashamed of her in heaven. She laid bare her wound to the gaze of all, and Rome beheld with tears the disfiguring scar that marred her beauty. She uncovered her limbs, bared her head and closed her mouth. She no longer entered the church of God but, like Miriam the sister of Moses, she sat apart, outside the camp, till the priest who cast her out should himself call her back. She came down like a daughter of Babylon from the throne of her daintiness, she took the millstones and ground meal, she passed barefoot through rivers of tears.
