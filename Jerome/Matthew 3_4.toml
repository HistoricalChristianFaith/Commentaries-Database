His raiment of camel's hair, not of wool—the one the mark of austerity in dress, the other of a delicate luxury.

Food moreover suited to a dweller in the desert, no choice viands, but such as satisfied the necessities of the body.

His girdle of skin, which Elias also bare, is the mark of mortification.

His raiment of camel’s hair, not of wool - the one the mark of austerity indress, the other of a delicate luxury.
Food moreover suited to a dweller in the desert, no choice viands, but such as satisfied the necessities of the body. He also relates, that in the same desert there is a kind of tree, with a large round leaf, of the colour of milk and taste of honey, so friable as to rub to powder in the hand, and this is what is intended by wild honey.
His girdle of skin, which Elias also bare, is the mark of mortification.
