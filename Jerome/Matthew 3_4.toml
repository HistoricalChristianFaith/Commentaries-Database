His raiment of camel's hair, not of woolâ€”the one the mark of austerity in dress, the other of a delicate luxury.

Food moreover suited to a dweller in the desert, no choice viands, but such as satisfied the necessities of the body.

His girdle of skin, which Elias also bare, is the mark of mortification.

(Verse 4.) Now John himself had a garment made of camel's hair and a leather belt around his waist. He said, 'It is made of hair, not wool.' The type of clothing indicates austerity, not luxury. The leather belt that he wore, just like Elijah, is a symbol of mortification (IV Kings 1). Furthermore, what follows is...

But his food was locusts and wild honey. It is fitting for a dweller of solitude to fulfill not the delights of food, but the necessity of human flesh.
