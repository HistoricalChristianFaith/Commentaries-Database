"For
with much wisdom comes much grief, and he who increases knowledge increases
pain." The more a man seeks wisdom, the more he finds himself
in vice and far from those virtues, which he is seeking. For those who are powerful suffer torments
more gravely [Cfr Sap. 6, 7.],
and more is demanded of the man, to whom more is entrusted. Because of this he increases his pain who
increases his knowledge, and is saddened by grief according to God, and suffers
beyond his offences. The apostle said
concerning this: "and who is there, who gladdens me, unless he is saddened
by me?"  [II Cor. 2, 2.] Unless perchance, and this must be
understood, that a wise man would suffer so much for his wisdom, in secret and
deep in his flank, nor would he show himself to prosper in intelligence, as
light is to seeing; but rather through certain torments and intolerable toil,
and through perpetual meditation and enthusiasm.
