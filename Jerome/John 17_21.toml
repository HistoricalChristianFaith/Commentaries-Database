“As we are Father, Son and Holy Spirit, one God,” [Jesus might say], “so may they be one people in themselves, that is, like dear children and partakers of the divine nature.” Call the church what you will—bride, sister, mother—its assembly is but one and never lacks husband, brother or son. [The church’s] faith is one, and it is not defiled by variety of doctrine or divided by heresies. [The church] continues a virgin. Wherever the Lamb goes, it follows him. It alone knows the song of Christ.
