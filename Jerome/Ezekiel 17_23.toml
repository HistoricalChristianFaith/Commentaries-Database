The high tree humbled and the humble tree exalted refer to the passion of the Lord and Savior, “who, though he was in the form of God, did not count equality with God a theme to be grasped, but he emptied himself, taking the form of a servant,” and after the resurrection, this very wood was afterwards raised high, which was fair and strong, and then made dry in death, and after reviving, received back its original strength.
