“Be holy, says the Lord, for I am holy.” The apostles boasted that they had left all things and had followed the Savior. We do not read that they left anything except their ship and their nets; yet they were crowned with the approval of him who was to be their judge. Why? Because in offering up themselves they had indeed left all that they had.
