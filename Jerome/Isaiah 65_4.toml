But what is read in the Septuagint, namely, “to demons that are not,” and is not included in the Hebrew text, must be taken to mean that no demons exist, either in the literal or in the spiritual sense; this because they have already fallen away from God, who truly is. Neither do sects of heretics that retain no truth exist, but they are transitory and die like shadows. For this reason did Esther say to the Lord, “Do not surrender your heritage to those who are not.” The holy one also prays in the Psalter: “Know me not, that I may find relief before I depart to exist no longer.” For whoever did not obtain the forgiveness of sinners while living in this body, leaving life in such a condition, also perished from God and therefore ceased existing, even though continuing in punishment.…Wrath, therefore, which is desire for retribution, is not the same in God as it is in people, for its material cause lies in our sins, not in God’s will. We are the ones who “store up wrath for ourselves on the day of wrath and the day of the revelation of the just judgment of God,” so that the thorns and thistles and briars, which we have produced from the seed of God, like the wood, hay and stubble with which we built on Paul’s foundation, should be consumed by flames of wisdom. And we read about this perpetual fire in the song of Moses: “A fire is kindled in my fury, and it will burn to the depths of hell and will devour the earth and its produce. It will set the foundations of the mountains ablaze, and my arrows will destroy them.” The meaning of this testimony is that the fire and vengeance of God will burn continually against sinners and that he will pursue them to hell.
