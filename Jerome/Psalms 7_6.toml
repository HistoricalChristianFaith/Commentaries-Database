Arise, in order that a vast multitude may believe in you, for after you have risen, what else would we pray for? Return to the Father. “Above them on high be enthroned.” For whose sake? For the assembly of the peoples. In that you suffered, you suffered for us; in that you rose again, you rose for us; in that you ascended to the Father, ascend for us. “Above them on high be enthroned.” “And no one has ascended into heaven except him who has descended from heaven: the Son of man who is in heaven.”
