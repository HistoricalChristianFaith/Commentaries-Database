(Ver. 4 seqq.) And you shall bring out your baggage like the baggage of an exile by day in their sight. And you shall go out in the evening before them, as one goes out into exile before their eyes. Dig through the wall for yourself, and you shall go out through it in their sight. You shall bear your baggage on your shoulders (Vulgate: you shall be carried): you shall escape in darkness (Vulgate: you shall be brought out). You shall cover your face, and you shall not see the ground: for I have made you a sign to the house of Israel. LXX: And you shall bring out your vessels of captivity by day in their sight. And you shall go out in the evening in their sight, as a captive goes out. Dig for yourself through the wall, and you shall pass through it in their sight. You shall be carried on your shoulders and go out in hiding. You shall cover your face, and you shall not see the ground, for I have made you a sign to the house of Israel. The prophet is commanded to act in a manner that Sedecias will do in truth. Gather, he says, your belongings (for these are the vessels of the one who is crossing over), while they are watching. And after they have seen what you are going to do, you will go out in the evening in the likeness of the one who is crossing over. We read that Zedekiah, with the wall secretly pierced, fled during the night to the deserts of the Jordan, and there he was captured by the Babylonians, and this signifies the wall being pierced. But when he says, 'you will carry on your shoulders,' your belongings are understood, and whatever they are accustomed to carry as a solace on the journey while fleeing. In the darkness you will escape ((or: you will lead out)); may you not be seen by anyone. You will cover your face, or by the blindness that befell him, the eyes will be plucked out by Nebuchadnezzar; or so that it is not recognized that he himself is the king, and the concern of the servants will be greater. And what follows: And you will not see the land, that signifies that he who is blind is led into Babylon, and will not see it. For I have given you as a portent to the house of Israel: for both the words and the deeds of the prophets have been spoken and fulfilled as a sign and a figure. And in Zechariah, extraordinary men are called, because they foreshadow the future (Zech. III). And in Hosea, God says: I have been compared to the hands of the prophets (Hosea XII, 10). But those who want to understand Christ in the person of Ezekiel, take the vessels of captivity to mean the human body, and the pierced wall through which he broke the bars of hell, and rising, he appeared to the believers alone; carried on their shoulders when he ascended as the victor to heaven with the angelic powers, and he came forth in concealment and veiled his face, so that the divine majesty might not be seen in mortal flesh, and he does not see the earth, lest the earth shine in his eyes, which does not deserve to see him. For the eyes of the Lord are upon the just (Ps. XXXIII, 16), and his face is turned away from the wicked. But they say that all these things were done in order to convert the hard hearts of the Israelite people to faith through the likeness of a man. And it is given as a sign to the house of Israel; according to what is written: Behold this child is set for the fall, and for the resurrection of many, and for a sign which shall be contradicted (Luke II, 24).
