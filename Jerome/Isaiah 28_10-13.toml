(Vers. 10 seqq.) Who will teach knowledge, and who will make understanding? Weaned from milk, pulled from the breasts: command, re-command; command, re-command; wait, re-wait; wait, re-wait; a little here, a little there. For with stammering lips and another tongue He will speak to this people, to whom He said, 'This is the rest, give rest to the weary,' and 'This is the refreshing,' but they would not hear. And the word of the Lord will be to them, command, re-command; command, re-command; wait, re-wait; wait, re-wait; a little here, a little there, that they may go and fall backward, and be broken, snared, and caught. LXX: To whom shall we announce evil, and to whom shall we announce good news? Those who have been weaned from milk, those who have been taken away from the breast. Expect tribulation upon tribulation; wait for hope upon hope; still little, still little: because of the mockery of lips, because of the other tongue with which they will speak to this people, saying to them: This is the rest for the hungry, and this is the crushing, and they did not want to hear. The word of the Lord will come upon them: Tribulation upon tribulation: wait, wait; hope upon hope: still little, still little; so that they may go and fall backward, and be crushed, and be endangered, and be captured. Who, he says, is worthy of the teaching of the Lord, to whom are the words of the Savior saying: 'He who has ears to hear, let him hear' (Matthew 12:15), so that what he has heard with his ears, he may understand with his heart? The following verse shows who they are: 'Weaned from milk, drawn from the breast, who are not nourished with milk in infancy, but are fed with solid food; who were drawn from the breast with Isaac: for the joy of this, Abraham made a great feast' (Genesis 22); they deserve to hear the mysteries of the Lord, and to understand what the priest and prophet do not know, intoxicated and absorbed by wine, who wandered and did not know the one who sees, because all their tables are filled with vomit and filth, who, when the prophets announce the future and threaten torments unless they did what was commanded, used to say scoffing: 'Command, re-command; command, re-command,' that is, 'order, order, command what we should do.' And when they abused the patience of God, who delays his anger in order to show mercy; who used to say even this in jest through the mouths of the prophets: Wait a little longer, wait a little while, the things that we have prophesied will come. But all of these things they spoke to the people, because they did not believe the words of God; and immediately the prophet brings this in: By no means will God speak to you with these words, in order to give you a commandment of what you should do, and to wait for the things that are to come, but he will speak to you in present fury, who had previously said to the people: This is my rest, revive the weary, I have labored for a long time, I have found no rest in anything. Foxes have dens, and birds of the sky have nests; but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head (Matthew 8; Luke 9). And this is my refreshment, that I may find rest in you at times. Those who did not want to listen and despised my warnings; therefore, they say to the prophets what they used to say when they were playing: Command, re-command; command, re-command; wait, re-wait; wait, re-wait; a little here, a little there, and they mock my patience, thinking that I am threatening things that I will never do: let them experience the fulfillment of their desires, so that they may go to destruction and fall back incurably; and may they never make progress and be unable to say with the Apostle: Forgetting the past, we stretch out to what is ahead (Philippians 3:13); but may they be broken and ensnared, and captured by either the Babylonian or the Roman army. For that which we have said: Command, re-command; command, re-command; expect, re-expect; expect, re-expect; a little here, a little there, in Hebrew it is written thus: Sau Lasau, Sau Lasau; Cau Lacau, Cau Lacau: Zer Sam, Zer Sam; and with these words the most impure heresy is accustomed to deceive and terrify the simple ones, in order to make them fear the novelty of the words, so that whoever knows these words and remembers them during their intercourse, without any doubt, will pass on to the kingdom of heaven. We read in the Apostle: 'In other tongues and with other lips I will speak to this people, and even then they will not listen to me,' says the Lord (1 Corinthians 14:21). This seems to me to be taken from the present chapter according to the Hebrew, and we observed this in the Old Testament (except for a few testimonies, which only Luke abuses by having more knowledge of the Greek language). Wherever something is said from the Old Testament, we do not follow the Septuagint, but the Hebrew, not following any interpretation, but translating the Hebrew sense into our own language. Symmachus, Theodotion, and the Septuagint had different opinions on this passage, and since it is long to speak about all of them, let us briefly pass over the Septuagint interpreters who are read in the Churches. I reject the Jewish people, the Priests and the Prophets, who have become drunk with wine, and have strayed and their plan, which they entered into because of greed, has been consumed by a curse. Will we announce future tribulations for the sake of Christ to them? To whom will evil be prepared as the crown of virtues? Surely it signifies the apostles, those who have been weaned from milk, those who have been torn away from the breast: Expect tribulation upon tribulation. But it speaks to the choir of the apostles and of all believers, that they should prepare themselves not for one, but for many tribulations, so that when they are troubled and oppressed, they may hope again, and have hope upon hope. And if the things that are promised are delayed a little, let them not be unbelieving: for indeed, it is a small and little delay, and the things that are promised will come. Indeed, tribulation works patience; patience, probation: probation, hope; and hope does not disappoint. (Rom. V, 3, 4, 5). And this same tribulation will be multiplied by the detraction of lips and the blasphemies of persecutors, with which they rage against the people of God with a rabid mouth. Moreover, the apostles and apostolic men will speak to the Jewish people, saying: This is the rest for the hungry for justice, and this is the contrition and anguish that leads to life. When these things were preached, the wicked refused to listen. Therefore, what was said to the people of God: Endure tribulation, endure tribulation; wait for hope, wait for hope: a little longer, a little longer, will be turned into punishment for those who refused to hear the word of the Lord, so that they may fall and go backwards, and fall into the danger of siege and death, and be captured without any end to their misery. But the Hebrew word Dea, which everyone translates as 'knowledge', was only interpreted poorly by the Seventy, a clear error. For the first letter is distinguished either as Daleth or Res with a small apex. Therefore, if it is read as Dea (), it means 'knowledge'; if Rea (), it means 'malice'; not from evil, which is contrary to good, but from constraint.
