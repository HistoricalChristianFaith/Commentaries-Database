“I, who created the smith who blows the fire of coals, that is, the devil of all evil arts, was not forced by nature to create him but freely chose to do so. I created the Adversary, not to cause people’s ruin but in order to provide a moral struggle. Those who lose that struggle lie in ruins, but I reward those who triumph in the struggle.” … Now the following seems to be the sense as the Septuagint has it: “I your creator have not made you in the way that the devil, that most evil craftsman with an unclean spirit, fills vessels of iniquity and carries them into perdition.” It should be known that vessels of this kind do not have a prosperous road ahead but are destroyed en route.… But the inhabitants of the church will be righteous to the Lord. For everyone who does right is born of God. To them the Lord says, “Be holy, since I am holy.”
