(Verse 26) And there will be the light of the moon, like the light of the sun, and the light of the sun will be seven times brighter, like the light of seven days, on the day when the Lord binds up the wounds of his people and heals the bruises inflicted by his blow. LXX: And the light of the moon will be like the light of the sun, and the light of the sun will be seven times brighter, on the day when the Lord heals the brokenness of his people and cures the pain of your wound. I wonder how in this present place the Hebrew words Labana () and Hamma (), which Aquila translates as whiteness and heat, by which it signifies the moon and the sun above the same LXX, have been rendered as brick and wall, in that place where it is written: And the moon shall blush, and the sun shall be confounded. For as they have been interpreted, the bricks will melt and the wall will fall, and now those who follow the Hebrew have translated the moon and the sun. Hence I am suspicious that they did not err from the beginning, but gradually corrupted by the fault of the scribes. For it cannot happen that those who have interpreted the same words correctly in this place have erred in the previous ones. Therefore, on the day of the killing of many, when the arrogant and proud have fallen, and those who have put their mouth in the sky have learned that they are of the earth, there will be light of the moon, just as the light of the sun: when the Lord gives a new heaven and a new earth, and the current state of this world passes away, so that the moon and the sun may obtain the rewards of their toil and their course. For the expectation of the creature waiteth for the revelation of the sons of God. For the creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him that made it subject, in hope: Because the creature also itself shall be delivered from the servitude of corruption, into the liberty of the glory of the children of God. For we know that every creature groaneth and travaileth in pain, even till now. And not only it, but ourselves also, who have the firstfruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption of the sons of God, the redemption of our body. For we are saved by hope. But hope that is seen, is not hope. For what a man seeth, why doth he hope for? But if we hope for that which we see not, we wait for it with patience. Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmity. For we know not what we should pray for as we ought; but the Spirit himself asketh for us with unspeakable groanings. And he that searcheth the hearts, knoweth what the Spirit desireth; because he asketh for the saints according to God. And we know that to them that love God, all things work together unto good, to such as, according to his purpose, are called to be saints. And the sun will receive sevenfold light: just as there was light for seven days when the world was created from the beginning (although the Septuagint did not transfer seven days), when the Lord bound up the wound of his people, or healed the bruise of his people: when that which is written will be fulfilled: Sorrow and mourning and groaning will flee away (Isa. 35:10): when with the influx of the fullness of the Gentiles, all Israel will be saved; or certainly when vengeance comes upon those whose souls cry out under the altar: How long will you not avenge our blood on those who dwell on the earth (Rev. 6:9)? And consider this, that it does not say, 'when he heals the brokenness of his people Israel, or Jacob;' but absolutely, 'his people,' in order to signify all who serve God. Some interpret this place and all that is contained in this chapter of promises as referring to heavenly Jerusalem, and to the return of its people, when what is written will be fulfilled: 'Heaven and earth will pass away' (Matthew 24:35). Others interpret it as referring to the time of Elijah, and they say it is he of whom it is written above: 'Your eyes will see your teacher' and 'your ears will hear a word behind you, saying: This is the way, walk in it' (Isaiah 30:20-21). Then, according to the fables of the poets, rivers of golden milk will flow from the mountains and hills, and the purest honey will drip from the leaves of the trees. Those who receive these things will also receive a tale of a thousand years and will embrace the earthly kingdom of the Savior, misunderstanding the Apocalypse of John on the surface of the letter, weaving the sacraments of the Church into their marrow.
