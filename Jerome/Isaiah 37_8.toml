Anyone who seeks to know why the history contained in the books of Kings and Chronicles appears to be confused in the book of the prophet should consider that prophecy may be mixed with history in the latter.… The liberation of the city and the downfall of Assyria and the reversion of the sun for ten hours and the fifteen years’ prolongation … belong both to prophecy and to history. - "Commentary on Isaiah 11.37.1–7"
