(Verse 23) And when the crowd was dismissed, he went up the mountain alone to pray. But when evening came, he was there alone. If Peter, James, and John, who had seen the glory of his transfiguration, had been with him, perhaps they would have gone up the mountain with him. But the crowd cannot follow to the heights, unless he teaches them by the sea on the shore and feeds them in the desert. But as for him going up alone to pray, do not attribute it to the one who satisfied five thousand men with five loaves, excluding women and children; but to the one who, upon hearing of John's death, withdrew into solitude. Not that we should separate the person of the Lord, but that his works are divided between God and man.
