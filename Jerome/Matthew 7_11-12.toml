(Ver. 11, 12.) So if you, being evil, know how to give good things to your children, how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask Him! Therefore, whatever you want men to do to you, do also to them, for this is the Law and the Prophets. It should be noted that when he referred to the apostles as evil, unless perhaps under the guise of the apostles the entire race of men is condemned, whose hearts are inclined to evil from infancy in comparison to divine mercy. Read Genesis (Genesis 8). It is not surprising if people of this age are called evil, since even the apostle Paul recalls: Redeeming the time, for the days are evil (Ephesians 5:16).
