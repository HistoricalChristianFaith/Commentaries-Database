Once again the prophetic word will encourage penitents to return to the churches and always seek the Lord and find him. The flocks of the Lord will thus be multiplied by the crowds who return, not of beasts of burden and wild animals, but flocks of people who are full of faith and reason, holy flocks, flocks of the city of Jerusalem.
