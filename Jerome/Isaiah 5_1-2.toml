The prophet sings a sorrowful song to the people of Israel, a song that he composed about the one of whom it is written in the Gospel: “When he saw her,” referring beyond doubt to Jerusalem, “he wept over her and said, ‘Would that you knew what will bring you peace, because the days are coming when your enemies will surround you and prevail over you and flatten both you and your children.’ ” And again: “How often have I desired to gather your children like a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, and you would not? Behold, your deserted house is abandoned,” which is similar to what was said in the current song: “I will abandon the vineyard.” But that Christ is called beloved and most dear, which Aquila understood to mean patradelphon, kindred through a father, the forty-fourth psalm teaches us in its inscription, “A song for the beloved,” as does the voice of God the Father in the Gospel: “This is my beloved Son, with whom I am pleased.” We also read in the sixty-seventh psalm: “The Lord will send the word with great power to preachers, the King of hosts to the beloved.” This beloved, therefore, composed a mournful song for his vineyard, one that I will sing to my beloved and pathetic people. Or at least it can be understood to mean “I will sing to almighty God the Father the song of Christ who is my kindred,” that is, begotten of my race.
