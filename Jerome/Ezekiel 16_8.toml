As far as Jerusalem is concerned, let us compare it with our soul, which as long as it is in infancy is unable to sin; but when it comes to that age, many are the lovers of demons and heretics and perverse teachings, which desire to turn aside to it; they are driven away by the protection of the Lord, so that the soul receives not the attendance of the devil but the ministers of a savior.

(Verse 8.) And I passed through you, and I saw you: and behold, your time, the time of lovers. And I spread my garment over you, and covered your shame. Septuagint: And I passed through you, and I saw you, and behold, your time, the time of those who divert: and I spread my wings over you, and covered your shame. What mercy! It was not enough to see her trampled in blood once, and to provoke her to repentance: but again he visited the sinner, and because she was naked, and full of confusion, he came and visited her again, and behold, her time, the time of lovers; whether according to the Septuagint, those who divert, or according to the interpretation of Aquila, the second συναλλαγῆς, namely the betrothal and wedding time; according to the first edition of the same and Theodotion, μαστῶν, which means of breasts: for which Symmachus translates ἀγαπῆς, which signifies love. Therefore, that was the time when women could join men and endure marital intercourse. However, merciful God spread His wings, and He took them in and carried them on His shoulders, according to what is written in the Gospel: \"How often have I desired to gather your children together as a hen gathers her brood under her wings, and you were not willing\" (Luke 12:34)? Or rather, He extended His garment as wings; for this is what the term \"pterygium\" means, with which Ruth covered her feet while sleeping at Boaz's feet (Ruth 3). And on the border, that is, on the hem of our garment, we are commanded to attach hyacinth fringes. This was done in order to cover the shame of Jerusalem, revealing the female genitalia under this name. Indeed, according to the Apostle: We surround the dishonorable parts of our body with greater honor (I Cor. XII, 13). Hence, the Psalmist sings: Blessed are those whose sins are forgiven, and whose sins are covered (Ps. XXXI, 1). This is why Ham, because he did not protect his father, is marked with eternal curse (Gen. IX). Let us turn our thoughts on what we said about Jerusalem to our own soul, which, as long as it remains in infancy, is free from sin. But when the time of its adulthood comes, there are many lovers of demons and heretics, and of perverse teachings, who desire to lead it astray. They are repelled by the protection of God, so that it may not receive the satellites of the devil, but rather the ministers of the Savior. For the diversion of lovers, and the abundance, it is expressed in Hebrew as Dodim (), according to the nature of their language, which means everything that has been turned upside down. The time of love, and the abundance of the lovers of God, can be understood in the cases of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob: when the Lord promised to them liberation for their people after the slavery in Egypt.

And I swore to you; and I made a covenant with you, says the Lord God. LXX: And I swore to you, and I entered into a covenant with you, says Adonai the Lord. For I spread my cloak, or my wings, over you: and I covered your shame: therefore I swore to you, and I entered into a covenant, or testament, with you: that you would be joined to me rather than others who wanted to turn away from you, according to that, The Lord swore and will not regret it: you are a priest forever, according to the order of Melchizedek (Ps. 110:4; Heb. 6). For the end of every controversy is an oath. And I live, says the Lord: unless the sinner repents of evil rather than death (Ezekiel XVIII). Therefore, at the time of the wedding, Israel receives the oath of God, in place of every dowry gift. And because David had said: Remember, O Lord, David, and all his meekness (Psalm CXXXI, 1): he who swears to the Lord, vows to God Jacob; and the Lord himself swears to him, as the Scripture says: The Lord has sworn truth to David, and he will not deceive him (Ibid., 11).
