(Verse 60) And he placed it in his new tomb, which he had cut out of the rock, and rolled a great stone to the entrance of the tomb and went away. The new tomb could be understood as a symbol that after the resurrection, being mistaken for someone else among the other bodies that remained, would not have occurred. It can also represent the virgin womb of Mary: the stone placed at the entrance, and the large stone, showing that the tomb could not be opened without the help of many people.
