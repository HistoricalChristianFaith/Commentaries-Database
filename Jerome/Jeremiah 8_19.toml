(Verse 19) Behold, the voice of the cry of the daughter of my people from a distant land. She describes weeping and the howling of the city of Jerusalem as the enemies enter.

Is not the Lord in Zion, and is not his king in her? Indeed, the Lord himself is the king. Or certainly the Lord refers to the Father, and the king refers to the Son, according to that which is written under the name of Solomon: 'Give your judgment, O God, to the king, and your justice to the king's son' (Psalm 72:1). But why is there a voice of shouting in Jerusalem, and why does the shout come from a far away land? The clear reason is that the Lord is not in her, and her king has departed from her.


Why, then, have they provoked me to anger with their idols and their foreign vanities? The Lord has departed from them, he said, because they provoked me to anger with the worship of idols, even though I, who am their Lord and king, was the one they should have worshipped.
