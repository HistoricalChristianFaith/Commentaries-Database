(Verse 5, 6) This is what the Lord God says: A single affliction, behold, is coming: the end is coming, the end is coming. He has awakened against you, behold, he is coming. Constriction is coming upon you, you who dwell in the land. These are not found in the Septuagint, but they have been added in their edition of Theodotion's translation under asterisks. However, we will follow the Hebrew. Instead of affliction, which according to Symmachus, who interpreted it as κάκωσιν, we have put for the sake of clarity: and in Hebrew and in Greek it is written κακία, or πονηρία: that is, wickedness. It is said (Al. Dicit) that the final time of the sins of the land of Israel has come: so that it may no longer escape the judgement of God, which it has deserved for a long time. And because it had not yet completed its sins, punishment was therefore delayed; according to what is written: For the sins of the Amorites are not yet complete (Genesis XV, 16). Therefore, the Lord also said to the Jews: And you, He says, fill up the measure of your fathers (Matthew XXIII, 32). Therefore, misery comes to you; affliction comes, and captivity comes. And lest you think that I threaten future things again, I show with my finger and demonstrate. Behold, it comes, the end comes, the end comes. He who seemed to you until now to be sleeping and resting, has suddenly awakened against you and risen up. Constriction comes, which is called Sephphira in Hebrew, and which Aquila interpreted as προσκόπησιν, that is, contemplation and foresight, which you always fear will come to you with trepidation; and which Theodotio interpreted as πλοκὴν, that is, the order and intertwining of all evils. Furthermore, what is said about you who dwell on earth, according to the Book of Revelation of John, we must understand: Woe to all who dwell on the earth. (Rev. 8:13). For the holy person is not an inhabitant of the earth, but a stranger and a pilgrim; and he says: I am a stranger and a sojourner, like all my fathers. (Psalm 38:13). Therefore, even Abraham the Hebrew, that is, a wanderer and a stranger passing through, is remembered; hastening to pass from the present world to the future. We can interpret this passage spiritually against the Jewish people, upon whom came the end and completion from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah son of Barachiah, whom they killed between the temple and the altar (Matt. XXIII). For as long as they did not lay hands on the Son of God, the judgment of the Lord slept and was delayed. But when they killed the heir, so that the inheritance would perish, then He arose against them and all the order of miseries and confusion awakened. Because they did not seek the heavenly things, but desired to cling to earthly things.
