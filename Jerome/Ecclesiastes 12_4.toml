"And the doors shall be shut in the streets,
when the sound of the grinding is low, and he shall rise up at the voice of the
bird, and all the daughters of music shall be brought low. "When the voice of the grinder is weak and the teaching
of a tutor has stopped, then in turn all things will stop. Even the doors are closed in the streets, as
according to the unwieldy virgins of the Gospel [Cfr. Matth. 25, 1-12.],
and each one regards her doors as closed to her in the street, so that she can
not buy oil. Or even, while the virgins
are wandering in the streets, husbands close each room when they have entered
into it. For if the road is thin and
narrow, which leads to life and that which leads to death is wide and open,
justly, the charity of most being cold, the door of teachings is closed in the
streets. [Cfr. Matth. 7, 13.] But let us use the following verse, in which
he says, "and he rises to the sound of a bird", (or of a sparrow), if
we seem to be a sinner to the voice of the bishop or elder so to show that we
are in repentance. But this could also
be different again, if we do not follow the context of this chapter, it can be
taken to mean the real resurrection, when the death will rise up to the voice
of the arch-angel. And it is not
surprising, if we compare the trumpet of an angel to a sparrow, when all night
is compared to Christ, if it is clement. 
And also this is not too surprising, if my memory serves me right, when
I have never read of a sparrow in a bad light. 
In the tenth Psalm a righteous man says, "I trust in God, just as
you say to my spirit: fly to the mountain like a sparrow." [Ps. 10, 1.] And in another place: "I woke and I was
made as a sparrow alone on a roof" [Ps. 101, 8.]. Nor is it seen in a bad light in another
place: "and even the sparrow found a home for himself" [Ps. 83, 4.]. Differently: they want to see this as the
closed doors in the street, as the weak steps of an old man, because he always
sits and cannot walk. The weakness of
the voice of the grinder is interpreted as in his jaws, because he cannot chew
food, and scarcely reduced in spirit, his voice is heard only quietly. More precisely he shows him to rise to the
sound of a bird, because now with cold blood and dry organs by which sleep is
nourished, he wakes to a soft sound, and in the middle of the night, when the
cock crows, he rises quickly; but he is not able to move his limbs from his
bed. And he becomes silent too, or as it
is better put in the Hebrew, the daughters of song become deaf, (meaning ears),
because it is harder for old-men to hear noises and there is less distinction
between voices, or enjoy songs. Also
compare what Berzellai says to David, when he does not want to go to Jordan. [Cfr. II reg. 19, 32-39.]" "
