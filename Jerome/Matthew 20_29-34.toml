Jesus stood still, because they being blind could not see their way. About Jericho were many pits, crags, and abrupt precipices; there fore the Lord stands still, that they might come to Him.

He commands that they be called to Him that the multitude may not withhold them; and He asks them what they would, that by their answer, their necessity may be made apparent, and His power be shewn in their healing.

The Creator bestows what nature had not given; or at least mercy accords what weakness had withheld.

They then who had sat shut up in Jericho, and knew only to cry with their voice, afterwards follow Jesus, not so much with their feet as in their virtues.

By the two blind men are generally understood the Pharisees and Sadducees.
