"And further, by these, my son, be
admonished: of making many books there is no end; and much study is a weariness
of the flesh. "If you remove the words which are given by
the one shepherd, related by the advice and agreement of the wise, do nothing
and nothing will be reproved you; follow in the footsteps of the multitude and
do not diverge from their command. Then
too for him who seeks to know many things there is a great number of books that
will lead him to wickedness and make the reader toil in vain. But he also teaches that you must have
enthusiasm and follow meanings more than the words themselves, the opposite
that philosophers and teachers of this world teach, who try to assert the
falsities of their doctrines with flamboyant and unnecessary language. On the other hand divine scripture is
restricted by the small quantity of what is written, and however much it is
enlarged by people's opinions it is restricted by the text itself. This is because the Lord has made speech
concise and brief all over the world, and His word is the same when it is
spoken in our mouth and our heart. [Cfr. Deut. 30, 14; Rom. 10, 8.] Differently: read often, then consider what
you have read daily, there is usually more toil of the mind that that of the
body. For just as whatever you do with
your hand and body is filled with the toil of the hand and the body, so that
which pertains to reading is more the toil of the mind. It seems to me from this that the above points
from the several books must be considered differently to the way in which many
believe them to be. It is the custom of
the Scriptures that, no matter how many books there are, if they all follow the
same matter are have few differences, then we can say that they are one
book. In this way the Gospel and the
"immaculate law of the Lord, converting spirits" [Ps. 18, 8.]
are called one, although there are several books in the Gospel and there are
many laws. In this way too there is one
volume of Isaiah, and all of the divine Scripture has one title; Ezekiel [Cfr. Ez. 3, 1-3.]
and John [Cfr. Apoc. 10, 9.]
are also many books in one book. The Saviour too prophesied in the holy words,
saying, "in the title of the Book is written about me" [Ps. 39, 9.]. According to this meaning therefore I think
it is a teaching that there should not be too many books. For whatever you say, if it is told to him
who was with God in the beginning, the word then is God [Cfr. Ioh. 1, 2.],
as one volume, and the many books are the one law, which is called the
Gospel. But if you argue that they are
varied and differ too much to be in the same volume, and look at them with too
much curiosity, even within each book you will see that there are many
books. They say about this: "you
may not escape the sin of saying too much" [Prov. 10, 19.]. Therefore there is no end to such books, for
all is good and the ending locks in truth, but wickedness and lying have no
end. And the more they are sought, the
more they come about. Study and
consideration of this is toil of the body. 
I say of the body here and not of the spirit. But the spirit even has toil according to
what the apostle says: "the more I worked for all these, not I, but the
grace of God which was with me" [I Cor. 15, 10.],
and the Saviour says, "I worked shouting" [Ps. 68, 4.].
