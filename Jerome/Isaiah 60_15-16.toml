(Verse 15, 16.) Because you were abandoned and hated, with no one to pass by, I will make you a pride for all generations, a joy from generation to generation. You will suck the milk of the nations and nurse at the breast of kings. And you will know that I am the Lord, your Savior and strong Redeemer, Jacob. LXX: Because you were abandoned and hated, with no one to help, I will make you an eternal exultation, a joy for generations to come. And you shall suck the milk of nations, and you shall eat the riches of kings. And you shall know that I am the Lord who saves you, and who redeems you, the God of Jacob. What was previously abandoned and despised, with broken branches because they did not bear fruit, they were broken because there was no one to pass by and provide help there. Concerning them it is said in the psalms: And those who passed by did not say: The Lord's blessing upon you (Ps. 128:8); therefore I will make you an everlasting pride, or a source of joy and gladness for two generations: for the former branches, others inserted from the wild olive tree of nations, which will bring forth fruit contrary to their natural example, not of bitterness, but of sweetness, which they have taken from the root. You will suck the milk of the nations, and the breast of kings you will nurse. We have explained in greater detail the meaning of this place, discussing that verse, 'Your sons shall come from afar, and your daughters shall nurse at your side.' Or according to the Septuagint, you will eat the riches of kings. These riches, according to the Hebrew truth, are the breasts of kings and doctors, by which the infancy of those born in Christ is educated and nourished. When you have sucked and have come to solid food, so that you also eat the riches of kings of this kind, then you will know that I am your Savior, who redeemed you with my blood, or the mighty God of Jacob.
