(Verse 18 and following) A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, nor can a bad tree bear good fruit. Every tree that does not bear good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire. Therefore, by their fruits you will know them. Let us ask the heretics who claim that there are two contradictory natures, if according to their understanding, a good tree can never bear bad fruit, then how did Moses, a good tree, sin by striking the rock (Deut. 32)? And how did David, after killing Uriah, sleep with Bathsheba (2 Sam. 11)? And how did Peter, during the Passion of the Lord, deny Him, saying: 'I do not know the man' (Matt. 26:72)? Or what connection is there between Jethro, the father-in-law of Moses, a bad tree who did not believe in the God of Israel, giving good advice to Moses (Exod. 18)? And how did Achior, in speaking to Holofernes, say something useful (Judith 5)? And as the comedian said (which the Apostle confirmed): 'Evil company corrupts good morals' (1 Cor. 5). And when they do not find what to answer, let us infer that Judas (John 13) , once a good tree, bore bad fruits after betraying (or handing over) the Savior; and that Saul (Philippians 3) , a bad tree at the time he persecuted the Church of Christ, bore good fruits afterwards, when he was transformed from a persecutor into a vessel of election (Acts 9) . Therefore, a good tree does not bear bad fruits as long as it perseveres in the pursuit of goodness; and a bad tree remains in the fruits of sin as long as it does not convert to repentance. For no one remains in what he was, he begins to be what he has not yet begun.
