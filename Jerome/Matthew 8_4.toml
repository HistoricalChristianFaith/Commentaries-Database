After the preaching and teaching, is offered an occasion of working miracles, that by mighty works following, the preceding doctrine might be confirmed.
It is not to be read, as most of the Latins think, ‘I will cleanse thee;’ but separately, He first answers, “I will,” and then follows the command, “be thouclean.” The leper has said, “If thou wilt;” The Lord answers, “I will;” he first said, “Thou canst make me clean;” the Lord spake, “Be thou clean.”.
And in truth what need was there that he should proclaim with his mouth what was evidently showed in his body?.
He sends him to the Priests, first, because of His humility that He may seem to defer to the Priests; secondly, that when they saw the leper cleansed they might be saved, if they would believe on the Saviour, or if not that they might be without excuse; and lastly, that He might not seem, as He was often charged, to be infringing the Law.
It was ordained in the Law, that those that had been cleansed of a leprosy should offer gifts to the Priests; as it follows, “And offer thy gift as Moses commanded for a testimony to them.”
