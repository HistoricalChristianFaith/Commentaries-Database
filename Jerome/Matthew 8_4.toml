(Verse 4.) And Jesus said to him: See that you tell no one. And in truth, why was it necessary that he boast in speech, which he excelled in bodily?

44 But go, show yourself to the priests and offer the gift that Moses commanded, as a testimony to them. He sends him to the priests for various reasons. First, out of humility, so that he may seem to defer honor to the priests. For it was commanded by the law that those who had been cleansed from leprosy should offer gifts to the priests. Second, so that seeing the cleansed leper, they might either believe in the Savior or not believe. If they believed, they would be saved; if they did not believe, they would be without excuse. And at the same time, in order to avoid being accused of frequently violating the law.
