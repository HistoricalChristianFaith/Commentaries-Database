As I said before, we must adapt our faith to those things that the Lord explained. Those things which he did not mention and which he left to our intelligence will be briefly touched on here. Think of those who were asleep as signifying the teachers of the different churches. Think of the householder’s servants as none other than the angels who daily look upon the Father’s face. Think of the enemy who sowed the weeds as the devil because he wanted to be a god.
