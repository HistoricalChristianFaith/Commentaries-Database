"Wisdom
strengthens the wise more than ten mighty men which are in the city. For there is not a just man on the earth,
that does good and does not sin. "Therefore wisdom strengthens the righteous,
and not even the aid of all the citizens of the city can help him, for although
someone may be righteous, yet while he is alive he is subject to vices and
sins, and he therefore needs greater protection. Another reading of this is: the ten who hold
power and are in the city are angels, who have arrived at the complete number
of 'denarii' and are here to help mankind. 
But if anyone should consider different types of help, the aid of wisdom
is better, because that is the aid of our Lord Jesus Christ. For after the angels said, "we would
have protected Babylon yet it is not now protected, so let us leave it, and let
each one of us go out unto his own land" [Ier. 51, 9.]. Then the teacher of doctors himself came down
and healed us with a touch of His finger, we who were spattered with blood, and
wet with the blood of sinners, we who weigh out all our possessions against
healing. But He healed in that city
which is in that world, and 'strengthened in wisdom' or as the Septuagint says
'helped'. For it is given and added to
everyone who possesses it. But the man
who sins greatly is stuck in deep and needs more help: therefore Wisdom herself
came to his aid. Another meaning of this
verse is: above he had said that one should be kind to both the good and the
wicked: therefore someone was able to reply: though I want to be kind to all
men, I have not the power with which to do this. And a righteous man does not have such
riches, which normally come more abundantly to sinners. Therefore he now says, those whom you can't
help with money, help with advice and comfort them with solace. For one is more able to excel in these ways
than any of the greatest of potentates. 
And you would be wise to do this, for the scale of justice is great, and
must decide for whom, how much, how long, and of what sort, help is given,
either with monetary support or with advice.
