(Verse 5.) Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted. This mourning is not a common law of nature for the dead, but for the sins and vices of the dead. Thus Samuel wept for Saul, because he regretted that God had anointed him king over Israel (1 Samuel 15). And so the Apostle Paul says that he weeps and mourns for those who have not repented after committing fornication and impurity (2 Corinthians 12).
