(Verse 11) Therefore I am full of the fury of the Lord, I have labored holding it. LXX: And I have fulfilled my wrath, and have endured: and I have not consumed it. According to the Hebrew, it is spoken from the perspective of the Prophet, who foresees the coming wrath of God, and is full of the fury and anger of the Lord, and cannot bear it anymore: nor does he dare to intercede with the Lord for sinners. According to the LXX, however, a new meaning is given, that the Lord himself has fulfilled it by striking the sinful people: and yet he has restrained it, and has not poured it all out, so that the remnants may be saved: which seems to me to be contradictory to itself. For if he completed his fury, how did he manage not to complete it?
