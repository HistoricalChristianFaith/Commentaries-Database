(Verse 35.) And she conceived and bore a son, and she said: Now I will confess to the Lord, and for this reason she called his name Judah. Judah means confession. Therefore, the name confession is derived from the confession. However, here confession is understood as thanksgiving or praise, as often in the Psalms and in the Gospel (Matthew 11:25): I will confess to you, Lord, Father of heaven and earth, that is, I thank you or glorify you.
