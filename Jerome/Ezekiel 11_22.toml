There is no doubt that the mount is the Mount of Olives, from which the Savior ascended to the Father, and the glory of the Lord, which had departed from the city of Jerusalem, stood on the Mount of Olives as a sign of resurrection and light.

It is wonderful that down to the present day the glory of the Lord, which had deserted the temple, stands on the Mount of Olives. Moving in the sign of a cross, it gazes at what was once the Jewish temple, destroyed in dust and ashes.
