(Verse 16.) And all who remain of all the nations that came against Jerusalem shall go up year after year to worship the King, the Lord of hosts, and to keep the Feast of Tabernacles. LXX: And it shall come to pass that everyone who is left of all the nations which came against Jerusalem shall go up from year to year to worship the King, the Lord Almighty, and to keep the Feast of Tabernacles. All, he said, who remain from the nations that came against Jerusalem, shall go up year after year to worship the King, the Lord of hosts, and to celebrate the feast of Tabernacles. The Jews also promise that this will happen in the empty hope of a thousand-year kingdom, the beginning of which is this solemnity: The people of Israel went forth from Egypt through a vast and terrible and broad wilderness, in which there was no house, village, town, or cave, and they made for themselves tabernacles and tents (which are now called tents from the likeness of a small bird's wing) in which they dwelt with their spouses and children, and took food, and avoided the heat of the sun by day, the dampness and cold and harm of the dew by night. And it was commanded that the feast of Tabernacles should be held on the fifteenth day of the seventh month. And when your son asks you tomorrow, saying, What do these tabernacles mean? You shall respond to him: For a long time we have been traveling in Egypt, from which the Lord brought us out into the wilderness, and therefore we set up tabernacles, so that we may remember the blessings of God at all times, when we began to dwell in cities (Deut. VI, 20, 21, and Lev. XXIII, 43). He also commanded them to make tabernacles from very beautiful wood, which the Jews call citron, and from the branches and leaves of very dense wood, and from willow and poplar. We have laid the foundations of history, so that we may move from these to spiritual matters. As long as we are in progress and in the course and struggle, we dwell in tabernacles, striving in our whole mind, so that we may move from tabernacles to a firm and stable dwelling, that is, the house of God. Therefore, holy David says in the Psalm: Woe is me, that my dwelling is prolonged (Ps. 119:5)! And: I am a stranger and a sojourner as all my fathers were (Ps. 38:31). This is spoken by someone who is in Egypt, and still living in the world. But whoever leaves Egypt, which is called Moab in Hebrew, and interpreted as tribulation; and enters the desert of vices, takes his journey, and says in the psalm: I will go through to the place of the wonderful tent, even to the house of God (Ps. XLI, 5). For it is admirable not to dwell with the Egyptians; but with Pharaoh drowned, to desire to enter the land of promise (Exod. XIV). And elsewhere it is said: How lovely are your dwelling places, O Lord of hosts! My soul longs, indeed it even faints for the courts of the Lord (Ps. 84:1). And a little later: Blessed are those who dwell in your house, they will praise you forever and ever (ibid., 84:5). For we find written in Proverbs: The house of the righteous will stand firm, their dwelling places will endure for those who act rightly (Prov. 2:21). He promises about houses, that they remain; about tabernacles, that they have statures. And in another place the holy man says: One thing I have asked of the Lord, this I will seek, that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life, and see the delight of the Lord, and visit His temple (Psalm 27:4). The one who dwells in such tabernacles, and from tabernacles goes to courtyards, and from courtyards goes to the house, and from the house goes to the temple of the Lord, ought to celebrate the feasts of tabernacles in the most beautiful wood of wisdom, about which it is said in Proverbs: It is a tree of life to all who approach it, and those who lean on it, as on a firm house (Proverbs 3:18). And in the branches of the palm trees, in which the sign of victory and the reward of virtue are contained, and in the leaves of the densest tree which the Jews understand to be myrtle, because of the mortification of the flesh and desires. Hence, it is offered to the Lord and Savior by the Magi in the form of myrrh (Matt. II). And he says, in the branches of the willow and the poplar, which some call one tree; and the name of the wood itself, which is called in Greek ἁγνὸς, indicates chastity. Doctors say, and those who have written about the nature of trees and plants, that if anyone drinks a mixture of willow flower or poplar with water, all heat will cool in him, and the vein of desire will become dry, and he will not be able to produce children. Whoever is protected by the branches of such trees should observe the feast of tabernacles, passing through the sixth month which refers to the world, and celebrating the spiritual Sabbath on the seventh day of the same month, when the moon of the night is fullest, and all its darkness is resolved by bright light. We have said these things briefly, contemplating in our mind the magnitude of the books, so that we may move on to the remaining ones.
