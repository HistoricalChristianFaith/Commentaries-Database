(Verse 9) But let us not grow weary in doing good, for in due season we will reap, if we do not give up. He encourages those who expect the reward of good works in this life, not knowing that just as there is a different time for sowing and for harvesting in a seed, so in the present life, there is sowing of works (which are either in the spirit or in the flesh) but the harvest is the future judgment. And depending on the quality or diversity of the sowing, it will make different measures for us, a hundredfold, sixtyfold, and thirtyfold, which no one can harvest lacking. For whoever perseveres until the end, will be saved (Matt. X, 22). As it is also commanded in another place: Do not fall away (Isai. V). But what is it, that while sinners increase daily in evil deeds, we grow weary in doing good?
