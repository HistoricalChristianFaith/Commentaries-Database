"And it
will not be well with the wicked, and he will not live long-like a
shadow-because he does not fear God. "He invokes wickedness upon those who do not
fear God, and desires that they do not wait long for their punishment, but
rather are crucified and immediately put to death, this punishment is for those
who merit such a death. This is similar
to what the apostle says: "I would that those who annoy us were put to death." [Gal. 5,12.] And in another place "Alexander the coppersmith
did me much evil, may the Lord reward him according to his works." [II Tim. 4, 14.] We must ask though how these things are said
so mildly. This is very true to the
Hebrew meaning of this verse. But we can
follow the Septuagint's interpretation, which seems to take another meaning,
and says, "and I know, since those who fear God will be well, that they
fear his face, and the wicked will not be well, and his day will not be long in
shadows, who does not fear God." He
could have said this: 'let there also be those things which I considered a
little earlier', but I know clearly that those fearing God will be well;
"for the face of God is above those who do wickedness" [Ps. 33, 17.]. And the wicked will not be well, for he does
not fear God and his days will not be longer in shadows. This is the day of his life, which is like a
shadow for the living. Not by this do
those who live for a long time lengthen their days, but they make them great
with the number of their good deeds. As
if confessing himself to be a sinner, Jacob says about this: "few and
wicked are these days of mine" [Gen. 47, 9.]. And confessing in the Psalm he says, "my
days are inclined like shadows, and I am like the hay of the field" [Ps. 101, 12.]. Not because he has sought a long life in the
present world, in which all that we live is brief and looks lie shadow:
"for man walks in His likeness" [Ps. 38, 7.],
but because he fears the future, lest the length of his life, if it is indeed
life, should be short.
