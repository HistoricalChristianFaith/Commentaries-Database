“It is as when the precious ointment upon the head runs down over the beard, the beard of Aaron.” Oh, if only there were time to explore together each verse; even a day would not suffice! We have read in Exodus45 the account of how oil is prepared for the anointing of the priest; we have read, too, of the different kind of balm used to anoint kings. There was still another unguent for prophets. What more is there to say? All these oils of unction were different, each with its own spiritual symbolism.… Nothing is ever made sacred except by anointing. It is with this in view that young maidens say in the Song of Solomon, “Your name is a spreading perfume: we will run after you in the odor of your ointments.”
