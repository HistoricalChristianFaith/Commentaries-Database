(Verse 11, 12) And it shall pass through the sea strait, and strike the waves in the sea; and all the deep waters of the river shall be confounded, and the pride of Assyria shall be humbled, and the scepter of Egypt shall depart. I will strengthen them in the Lord; and they shall walk in His name, says the Lord. LXX: And they shall pass through the narrow sea, and strike the waves in the sea, and the deep waters of the rivers shall be dried up; and all the injury of the Assyrians shall be taken away, and the scepter of Egypt shall be lifted up. And I will strengthen them in the Lord their God, and they shall glory in His name, says the Lord. The Hebrews narrate that the captive people of the Jews, not only to the Medes and Persians, but also to the Bosporus and the northern region, were transported by the Assyrians and Chaldeans, and afterwards partially restored by the mercy of God, when He turned them towards Himself; and this is what is now said: They shall pass over the narrow sea. The straits of Propontis, which divide Chalcedon and once Byzantium by a narrow channel. And the Lord, going before his people, will strike the waves of the sea, and all the deeps of rivers will be confounded, as it was done in the drying up of the Jordan (Joshua 3), and the people passed over the Red Sea in the desert (Exod. 24). And when he has been freed from the depths of captivity and the bitterness of evil, Assyria will be humbled, and the empire of Egypt will withdraw from them. And they will be strengthened in the Lord, and they will walk in the land of Israel in his name, says the Lord. These things, as they were handed down to us by the Hebrews, we have expressed to the people of our language, faithfully representing the words spoken to them by those from whom they were spoken. However, we who are called by the name of Christ, leave behind the letter that kills, and follow the life-giving spirit, rather comparing spiritual things with spiritual things, not the Bosporus and the dryness of the sea and the dry flow of the Jordan, which are like fables, but we seek the worthy mercy of God towards His servants, with Him leading the way and opening the path for us, we cross the sea channel, or rather the narrow sea, which is widest for sinners: For wide is the gate and broad is the way that leads to destruction: and narrow is the gate and narrow is the way that leads to life (Matthew 7:13). About this sea we read in the Psalms: Those who go down to the sea in ships, doing business in many waters, have seen the works of the Lord, and his wonders in the deep (Psalm 107:23-24). In this sea of the world, in which the number of the saints is restricted, and they are in a state of tribulation, the apostles descended, and the Lord himself, in order to free us from the bitter waves (Mark 4). In this sea, the net of the Gospel is cast (Matthew 13), which is woven with the testimonies of the Scriptures, so that it may draw out many fish that are submerged in the depths of this world, into the free air, so that they may sing praises to God. There are those who go down to the sea and work many deeds in the ships of the Churches, and they behold the wonders of God in the deep of the riches of His wisdom and knowledge (1 Corinthians 2); and in the Holy Spirit who searches even the heights of God, to whom the Lord speaks: Come after me, and I will make you fishers of men (Matthew 4:19). Concerning these fishermen who go down to the sea and are in ships, Isaiah also prophesies: They will fly in the ships of foreigners, and they will equally plunder the sea (Isaiah 11:14). For in the churches, the apostles flew throughout the whole world in order to plunder the sea and take the spoils of the dragon who ruled in the sea, of whom it is written: 'This great and wide sea, in which are creatures without number, both small and great creatures, and ships pass through it.' This dragon, which You made to play with (Psalm 103:25-26), is the vast and wide sea with small and great creatures, which interact with the dragon and are without number. But those who are on the sea and fly over the sea in ships, hear with the Savior: You rule the power of the sea: you calm the movement of its waves (Ps. LXXXVIII, 10). And when they have passed through the strait of the sea and have trampled its waves with their feet, all the deep waters, of which it is written: Who turns the sea into dry land, they shall pass through the river on foot (Psalm LXV, 6), so that the injury or arrogance of Assyria and Egypt may be humbled and depart from the holy and believing people, and those who are freed may be strengthened in the Lord and say: My strength and my praise is the Lord (Ps. CXVII, 14). And again: I will love you, O Lord, my strength (Psalm 17:1). And with Jeremiah: You are my strength, my help, and my refuge, O Lord my God (Jeremiah 16:19). Therefore, the Apostle, in whom Christ spoke, said: I can do all things through him who strengthens me (Philippians 4:13). And they will not only be strengthened in the Lord, but they will also glory in him and say: But far be it from me to boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world (Galatians 6:14). And: Whoever boasts, let him boast in the Lord (1 Corinthians 1:31). And in another place: Let not the wise man boast in his wisdom, and let not the strong man boast in his strength, and let not the rich man boast in his riches; but let him who boasts boast in this: to understand and know the Lord, and to practice mercy and justice in the midst of the earth (Jeremiah 9:23-24). But because it is written in Hebrew: And they shall walk in His name, it is thus understood: that Christians should walk in the name of Christ, and let the new name be written on their hearts, and let them walk with the Lord in the dignity of such a great name, as Enoch walked and pleased God, and was translated (Genesis 5).
