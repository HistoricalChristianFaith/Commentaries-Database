(Verse 19 onwards) Because this is what the Lord (the Vulgate adds God) says: When I make you a desolate city like cities that are uninhabited, and I bring an abyss upon you, and many waters cover you, and I bring you down with those who descend into the pit (or to those who descend into the grave) to the everlasting people, and I place you in the farthest land (or in the depths of the earth) like the ancient wildernesses, with those who are brought down into the pit (or descend into the grave), so that you will not be inhabited, and when I give glory in the land of the living (or so that you will not rise again in the land of the living), I will bring you to nothing (or I will give you destruction) and you will not be, and you will not be sought after (the Vulgate adds anymore) forever, says the Lord God. Join the things that were said with the ones before. When I will hand you over, O Tyre, a city forever desolate, just like other cities that are not inhabited at all, and if I bring upon you the abyss, and many waters cover you, or the infinite multitude of enemies, or certainly the one who speaks to the island and compares the frequency of adversaries in the city established on the island to the waves of the abyss: and if I drag you down with those who descend into the lake, or into the pit, to those who are in hell, of whom we also read in the Psalms: They will enter the lower parts of the earth: they will be delivered into the hands of the sword, the parts of foxes will be (Ps. LXII, 10, 11); to the everlasting people, where there is weeping of eyes, and gnashing of teeth, and I will place you in the last land, where the ancient dragon is established, and like the ancient desolations and deserted places, where there is no remembrance of good things, but eternal punishments, nor will I make you rise again in the land of the living, of which it is written: Blessed are the meek, for they shall possess the land (Matthew V, 4). And in another place: I will please the Lord in the land of the living (Psalm 115:9): then you will be reduced to nothing, or you will perish forever, and you will be no more, according to what is written in another psalm: Leave me, that I may be refreshed before I depart, and I shall be no more (Psalm 39:14). Not that he who is in eternal punishment ceases to exist, but because it is said in the holy scriptures that he who does not live for God does not subsist. Therefore, even Esther speaks against idols, saying: Do not yield your scepter to those who are not (Esther 14). Certainly there were those who begged that it not be handed over; but they were not of God, who had ceased to have virtues and to be alive to God. And this should be noted, that Tyre is sought by the one who comes to seek and save what was lost, and he seeks one stray sheep out of ninety-nine left in the mountains (Luke 19). Also, the woman who had lost one drachma seeks, finds, and calls her neighbors to share in her joy (ibid., 15). But if Tyre is not found, it is not the fault of the one searching, but of the one who has escaped the hand of the good shepherd. And furthermore, it says, 'You will be no more forever;' whether it is written in Hebrew as 'Lolam' or in Greek as 'αἰῶν,' it signifies one age, according to what Isaiah says, who after seventy years declares that Tyre will be restored to its former state. They say, however, that one age, that is, the span of human life, is calculated as seventy years, as the Psalmist says: 'The days of our years, in them are seventy years.' But for those in power, eighty years, whatever is beyond that, is labor and sorrow (Psalm 89:10). We have briefly spoken in a metaphorical sense about Tyre. This can also be understood as referring to those who, in the distress of this world, are led down to the underworld, covered by the abyss of punishment and the waves of torment, and dragged down to the depths of the earth. They are joined with those who are in the ancient desolation, and are led into the lake or eternal pit, so that they are no longer inhabited by the Holy Spirit. Concerning which it is written: When the ungodly falls into the depths of evil, he despises it (Prov. XVIII, 3). They will no longer exist on the land of the living, but will perish and be reduced to nothingness, ceasing to belong to God. These are the testimonies that those who claim the punishments of the wicked, not the sinners, are eternal abuse: those who have sought from God and have not been found, and have ceased to exist forever because they have lost Him who says: I am the life (John XIV, 6).
