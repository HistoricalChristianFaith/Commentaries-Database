(Verse 7 and following) "I will raise up a spear against my shepherd, and against the man who is my associate," says the Lord of hosts. Strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered, and I will turn my hand against the little ones. And they shall be in all the land, says the Lord, two parts in it shall be cut off and perish, and the third part shall be left. And I will bring the third part through the fire, and will refine them as silver is refined, and will test them as gold is tested. He will call my name, and I will answer him: I will say, 'You are my people,' and he will say, 'The Lord is my God.' Zechariah: Sword, rise against my shepherd, and against the man who is my associate, says the Lord Almighty. Strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered; I will raise my hand against the shepherds. On that day, says the Lord, two-thirds will be cut off and perish, and one-third will be left. I will bring the one-third through the fire, and I will refine them as one refines silver, and I will test them as one tests gold. He himself will call upon my name, and I will answer him; I will say, 'This is my people,' and he will say, 'The Lord is my God.' Regarding the sword that the LXX translated as 'ῥομφαία' in Hebrew as 'Areb,' we found that Aquila and Symmachus translated it as 'μάχαιρα,' meaning sword or blade. And as for the phrase we translated as 'cohaerent mihi,' which means 'adhering to me,' Aquila interpreted it as 'contribulem meum,' meaning 'my fellow countryman,' and Symmachus translated it as 'populi mei,' meaning 'my people' in Hebrew 'Amithi.' The LXX translated it as 'civem ejus,' which means 'his fellow citizen,' and Theodotio translated it as 'proximum ejus,' meaning 'his neighbor.' At the end of the sentence, they read 'Jod' instead of 'Vau,' which are only different in size. If 'Jod' is read, it signifies 'my.' If 'Vau' is read, it signifies 'his.' But I marvel at certain individuals who wish to diminish this prophecy (which the evangelist Matthew related to the Lord and Savior after his disciples fled during his passion, and then he said it was fulfilled) with allegorical interpretations, and while they desire to appear to know more than others, they do not hold to the rule of truth. For the evangelist Matthew reports: Then Jesus said to them: all of you will be offended because of me this night. For it is written: I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered. And again: All this has happened so that the Scriptures of the Prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples, leaving him, fled (Matt. XXVI, 31 et seq.). Nor should it be thought that this testimony is taken from another place, because in the Gospel God says of himself that he is the shepherd who is struck, and in the present place, we read that it is commanded with sword and spear: Strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered. This is a sword and this is a spear, and a javelin, from which in the twenty-first Psalm the Lord speaks to the Father: Deliver my soul from the sword; and my only one from the hand of the dog (Psalm 21:12). Of this javelin it is also written in the prophet Amos: They shall all die by the sword, the sinners of the land (Amos 9:10). Which cannot be taken literally: for many sinners perish in shipwreck, others by poison, these are suffocated by water, those consumed by fire. But with this sword and this spear, all sinners perish (or are punished), and the dark-skinned Ethiopians, of whom Zephaniah testifies with sacred mouth, saying: But you also, Ethiopians, will be killed by my sword (Zeph. 1:12). After the good shepherd who laid down his life for his sheep (John 10:15), who spoke to the Father: Those whom you struck, they pursued, and they added to the pain of my wounds (Ps. 68:27), he was struck by the will of the Father, and the man who is united with God who said: I am in the Father, and the Father is in me (John 13:10), hung on the gibbet, and said: Father, into your hands I commend my spirit (Luke 23:46): immediately the sheep were scattered, the whole multitude of believers in Christ. And the Lord stretched out his hand, as we read in the Septuagint, to the shepherds, whom many of the Jewish rulers interpret as evil. But as it is written in Hebrew, to the children, to whom the Lord said in the Gospel: Do not be afraid, little flock (Luke, XII). And in Isaiah: Behold, I and the children, or little ones, whom God has given me (Isaiah VIII, 18). And there were two parts in all the land of the Jews and the Gentiles, who perished and failed together: for in his suffering, the voice of the Psalmist is fulfilled, saying: Save me, O Lord, for the godly one is gone (Psalm XI, 1). And: All have turned aside; they have together become useless; there is none who does good, there is not even one (Ps. XIII, 3). As the nations and the Jews were perishing, the third part of the world, that is, the third people of the Christians, suddenly increased. And it says beautifully: A third part shall be left in it, that is, on the earth: because among the Jews and the nations, those who have confessed the Lord are alone reserved for the life and habitation of the earth. Moreover, the third part, so as not to be delicate and secure in confession, is tested as silver and gold are tested by fire, which the Lord desires to burn in believers (Luke 12), and which Paul desires to fervently burn (Romans 12). And so the apostles, baptized in the fire of the Spirit of the Lord (Acts 2), speak in the psalm: For you have tested us, O God, you have tried us as silver is tried (Psalm 65:10, 11). And after a little while: We passed through fire and water, and you led us into refreshment. And in another place it is said to the believer: If you pass through fire, the flame will not burn you: because I am with you (Isaiah 43:2). But the fire does not consume, and the flame does not devour, because it is the voice of the Lord who cuts off the flame of fire (Psalm 29:7). When these little ones have been tested in this way, upon whom the Lord has turned his hand, and through their calling the whole multitude of nations has believed, then the people of believers will call Christ by his name, and with him saying: You are my people, the people will respond: You are the Lord my God. The Jews refer these things to Christ: and they contend that they will happen in the last time; but the difference between us and them is that we say that they have already been fulfilled, while they mention things that are still to be fulfilled.
