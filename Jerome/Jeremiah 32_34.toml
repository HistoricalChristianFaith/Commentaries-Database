(Verse 34) And they placed their idols in the house where my name is invoked, to defile it. Not only in that time did Judas place in the Temple of God the statue of the idol, which we read about in the beginning of Ezekiel (Ezek. VIII): but even today in the house of God, which is interpreted as the Church, or in the hearts and souls of believers, an idol is placed when a new doctrine is established, and according to Deuteronomy it is worshipped in secret (Deut. IV): Do you not know that you are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwells in you (1 Cor. III, 16).
