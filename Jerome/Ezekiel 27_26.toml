(Verse 26) Your rowers have brought you into many waters. Above the rowers, we read about the Tyrians of the city of Sidon, and the Aradians, of whom the former are interpreted as hunters and the latter as passers-by. Indeed, they hunt the souls of those whom, amidst the waves of this world, they lead according to their own judgment and do not raise up to lofty heights, but plunge them into the depths. They do not imitate those who, sailing until the morning watch, broke the raging waves of the sea and deserved to receive the Lord and Savior. And immediately, with such a guide and companion, they arrived at the harbor of rest. About which is more fully written in the Gospel.

The south wind tossed you in the heart of the sea (Matthew 14). All the riches of Tyre, scattered by the blowing south wind. They are significantly called Cadim, which is interpreted in Greek as καύσων; we can translate it as a burning wind. Concerning this wind, the holy David said: The sun shall not harm you by day, nor the moon by night (Psalm 121:6). Jacob was burned by this wind, yet not consumed, as he speaks: By day the heat consumed me, and the frost by night (Genesis 31:40). Those also who were hired from the first hour endured the heat and burning of the whole day, and yet they receive a denarius, because they were scorched and not defiled. Hence the bride says in the Song of Songs: I am black, but beautiful, because the sun has looked upon me (Cant. I, 4): or, as it is better expressed in Hebrew, the sun has made me pale.

Your riches and treasures, and your abundant wealth. Many read it this way: In the heart of the sea are your riches and treasures, and your abundant wealth; so that all the riches and treasures of Tyre, and all its substance, are set in the heart of the sea, and are overwhelmed by the waves of time, and its inhabitants have nothing stable and lasting, with that Gospel fulfilled: 'Fool, tonight they will take your soul from you, and whose will be what you have prepared?' (Luke XII, 20). And to that apostle: Those who want to become rich, fall into temptation and many snares, and are dragged into the abyss (I Tim. VI, 9). The story is clear; therefore, we join together brief sentences with almost single verses. For the speech is already hastening towards the end of the book.
