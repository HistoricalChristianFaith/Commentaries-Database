If these little creations fall not without God’s superintendence and providence, and if things made to perish, perish not without God’s will, you who are immortal ought not to fear that you live without His providence.
That He says, “The hairs of your head are all numbered,” shows the boundless providence of God towards man, and a care unspeakable that nothing of ours is hid from God.
Those who deny the resurrection of the flesh ridicule the sense of the Church on this place, as if we affirmed that every hair that has ever been cut off by the razor rises again, when the Saviour says, “Every hair of your head” - not is saved, but - “is numbered.” Where there is number, knowledge of that number is implied, but not preservation of the same hairs.
