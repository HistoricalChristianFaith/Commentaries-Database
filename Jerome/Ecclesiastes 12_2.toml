"While the sun, or the light, or the moon, or
the stars, be not darkened, nor the clouds return after the rain. "If we take this from the creation of the world, this
chapter agrees with the words of the Lord, in which He says, "there will
be trouble and difficulty as there has not been since the beginning of
creation, but this will not happen. For
the sun will grow dark and the moon will not shed light, and the stars will
fall from the sky, and the virtues of heaven will be moved" [Matth. 24, 21.19.]. Those things are the guardians of the house,
as we understand the 'house' to be this world, and the strong men, deceived by
wickedness and varied strengths must be dispersed. But if a particular consummation of any one
person is kept to the end of his life, then the sun, the moon, and stars,
clouds and rain will cease to be for him, who has died. Differently: enjoy youth, O Christian people,
and enjoy the goodness which has been given to you by God, and know that God
will judge you for all these. Do not
think that, since the earlier branches have been broken, you will be placed in
the root of a good olive tree, and therefore you will be without worry. But remove anger from your heart and desires
from your body, and when you have left all other vices remember your Creator
before the day of wickedness comes, the day of madness, in which punishments
have been made for sinners. This is so
that when you sin the sun of righteousness will set for you at midday, and the
light of knowledge will die, and the brightness of the moon, (that is of the
Church) will be taken away, and the stars will die, about which is written,
"in which you shine like the lights in the world having reason of
life" [Phil. 2, 15.]. And elsewhere: "star differs from star
in glory. Before the clouds return after
the rain" [I Cor. 15, 41.],
lest the prophets, who have watered the hearts of believers by the rain of
their speech, after they have seen you to be unworthy of their rain, return to
their seat, clearly to Him from whom they were sent.
