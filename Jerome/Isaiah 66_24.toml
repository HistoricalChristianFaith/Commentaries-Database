But the worm that will not die and the fire that will not be extinguished are understood by many to be the conscience of sinners, which tortures those who are in supplications. Therefore, due to their vice and sin, they are deprived of the good of the elect, in accordance with which it is said, “I was turned to misery, as thorns pierced me,” and in the Proverbs, “the worm of the bones is the envious heart.” … The Lord also says in the Gospel, “Depart into everlasting fire, which was prepared for the devil and his angels,” and in another place, “Bind his hands and feet, and cast him into outer darkness.” If we hear “hands” and “feet” and “outer darkness,” which is punishment for the eyes that are deprived of seeing the light of God, and “weeping,” which belongs to those very eyes, and “gnashing of teeth,” I marvel that this bronze body is to be dissolved gradually into an ethereal body, given that the Lord in the power of his majesty entered to the apostles when the door was closed. … The fire, like the worm, must also be understood to burn as long as it has material with which the voracious flame is fed. If, therefore, anyone has weeds in his conscience, which the enemy sowed while the head of the family was asleep, this fire will burn them up, and this conflagration devour them.
