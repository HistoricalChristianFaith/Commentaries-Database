(Verse 11.) And seventy men of the elders of the house of Israel, and Jezoniah the son of Saphan stood among them who were standing before the paintings, and each one had a censer in his hand, and the smoke of incense rose from the censers. When it says that seventy men of the elders of the house of Israel held censers in their hands, it shows that there were many other priests who did not do this, but perhaps were held back by other sins. And it mentions specifically that Jezoniah the son of Saphan stood among them, as if he were the chief of their wickedness and sacrilege, who, having abandoned the religion of God, worshipped idols, and in the temple, did not worship the God whose temple it was, but the paintings on the walls. And it is rightly said: Jezonias, son of Saphan, stood in the midst of the standing elders, as a symbol of his judgment and condemnation, because he, as well as those whom he was the leader of, stood firmly in their sins and did not waver in wickedness; rather, they persisted strongly. And the steam of incense, the fog of confusion, and the whirlwind that rose from the offering of sacrilege demonstrated this. This event happened at that time, according to the letter of the law. Furthermore, we must pray that the elders of the house of Israel, by multiplying the sacred number, which is seven, by seven decades, do not stand in their errors and worship the images of idols, and that the sacrilegious vapor does not rise up against God. When we see the worst people gathered, of whom it is written: 'I hate the assembly of evildoers' (Psalm 26:6); and worse than the people are their leaders, and the leader who is in charge of the people and the elders, let us say that Jezoniah stands before the images and each one holds a censer in their hands, worshiping not the majesty of God, but their own opinions, and not offering a pleasing fragrance to God, but a foul odor to idols.
