(Chapter XXX.â€”Verses 5 and 6) And Bala conceived and bore a son to Jacob: and Rachel said: The Lord judged me, and heard my voice, and gave me a son: therefore she called his name Dan. She expressed the reason for the name, that because the Lord had judged her, a son of the handmaid, she would give the name of judgment: Dan, indeed, is interpreted as judgment.
