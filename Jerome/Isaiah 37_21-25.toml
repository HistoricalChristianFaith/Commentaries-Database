Because Hezekiah prayed to the Lord so boldly and did not send for Isaiah, as he had done previously, the prophet did not visit him in person but sent messengers who spoke to him the words of God: “This is the sentence of the Lord on Sennacherib, against whom you prayed: the virgin of Zion and daughter of Jerusalem”—who is called virgin and daughter because, with all the other nations worshiping the idols of dead men, she alone preserved the purity of the religion of God and the worship of one divinity—“has mocked and despised you. And lest she provoke you to greater blasphemy, she did not respond in your presence, but wagged her head behind you, immune from vengeance, secure from punishment. She also said this: ‘It is not against me that you have rebelled but against the Lord. Nor did you do it yourself, but through your servants, that the arrogance of your blasphemy might be greater. For you said that with the multitude of your chariots you would ascend the heights of the mountains and the yokes of Lebanon, and that you would fell the highest of its cedars and firs.’ ” We should read this metaphorically as concerning all the Gentiles and their princes, or as concerning Jerusalem, which Lebanon represents, such that we would refer her cedars and firs to the rulers and aristocrats but the height of her summit and the forest of her Carmel to the temple. For he had said above: “Have you not heard what the kings of Assyria did to all the earth, destroying it? Therefore, neither can you be liberated.” And because he adds: “I dug a well and drank water and dried up with my footsteps all the rivers of Egypt,” it can be understood in accordance with history that all the streams ran dry before the multitude of the army, thus making it necessary to dig wells. This means that by means of his army he destroyed all the peoples, who are sometimes known under the name of “waters,” as only the Seventy translated: “And I made a bridge and I turned the desert into waters and all the congregations of the waters.” None of the nations were impassable to themselves, of course, but he trampled with his foot on all the waters of the people.

(v. 21 seqq.) However, Isaiah (also known as Josiah), the son of Amos, sent to Hezekiah saying: Thus says the Lord God of Israel: concerning what you asked me about Sennacherib, the king of Assyria, this is the word that the Lord spoke about him: He has despised you and mocked you, O virgin daughter of Zion. After you, the daughter of Jerusalem has shaken her head. Whom did you reproach and blaspheme? Against whom did you raise your voice and lift your eyes in pride, to the Holy One of Israel? You reproached the Lord in the hand of your servants and said: In the multitude of my chariots I have ascended (Al. I will ascend) the height of the mountains, the peaks of Lebanon, and I will cut down its lofty cedars, and its chosen fir trees, and I will enter the height of its summit, the Carmel of its cliff. I dug and drank water, and I dried up with the sole of my foot all the rivers of the banks. Because Hezekiah prayed to the Lord so boldly, and did not send to Isaiah, as he had sent before, the Prophet himself does not go to him, but sends messengers to him, who would say to him in the words of God: concerning Sennacherib, against whom you pray, this is the Lord's sentence: The virgin of Zion and the daughter of Jerusalem (who is called virgin and daughter because, while all the nations worship the idols of dead men, she alone preserves the purity of the religion of God and the worship of the one divinity) has derided you and despised you; and in order not to incite greater blasphemy against you, she did not respond immediately, but after you departed, she moved her head, certain of vengeance and secure in punishment. And she spoke these words: You have not sinned against me, but against the Lord; and it is not for your own sake, but for the sake of your servants, that the pride of the blasphemer becomes greater. For you have said that you would ascend to the heights of the mountains and the peaks of Mount Lebanon in your chariots, and cut down its tall cedars and its firs. This we can take either metaphorically of all nations and their rulers, or of Jerusalem, which is interpreted as Lebanon, so that its cedars and firs refer to the powerful and the nobles; but the height of its summit and the leap of Carmel refer to the Temple. For he had said above: Have you not heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all the lands that they have destroyed? Therefore, you will not be able to be saved. And what he infers: I dug and drank water, and I dried up with the sole of my foot all the streams of the ramparts, according to the story, this can be understood that, due to the multitude of the army, he has dried up all the rivers so that he is compelled to dig wells for himself. According to the translation: he has devastated all the peoples who are sometimes described by the names of waters with his own army. For whom alone they translated the Seventy, and I made the bridge (i.e. the powerful one, or the power), and I made the waters deserted, and all the congregation of waters: so that no nation might have any unpassable way for itself, but that it might trample the waters underfoot above all the peoples.
