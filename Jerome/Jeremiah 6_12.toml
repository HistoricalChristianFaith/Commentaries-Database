(Verse 12) Pour (or he pours) on the little one outside, and on the assembly of young men together: for a man will be captured with a woman, an elder with one full of days. And their houses will pass on to others, fields and wives alike. Perhaps the Prophet commands, by the Spirit coming to the Chaldeans, to pour out the fury of the Lord on the little ones, and not spare even the innocent age: or certainly, he narrates what happened to the assembly of young men together, who had taken up arms to resist. For when a man is captured with a wife, they together will feel the sweetest names of captivity: an old man with full days. Therefore, old age is not the final age, but of those who are full of days, whom we call in our language the deposited or the decrepit. It follows, And their houses will pass on to others, with the evil of captivity, along with fields and wives: so that the spouse passes over to the enemies and possession. Whatever we understand literally about Jerusalem, let us refer spiritually to the Church, if it has offended God.
