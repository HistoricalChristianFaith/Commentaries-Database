(Verse 19.) If you have faith as a grain of mustard seed, you shall say to this mountain: Remove from hence, and it shall remove: and nothing shall be impossible to you. Some people think that faith compared to a grain of mustard seed is small, because the kingdom of heaven is compared to a grain of mustard seed; when the apostle says: And if I shall have all faith, so that I could remove mountains (I Cor. XV, 2). Therefore, great is the faith that is compared to a grain of mustard seed. The translation of the mountain does not signify the one that we see with our physical eyes, but rather the one who has been transferred by the Lord from the lunatic. For when he says, 'You will say to this mountain, "Move from here to there," and it will move,' it is understood to refer to the devil. From this, those are shown to be foolish who argue that the apostles and all believers, did not even have a little faith, because none of them moved mountains. For the movement of a mountain from one place to another is not beneficial in itself, and seeking the vain display of miracles; but this mountain must be moved for the benefit of all, which is said by the prophet to corrupt all the earth (Zech. IV).
