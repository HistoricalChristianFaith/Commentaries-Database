Consequently he gave this order to the preachers of truth to whom he had said before: “Freely you have received, freely give.” If they truly declare that they do not receive payment, the possession of gold, silver and money is superfluous. For if they were to have gold and silver, it would seem they were preaching not for the sake of humanity’s salvation but for the sake of their own financial gain. “No copper in your belts.” One who cuts off riches nearly cuts off what is necessary for life. Thus as the apostles and teachers of true religion taught that all things were governed by providence, they show they are not concerned about what tomorrow will bring.
