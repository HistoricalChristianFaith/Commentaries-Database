(Verse 10.) And it was, he said, the head of his kingdom, Babel and Arach, and Achad, and Chalanne in the land of Sennaar. Nimrod, the son of Chus, first seized an unprecedented tyranny among the people, and he reigned in Babylon, which was named after him because the tower of the builders' confusion occurred there. For Babel means confusion. However, he also reigned in Arach, which is Edessa, and in Achad, which is now called Nisibis: and in Chalanne, which later, under a different name, was called Seleucia by King Seleucus, or certainly what is now called Ktesiphon.
