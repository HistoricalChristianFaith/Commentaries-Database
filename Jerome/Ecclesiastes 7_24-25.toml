"I have
proved all this by wisdom: I said, I will be wise; but it was far from me." "That
which is far off, and exceeding deep, who can find it out? "Just as is attested in the Book of Kings [Cfr. III Reg. 3. 4.]
he says that he sought wisdom more than other men, and tried to reach the
pinnacle, but the more he sought, the less he found, and in the midst of his
confusion, he was surrounded by the darkness if ignorance. But at another time, regarding him who was
learned in the Scriptures- the more he wanted to know, the more a greater
obscurity arose each day for him. 
Another meaning of this is: he seems to mean that contemplation of
wisdom in this life is like looking in a mirror or at a picture; therefore if I
look at my face in the mirror in the future I'll think back to the way it used
to be, and then in the liquid pool I'll recognise that I differ greatly from
the way I used to be.
