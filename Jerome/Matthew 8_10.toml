(Verse 10.) But when Jesus heard this, he marveled and said to those who followed him, 'Truly, I tell you, with no one in Israel have I found such faith. I tell you, many will come from east and west and recline at table with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven, while the sons of the kingdom will be thrown into the outer darkness. In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.'

Amen I say to you, I have not found such great faith in Israel. He speaks about the present, not about all the past patriarchs and prophets: unless perhaps the faith of the Gentiles is preferred over that of Israel.
