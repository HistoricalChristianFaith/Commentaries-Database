We are invited to flock to Christ's passion wheresoever in Scripture it is read of, that through it we may be able to come to God's word.

These things, therefore, shall not come to pass by any diminution of light, for in another place we read that the light of the sun shall be sevenfold; but by comparison with real light, all things shall seem dim.

By the powers of heaven, we understand the bands of the Angels.

Rightly does He say, the tribes of the earth, for they shall mourn who have no citizenship in heaven, but are written in earth. (Jer. 17:13.)
