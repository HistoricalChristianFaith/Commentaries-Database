(Verse 5) But they said to him: in Bethlehem of Judea. For thus it is written by the prophet: And you, Bethlehem, land of Judah, are by no means least among the leaders of Judah. For from you shall come forth a ruler, who will shepherd my people Israel. This is an error of the scribes. We think that it was first written by the evangelist, as we read in the Hebrew itself, 'of Judah,' not 'of Judea.' For what other Bethlehem of the nations is there, that it should be distinguished here as 'of Judea'? But it is called Judaea for this reason, because there is another Bethleem in Galilee. Read the book of Joshua the son of Nun (Joshua 19). Finally, even in the testimony itself, which is taken from the prophecy of Micah, it is written thus: And you, O Bethlehem, land of Judah (Micah 5:2).
