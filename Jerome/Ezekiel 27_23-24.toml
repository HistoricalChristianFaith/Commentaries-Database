(Verse 23, 24.) Aran, and Channe, and Eden, your traders were from Saba, Assur, Chelmad, your sellers: these traders of yours had various wrappings of hyacinth and precious gems, which were wrapped and tied with ropes. LXX: Charran, and Chana, and Edne, these were your traders: Sabba, Assur, and Chalman, your merchants, bringing merchandise + in Machalim, and in Galima ** hyacinth and + polymita ** precious treasures tied with ropes. And these are the names of the various places. The addition made by Theodotion to the Septuagint was interpreted by Symmachus as 'precious coverings' in Machalim and in Galima. We have also added Polymita, which Theodotion interpreted in various ways, by Aquila and Symmachus. These precious garments were carried by merchants in such valuable coverings that they were fastened with hyacinth ropes. Aran, or as the Septuagint says, Charran, means 'holes' in our language. Channe means 'preparation'. Eden means 'delights'. As for Edne, which is not found in the Hebrew, we do not know its meaning, and we should not seek the etymology of a fabricated name. Therefore, in the negotiation, the Tyrians rely on the fleshy senses that are indicated in the forums. The whole preparation of the people of the world is to believe that they are the only delights if they increase the commerce of the Tyrian city. We have mentioned about Sheba earlier. Assur, which means 'leading', is transferred to vineyards: undoubtedly, the Sodomites who come to the Tyrian market direct, even accuse with punishments, and correct what has been depraved, according to what is said in the Psalms: 'That you may destroy the enemy and the avenger' (Psalm 8:3). And they have a variety of household items, distinguished by an incredible variety, which are bound by hyacinth wrappings; whether their treasures are bound by ropes, which they have stored up for themselves on earth, according to what is written: Everyone is bound by the ropes of their own sins (Prov. 5:22). And they did not have free trade, but they bound everything to the chains of sin. Let us refer the hyacinth wrappings, because of their similarity in color, to the airy powers, which lavish their treasures in the markets of the world.


They also had cedar in your negotiations. The ships of the sea (or as it is contained in Hebrew, Tharsis), your princes in your negotiation. For cedar, the Seventy translated it as cypress. And because we have spoken above about both, it is superfluous to increase the reader's disgust.
