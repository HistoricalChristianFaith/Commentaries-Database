(Vers. 16 seqq.) Join me in blessing, and come out to me, and each one eat his own vineyard, and each one eat his own fig tree, and each one drink the water of his own cistern, until I come and take you to a land, which is like your own land: a land of wheat and wine, a land of bread and vineyards. Do not let Hezekiah disturb you, saying: The Lord will deliver us. Have the gods of the nations ever delivered each one his own land from the hand of the king of Assyria? This is what is read in the Book of Kings: 'Do with me what is beneficial, and come out to me' (2 Kings 18:31). Therefore, the meaning is the same. 'Do what is profitable for you,' he says, 'and may it contribute to your blessing.' Whether he is saying this: 'Bless the Assyrian king and praise him, and confess the Lord, so that you may obtain rewards, and until I return from Egypt, or when Lobna is captured, I will return. Dwell in your city and enjoy your possessions.' Later, however, I will come and lead you to a land that is similar to your land, with wheat, wine, and oil. It does not mention the name of the region, because it could not find an equivalent land promise: but it promises similarity. For each person desires what they were born into. Some think that the land of Media is promised to them, which had a similarity to the land of Judaea, both in location and in crops. And this is what he brings up.
