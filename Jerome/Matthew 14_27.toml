(Verse 27) Immediately Jesus spoke to them, saying: Have confidence, I am, do not be afraid. He takes care of what was first in the matter and commands those who fear, saying: Have confidence, do not be afraid. And what follows, I am, does not add who he is, either from a voice they could recognize, who spoke through the darkness of the obscure night, or they repeated that he himself is the one who spoke to Moses: Thus you shall say to the children of Israel: He who is, has sent me to you (Exod. III, 14).
