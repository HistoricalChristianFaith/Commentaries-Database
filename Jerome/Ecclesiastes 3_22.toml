"I
therefore observed that there is nothing better for man than to be happy in
what he is doing, for that is his lot. 
For who can enable him to see what will be after him? " Instead of that
which we have as "to see what will be after him", Symmachus
interprets it more clearly saying, "so that he sees those things which
will be after these ones". 
Therefore nothing is good in life, unless a man is happy in his work,
doing acts of sympathy<u>, and obtaining his future reward in the realm of
heaven. We have this one lot, which nor
neither thief nor robber values, nor any tyrant has the power to take away, and
which follows us after our death. And we
will not be able to enjoy our toil again when this life will be over, or know
what things will be afterwards in the world. 
Another explanation of this is: I am disturbed by the wickedness of what
I have said above, that I think there is no difference between men and beasts,
and I have been led into this opinion by wrong conclusions, so that I said
nothing else was good, except grasping ones present desire. Nor when death has destroyed us is it
possible to enjoy these things, which we, ungrateful, leave behind. Some have referred to that understanding
because it says, "for who leads him, so that he sees those things, which
will be after him", so that they say, "it is better for a man to
enjoy his work" because it is only this that he is able to take away with
him from his possessions. For when death
comes he will not know what kind of heir he will die with, whether worthy or
unworthy, who will enjoy his wealth.
