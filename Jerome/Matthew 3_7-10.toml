He intimates God's great power, who, as he made all things out of nothing, can make men out of the hardest stone.

These stones signify the Gentiles because of their hardness of heart. See Ezekiel, I will take away from you the heart of stone, and give you the heart of flesh. Stone is emblematic of hardness, flesh of softness.
