For we are not obliged to accept as parents those whose iniquities and sins now return to us, but only those from whose seed our bodies were born. Elsewhere, Moses, who had said that the sins of the parents shall return to the third and fourth generation of those who hate God, interpreted the verse that we are considering: “It is not on account of the sins of their parents that the children will die, but each one will die for his own sin,” with Ezekiel confirming the same interpretation, saying that one should never repeat the proverb, “the parents ate sour grapes and the teeth of their children suffered,” but that only the teeth of those who do the eating are affected, meaning that the sinful soul itself dies; it is not punished for sins that it did not commit. From this we understand that when every individual departs this life, he or she must accept the parents who were assigned to them, either for good or otherwise.

But Abraham was saved by the integrity of faith from the fire of the Chaldeans. Jeremiah agrees with this, speaking in the person of the Lord: “Like a hot spring in the desert, I found Israel with a deadly sword.” For … he said, All the world lay wounded by the deadly swords of idolatry. I found Israel in Abraham to have the heat of faith, like a medic after a war who senses that some among the bodies of the dead have a vital pulse and provides care for the wounded to restore their health. But what was written, ōs thermon, that is, “like a hot spring,” the Latin translator rendered “like a wolf,” deceived as he was by ambiguous words that cause errors also among the Greeks. Nevertheless, it should be noted that in Hebrew thoda, which means “grace,” is written in place of “heat.” Indeed, Israel shall be saved by the grace of God, not by its own works.
