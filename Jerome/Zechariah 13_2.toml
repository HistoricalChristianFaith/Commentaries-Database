(V2.) And it shall be in that day, says the Lord of hosts, I will destroy the names of the idols from the land, and they shall be remembered no more; and I will also remove the false prophets and the unclean spirit from the land. LXX: And it shall be in that day, says the Lord of hosts, I will destroy the names of the idols from the land, and their memory shall no longer exist; and the false prophets and the unclean spirit I will remove from the land. On that day that is frequently mentioned, all idols will be removed from the land, including those idols of which the Psalmist says: The idols of the nations are silver and gold, the work of human hands (Ps. 115:4), so that there may be no other religion except the name of the Christians, and concerning which it is written in the prophet: Wail, you sculptures, in Jerusalem and in Samaria. For as I have done to Samaria and its idols, so I will do to Jerusalem and its idols (Jer. XXX). Whether these idols, of which the Apostle speaks: Now the Spirit manifestly saith: That in the last times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to spirits of error and doctrines of devils, Speaking lies in hypocrisy and having their conscience seared (into idolatry) (I Tim. IV, 1, 2). For just as idols are made by the hand of the craftsman, so the perverse doctrine of heretics, whatever it may simulate, turns into an idol and causes Antichrist to be adored in place of Christ. For pseudo-prophets, in Hebrew the prophets are absolutely called prophets, that is, Nebim, which also means pseudo-prophets; but nevertheless even the priests of idols among the Gentiles are called prophets.
