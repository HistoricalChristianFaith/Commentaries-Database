(Verse 22) And I will turn my face away from them: and they will violate my sanctuary: and emissaries will enter it (as the Septuagint rashly translated, or as Symmachus and Theodotio, bursting in, and pestilential), and they will defile it. For, he says, because of the previous abominations of the people, I will turn my face away from them and I will not judge them worthy in my eyes: then they will violate my sanctuary, which signifies the Holy of Holies, for which the Septuagint translated visitation (to demonstrate the presence of God in holy places) and the impious and pestilent ones of the earth will burst in: which, except for the priests and the high priest alone, no one else dared to enter. What we know, both from the Babylonians, and from King Antiochus and Gnaeus Pompeius, and finally from what happened under Vespasian and Titus, when the temple was captured and destroyed, and all the things that the following prophet's speech encompasses. God also turns His face away from our evil deeds: and because His face is turned away, the secret of God is violated, so that the pestilential may enter for the priests and saints of God, and contaminate everything: so that the place that should have been holy becomes a place of uncleanness, according to the Gospel saying: 'My Father's house shall be called a house of prayer: but you have made it a den of thieves' (Matthew 21:13).
