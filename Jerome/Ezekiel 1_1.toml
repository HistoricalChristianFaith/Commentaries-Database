[Daniel 10:4] "And in the twenty-fourth day of the first month, I was beside the great river which is the Tigris." Ezekiel also had seen a great vision beside a river, the Chebar (Ezekiel 1:1). And it was by the stream of the Jordan that the heavens were opened to the gaze of our Lord and Savior and also to John the Baptist (Matthew 3:1-17). Therefore those critics should leave off their foolish objections who raise questions about the presence of shadows and symbols in a matter of historical truth and attempt to destroy the truth itself by imagining that they should employ allegorical methods to destroy the historicity of rivers and trees and of Paradise.

The Prophet Ezekiel was led captive with Joachin king of Judah to Babylon, and he prophesied there to those who were captives with him, to those repenting that they had willingly handed over the prophecy of Jeremiah to enemies, and yet saw the city Jerusalem to stand, which he had predicted would fall. And in his thirtieth year of age, and in the fifth year of the captivity, he began to speak to his fellow captives. And at the same time, though later, this one in Chaldea and Jeremiah in Judea prophesied. His style is neither greatly eloquent nor excessively rustic, but properly proportioned between both. And he was a priest, as also was Jeremiah, the beginning and ending of the book being wrapped in great obscurities. But also the common edition of him does not differ much from the Hebrew one. Because of that I greatly wonder what was the cause, that when we have the same translators in all the books, in some they translated the same things, in others, different things. Therefore, read this also according to our translation because, by being written in words with spaces, it gives a clearer meaning to readers. And if my friends also mock this, say to them that no one restrains them from writing. But I do not respect him who follows them, which is more clearly said in Greek, as they are called insult-swallowers (φαγολοιδοροι).

Truly our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ is prefigured, who came to baptism at the age of thirty years, which in a man is the perfect age.

You must understand that the heavens were opened not by the firmament being divided but by the faith of the believer, for the one to whom these things are heavenly is the one to whom mysteries are disclosed. At the baptism of the Savior, when the Holy Spirit descended on him in the form of a dove, we read that “the heavens were opened.”

(Chapter 1, Verse 1) And it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the fourth month, on the fifth day of the month. The thirtieth year is not, as many think, the age of the prophet, nor the Year of Jubilee, which is the year of remission; but from the twelfth year of King Josiah of Judah, when the book of Deuteronomy was found in the temple of God, until the fifth year of the captivity of Joachin, also known as Jeconiah, when he was led with his mother to Babylon, along with Daniel and the three young men, and Ezekiel (who was among the first captives of the tribe of Judah) when the wrath of God was poured out on Jerusalem (2 Kings 22; 2 Chronicles 34; 2 Kings 24). But according to the mystical interpretation, the Lord and Savior is prefigured, who came to baptism at the age of thirty (Luke 3), which is the age of perfection in man. Therefore, in the book of Numbers, according to the Hebrews and not as contained in the Septuagint, the priests begin to minister in the tabernacle at the age of thirty and not at the age of twenty-five (Numbers 4). In this sign, Joseph also preceded when he distributed grain to the hungry people in Egypt (Genesis 41), and John the Baptist came to the banks of the Jordan and preached the baptism of repentance (Luke 3). And what is written, in the fourth, the sentence is pending, it is understood in the month. For immediately it follows, in the fifth month. And to make it more clear, they added Seventy before.
