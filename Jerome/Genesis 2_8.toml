(Verse 8.) And the Lord God planted a garden in Eden, in the east. Instead of paradise, in Hebrew it has the word 'hortum' which means garden. And Eden is translated as 'deliciae'. Symmachus translated it as a flourishing paradise. Also, what follows, 'in the east', in Hebrew it is written as 'Mecedem', which Aquila translated as 'ἀπὸ ἀρχῆς', and we can say 'from the beginning'. Symmachus, however, uses 'ἐκ πρώτης', and Theodotion uses 'ἐν πρώτοις', which also signifies not the east, but the beginning. From this it is most clearly shown that before God made heaven and earth, He had already established paradise, as it is read in Hebrew: But the Lord God had planted a paradise in Eden from the beginning.
