91 (Ver. 17.) And he said to me: Surely you have seen, O son of man: Is it a light thing to the house of Judah, that they commit the abominations which they have committed here, because they have filled the land with wickedness and turned to provoke me? And behold, they put the branch to their nose. For we have said: And behold, they put the branch to their nose, the LXX translated: and behold, they are like mockers, to whom Theodotion added: They stretch out the branch; so that it is all together: And behold, they stretch out the branch as if mocking. About this, Symmachus interprets it as if they emit a sound like a song through their nostrils. However, it signifies twenty-five men who are positioned firmly in a square formation and, through their five senses, create a square shape. They not only have a temple behind them, but they also attach a branch to their nostrils, resembling idols. Undoubtedly, this signifies that they worship idols, which in Greek are called βαΐα. Finally, Job says among the other virtues that he has also had this, that he has never looked at the sky and the sun, and the moon, and the shining stars, and kissed his hand (Job. XXXI), that is, worshipped creatures. However, Symmachus' interpretation means a foul and hoarse sound coming from the nostrils in contempt of God. And all heretics, who have filled the earth with injustice, and turned to the knowledge of false names, in order to provoke the Lord to anger, are to be regarded: when they wanted to praise God, they would blaspheme with an ugly sound, or consider the God of the Old Testament of little importance, mock, and despise Him.
