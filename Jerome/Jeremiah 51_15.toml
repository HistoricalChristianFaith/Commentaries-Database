“His lightnings illumine the world,” Jeremiah says. “The Lord who established the world by his wisdom and brings up clouds from the end of the earth; he makes the lightning flash in the rain.” “His lightnings illumine the world.” The philosophers, who are always discoursing on the nature of things, say that unless the winds cause a collision among the clouds, fire cannot escape from them; but when they have been aroused to a kind of rivalry in thundering, lightning flashes forth. We can observe a similar phenomenon in producing fire from stones. We have called attention to this to note more easily a similar marvel in the mystery of the Savior. We have our clouds, prophets and apostles, as another psalm says: “Your truth, to the clouds.” If to the clouds of this sky he transmits his truth, what does the prophet mean in still another psalm when he says, “Truth shall spring out of the earth”? Now, “your truth, to the clouds” is certainly a figure of the prophets and the apostles.
