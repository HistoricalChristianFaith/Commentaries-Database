Two are stretched out and lift themselves up on high and signify heavenly preaching, in everything that pertains to the majesty of God. Two cover their bodies, for human knowledge is excluded, and perfect consideration is not offered.

(Verse 11) And their faces and wings were stretched out from above, with two wings of each joined together and two covering their bodies. And above we have said that the Gospels and the seasons are joined together, and all rational creatures, and the four virtues, so that whoever lacks one lacks all. And that the two are stretched out and rise up high signifies heavenly preaching and all things tending towards the majesty of God. But two things hinder the knowledge of bodies: human knowledge is excluded, and perfect intuition is not provided, as the Apostle says: For we know in part, and we prophesy in part. But when that which is perfect has come, then that which is in part will be done away with (1 Cor. 13:9).
