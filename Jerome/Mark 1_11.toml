Again, the Holy Spirit camedown in the shape of a dove, because in the Canticles it is sung of the Church: "My bride, my love, my beloved, my dove. ”Bride” in the Patriarchs, “love” in the Prophets, “near of kin” in Joseph and Mary, “beloved” in John the Baptist, "dove” in Christ and His Apostles: to whom it is said, “Be ye wise as serpents, and harmless as doves.” .
Morally also it may be interpreted; we also, drawn aside from the fleeting world by the smell and purity of flowers, run with the young maidens after the bridegroom, and are washed in the sacrament of baptism, from the two fountains of the love of God, and of our neighbour, by the grace of remission, and mounting up by hope gaze upon heavenly mysteries with the eyes of a clean heart. Then we receive in a contrite and lowly spirit, with simplicity of heart, the Holy Spirit, who comes down to the meek, and abides in us, by the never-failing charity. And the voice of the Lord from heaven is directed to us the beloved of God; “Blessed are the peacemakers, forthey shall be called the sons of God;” and then the Father, with the Son and the Holy Spirit, is well-pleased with us, when we are made one spirit with God.
