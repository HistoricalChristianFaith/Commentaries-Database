(Verse 13.) This is the word that the Lord spoke to Moab from that time. From when do you think? Obviously from the time that Moab was created. And the Lord says: The Moabites and Ammonites shall not enter into the Church of God (Deut. XXIII, 3). Whether we understand it from that time as referring to ancient times, which long ago this divine sentence was decreed, not that the foreknowledge of God brought about the cause of the devastation; but that the future devastation was foreknown to the majesty of God.
