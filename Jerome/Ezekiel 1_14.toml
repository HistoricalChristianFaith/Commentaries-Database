Whatever creature we will have looked at makes the knowledge of God shine forth, while the Creator recognizes it from his creatures. And from the midst of the animals splendor and fire and light go forth. For if the Gospels are at variance in themselves, you will find in the midst of their writings and worthy narratives the mysteries of the Holy Spirit.
