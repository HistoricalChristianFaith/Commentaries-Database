This cornerstone joins together both walls and restores two peoples to unity, concerning which God said through Isaiah: “Behold, I will lay a cornerstone in Zion as its foundation, elect and precious; the one who believes in it will not be ashamed.” It was his will to build further upon this cornerstone and other cornerstones, so that the apostle Paul would be able to say boldly, “built upon the foundation of the apostles and the prophets, with Jesus Christ himself being the chief cornerstone.”

Peter also spoke confidently about this stone of assistance: “This is the stone rejected by you builders, which was made the cornerstone.” And Isaiah said, “Behold, I will lay a cornerstone in Zion as its foundation, elect and precious; the one who believes in it will not be ashamed.”“Therefore I say to you that the kingdom of God will be taken from you and given to the people who produce its fruit.” As I have said, the kingdom of God is often to be understood as sacred Scripture, which the Lord removed from the Jews and gave to us that we might produce its fruits. This is the vineyard that was given to the tenant farmers and vinedressers who did no work in it; possessing the Scriptures in name only, they will lose the fruits of the vineyard.
“Whoever falls on this stone will be broken, but the one upon whom it falls will be destroyed.” It is one thing to offend Christ through evil deeds but another thing to deny him. The sinner who nevertheless still believes in him is the one who falls on the stone and is broken but not altogether destroyed, for he is preserved for salvation through patience. But the one upon whom it falls, that is, the one upon whom the stone itself rushes, is the one who denies Christ inwardly. He is destroyed so completely that not even a shard with which to draw a little water will remain.
