If we want to regard the prince of Tyre having the same power as that public provincial authority that is entrusted him by God, let us look at the testimony: “I say, ‘You are gods, sons of the Most High, all of you; nevertheless, you shall die like mortals, and fall like any prince.’ ” For the provinces were handed over to them to be ruled, as judges, by the emperor; they besmeared his honor, as was recently the case with Heraclinus in Africa; they have been puffed up with the mind of a tyrant against the King and their Lord, so that, dispersed throughout the world, they assume for themselves the name of gods, gods that are really called idols and inflated with pride. They fall under the judgment of the devil, into the snare of which the Savior speaks in the Gospel, “I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven.”
