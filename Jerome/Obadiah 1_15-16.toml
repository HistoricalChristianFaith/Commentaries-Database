(Verse 15, 16.) For the day of the Lord is near upon all nations: as thou hast done, so shall it be done unto thee: thy reward shall return upon thine own head. For as ye have drunk upon my holy mountain, so shall all the nations drink continually, yea, they shall drink, and they shall swallow down, and they shall be as though they had not been. LXX: For the day of the Lord is near upon all nations: as thou hast done, it shall be done unto thee: thy reward shall return upon thine own head. For as ye have drunk upon my holy mountain, all the nations shall drink wine continually: they shall drink, and they shall swallow down, and they shall be as though they had not been. But you, O Idumea, will cease to do these things because the vengeance of the Lord will come upon you. For if, according to Jeremiah, they who were not deserving of judgment drank from the cup, you, though innocent, will not be left innocent, but you will drink. Furthermore, what he says, 'The day of the Lord is near against all nations,' let us read the same in Jeremiah, and we will see the cup of the Lord being passed to all nations. Where it is said in the same: The golden cup Babylon in the hand of the Lord making all nations drunk. Indeed, the Assyrians and Babylonians held all the nations as far as the Propontis, the Scythian Sea, and the Ionian or Aegean Sea. Let us read Herodotus, and Greek and barbarian histories, and we shall see how this which is said, 'The day of the Lord is near upon all nations,' was fulfilled among the Babylonians and Assyrians. But what follows, 'As you have done, it shall be done to you; your recompense shall return upon your own head,' has the same meaning as we read in the Psalm: 'Remember, O Lord, the sons of Edom in the day of Jerusalem, when they said, 'Lay it bare, lay it bare, down to its foundations!' (Psalm 137:7 et seqq.)' Therefore, the prophet curses Babylon by saying: 'Daughter of Babylon, miserable one! Blessed is he who will repay you according to your deeds, which you have done to us. Blessed is he who seizes and dashes your little ones against a rock. Just as you have drunk with the Babylonians on my holy mountain, Zion, and rejoiced, so all the nations that the Babylonians had as allies will turn against you and drink, and they will rejoice.' Not only will they drink your blood, but they will suck you in so much that the Edomites will be as if they were not: or at least the same nations, when they will have sucked you in, will be sucked in by the Medes, and this revenge will proceed in a circle, so that you, Israel, the Babylonian, will consume Babylon, the Medes, and the Persians. Let us follow the order of interpretation. The day of the Lord is near, O heretic, over all nations: the time of judgment is near when all nations will be judged. Just as you have done against the church, your pain will turn against you, and your wickedness will descend upon your head. For how you have rejoiced in their death, and celebrated a feast, and on my holy mountain, that is, the Church, you have drunk not from my cup, but from the devil's: of whom it is said in Habakkuk, 'Woe to him who gives drink to his neighbor, pouring it from the wineskin till they are drunk' (Habakkuk 2:15): so too, all the nations, or opposing powers subjected to punishment, or every opposing virtue, will drink and consume your blood, and in the end, when torment comes upon all, they themselves will be as if they do not exist. For he who perishes, is counted as not being, and he who said to Moses: I am who am sent me to you (Exod. III, 14), according to the rule of the Scriptures, is said not to be. Hence, we also read in Esther: Do not give, O Lord, your kingdom to those who are not (Esth. XIV, 11). We can interpret this passage differently: Because you have rejoiced in the ruin of my servants, the same persecution will come against you also, and you will suffer for whatever you have done. And just as you rejoiced against my people with the rest of the nations, so all nations will rejoice against you, and they will devour and drink, and crush with a similar persecution.
