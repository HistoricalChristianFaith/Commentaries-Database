(Verse 2, 3.) And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: Son of man, speak to the elders of Israel, and say to them: Thus says the Lord God: Have you come to inquire of me? As I live, I will not answer you, says the Lord God. To the righteous and worthy who ask, a promise is given. As you continue to speak, I will say: Here I am. But to the sinners, like the elders of Israel, whose crimes are described by the prophets that follow, there is no answer; only rebuke for their sins. And an oath is added: As I live, the sentence of denial is made stronger. But as for what the LXX said, if I were to respond to you, Symmachus translated it more clearly, I will not respond to you.
