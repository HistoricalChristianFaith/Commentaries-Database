"A lover
of money will never be satisfied with money; a lover of abundance has no
wheat. This too, is futility! As goods increase, so do those who consume
them; what advantage, then, has the owner except what hi eyes see?" Wherever we read 'silver', according to the ambiguity
of the Greek term, it can be translated as 'money', since each has the meaning
of the Greek "argurion. "More precisely Tullius is said to have
called these men 'pecuniary', who have many small savings, that is wealth in
cattle. [(because the Latin for cattle is pecus)] For they were called this in antiquity. But little by little the word devolved into
the one used here through misuse. 
Therefore he is described as greedy because he is never sated by wealth,
and the more he has, the more he desires. 
Horace also agrees with this sentiment, who says, "always the miser
is wanting" [Horat. Epist. I. 2, 56.],
and too the noble historian, since "avarice is diminished neither by
possessions, nor by lack of them" [Sallust Catil. 11, 3.]. Nothing therefore, says Ecclesiastes can aid
a man who possesses riches, unless only this: that he sees what he
possesses. For the greater his wealth,
the more he will have a larger number of servants, who use up his amassed
wealth. But if he will only see what he
has, he will be able to take more than the food of one man.
