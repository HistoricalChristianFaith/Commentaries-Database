"I
applied my mind to seek and probe by wisdom all that happens beneath the sky -
it is a sorry task that God has given to the sons of man with which to be
concerned." Aquila, the Septuagint, and Theodotion have
all translated the Hebrew word "anian "similarly
as "peristasmon", which the interpreter
expressed as "occupied" in Latin [Hier.. "in distentionem".],
because the mind of man is torn asunder when occupied by several
anxieties. But Symmachus uses the Greek
word "ascholian", which means business [Hier.. "occupationem".]. Since therefore in this book it is more often
called either "occupationem", or "distentionem", or whatever else we have
called it, they all refer to the higher senses.  Ecclesiastes therefore set his mind first of
all to the acquisition of wisdom, and pursuing this beyond what is allowed,
wanted to know the causes and reasoning why children are easily snatched by the
Devil; why the righteous and the wicked are equally punished in shipwrecks; and
whether these events happen as a result of fate, or by the decree of God. And if by fate, where is providence? If by
decree, where is God's justice? With
such desire to know these things, he said, I understand the great care and
torturing anxiety experienced in many things, which was given to man by God, in
order that he might desire to know that which he is not allowed to know. But the cause is inborn first, and God then
gives vexation. For it is written
similarly in the epistles to the Romans: ""On account of what did God give them up to the suffering of dishonour?""
 [Rom. 1, 6.]
then again he says: ""On account of
what did He give them up to uncleanness, so that they did what was not allowed"". [Rom. 1, 28.] And then: ""On account of which God gave them up to desire for their uncleanness"". [Rom. 1, 24.] And to the Thessalonians: ""And for this cause God will send them strong
delusion.""  [II Thess. 2, 10.] But the causes why they succumb were revealed
earlier: either by the suffering of dishonour, or by vile affections, or by the
longing in their heart, or whatever it is they do to receive strong
delusion. In this way and because of
their effectiveness God gave this wicked 'occupation' to man, with which to be
concerned, because he did these things first voluntarily and entirely of his
own will.
