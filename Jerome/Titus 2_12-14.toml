For the grace of God our Savior hath appeared to all men, instructing us, that denying ungodliness and worldly desires, we should live soberly, and justly, and godly in this world, looking for the blessed hope and coming of the glory of the great God and our Savior Jesus Christ, who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and might cleanse to himself a people acceptable, a pursuer of good works. After enumerating what he should teach to Titus - the old men, and old women, and young women and young men, and, lastly, servants, he now accurately declares. For the grace of God our Savior hath appeared to all men. For there is no difference between free and slave, Greek and barbarian, circumcised and uncircumcised, woman and man: but we are all one in Christ, we are all called to the kingdom of God, we are all reconciled to our Father after the offense; not by our merits, but by the grace of the Savior: whether it be that the living and subsisting grace of God the Father himself is Christ or that this is the grace of Christ the God and Savior, and that we are saved not by our own merit, according to what is said in another place: You will save them for nothing (Ps. 55: 8). This grace has shone upon all men in order to instruct us to renounce impiety and worldly desires and to live chastely, justly, and piously in this world. However, to deny impiety and worldly desires, as we have explained above, they confess to knowing God, but deny it by their deeds. I believe that this can be understood through opposing arguments. Therefore, worldly desires are those that are suggested by the prince of this world, and since they belong to this world, they pass through it like a cloud. But we, living in Christ in a chaste and just manner, not only avoid sin with our body and mind, but also live piously in this world. This piety expects a blessed hope and the advent of the glory of the great God, and of our Savior Jesus Christ. Just as impiety fears the advent of the great God, so does piety confidently await it, secure in its works and faith. Where is the snake Arius? Where is the serpent Eunomius? The great God Jesus Christ, is called Savior, not the firstborn of every creature, not the Word of God and wisdom; but Jesus Christ: which words are of a human assumed. Nor indeed do we speak of one Jesus Christ and another Word, as a new heresy calumniates: but the same both before ages, and after ages, and before the world, and after Mary: nay, from Mary, we call Him Jesus Christ, our great God and Savior, who gave Himself for us, that He might redeem us from all iniquity, and might cleanse for Himself a people pleasing (for so it is held in Greek), and might make us zealous of good works. Often considering with myself what the word "pleasing" might mean, and asking of the wise of this world if they had perchance read it anywhere, I have never been able to find anyone who could tell me what it signified. Therefore, compelled, I have returned to the old testament, from which I thought that even the Apostle had taken what he had said; for, as a Hebrew among Hebrews, and as a Pharisee according to the law, he certainly placed in his letter what he knew he had read in the old testament. So in Deuteronomy I found this: "For you are a holy people to the Lord your God, and the Lord your God chose you to be his own possession out of all the nations on the face of the earth." (Deut. 7:6) And in the 134th Psalm, where we have, "Praise his name, for it is pleasant, for the Lord has chosen Jacob for himself; he has chosen Israel as his own possession" (Ps. 134:3-4): the words "his own possession" are in the Greek text εἰς περιουσιασμὸν, which Aquila and the fifth edition translate as "his own possession," while the Septuagint and Theodotion translate ἐξουσίασμα as "possession," changing only the syllable, not the sense. Symmachus therefore, for what is in Greek περιούσιον, in Hebrew, Sgolla, expressed ἐξαίρετον, that is, excellent or outstanding: for which word in another Latin book, he interpreted it as 'peculiar'. Therefore Jesus Christ, our great God and Savior, rightfully redeemed us with His Blood, so that He would make us a peculiar Christian people to Himself, which could then be peculiar if they were to exist as emulators of good works. Hence that which is written in the Latin Gospel, Give us this day our daily bread (Matt. 6:11), is better expressed in Greek asἐπιούσιον bread, that is, excellent, outstanding, and peculiar, which indeed descending from heaven, says, I am the bread which came down from heaven (John 6:41). For it is inappropriate that we who are forbidden to think about tomorrow, should be commanded to pray to the Lord about that bread which is to be slightly prepared and thrown away. There is little difference between "ἐπιούσιον" and "περιούσιον"; for only the preposition is changed, not the word. Indeed, some think that in the Lord's Prayer, "ἐπιούσιον" means bread that is above all substances, that is, above all material things. And if this meaning is adopted, it does not differ greatly from the sense we have explained. For whatever is outstanding and exceptional, is outside everything and above everything.
