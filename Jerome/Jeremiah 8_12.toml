(Verse 12.) They were confused because they committed abominations. However, they were not confused by their confusion, and they did not blush. Questioningly, is this to be read, so that the meaning would be: Did they blush at their crimes and understand the abominations they had committed? By no means, but they burst forth into such madness that they neither desired to correct their vices through confusion, nor to confess their crimes in the hope of forgiveness.

They will fall among the fallen (or rushing), at the time of their visitation they will fall, says the Lord. These are the rewards of those who have not known how to be ashamed: whose dignity was higher than the peoples, they will be mixed with the ruins of the people. From the least to the greatest, everyone goes after falsehood, from prophet to priest, all practice deceit: but the time of visitation is coming, a near captivity.
