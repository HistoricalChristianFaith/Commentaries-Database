"I
realised that whatever God does will endure forever: nothing can be added to it
and nothing taken away, and God has acted so that man should fear Him. "There is nothing in the world that is
new. The course of the sun and moon in
turn and the dryness and verdure of the earth and trees are born and take shape
with the world itself. And therefore God
governed all things by a defined plan and commanded the elements to be at the
disposal of man, for his use, so that when men see these things they know that
there is providence and fear the appearance of God; while from the equality of
the world, the natural season, order, and constancy they understand their
creator. "For his invisible work in
the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things
which are made, even his eternal virtue and power" [Rom. 1, 20.]. If we want we can read this as if from the
beginning, with the meaning of the first part already understood: "and God
has acted so that man should fear Him" then this is the meaning: God made
all these things, so that men fear him, and reject for another what God once
created for man. But he governed
perfectly, saying: "so that they should fear his appearance". [Ps. 33, 17.] The image of the Lord, indeed, is powerful
over those who are wicked.
