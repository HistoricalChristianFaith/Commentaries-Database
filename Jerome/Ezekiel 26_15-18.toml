(Verse 15 and following) Thus says the Lord God to Tyre: Shall not the rumble of your downfall, and the groaning of your slain, when they are killed in your midst, shake the islands? And all the princes of the sea will come down from their thrones, and they will take off their robes and cast aside their embroidered garments; they will put on sackcloth and sit on the ground, and they will tremble with horror at you. They will raise a lament over you and say to you: How you have perished, you renowned city, you were mighty in the sea with your inhabitants, who were feared by all. Now the ships will be astonished on the day of your terror, and the islands in the sea will be troubled, because no one will go out from you. LXX: For thus says the Lord God, Sister. Will not your wounded ones groan at the sound of your downfall, when the sword is drawn in your midst? The islands will shake, and all the princes of the sea will come down from their thrones, and they will take off their crowns, and they will be stripped of their various garments. They will go insane with fury: they will sit on the ground, and they will fear their own destruction, and they will groan over you, and they will take up a lamentation for you, and they will say to you: How you have perished and been scattered in the sea, praised city, which was strong in the sea itself, and its inhabitants, who each gave their fear to all its inhabitants? And the islands will fear on the day of your downfall, and the islands will be troubled in the sea at your departure. First, let us unfold the words of the story itself, briefly opening the meaning of the statements. Thus says the Lord God to Tyre, which is called Sor in Hebrew: Will the islands not be moved on the day of your downfall, when Nebuchadnezzar attacks and you fall, and amid the groaning of the wounded or killed in your midst? And all the kings will descend from their seats or thrones, and the princes of the sea who govern various islands will take off their crowns from their heads, laying aside all the glory of ruling and their most precious garments shining with incredible variety, they will cast them away, and in the greatness of their astonishment they will turn into madness, and being humiliated, they will sit on the ground, and when they see you have fallen, they will fear the same fate for themselves; and they will consider nothing to be everlasting in the goods of the earth; but on the contrary, they will take up a mournful lament and sing a sorrowful song, saying: How you have perished, you who lived (or were praised) in the sea, illustrious city? For we read in the Greek, Latin, and Barbarian histories that Tyre was indeed an island, and that it had no entrance from the land. But later, according to some, it was thrown up with mounds by Nebuchadnezzar, the king of the Chaldeans, or as others affirm, by Alexander, the king of the Macedonians, and a place was prepared for its siege with machines and battering-rams, and the island became a peninsula. Therefore, oh Tyre, oh Sor, who once were the strongest of all islands, praised in the voices of all cities with your inhabitants, whom everyone feared, how suddenly have you fallen? Now the islands will be astonished, or will be afraid over you, and as it is better understood in Hebrew, the ships, on the day of your terror and ruin, and the islands will be troubled in the sea. From this it follows that it is advisable to read the lines above the ships, so that the islands are not placed in a second position; because no one will go out from you, or, as the Seventy translated, on the day of your departure: when you are led captive. These, in the meantime, may be considered as the foundations of a certain story: now let us strive to raise the spiritual pinnacle. Imagine someone, who for a long time preserved their modesty, flourished with many virtues, and then collapsed in some grave and mortal sin: will not all the islands be moved by the sound of their ruin and the destruction of their virtues? Indeed, those who are tossed by the salty and bitter waves of this world. And those who appeared as princes in the filth of this age will descend from their thrones of pride and, humbled, will remove the crowns from their heads, which seemed to possess good works, and they will cast off their various garments of virtue and be cloaked in astonishment or a kind of fear. They will sit on the ground and, astonished by their sudden fall, they will marvel. So much so that all will take up lamentation and mourning over the one who has fallen, and they will say: How have you perished, who were once saved? How you have fallen, you who once stood so tall, who were considered illustrious among all in the sea of this world, who were thought to be strong by everyone. And your inhabitants, that is, the most courageous thoughts, resisting all the fiery arrows of the devil, which were previously feared by all adversaries, have turned to astonishment. But even the ships, all the saints who cross the waves of this world, will be astonished when they see you fall. On the day of your terror and destruction, the islands will be troubled, lest they themselves suffer the same. For the ruins of others serve as examples for the righteous, as we all abide in this weak and feeble state, constantly wavering in this world, and victory is never certain and secure for us: for those who once stood will depart from you; or at your departure; at your end and completion. For we are judged not by the past, but by the present. And care must be taken, and always feared, that it may overthrow ancient glory and solid stability, the storms of a single hour.
