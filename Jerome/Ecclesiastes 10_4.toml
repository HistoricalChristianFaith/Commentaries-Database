We also read in Ecclesiastes, “If the spirit of him that has power, ascend upon your heart, leave not your place.” From this it is clearly evident that we have committed a sin if we surrender our place to him who ascends upon us and if we have not cast down headlong the enemy ascending upon the walls. However, it seems to me that when you call down upon the heads of your brothers, that is to say, upon your slanderers, eternal fires with the devil, you are not so much dashing your brothers to the ground as you are elevating the devil, since he is to be punished in the same fires as Christians.

"If the
anger of a ruler flares up against you, do not leave your place, for defence
appeases great offences. "Now the Scripture mentions the chief of that
world, the creator of the darkness and he who toils for the sons of despair,
whom the apostle also recalls. [Cfr. Eph. 2, 2; 6, 12.] For if he rises in our heart and the spirit
of bad thoughts is wounded, we ought not to give way, but fight against the
worst thoughts and free ourselves from the greatest sins, so that we do not
fill our work with that thought, since it is one thing in thought, another in
the deed of sinning. Reference to this
great sin can also be found in the Psalm: "if they had not conquered me, I
would be clean and purified from the greatest crime" [Ps. 18, 4.]. Symmachus translates the Hebrew word "marphe "as all the others do: "iama", that is, 'cleanliness' or
'neatness'. He has interpreted the
meaning too, and he says, "if the spirit of a ruler defeats you, do not
move from your place; since virtue wins over the greatest sin". That is, if the devil entices your mind and
incites you to lust, do not follow the thought of sin and flattering desire,
but stand firm and fast and extinguish the flame of desire with the cold of
chastity. My Hebrew tutor suspected
certain things about this passage for a reason I do not know. If you take any high-up position in the
world, or are appointed a post higher than the other people, do not let go of
your former works and start to forget your former virtues, or cease from your
previous work, because the cure for sins is born out of doing good things, and
not from pompous and overflowing rank.
