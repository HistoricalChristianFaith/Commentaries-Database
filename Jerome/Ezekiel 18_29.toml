(Verse 29.) And the children of Israel say: The way of the Lord is not fair. Are not my ways fair, O house of Israel, and are not your ways crooked? Even today Israel blasphemes God, for abandoning his people and taking in a multitude of nations. Whom the Lord reproves because their ways are crooked, he exercises his rightful judgment by sending other farmers to his vineyard after the previous ones were lost. Which, understanding in the parable of the Gospel, the Jews said: This will not be (Luke 20:16).
