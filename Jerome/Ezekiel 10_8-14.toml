(Versed 8 and following) And I saw, and behold, there were four wheels beside the Cherubim. One wheel beside one Cherub, and another wheel beside another Cherub. The appearance of the wheels was like the gleam of a chrysolite stone, and they all had the same likeness, like a wheel within a wheel. When they moved, they went in the four directions without turning as they went. And the wheels went toward the place where the first wheel went, and they followed in its tracks and did not turn back. And all their bodies, and necks, and hands, and wings, and circles, were full of eyes all around the four wheels. And these wheels he called voluble, as I heard. But it had four faces. One face, the face of a Cherub; and the second face, the face of a man; and in the third, the face of a lion; and in the fourth, the face of an eagle. And the Cherubim were elevated. Notice what was before, or how many species of wheels, according to the Septuagint, like the appearance of a beryl: but now, according to the same, like the appearance of a carbuncle; so that the likeness of wings being moved by fire, which is attributed to the Cherub, may be shown: although in Hebrew, both above and here, it is written 'beryl,' which the Eagle translated as 'chrysolite' and Symmachus as 'hyacinth.' And again, when we turn to them: And the whole body of them, which is understood to be of the wheels, is written in Hebrew: And all their flesh, and necks, and hands, and feathers, and circles. Note that flesh is called in heavenly powers, as when we read: Flesh and blood shall not possess the kingdom of God, neither shall corruption possess incorruption (I Cor. XV), let us know that not the substance of the flesh, but the works, are condemned: For Basar () which is written in this place, signifies not the body, but rather flesh. But he called the circles of wheels, iron edges, by which the roundness of the wood is constrained and tightened. And these wheels not only have flesh, or bodies, or limbs: but also necks, and hands, and feathers, so that we perceive the effectiveness of things in each, not images of limbs. The wheels themselves are also called in the Hebrew tongue Gelgel, which Symmachus interpreted as revolving, and Aquila as a wheel. Furthermore, what follows: When I was listening, until the place where it is written: The Cherubim are lifted up, it is not found in the Septuagint; but it has been added from the Hebrew. In which it is to be noted that, as stated above, there are not, as it were, four faces on the right and four faces on the left: the face of a man and the face of a lion on the right, and the face of a calf on the left, and the face of an eagle; so that they are believed to be different on the left and on the right. But an equal order of all is described, with Scripture saying: Yet it had four faces: one face, the face of a Cherub, and the second face, the face of a man; and in the third, the face of a lion; and in the fourth, the face of an eagle; so that the first and second, and third, and fourth faces, are described not by the difference of places on the right and the left, but by one order of degrees. He named the first face Cherub, which he had spoken about earlier as the face of a calf. From this, it is understood that the face of the Cherub is the face of a calf. The explanation of this vision includes the meaning of all these things.
