In the scroll of Ezekiel, who is truly a type of the Savior, no other prophet (I mean of major prophets) is called “Son of man.” The title is given strictly to Ezekiel. In Ezekiel after almost every twenty or thirty verses it says regularly, “the word of the Lord came to the prophet Ezekiel.” Someone may ask, “Why is that so frequently repeated in the prophecy?” Because the Holy Spirit descended on the prophet but again withdrew from him. Whenever it says “the word came,” it indicates that the Holy Spirit departed from him and came back again to him.

Unless we eat the open book first, we cannot teach the children of Israel.

(Chapter III, Verse 1) Eat this scroll, and go to the sons of Israel. Unless we eat the open scroll beforehand, we cannot teach the sons of Israel. Finally, even David, after he obtained mercy, said: I will teach the wicked your ways, and the impious will turn to you (Psalm 50:15).
