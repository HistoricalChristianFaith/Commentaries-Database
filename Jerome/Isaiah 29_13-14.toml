(Verse 13, 14) And the Lord said: Because this people draw near with their mouth, and with their lips glorify me, but their heart is far from me, and they fear me by the commandment of men, and teach me the precepts and doctrines of men. Therefore, behold, I will add to do wonders and great marvels among this people: for wisdom shall perish from their wise men, and the understanding of their prudent men shall be hidden. LXX: And the Lord said: This people draw near to me with their mouth, and with their lips honor me; but their heart is far from me: in vain do they worship me, teaching the commandments and doctrines of men. Therefore, behold, I will add to transfer this people: for I will transfer them and destroy the wisdom of the wise, and hide the understanding of the prudent. This testimony was used by the Lord against the Pharisees in the Gospel of Matthew, saying: Why do you also transgress the commandment of God because of your tradition (Matt. 15:3)? And again: Hypocrites, well did Isaiah prophesy about you, saying: This people honors me with their lips, but their heart is far from me. But in vain do they worship me, teaching doctrines and commandments of men (Matthew, 15:9). In this we must note what we have often mentioned before, that the Evangelists and Apostles did not translate word for word; nor did they follow the authority of the Seventy Interpreters, whose edition was read at that time; but they used their own words, as if they were Hebrew and instructed in the Law, without compromising the meaning. However, the people of the Jews draw near to God with their mouth and with their lips, because they boast of having the worship of one God and rejecting idols; but their heart is far from Him, because they do not receive the Lord Jesus Christ. For whoever does not receive the Son, does not receive the Father. And let us learn together how someone approaches God, or how they become distant from Him. For it is written through Jeremiah: 'I am a close God, and not far away,' says the Lord (Jer. XXIII, 23, according to the Septuagint). But we approach God in mind, not in body; just as we read about Moses: 'Moses alone approached God, but the others did not approach' (Exod. XXIV, 2). For he was praying to God in spirit and truth, and he approached him with his mind and spirit. But those about whom it is written that they are taken from the womb and educated from infancy to old age; and in the Law of God they meditate day and night, they do not come near to God, because they accept the traditions of the Pharisees and Scribes, which keep them far from God, and they are whitewashed tombs, which appear beautiful on the outside, but inside are full of dead bones: those who chose Barabbas and rejected the Lord (Matthew 23:27): Therefore, he threatens to add to it, according to the Septuagint, that he will not transfer them to the Assyrians and Babylonians, but disperse them throughout the whole world. According to the Hebrew, he says that he will perform a great astonishment and a marvelous miracle to the Jewish people; so that he may destroy the wisdom of those who do not receive the power of God and the wisdom of God, and may hide and conceal the understanding of the wise, so that they may not find him who is contained in the scripture. The Apostle Paul, writing to the Corinthians, gave testimony of this: 'I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and the understanding of the prudent I will reject' (1 Cor. 1:19); in other words, he explained the same meaning: not that God, whose father is he, the enemy of wisdom, and through whom all wisdom is in mankind; but with an addition, as it is in Hebrew, he mentioned the wisdom of the people and the wise of that people, that is, the Jewish people. And truly God performed a great miracle in the people after the coming of the Lord Savior, so that at the same time Jerusalem burned, the temple collapsed, and all the knowledge of the teachers was taken away; this being fulfilled what was said above: (Chapter 3, 1 seqq.): Behold, the Lord God of hosts will take away from Jerusalem and from Judah the strong and the strong: all the strength of bread, and all the power of water; the giant and the warrior, and the judge, and the prophet, and the diviner, and the elder, and the fifty-year-old, and the admirable counselor, and the wise architect, and the prudent hearer, and the rest, which the prophetic speech has woven.
