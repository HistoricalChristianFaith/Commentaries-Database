(Verse 4) But let each one test his own work, and then his reason to boast will be in himself alone and not in his neighbor. The meaning is this: You, who consider yourself spiritual and stronger in the weakness of others, should not focus on the weakness of the one who is falling but on your own strength. For it is not because someone else cannot perfectly transition from Judaism to Christianity that you are a perfect Christian; rather, if your own conscience does not bother you, you have reason to boast in yourself and not in someone else. An athlete is not strong because they have defeated the weak and overpowered the feeble limbs of their opponent, but if they are strong in their own strength, not in the weakness of others. It can be understood another way: one who has a conscience of good work and considers themselves should not boast about it to others, pour out their own praise to the world, share it with everyone, and seek glory from the favor of others. Rather, they should have glory within themselves and say: But far be it from me to boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world. He who seeks glory from another, is neither crucified with the world, nor is he himself crucified with Christ. He has indeed received his reward, that which he sought from men.
