When you eat your meals, remember that you must immediately afterwards pray and read. Have a fixed number of lines of Holy Scripture, and render it as your task to your Lord. On no account resign yourself to sleep until you have filled the basket of your breast with a thread of this weaving. After the Holy Scriptures you should read the writings of learned people, of those at any rate whose faith is well known. You need not go into the mire to seek for gold. You have many pearls. Buy the one pearl with these. Stand, as Jeremiah says, in more ways than one so that you may come on the true way that leads to the Father. - "Letter 54.11"

What are the marks of the person who fears the Lord? What is the stamp of those “who walk in his ways.” There are many ways, and the many ways lead to the one way. Wherefore it says in Jeremiah: “Stand beside the ways of the Lord, and ask for the eternal pathways. Find the one way, and walk it.” Notice that it says, “Stand beside the pathways of the Lord, and ask for the eternal paths of the Lord. Find the one way, and then walk it.” Through many ways, we find the one way. The same thought occurs in the gospel. - "Homilies on the Psalms 42 (Ps 127)"
