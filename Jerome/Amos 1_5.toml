(Verse 5) Holding the scepter from the house of pleasure, and the people of Syria will be transferred to Cyrene, says the Lord. LXX: And I will cut off the tribe from men from Haran, and the captive people of Syria will be led, says the Lord. So that it is understood, I will crush and destroy, and the people of Syria will be transferred to the farthest borders of Egypt. And that which is said at the beginning: Concerning the three sins of Damascus, and concerning the four, shall I not (Alternate: shall I not indeed) turn away from him, and according to the Septuagint, shall I not (Alternate: shall I not indeed) reject him, that is, the people of Damascus, or Aram, that is, Syria, can have this meaning according to the history: If they had persecuted my people once, or even twice, I would have forgiven them. But now, since they have become cruel for a third and fourth time, to the point of driving captive multitudes with iron chariots, should I not punish them with blows? Doesn't the mercy of my mother turn away from him? But according to tropology, we can say this: the first sin is to think of evil things. The second is to find rest in perverse thoughts. The third is to carry out what you have decided in your mind. The fourth is not to repent after the sin and to take pleasure in your own wrongdoing. All heretics do this, who not only think and do evil things, but deceive the innocent with their teachings, and, following the example of the Damascenes, who interpret that they drink blood, they also drink the blood of those they have deceived. The Lord says of such great sins: is it not fitting that I punish them with blows and turn my face away from them? For those who do not see the truth of my teachings, let them be overwhelmed with darkness by the turning away of my countenance. Indeed, they have contrived and dissected in iron chariots the pregnant women of Gilead. These are the pregnant ones of whom the Lord speaks in the Gospel: Woe to the pregnant and nursing women in those days (Luke 21:23). The souls of believers are pregnant, who at the beginning of faith can say: We have conceived and given birth from your fear, O Lord (Is. XXVI, 17, 18); and if they are not equipped with iron and toothed wagons (of which the Psalmist says: The teeth of men are their weapons and arrows (Ps. LVI, 5), cut and ironed, they can also say what follows: We have given birth, we will bring forth the spirit of your salvation upon the earth. At the same time, consider that they cannot cut down men of perfect age; but those who are still in the womb, or who are unable to take solid food and are still being nourished by milk, belong to infancy. Now, these pregnant women are from Gilead, which means translation or transmigration of the testimony. For they have migrated from the Church into heresy, and have transferred the testimonies of God, which they had previously received, to foreign boundaries. But the Lord will send fire into the house of Azel, which they themselves call Azel (), that is, the vision of God: a fire that will consume the wood and straw in them, and devour the foundation of the son of Ader. For we ought to say also according to the Septuagint, lest we seem to have proposed them in vain: Ader is translated as 'elegance', which we can also call 'beauty': because every heretic discourse is well-arranged and composed, and has the beauty of secular eloquence, it deceives the listeners more easily. However, the beams of Damascus, like very strong and firm bolts, are to be understood as those who are trained in the art of dialectic and the arguments of philosophers. For example, the door is called, which conceived and gave birth to false doctrine, like Arius in Alexandria: its bolts and strongest bars, Eutychius and Eunomius, try to strengthen with syllogisms and enthymemes, even with sophisms, and pseudo-reasonings and arguments, which they have poorly invented compared to others. And when the bolts of Damascus are broken and shattered, he will also destroy the inhabitants of the field, which is interpreted as labor or pain. For all heretics have made great effort and endured great pain in seeking some order and consistency in their heresy. And I will destroy the tribe of Charram, which in our language means 'holes.' For they do not have windows, through which the light of truth may enter; but rather they have certain holes and hidden passages, through which harmful and impure creatures may enter. And the captive Aram shall be led away, a proud and lofty people, who have exalted themselves and made promises of heavenly things to themselves, so that they may be captured in their own salvation. And they shall be transferred to Cyrene, according to the Hebrew, where the calling of God is.
