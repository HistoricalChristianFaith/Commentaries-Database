(Verse 27) The king will mourn, and the prince will be clothed in sorrow, or, according to the Septuagint, in death: those who desired something, what we have expressed in the Hebrew language, the king will mourn, they have completely remained silent about it. However, the Holy Scripture commemorates that Zedekiah mourned, and all the princes of the people of Judah were consumed with sorrow. But, although this may seem blasphemous at first glance, we can say that the king mourning for our vices and sins is Christ, who speaks in the Psalms: What profit is there in my blood, when I go down to corruption? (Ps. 29:10) And when he approached Jerusalem, he wept over it saying: Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you who kill the prophets and stone those sent to you, how often I have longed to gather your children together as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you were not willing (Matthew 23:37)! Even the leaders can be apostles, whether they mourn sinners in a good way or, on the contrary, those to whom it is said: Hear the word of the Lord, leaders of Sodom (Isaiah 1:11). And he will be clothed, according to the Septuagint, in destruction, who does not have the armor of God, nor is he clothed in Christ. For all who have been baptized in Christ, have clothed themselves with Christ (Galatians 3:27).

And the hands of the people of the earth will be troubled, or, according to the Septuagint, dissolved. When there is no vision in the prophet, and knowledge of the Law in the priest, and counsel in the elders. And the king will mourn, and the prince will be in grief, or in destruction, consequently the hands of the people will be troubled, losing their order, or dissolved, not having ancient strength. And it is said beautifully that the people of God is not mentioned, whose hands are troubled, and who does not have a place in heaven; but the people of the earth, about whom it is written: Those who turn away from you will be written upon the earth. (Jeremiah 17:13).


According to their way, I will deal with them, and according to their judgments, I will judge them, or as the Septuagint translated, I will avenge them. God repays sinners according to their ways, so that He may keep the truth of judgment. However, in the saints, the extent of mercy exceeds the limits. For the sufferings of this temporary time are not worthy of the future glory that will be revealed in us (Rom. VIII, 18). For the wages of sin is death (Ibid. VI, 23), which the sinner receives according to their ways and works. Moreover, the virtue of the righteous enjoys the generosity of the Lord, of which Paul speaks: The gift of God is eternal life. And he added: and according to their judgments I will judge them, that Gospel saying: with what judgment you judge, you shall be judged (Matthew 7:1). And the Apostle: For in the judgment you pronounce you condemn yourself as you do the same things (Romans 2:1).

And they shall know that I am the Lord. This verse is often placed in this prophet, that it may be known that the knowledge of God is followed by sufferings and tortures, so that those who did not understand through blessings may understand through torments.
