“Tell us what is to come hereafter, that we may know that you are gods; do good or do harm, that we may be dismayed and terrified.” … It is a further sign that the idols are not gods that they can do neither good nor evil. It is not saying that the idols or the demons inhabiting idols do not do evil frequently, but that unless God permits them to have power they cannot do so. So in the Gospel demons ask that they might have power over a herd of pigs, and in Job we read that without the Lord’s command the devil is not able to destroy livestock or goods.
