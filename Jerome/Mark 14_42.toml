In the valley of fatness also, the fat bulls beset Him. There follows, “And He saith to His disciples, Sit ye here, while I shall pray;” they are separated from Him in prayer, who are separated in His Passion; for He prays, they sleep, overcome by the sloth of their heart.
By this also we are taught to fear and to be sorrowful before the judgment of death, for not by ourselves, but by Him only, can we say, “The prince of this world cometh, and hath nothing in Me.” There follows: “Tarry ye, here, and watch.”.
By which also He ceases not up to the end to teach us to obey our fathers, and to prefer their will toours. There follows: “And he cometh, and findeth them sleeping.” For as they are asleep in mind, so also in body.
But he is said to enter into temptation, who neglects to pray. There follows: “The spirit indeed iswilling, but the flesh is weak.”.
The threefold sleep of the disciples points out the three dead, whom our Lord raised up; the first, in ahouse; the second, at the tomb; the third, from the tomb. And the threefold watch of the Lord teaches us in our prayers, to beg for the pardon of past, future and present sins.
