(Verse 27) Then Peter answered and said to him: Behold, we have left everything and followed you: What therefore will be for us? Great confidence: Peter was a fisherman, he had not been wealthy, he sought food by hand and skill: and yet he speaks confidently, We have left everything. And because it is not enough to just leave, he adds what is perfect: and followed you. We have done what you commanded, so what reward will you give us?
