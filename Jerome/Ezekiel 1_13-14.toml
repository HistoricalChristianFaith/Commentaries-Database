(Vers. 13, 14.) And the likeness of the creatures, and their appearance was like burning coals of fire, and like the appearance of torches. This was the vision running among the creatures, a gleam of fire, and lightning coming forth from the fire. And the creatures went and returned like the flashing of lightning. LXX: And in the midst of the creatures a vision like burning coals of fire, like the appearance of torches running among the creatures; and a gleam of fire, and lightning came forth from the fire. And what follows: And the animals were running and returning as if they were species of beasts, it is added from the edition of Theodotion to the Septuagint: who, lest he seem to say something contrary to the two previous statements of the prophet, thought it best to omit what they thought to be contradictory, that is, and the animals were running and returning, so as not to cause scandal to the reader. It is better, however, to translate in divine books what has been said, even if you do not understand why it has been said, rather than remove what you do not know. Otherwise, many other things that are ineffable and cannot be grasped by the human mind will be destroyed by this freedom. But we say this, as it is also written in the Proverbs in the same place: \"Do not answer a fool according to his folly, lest you also become like him\" (Prov. XXVI, 4, 5); and in another place it is put that seems to be contrary to us: \"Answer a fool according to his folly, lest he appear wise in his own eyes;\" and both are in agreement with the diversity of times and persons, since the fool is despised because he does not receive wisdom; and foolish pride is brought down by other foolishness, as the Apostle says: \"I have become foolish, you compelled me\" (II Cor. XII, 11): so also in this place we should seek why it was said above for the second time: \"The animals did not turn back when they walked;\" and now, once, the animals ran and turned back. And if there were not a question following, it would be like a flashing lightning: which in Hebrew is called Bezec, and is interpreted by Symmachus, as if it were the appearance of a lightning bolt. Therefore, just as the ethereal fire flashes with frequent sparks, and the lightning bolts flash and return in the blink of an eye, without losing their source and, so to speak, the origin of fire and material; in the same way, these animals, when they continue with an unhindered foot, hasten towards their former state. But if they see something opposed to their attempts, they do not so much turn back as they contract themselves, to be extended again, and to give the light that they had hidden for a while, to give food to the slaves in their proper time, to not give what is holy to dogs, nor to throw pearls before swine (Matthew 7). Therefore, Paul also says: I have given you milk to drink, not food, for you were not yet able to receive it (1 Corinthians 3:2). And the choice of Judas and the anointing of Saul do not indicate that God is ignorant of future events, but they show that He is the judge of present things (Matthew 10). And it is commanded to the Apostles, that if they perceive an unworthy house by the salutation, they should first shake off the dust from their feet; and the peace which they have given to the house should return to them. But the burning coals and the lamps running among the animals are interpreted from that place of Isaiah: And the fire shall eat the flesh as the grass, and I will sanctify them in the burning fire (Isaiah 5:24) . And it is written elsewhere: Burning coals shall fall upon them (Psalm 140:11) . And against deceitful lips, it is said in another psalm: 'What shall be given to you, or what shall be added to you, to a deceitful tongue? Sharp arrows of the powerful, with coals of desolation.' (Psalm 119:3-4). And in another place: 'You have coals of fire, you shall sit upon them, they shall be to you for help.' (Isaiah 47:14). Whatever creature we behold, it reflects the knowledge of God, as the Creator is recognized through his creatures. And from the midst of living beings comes the splendor of fire and lightning. For if you study the Gospels, amidst the letters and humble history, you will discover the sacraments of the Holy Spirit.
