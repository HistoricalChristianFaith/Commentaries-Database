(Verse 12.) Rejoice and be glad, for your reward is great in heaven. For so they persecuted the prophets who were before you. I do not know who can fulfill this for us, so that our reputation may be torn apart by insults, and we may rejoice in the Lord. Whoever pursues vain glory cannot fulfill it. Therefore, we must rejoice and be glad, so that a reward may be prepared for us in heavenly places. We read elegantly written in a certain volume: 'Do not seek glory, and you will not grieve when you are without it.' Â»
