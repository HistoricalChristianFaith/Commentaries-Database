(Chapter XXXII, verse 1 and following) And it was in the twelfth year, in the twelfth month (or tenth), on one day (the Vulgate is silent on the day) of the month, the word of the Lord came to me, saying: Son of man, take up a lamentation for Pharaoh king of Egypt, and say to him: You are like a lion among the nations, and like a dragon in the sea; you stirred up your horns in your rivers, and troubled the waters with your feet, and trampled their (or your) rivers. Therefore, thus says the Lord God: I will spread my net over you in the multitude of many peoples, and I will draw you up in my dragnet (or I will draw you up with a hook). And I will throw you down on the ground; on the surface of the field I will cast you (or your fields will be filled). And I will make all the birds of the sky dwell upon you, and I will satiate all the beasts of the earth with you, and I will give your flesh over the mountains, and I will fill the hills (Vulgate adds yours) (or valleys) with your filth (or your blood) and I will irrigate the land (or the land will be irrigated) with the stench (Vulgate feces; alternative odor) of your blood (or your dung) over the mountains, and the valleys will be filled from you. And when you are extinguished, I will cover the sky and make its stars darken: I will hide the sun with a cloud, and the moon will not give its light. I will make all the luminaries of the heavens mourn over you: and I will bring darkness upon your land, says the Lord God. And I will provoke the hearts of many peoples when I bring your destruction upon the nations and lands that you do not know. And the people will be astonished, and their kings will be greatly terrified when my sword begins to fly against them, and they will be suddenly dismayed, each for his own life, on the day of your downfall. Because thus says the Lord God: The sword of the king of Babylon will come upon you. I will cast down your multitude (or your strength) with the swords of warriors (or giants): all these nations are invincible (or pestilent from all nations), and they will destroy (or lay waste) the pride (or injury) of Egypt, and his multitude (or all his strength) will be scattered (or crushed). And I will destroy all its livestock that were upon many waters (or from many waters): and the foot of man shall no longer disturb them, nor shall the hoof of beasts trouble (or trample) them. Then I will make their waters very pure (or so that their waters may finally rest), and I will bring their rivers like oil (or so that oil may flow), says the Lord God, when I make the land of Egypt desolate (or destroyed). But the land will be deserted from its abundance (or with abundance) when I strike (or scatter) all its inhabitants: and they will know that I am the Lord. The daughters of the nations will lament for him, and they will lament for him over Egypt and its multitude (or over all its strength), says the Lord God. We mix both editions, but only in those places where they differ. Otherwise, where there is only one meaning, we follow the Hebrew text. In many copies, according to the Septuagint, the twelfth year and tenth month are stated; according to other interpreters, the tenth year and twelfth month, either because Jerusalem has already been captured and Pharaoh's joy is taken away from him, due to the impending evils; or certainly it is to be captured and Israel should mourn more for its own miseries than rejoice in the captivity of others. And meanwhile, briefly laying down some foundational history, let us examine what the Hebrews understand in this place. Pharaoh is compared to a lion, not of one people, but of many peoples; or to a sea serpent, who possesses the land and the waters and was raised in pride by the irrigation of the rivers, which is called a horn, and by the multitude of his army, he could disturb all the waters as he passed through them: therefore, it is said that his net is spread out over his multitude, to catch him with its fishing net or hook, and to throw or extend him on the ground, who had been wrapped in many coils like a snake, so that he could be devoured by all the birds of the sky. And when not only the birds but all the beasts of the earth have torn him apart, his remaining flesh will fill the mountains, valleys, and fields, so that everything teems with worms. This, however, is metaphorical, indicating that after the birds of the sky and the beasts have been satiated with his flesh, that is, his army, and the rest of the multitude is turned into worms and putrefaction. Then it says, the heavens will be enveloped in darkness: the sun, moon, and other celestial bodies will not give their light, but everything will turn black over you: nothing joyful will be for you, and for your destruction all the peoples and all their kings will be terrified in great horror, seeing my sword flying here and there and sparing no one, and in your ruin they will fear a similar ruin. But so that you may know who this sword is, listen more clearly: The sword of the king of Babylon will come to you: with the swords of the mighty, or the giants, I will cast down all your multitude. These giants are invincible nations, which were held by the army of the king of Babylon. They will devastate or destroy the pride of Egypt, and all its multitude: and nothing will remain in Egypt, but both men and brute animals will be taken away together. And there will be such a solitude in Egypt that neither the foot of a man, nor the hoof of a beast, nor the water of its rivers shall be disturbed, but all shall be calm; and the waters of its rivers shall flow like pure and shining oil, with no one passing through them, nor disturbing their flow. And this shall happen because of the solitude of Egypt, which shall be turned into a desert by its own multitude: when its inhabitants are struck by the Lord, so that those who remain may understand that he is the Lord. Therefore Pharaoh lamented, and the daughters of the nations lamented him in a circle. Not only over him, but also over his multitude, which, being devastated by the Lord, was destroyed. Let it suffice to have hastily said these things in a simple letter, let us come to spiritual understanding. And I do not believe that we need to labor greatly to know who Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, is, since we will explain more fully above, namely that power to which Egypt is entrusted; either one province, or Egypt of the whole world, which is not established like a lion, but is assimilated to the lion of the nations by its own fault. For when a man is in honor, he does not understand; he is compared to senseless beasts, and becomes like them. (Psalm 49:20) Concerning this, Peter also speaks of the lion: Our adversary the devil prowls around like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour. (1 Peter 5:8) And in the ninth psalm, it is written: He lies in wait secretly like a lion in his den; he lies in wait to catch the poor. And in Jeremiah, the Holy Spirit says: A lion from the forest has struck them down. (Jeremiah 5:6). But the dragon is called the devil (for which the Eagle has interpreted as Leviathan, explaining the name of the dragon), as I have taught with many testimonies, who said: My are the rivers, and I made them. Therefore, this dragon, with his rivers, as if with horns, scattered many nations: which we can understand concerning Marcion, Valentinus, Arius, Eunomius, and the other leaders of heresies, who imitate the ecclesiastical men, saying to the Lord and Savior: In you we will scatter our enemies with a horn (Ps. 43:6); and they do not scatter for salvation, to be lifted from earth to heaven, but to be thrown down into the depths. Finally, it follows: And you were disturbing the waters with your feet; according to the words of the Apostle: But he who troubles you, will bear judgment (Gal. V, 10). For he does not want to drink the waters of Siloam, which flow silently (Isa. VIII), but the turbid and muddy waters of Egypt, which were pure and flowing in their own order before they were trampled by the feet of the dragon; but after they were disturbed by his feet, they lost their course. For heretics do not use the testimonies of the Scriptures that agree with themselves, but rather confuse everything. And because he is an enemy and avenger, not only does the Egyptian dragon disturb alien waters with his feet, but he tramples his own rivers so as not to spare those whom he has once brought under his power. The righteous, desiring to avoid this, prays: Let not the foot of pride come upon me (Ps. 35:12). And in another place, being trampled, he asks not to be trampled again: Have mercy on me, O Lord, for man has trampled upon me (Ps. 55:1). But the enemy is a man who is a devil, about whom another psalm speaks, 'Let not man be magnified over the earth.' Therefore, thus says the Lord God: I will spread my net over you, in the multitude of many peoples (Ps. IX, 18). The net of the Lord, woven together by the reason of the old and new Testament, is sent upon the dragon, who dwells in the multitude of peoples, and always delights in the tumult and multitude of peoples, so that he may draw him in his snare or in his hook. This is the net that is cast into the sea of this world, and it draws in many other fish to be chosen, and others to be cast away (Matt. XIII). Or this is the hook, of which it is written in Job: Thou shalt take the dragon by the hook, and encircle his nostrils with a bridle (Job XL, 19); for which Aquila interpreted: Thou shalt draw out Leviathan with a hook, and bind his tongue with cords. Now the dragon, or Leviathan, is drawn out of the sea by the hook or net of the Lord, to be cast away, or extended upon the earth, and all its coils, in which it concealed its snares, shall be uncovered and brought forth in public, and cast down to the earth, and he who had placed his mouth in heaven shall lie down, and boast of being like the Most High. From this it follows: And I will make all the birds of the sky dwell or settle upon you, and I will satisfy all the beasts of the earth with you, according to what is written: You have given him as food to the peoples of Ethiopia (Ps. 73:14). Those that are called birds or beasts of the earth (Matt. 13; Luke 8). Birds, which, as we have said, snatch the seed along the path. Beasts of the earth, which can be referred to heretics and pagans, given to vice. But what follows: And I will give your flesh upon the mountains, and fill your hills with your gore; or, I will fill the valleys with your blood, has this meaning: that we understand the deceitful people, the cruelty of the pagans, both the birds of the sky and the beasts of the earth, and that we return the mountains to the leaders of heresies, such as Valentinus and Marcion, and the hills to their successors who are filled with the gore of the dragon; or the valleys, which are filled with the blood of the dragon, to the lowest of the believers. But certainly there are opposing powers in the mountains that roam in the air, and valleys that penetrate the depths, and they are bound by eternal torments. Furthermore, what is said, 'And I will water the land with the stench of your blood over the mountains,' or, 'The land will be watered with your excrement over the mountains, and the valleys will be filled with you,' signifies that every pride and the arrogant swelling of heretical pride is filled not so much with vital and pure blood, but with putrid and foul-smelling blood, according to what is written: 'Make them like the dung of the earth' (Ps. LXXXII, 11). About whom the saint is freed from the Lord: He raises up the needy from the earth, and lifts up the poor from the dung heap. To seat him with princes, with the princes of his people. (Ps. CXII, 7, 8). However, the valleys in the depths, as we have said, signify either hell or the humble sense of the heretics due to pleasure and earthly wealth that make everything. But what is joined: And I will cover the heavens when you are extinguished, and I will make its stars black: I will cover the sun with a cloud and the moon will not shed its light, all the luminaries of heaven will mourn, or I will make them dark over you, and I will give darkness over your land, says the Lord God, if we follow the letter, it cannot be fully understood. For when Pharaoh, or the serpent sun, and the moon, and the stars did not give their light, and the heavens were covered in darkness, according to that poetic (Virgil, Georgics I):

And the impious have feared the eternal darkness. Therefore, this must be said, that with the extinguishing of Pharaoh, who transformed himself into an Angel of light, about whom it is written elsewhere: The light of the wicked will be extinguished (Job XVIII), the heavens or the highest heavens will be covered in darkness. Of which even Paul speaks: For our wrestling is not against flesh and blood, but against the Principalities and Powers, against the rulers of this world of darkness (Ephesians VI, 12). And the Lord will cause his stars, or the dragon, or the heavens, to darken. On which also Jude the Apostle writes: Wandering stars, for whom the gloom of darkness is kept forever (Jude XIII). The sun is also covered by a cloud, the sun of iniquity, which is contrary to the sun of justice, but by a cloud, even by the Lord and Savior Himself, who descended into Egypt upon a light cloud (Isaiah 19), not weighed down by any burden of sins, or by the prophets and Apostles, of whom we read: 'I will command the clouds, that they rain no rain upon it' (Isaiah 5:6). And in the Psalms: 'Your truth reaches unto the clouds' (Psalm 36:6). But when the sun of iniquity is obscured, the moon, which we understand to be the Church of heretics, and which was thought to receive its light from the sun of iniquity, will not give its light, nor will it deceive believers with the false knowledge of its name. Moreover, all the lights and everything that appears to be in heretics' doctrine will be extinguished, the dragon being destroyed, and dried up, they will mourn, the prince being lost, so that the Lord himself may cover the land of the heretics with darkness, namely ignorance of the truth, so that the blind may lead the blind into the pit, and the inhabitants of the earth may be cast into outer darkness, where there is weeping and gnashing of teeth. After this it is said: And I will provoke the heart of many peoples, when I bring your contrition, or your captivity, among the nations upon the earth which you do not know, so that those who previously served Pharaoh may be angry against him, seeing his captivity brought to another land, which the dragon did not know to exist. Nor should we doubt that those lands are good, which Pharaoh does not know, namely when the captivity of Pharaoh is changed by another captivity, of which it is said to the Savior: Ascending on high, he led captivity captive: he received (or, according to the Apostle (Ephes. IV, 8), gave) gifts to men (Psal. LXVII, 19). And I will cause many peoples to marvel at you, he says, so that those who previously admired Pharaoh's power may afterwards marvel at his downfall from his own height. The kings of the nations will also fear him excessively, whose kingdoms the devil shows to the Lord and of whom it is said in the psalm: The kings of the earth stood up, and the princes gathered together in one (Ps. II, 2). This, however, will happen when the sword of the Lord begins to fly over their faces, understood as the kings or the peoples. The sword of the Lord, moreover, is to be understood as the living word of God, powerful and sharp on both sides, which flies and runs, and wounds the eyes of those who see it and terrifies their faces, so that, amazed by the downfall of Pharaoh, they see themselves thrown down in it. And indeed, the sword of the Lord, about which it is written: Behold, this one is set for the fall and rising again of many (Luke 2:34), raises up those who are lying down, and by humility, transforms those who are badly erected. But the sword of the king of Babylon will come upon the Egyptian dragon, so that, like the swords of the mighty or giants, the Lord may cast down the multitude of those who followed the king of Egypt. Inexorable, he says, or pestilent from the nations, all of these, so that they may be handed over to worse evils for punishment, about which it is written: He sent among them the anger of his wrath, fury, and affliction, by sending evil angels (Psalm 78:49). And the Apostle says: 'Whom I have delivered up to Satan, that they may learn not to blaspheme, but rather to be saved in the day of judgment by the destruction of the flesh' (I Tim. I, 20). But when through such ministers the pride of Egypt has been cast down and its multitude scattered, all the beasts that were upon many waters will perish, and the foot of man will no longer disturb them. For if blessed is he who sows upon the waters, where the ox and the ass tread (Isa. XXXII); on the other hand, unhappy is he who can retain only the simple things and is thus unable to reach his own error, so that the foot of man does not tread upon them, as if they did not even seem to have the sign of wisdom and reason, the waters of Egypt within themselves. Moreover, the hoof of the cattle will not disturb them so as to make them muddy and turbid from being clear and bright. Then the waters, which had been disturbed by the dominion of the dragon, will be restored not by another, but by the Lord Himself: so that their rivers flow like oil, and they become the nourishment of true light. However, these things will happen when the Lord has made the land of Egypt desolate, and has destroyed its multitude, and all its inhabitants have been struck, so that they may know by this event that He Himself is the Lord. But what is joined: it is a lament, and the daughters of the nations shall lament over Egypt, and over its multitude they shall lament, says the Lord God; it is clear to the souls of all nations, which were previously oppressed, whether the nations that did not dwell in Egypt at all, but lived in the land of the living, to lament the slain dragon, and all its multitude: not in hope of salvation, but because he, through his own fault and pride, has been cast down into eternal punishment of such great power.
