(Verse 6 and following) For the Lord spoke these words to me: Go and set a watchman, and whatever he sees, let him announce. And he saw a chariot with two horsemen, a rider on a donkey, and a rider on a camel. And he looked closely with much attention, and the lion cried out: I am standing continually on the watchtower of the Lord, both day and night. Behold, here comes a rider of a chariot with horsemen, and he answered and said: Babylon is fallen, is fallen, and all the carved images of its gods are shattered on the ground. Crush my people, O threshing floor of mine, which I heard from the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, I have declared to you. The reasons for the previous fear are given, why distress has taken hold of him like a woman in labor, and he has fallen down, hearing and trembling, and being surrounded by dark horror. This, the Lord said to me: go and set a watchman, so that he may foretell to you the future with a prophetic spirit; when I placed him on the watchtower, he saw a chariot coming with two horses, and a charioteer high above, and an ass and a camel drawing the chariot. But it signifies Cyrus, the king of the Persians and Medes, coming with little and great authority. For the Persians were formerly unknown before Cyrus and held no place among the nations; the Medes, however, were always very powerful. Therefore, this one, supported by the army of two nations, came against Babylon. And that lookout who was positioned to see what was coming cried out like a lion, or rather, he is called a lion himself as a prophet. And because there was doubt about the identity of the lookout who had seen Cyrus ascending, he explains more explicitly and says: \"I am standing on the lookout of the Lord constantly throughout the day, declaring himself to be the lookout of the Lord, who is always stationed in the prophetic office, and who, in the days and nights of the Lord's command, speaks whatever He orders.\ Therefore, what did the lion call out? Behold, that man comes, the ascender of the chariot of the horsemen; no doubt, Cyrus is indicated. And he answered and said, the lion himself who had called out before: Babylon has fallen, fallen, and all the sculptures of its gods are shattered on the ground. For with the devastating ascender of the chariot, Babylon is destroyed forever, and the temple of Bel and all the idols are laid to the ground. And what follows, 'My threshing, and the son of my floor,' it makes an apostrophe to Jerusalem, and to the Temple which is situated in the area of Orna, and it says to it: 'O Jerusalem, and people, sons of my Temple, do not think it unbelievable what I have said; for they are not my words, but the words of the Lord, and through my mouth, his words resounded.' Some people mistakenly think that this is not said about Jerusalem, but about Babylon, from which my beloved above Babylon is placed for me as a miracle; and the meaning is: what you have broken, you will also be broken, not in my words, but in the power of the Lord, which foretells these things to you. However, what the LXX translators meant in this place, to translate 'lion', which is called in Hebrew 'Aria' (), as 'uriah', I do not quite understand, especially since the aforementioned priest Uriah, who is called as a witness, is written in other letters.
