(Verse 23.) And you shall defile the plates of your carved silver, and the garment of your molded gold, and scatter them like the impurity of a menstruating woman: go forth, you shall say to it. LXX: And you shall defile the silver and the gold idols: you shall break them and scatter them like the water of a menstruating woman, and you shall cast them away like feces. When you understand the truth, and those who deceive do not approach you, but your eyes have seen your teacher, and your ears have always heard him: This is the way, walk in it, neither to the right nor to the left; then you shall break and scatter all errors and idols, and the likenesses of truth, which the skilled tongue has composed in the splendor of eloquence, which is translated as silver, and in the reasoning of wisdom, which sounds like gold, and you shall judge them as unclean, like the most filthy blood of a menstruating woman, which the Seventy translated into other words for the water of a menstruating woman.
