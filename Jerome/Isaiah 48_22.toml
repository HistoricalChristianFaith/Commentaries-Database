Some say that so we might know that this prophecy is not about Christ but about Cyrus, the phrase is added, “there is no peace for the ungodly, says the Lord.” This would mean that there will be no perfect happiness except under Christ, which is reserved for the last times. Yet those who more truly and rightly apply these words to the advent of the Savior, about whom it is said, “He has sent me to announce to the poor, to preach liberty to the captives,” understand it to be an encouragement of those who preach the gospel or of the Lord and Savior, that we leave Babylon, that is, the confusion of this world, and flee the Babylonians.… For the Lord has redeemed his servant Jacob with his most precious blood and led him through the desert and made a way for water to come out of a rock, about which the apostle said, “The Rock was Christ.” … And lest it be thought that the prophecy is said about all the seed of Jacob, and not those only who would believe through the apostles, mention is also made concerning this: “there is no peace for the ungodly.”
