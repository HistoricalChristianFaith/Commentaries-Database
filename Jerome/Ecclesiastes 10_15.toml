"The
toil of fools exhausts them, as one who does not know the way to town.  "Join these lines with the verse above; either to those
verses that speak in general about fools, who know not God, or in particular to
that one which argues about heretics. 
Read in Plato for example: unravel the tricks of Aristotle, read Zeno
and Carneas more diligently, and you will prove to be true what is written
here: the toil of fools exhausts them. 
For they seek the truth in fact with all their enthusiasm, but since
they have no leader or anyone to lead the way on their journey, they are led by
their human instincts to think that they can understand wisdom, and thus they
do not arrive at the town; the Psalm speaks of this too: "Lord, you will
scatter their image in your town" [Ps. 72, 20.]. For the Lord will scatter in the town all
shadows and strange appearances or characters, in which they clothe themselves
in their many doctrines. In another
place the Psalm says of this: "the force of a river causes the city of God
to rejoice" [Ps. 45, 5.]. And in the Gospel: "a town built on a
mountain cannot be hidden" [Matth. 5, 14.]. And in Isaiah: "I am a strong city, a
city which is attacked" [Is. 27, 3. (According to the LXX.)]. And all the wise men and heretics of this
world are trying to attack this city of truth and wisdom, although it is strong
and fortified. And that which I have
said about philosophers can also be said of heretics, that they toil in vain,
and are exhausted in their enthusiasm for the Scriptures, when they wander in
the desert and are not able to find the town. 
The Psalmist also mentions their madness too, saying, "they
wandered in the wilderness in a solitary way; they found no city to dwell
in." [Ps. 107, 4.]
