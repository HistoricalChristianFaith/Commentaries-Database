To us this life is a race course: we contend here, we are crowned elsewhere. No one can lay aside fear while serpents and scorpions beset his path. The Lord says, “My sword has drunk its fill in heaven,” and do you expect to find peace on the earth? No, the earth yields only thorns and thistles, and its dust is food for the serpent. “For our wrestling is not against flesh and blood but against the principalities, against the powers, against the world rulers of this darkness, against the spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places.” We are hemmed in by hosts of foes; our enemies are upon every side. The weak flesh will soon be ashes: one against many, it fights against tremendous odds. Not till it has been dissolved, not till the prince of this world has come and found no sin therein, not till then may you safely listen to the prophet’s words: “You shall not be afraid for the terror by night nor the arrow that flies by day; nor for the trouble which haunts you in darkness.” … When the hosts of the enemy distress you, when your body is hot with fever and your passions roused, when you say in your heart, “What shall I do?” Then Elisha’s words shall give you your answer, “Fear not, for they that be with us are more than they that be with them.” He shall pray, “Lord, open the eyes of your handmaid that she may see.” And then when your eyes have been opened, you shall see a fiery chariot like Elijah’s waiting to carry you to heaven, and you shall joyfully sing, “Our soul has become free like a bird out of the snare of the fowlers: the snare is broken and we have been set free.”

Because God did not spare the sinful angels who lost their heavenly home through their own fault, therefore does he say through Isaiah, “My sword in heaven is satiated.” For every sinner among the people will die by the sword, yet not by a physical sword (there are many and varied ways to die other than by a sword) but by the spiritual sword with which all who fail to do penance must be stricken.
