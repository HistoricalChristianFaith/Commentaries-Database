(Vers. 4, 5.) However, this happened so that what was spoken through the prophet might be fulfilled, saying: Tell the daughter of Zion, behold your king comes to you, meek and sitting on a donkey, and on a colt, the foal of a beast of burden. This is written in the prophet Zechariah: of which, if there is enough time in life, it will be said in its proper place. Now, briefly, it must be understood that according to the literal meaning, it was not possible for him to sit on both animals in a short distance of the journey. For either the she-asses sat and the foal was without a rider, or if the foal, which is more fitting, was used for sitting, the she-ass was led freely. Therefore, when the story seems to have impossibility or shame, we are led to deeper meanings: so that that she-ass which was submissive, and tamed, and had taken the yoke of the law, may be understood as the Synagogue; the foal of the she-ass, wanton and free, may be understood as the people of the Gentiles, on whom Jesus sat, and when he sent two of his disciples to them, one to the Circumcision, and the other to the Gentiles.
