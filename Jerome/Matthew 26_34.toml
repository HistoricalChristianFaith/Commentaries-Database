(Verse 34.) Jesus said to him: Truly I say to you, that in this night before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times. And Peter, with fervor of faith, promised, and the Savior, as if God, knew the future. And note that Peter will deny in the night, and deny a third time. But after the rooster crowed, and the darkness diminishing, the approaching light was announced, he turned and wept bitterly, washing away the stains of denial with tears of repentance.
