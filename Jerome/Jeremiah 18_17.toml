(Verse 17) Like a burning wind, I will scatter them before the enemy (or enemies); I will show them my back, not my face, on the day of their destruction. Until this day, God's judgment remains on the Jews. They were scattered before the enemy devil or enemy demons throughout the entire world; and as they invoke the name of God in the synagogues of Satan day and night, God shows them his back, not his face, so that they may understand that he is constantly withdrawing and never coming to them. But this is the time of the destruction of the Jews, from the passion of the Savior until the end of the age: so that after the fullness of the Gentiles has come in, then all Israel may be saved (Rom. 11).
