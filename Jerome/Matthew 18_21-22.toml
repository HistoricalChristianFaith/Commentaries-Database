The Lord had said above, See that ye despise not one of these little ones, and had added, If thy brother sin against thee, &c. making also a promise, If two of you, & c. by which the Apostle Peter was led to ask, Lord, how oft shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? And to his question he adds an opinion, Until seven times?

Or understand it of four hundred and ninety times, that He bids us forgive our brother so oft.

(Verse 21, 22.) Then Peter came to him and said, Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? Up to seven times? Jesus said to him, I do not say to you, up to seven times, but up to seventy times seven. The Lord's words weighed heavily on him, and they could not be broken like a triple cord. Earlier, he had said, See that you do not despise one of these little ones; and he had added, If your brother sins against you, go and show him his fault, just between the two of you. If he listens to you, you have won your brother over. And he had promised a reward, saying, If two of you agree on earth about anything they ask for, it will be done for them by my Father in heaven. For where two or three gather in my name, there am I with them. The apostle Peter, provoked, asks how many times he should forgive his brother who sins against him, and when he proposes the question, should it be up to seven times? Jesus responds: Not up to seven times, but up to seventy times seven, that is, four hundred and ninety times, so that he should forgive his brother who sins against him as many times in a day as that brother cannot sin.
