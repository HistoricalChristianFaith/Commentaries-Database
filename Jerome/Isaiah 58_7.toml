But the affliction of the body entreats for the indulgence of sinners. Divine Scripture teaches us to forgive our debtors so that the heavenly Father would also forgive our debts. The old history instructs in the seventh year of remission, or in the fiftieth, which is the true jubilee, to return all possessions to the Lord and to restore to one’s servants their original freedom and to render void every name that was used as a warranty. But if this was commanded in the law, how much more in the gospel, where all goods are doubled and where we are ordered by no means to take an eye for an eye or a tooth for a tooth but instead to offer our cheek to the assailant!…When you see people freezing outside the church in the frigidity of unbelief, without the warmth of faith, impoverished and homeless, lead them home into the church and clothe them with the work of incorruption, so that, wrapped in the mantle of Christ, they will not remain in the grave.
