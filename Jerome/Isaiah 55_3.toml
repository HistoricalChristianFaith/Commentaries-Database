This covenant that the Lord promises will not be short-lived and for one age only, as it was of the Jewish people, but it will remain in eternity, in that the true David will come and the things promised in the gospel from the person of God will be fulfilled: “I have found my servant David, and in holy mercy I have anointed him.”
