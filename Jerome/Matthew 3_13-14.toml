(Verse 13, 14.) Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to John to be baptized by him. But John tried to prevent him, saying: I need to be baptized by you, and you come to me? But Jesus answered and said to him: The Savior accepted baptism from John for three reasons. First, to fulfill all righteousness and humility of the Law, because he was born as a human. Second, to confirm the baptism of John with his own baptism. Third, as Jordan sanctified the waters, by the descent of the dove, the Holy Spirit would show forth the coming in the baptism of believers.
