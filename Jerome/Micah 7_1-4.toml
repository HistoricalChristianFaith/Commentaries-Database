(Chapter 7, Verses 1 onwards) Woe is me, for I have become like one who gathers the grapes of the vineyard in autumn: there is no cluster to eat; my soul longed for the early figs. The holy one has perished from the earth, and there is no upright person among mankind. They all lie in wait for blood; each hunts his brother to death. They declare their evil deeds as good; the ruler demands, and the judge accepts bribes, and the great one speaks of the cravings of his own soul, and they trouble it. The best among them is like a thornbush, and the most upright is like a thorn from a fence. Woe is me, for I have become like one who gathers straw in the harvest, and like grape clusters in the vineyard, when there is no first-ripe fig for my hunger, which my soul craves. Woe is me, for the reverent one has perished from the earth, and there is no one who corrects among men. They are all judged in bloodshed; each one of them inflicts trouble on his neighbor, and they prepare their hands for evil. The ruler makes demands, and the judge speaks peaceable words; his desire is for the longing of his soul. And I will take away their goods, like a consuming moth, and walking over the ruler in the day of your watchfulness. In the aforementioned captivity and ten tribes and two (For the word of the Lord has come to Micah the Morestite concerning Samaria and Jerusalem), the prophet laments that no just person is found in the land who can resist the anger of God and stand as a wall in the middle. In vain, he says, I have spoken: in vain I sought the last clusters of the vine and the destroyed city; and since there is no bunch to eat, I will at least take immature figs, which the Hebrews call "Bechchora", that is, thick figs, as food: as if to say, not finding bread because of the magnitude of the famine, I have sought scraps and chaff. The saint has perished from the earth, and the righteous among men are no more. Everywhere there are traps, everywhere there is deceit. Innocent blood is shed. Due to greed and lust, kinship is disregarded. Not only do they commit evil deeds, but they also defend them. They change names and claim that what is evil is good. The rulers do not accept gifts from those offering them, but they force their subjects to give and demand. And in rendering judgment, the judge treats another as he himself is judged by another, so that they may mutually favor each other in their crimes and defend themselves in the crimes of others. Whoever is great and almost most learned in the Law, speaks not the will of God, but his own will. And they have disturbed it, either the city, or the truth, or the land, of which it is said above: The holy one has perished from the earth. For whoever is the best among them, like a sharp thorn, pierces and holds, injuring the one who approaches him, and grasping with a hooked tooth: and whoever is found to be upright, like a thorn from a fence, so that there may be found pain where help was supposed to be. According to the Hebrew text, however, according to the Septuagint, who differ in some respects, and at the end of the chapter they translated completely differently, this is the meaning that seems to me: The prophetic or apostolic discourse laments, in general, the human race, which has in vain cast the seeds of doctrines, and instead of crops and grain, the late reaper finds only empty straw and useless stalks, and he cannot even find small grapes in the vineyard, and so on until the end of the chapter. For if it is a blessing for the speaker to be heard by the listener's ears, and the desire of the wise is the ear of the listener, and the understanding of the listener is the joy of the speaker; on the contrary, the grief of the teacher is a bad disciple, with Jeremiah's words also fitting this complaint: I have not profited, nor has anyone else profited me (Jeremiah). There are those who believe that these words are spoken from the perspective of the Savior, who is the cause of not finding worthy works in such a great multitude of believers and in the whole world of human kind, and who also says in Psalm 29: What profit is there in my blood, while I descend into corruption? Although others assert that these words do not fit his person at all, as he says: Woe is me, because I have become as one who gathers straw in the harvest; he who spoke in the Gospel: Lift up your eyes and see the regions, for they are already white for harvest (John 4:35). And elsewhere: The harvest indeed is great, but the laborers are few (Matthew 9:35). Therefore, those who want to understand this from the perspective of the Savior say that it is not surprising if he says: Woe is me, who wept in Jerusalem and shed tears at the death of Lazarus (Luke 19). But also this, I have become like one who gathers straw in the harvest, they apply it to the end of the age: and the harvest is interpreted to signify this, and they say that at that time this prophecy can be fulfilled, when, with the increase of wickedness, the love of many will grow cold, and when the Son of Man comes, he will scarcely find faith on earth (Mat. XIV, 24): for then, like straw after the harvest, and like grapes after the vintage, there will be few found among them who will maintain faith amidst the devastation of all things, and they believe that this statement, spoken from the perspective of the assumed man, approves of what follows: Woe is me, my soul: of whom he was speaking: My soul is sorrowful even unto death (Mat. XXVI, 38). He will perish (or He will be destroyed) returning from the earth, either by the Antichrist killing the saints, or by everyone collapsing due to the magnitude of scandals. And there is no one to correct among men: all are judged by blood, not by slight and small sins, but by the greatest sins and those related to bloodshed. Proximity, friendship, and kinship will not delay the crime: all will raise their hands to evil, so that even one who couldn't commit evil, yet, while preparing the hand, may sin by the will. The ruler himself seeks, and the judge speaks peaceful words; for he receives gifts, the desire of his soul. And because this is evident, and I avoid the envy of rulers and judges, leaving it to the understanding of the reader, I will only add this: Gifts blind the eyes even of the wise (Deut. XVI, 19): they also give life to the soul, which they should not have given life to, and they kill her who lives by her own merit and virtues, and they do this because of the gifts they demand shamelessly, and accept them more shamefully. To those whom the Lord threatens, saying: 'And I will take away their goods, which they think are good, but which appear good to them. Moreover, the truth of the matter will never be called good, which both deprives the giver and kills the receiver: although it is not so much a threat as a blessing, to take away evil from them, and for the Lord Himself and His divine word to enter into their consciences like a moth eating away whatever is perverse, and to make a devastation of plunder and evil thoughts, and to walk above the measure and rule of truth, and to lead back those who were led by false opinions to what is straight; and to do this in the light of truth, and on that day when those who are holy and elected from the Church ascend to the watchtower, and in the height of their learning and works, they will discuss heavenly matters.'
