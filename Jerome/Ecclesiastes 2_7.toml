"I
bought slaves, male and female, and natives too; I also owned more possessions,
both cattle and sheep, than all of my predecessors in Jerusalem."  If we want
Ecclesiastes, as we have said before, to refer to the person of Christ here
too, then we are able to say "his slaves"
who have the spirit of fear in servitude and desire more spiritual things in
life than they already have. But we can
also call the slave-girls "hearts [Hier.. "animas"]"
that till now have been bestowed upon the body and upon the earth. They surpass also those natives, who are
certain of the Church, both slaves and slave-girls, about whom I have spoken. And the Lord has not yet bestowed upon them freedom
or noble-birth. But there are others in
the estate of Ecclesiastes like oxen and sheep, who are kept on account of work
and their innocence, and who work even in the church without reason and
knowledge of the Scriptures. But they
have not yet attained such an understanding, that they deserve to be men and
return to the appearance of their creator. If you look more diligently too, you
will notice that the number is not added in the case of slaves, slave-girls and
natives, but in the case of cows and sheep it is said: "I owned more
possessions of cattle and sheep". There is more silver in fact in the
Church than men: more sheep than slaves, slave-girls and natives. But that which is said at the end- "more
than all those who were before me in Jerusalem" does not pertain to the
glory of Solomon, or that he was richer than his father the King, since Saul
did not rule in Jerusalem, and the city was held by the Jebusites who had
themselves occupied the city at that time. 
Ecclesiastes however was richer at a younger age than were all men, who
had preceded him as kings in Jerusalem.
