(Verse 27, 28.) And I saw something like the appearance of electrum, like the appearance of fire within it all around. From the appearance of his loins and upward, I saw something like the appearance of glowing fire all around, like the appearance of a rainbow in the clouds on a rainy day. This was the appearance of the splendor of the Lord's glory. When I saw it, I fell facedown and heard a voice speaking. The electrum had the appearance of fire both inside and outside. But from the loins downwards, there was a shining fire all around, to show that those things which are above the loins, where the senses and reason reside, do not need fire or flames, but rather the most precious and pure metal. However, those things that are below the loins, where sexual intercourse, procreation, and the incitement of vices take place, need the purifying flames, so that when they have been purified, they may have a resemblance to a rainbow, which is commonly called Iris, when it appears in a cloud on a rainy day. For indeed the rainbow, which is called Iris in the Holy Scriptures, and in the Apocalypse of John is also called Iris (Apoc. IV), can only appear in rain and a watery cloud, of diverse and most beautiful colors, gradually transitioning into others. Hence the poet (Virgil, Aeneid IV).

Adversity brings a thousand different colors. But the same poet also follows the custom of the common people when he says: 'When he drinks, the rainbow.' From this he signifies that the rainbow never appears unless in the cloud and in the waters. This rainbow is a sign of God's mercy and covenant that he made with humans: that when it appears in the cloud, we, according to the example of antiquity, may know that we will never be destroyed by a flood (Genesis 9). From this it is shown that after punishment and punishment, and the purification of sins, there will be future mercy, only for those who deserve to see God reigning. Where it is said: Here was the appearance of splendor in a circle. In a circle of God, or of thrones, or of all things that are seen. And this is the vision of the glory of the likeness of God: not that he saw the glory of the Lord, but the likeness of his glory. And this whole vision is: a Spirit lifting up, and a great cloud, and four living creatures, and wheels following the same creatures, and the spirit, which deserve to be under the firmament of God. And after they were lifted up, and heard a voice like many waters, and like the sublime word of God, and the voice of camps and armies, they let down their wings, and showed astonishment in silence: and there appeared one sitting upon the likeness of a sapphire stone, as it were the likeness of a man that was from his loins upward, and the likeness of fire from his loins downward, and from his loins upward, as the appearance of amber. Afterwards, a sign of mercy is given to counteract this fear; just as the appearance of a rainbow when it is in the cloud on a rainy day. We have spoken at length about this vision because it is both obscure and interpreted in various ways by many. In the remaining parts, as much as possible without harming the senses, we will strive for brevity due to the large volume of the work.
