(Chapter 27 - Verse 1) On that day the Lord will visit with His hard, great, and strong sword Leviathan, the twisted serpent, and Leviathan, the fleeing serpent, and He will slay the sea monster that is in the sea. LXX: On that day God will bring forth His holy, great, and strong sword against the fleeing dragon, against the twisted dragon, and He will slay the dragon that is in the sea. The Hebrews understand the devil, that is, the accuser, whose Greek name is Satan (), to be called in Hebrew Satan (), which means adversary. And in Zachariah it is said: Satan stood at his right hand, to resist him (Zech. III, 1). And he is also called Belial (), that is, apostate, transgressor, and without yoke. And so the Apostle says: What fellowship hath Christ with Belial? (2 Cor. VI, 15). And wherever the LXX translate the sons of iniquity, in the Hebrew it is written, sons of Belial. And that which is sung in the psalm about the mystery of the Savior: The son of iniquity shall not afflict him (Ps. LXXXVIII, 23), in the Hebrew it is said, son of Belial. And it is called by other names, as it is written in another psalm: You shall walk upon the asp and the basilisk, and you shall trample the lion and the dragon (Psalm 90, 13). This dragon is properly called Leviathan in the Hebrew language. It is the great sea monster, of which, that it must be caught by Christ, is mystically narrated in the book of Job: He who will capture the great sea monster (Job 40, 20); for there, Leviathan is also used instead of sea monster; and again: You will draw out the dragon with a hook, you will encircle his jaws with a bridle; And immediately: This is the beginning of the creation of the Lord, which was made to be played with by his angels. And in the psalm: This great and spacious sea: there are creatures without number: small creatures with the great ones. This dragon that you formed to mock him (Ps. CIII, 25, 26). John also writes about this in the Apocalypse: A battle took place in heaven: Michael and his angels fought with the dragon, and the dragon fought and his angels, and they did not prevail, nor was a place found for them in heaven (Apoc. XII, 7 et seqq.). And the great dragon was thrown down, the old serpent, who is called the devil and Satan, who deceives the whole world; he was thrown down to the earth, and his angels were thrown down with him. And I heard a loud voice in heaven, saying, 'Now the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God and the authority of his Christ have come, for the accuser of our brothers has been thrown down, who accuses them day and night before our God.' (Revelation 12:9-10). It should be noted that in the psalm and in Job, the dragon is called Leviathan, to mock him by the angels. And so the Apostles receive power, that they may tread upon serpents and scorpions and upon all the might of the enemy (Luke 10). Therefore, from that place where it is written: Behold the Lord will lay waste the earth and make it desolate (Isaiah 24:1); or according to the Septuagint: Behold the Lord will destroy the world and lay it waste, until the present chapter, the judgment against the world at the consummation of the age has been preached, and the final enemy death will be destroyed (1 Corinthians 15): therefore, against the devil the ultimate sentence is that he be attacked with a holy, great, and strong sword, or according to the Hebrew and other interpreters, a harsh sword. For it is not as the Seventy perceived Cadesa, which, if it were, would sound holy; but Casa, which properly means hard. Hence also Saul, the father of Cis, is called hard. And some of our people understand the holy or hard sword to be the Word of God, because of its sense which it endures, of which the Apostle says: 'For the word of God is living and effectual, and more piercing than any two-edged sword' (Hebrews 4:12). And in another place we read about the double-edged sword of the Savior coming forth from his mouth (Apoc. XIX). But at the end of the world, against Leviathan, who is called the most cunning serpent in the beginning of Genesis, the holy and strong sword will be brought forth, which will flee from the one who has never been accustomed to fleeing, not knowing that written: Where can I go from your Spirit? Where can I flee from your presence? (Ps. CXXXVIII, 7)? A certain poet beautifully describes in the Gigantomachia about Enceladus:

Where are you fleeing, Enceladus? Wherever you may go, you will always be under God. But that fleeing serpent Leviathan is called Bari in Hebrew, which the Eagle interpreted as a bolt, Symmachus as a lock, and Theodotion as strong. I think it is called a bolt or a lock because it has locked many in its prison and subjected them to its power, and it does not possess anything straight within itself, and for this reason it is called tortuous, and it cannot imitate the rod of the Lord, of which it is written: A rod of direction, a rod of your kingdom (Psalm 44). Whom the Lord will kill with the breath of his mouth (2 Thess. 2), the former inhabitant of the sea, the false and bitter waves. Those who say that the devil will repent and obtain forgiveness, let them explain to us how they understand this, which is written: And he will kill the dragon who is in the sea, or the whale. For in the second place, in the present chapter, in Hebrew it is not called Leviathan, but Thannin (), which properly means whale. The Hebrews believe that Leviathan dwells under the earth and in the heavens, while the sea monsters dwell in the sea, which is a Jewish fable. And what is said at the end of this chapter is connected by Eusebius to the previous chapter, so that the following prophecy is not related to this time. However, the Hebrews and other commentators explain the following, which we are now going to set forth.
