(Verse 55.) At that hour Jesus said to the crowds: Are you coming out with swords and clubs to arrest me like a robber? Every day I was sitting in the temple teaching, and you did not seize me. It is foolish, he said, to seek him with swords and clubs, who willingly surrenders himself to your hands, and to search for him like a lurking fugitive in the night, and to investigate him through a betrayer, who teaches in the temple every day. But you are gathering against me in the darkness, because your power is in darkness.
