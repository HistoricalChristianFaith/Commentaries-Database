(Verse 9.) The sons of your father shall adore you. The lion's cub of Judah, my son, you have risen, bowing down like a lion and like a lion cub. Who will awaken him? Although there is a great mystery about Christ, it is prophesied according to the literal interpretation that kings from the lineage of David through Judah will be born and that all tribes will adore him. For it does not say, the sons of your mother, but the sons of your father. And what follows, you have risen from the lineage, my son, in Hebrew is, you have risen from captivity, my son, to show that he will lead captive peoples; and according to a more sacred interpretation, he has ascended on high and led captivity captive (Psalm 68). Or what I think is better, captivity signifies passion, ascent signifies resurrection.
