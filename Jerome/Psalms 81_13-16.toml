“And he fed them with the fat of wheat.” He led them into the land of promise. He fed them, not with manna as in the desert, but the wheat that had fallen, that had risen again. “And he fed them with the fat of wheat.” Be sure you penetrate the mystery in the scriptural words: “With the finest of wheat.” Does wheat have fat? Does it also have intestines? The prophet wanted to show the abundance and richness of spiritual grace, and hence he called it fat. “And with honey from the rock he would fill them.” He is the wheat; he also is the rock20 who quenches the thirst of the Israelites in the desert. He satisfied their thirst spiritually with honey, and not with water, so that they who believe and receive the food taste honey in their mouth. “How sweet to my palate are your promises, sweeter than honey to my mouth!” Lastly, that is why our Lord ate honeycomb after the resurrection and was satisfied with honey from the rock. I am going to tell you something new. The Rock himself ate honey in order to give us honey and sweetness, so that they who in the law had drunk myrrh, or bitterness, might afterwards eat the honey of the Gospel.
