O mortal, you have now been cleansed in baptism, and it is said of you, “Who is she that comes up, cleansed and leaning upon her beloved?” so that she, indeed, is cleansed, but she is not able to guard her purity, unless she is sustained by the Lord God. You, who but a moment ago were freed from your sins, how is it that you desire to be delivered by the mercy of God, if not in the way I stated, that, when we have done everything, we confess that we of ourselves are insufficient?
