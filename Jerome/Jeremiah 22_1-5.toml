(Chapter XXII - Verses 1 onwards) Thus says the Lord: Go down to the house of the king of Judah, and speak there this word, and say, Hear the word of the Lord, O king of Judah, who sits on the throne of David, you and your servants and your people who enter by these gates. Thus says the Lord, Do justice and righteousness, and deliver the one who has been robbed from the hand of his oppressor. And do not mistreat or do violence to the stranger, the orphan, or the widow, nor shed innocent blood in this place. For if you do this word, then the kings sitting upon the throne of David will enter in by the gates of this house, riding in chariots and on horses, they, and their servants, and their people. But if you will not hear these words, I swear by myself, saith the Lord, that this house shall become a desolation. This vision, or rather this word of the Lord, either happened before the messengers of Sedecias were sent to him, or certainly after they were sent, and before they returned again, Jeremiah is commanded, that he should not speak to the king by messengers, but that he himself should go into the house of the king, and there speak to him. At the same time, we notice the divine wisdom, that through messengers he commands sad news to be announced, mixed with good news, if the king will repent. However, because he is commanded himself to move forward, he does not announce sad news, and the impending captivity; but he warns what he should do to avoid the impending judgment of God. But it is the duty of kings to administer judgment and justice, and to deliver those oppressed by the violence of slanderers, and to provide assistance to foreigners, orphans, and widows (who are more easily oppressed by the powerful). And in order to impose a greater care of the commandments of God upon them, he said: Do not be distressed, so that you not only do not rescue, but also do not even allow others to be distressed through your connivance. And do not shed innocent blood in this place. For punishing murderers, sacrilegious, and poisoners is not the shedding of blood, but the ministry of the laws. If you do these things, O kings of Judah, you will maintain your former power, and you will enter the gates of Jerusalem with ambition. But if you refuse to do so, O royal household, the cruelty will not be so much of the Lord as it will be of your will, so that the whole city will be reduced to desolation. Let the bishops, along with their associates the presbyters and deacons, and all the ecclesiastical order, understand whatever has been said to the royal household, so that if they do what has been commanded and, among other things, do not shed innocent blood, causing offense to the least of these and striking the consciences of each individual, they may obtain the dignity entrusted to them by the Lord. But if they refuse and despise, let them themselves reduce the Church of God to solitude. And they enter by the gates of Jerusalem from the lineage of David, and they sit upon his throne, which is interpreted as strong by hand, and they ascend in chariots and horses, when they restrain both their own and the disturbances of the people, and in an orderly manner they enter the Church, with the chorus of many virtues, and singing in harmony from every side. And to believe that this is true, he swears by himself, because, according to the Apostle, he has no one greater by whom he may swear (Heb. VI).
