(Chapter 19, verses 1 onwards) And you, take up a lamentation for the princes of Israel, and say: Why did your mother, a lioness, lie down among lions? In the midst of young lions she raised her cubs. And one of her cubs grew up, he became a lion and learned to catch prey and devour men. The nations heard about him and captured him in their own traps, and they brought him with chains to the land of Egypt. When she saw that she had been frustrated and her hope was lost, she took one of her cubs and made him a lion. He who walked among lions, became a lion. He learned to capture prey and devour men. He learned to make widows and turn their cities into deserts, and the land was laid waste, and its fullness, by the roar of his voice. And nations from all provinces gathered against him and spread their nets over him; he was captured in their wounds. And they put him in a cage, they led him in chains to the king of Babylon, and they sent him to prison so that his voice would no longer be heard on the mountains of Israel. LXX: And you shall take up a lamentation for the prince of Israel, and you shall say: What was your mother's lioness? She has grown up among lions and has brought up her cubs among lions. And one of her cubs has come up: he has become a lion, and he has learned to catch the prey. He devours people, and the nations have heard of him. He has been trapped in their pits, and they have brought him with hooks to the land of Egypt. And when she saw that she was taken captive and her hope was lost, she took another of her cubs and made him a lion. And he went about among lions. He became a lion, and learned to seize prey. He devoured men, and fed on their audacity. He brought their cities to desolation, and laid waste to the land and its abundance with the sound of his roaring. Nations from all around set traps for him, and spread their nets over him. He was captured in their corruption, and they put him in a cage. He was brought to the king of Babylon in chains, and they brought him into prison, so that his voice would no longer be heard on the mountains of Israel. I know that in this place I have read a multitude of explanations, and hindered by such obscurities, that it has not so much revealed as enveloped the reading, while all the writings refer to opposing strengths, and in heavenly Jerusalem describes lions and battles: how one of them is captured, and another is placed in his stead, and he provides many testimonies: that the devil and his companions are often called lions, as in that passage about the apostle Peter: Our adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, goes about seeking whom he may devour (1 Peter 5:8); and in the Psalms: Do not give the soul of your confession to wild beasts (Psalm 73:19). Certainly, when it comes to history, it is said that Johanan, the son of Carea, was taken to Egypt: how he was called a lion while fleeing with a few, I do not know; and the other lion, Zedekiah, who was also taken to Babylon. However, leaving such explanations to the judgment of the reader, let us say that the prophet predicts not so much the future as he narrates the past. For after the sixth year of Zedekiah (for immediately afterwards we read: And it came to pass in the seventh year, in the fifth month, on the tenth day) a lamentation is made over the princes, or over the prince of Israel, and it is said: Why has your mother the lioness lain among the lions? Therefore, the lamentation is over the princes, namely all those who are descended from the line of Josiah. The mother of the princes of Jerusalem is called a lioness, who gave birth to and nursed little lions: and she brought up one of her little lions, and made him a lion, signifying Joachaz the son of Josiah, whom Pharaoh Neco took to Egypt, and in his place made Joakim. After his death, Jechoniah his son was made king, and he was carried off to Babylon with his mother and the nobles of the city by Nebuchadnezzar: and from him is born Salathiel, the father of Zerubbabel, who received his name because he was born in Babylon (2 Kings 23). And it is clear that under the metaphor of the lioness, lion cubs, and lion, and again of another lion, those things which had already happened at that time when this prophet was speaking are described. For after he had taken Jerusalem from the royal lineage of Joachaz son of Josiah and made him king, he became so cruel in a short time that he is said to have metaphorically seized prey and devoured men. When an Egyptian came to him, he captured him not without wounds, either in a pit, as is specifically stated in Hebrew, in order to preserve the metaphorical capture of lions, which are always caught in pits. And he brought him in chains or shackles to the land of Egypt, and there he died. When his mother, who had borne him, who had raised him, who had established him as king, saw this, her hope was destroyed. She took one of the other kings, Jechoniah, son of Jehoiakim, and made him king. He, imitating the cruelty of his predecessor, is described as savage like a lion, as he devoured men, made many widows, led cities to ruin; and at the sound of his roar, the whole province was terrified, so that nations gathered around him, spread their nets over him, captured him in a pit, put him in a cage and in chains. Not that Jechoniah experienced this, for he himself surrendered to the king of Babylon and was carried off to Chaldea; but this translation is kept like that of a lion, who is caught in pits, bound in chains, and kept in cages. Furthermore, according to history: we read this about Zedekiah, who was appointed king of Jerusalem after Jehoiachin. And this is the reason why, because chains are mentioned, and a cage, and a prison is named, most people understand it to refer to Zedekiah rather than Jehoiachin. Therefore, he was saved in prison, not killed, and only removed from the kingdom. However, the history tells us that Zedekiah, being blind, was taken to Babylon, and there he was immediately killed.
