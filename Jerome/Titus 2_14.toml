He gave himself for us that he might make a periousion people (for thus is the term in Greek for “peculiar”) and that he might make them the emulator of good works. Though I have often pondered this term periousion and have sought after clues to its meaning in secular writers, I have come up with nothing. Thus, I have come to see that the apostle’s reference is primarily to the Old Testament.… It carries the meaning of “emulator of good works” through the special status conferred by the blood of Christ.
