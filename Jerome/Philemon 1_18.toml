But if anyone has wronged you, or owes you anything, charge that to me. As an imitator of his master, and having Christ speaking in him, he ought to do the things which Christ did according to his ability. For if he bore our weaknesses and suffered our wounds, the Apostle rightly opposes himself on behalf of Onesimus and promises what he owed. But as we have said above, all that which was taken away by theft and lost through luxury could not be made right, which Philemon valued greatly while he received his runaway slave, lost money and eternal brother, thus making himself a debtor to the Apostle through him.
