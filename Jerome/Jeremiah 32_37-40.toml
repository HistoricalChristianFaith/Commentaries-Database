(Verse 37 and following) Behold, I will gather them from all the lands to which I have driven them in my anger, in my wrath, and in great indignation, and I will bring them back to this place and make them dwell securely. They will be my people, and I will be their God. And I will give them one heart and one way, that they may fear me forever, for their own good and for the good of their children after them. And I will make an everlasting covenant with them, and I will not turn away from doing good to them. And I will put the fear of me in their hearts, that they may not turn from me. And I will rejoice over them, when I have done good to them (or when I have visited them, to do good to them). And I will plant them in this land in truth (or in faith), with all my heart and with all my soul. Many thought this at the time of Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, and Joshua, the son of Jozadak, the high priest, when Haggai and Zechariah prophesied during the time of the completion of the Temple under the priest Ezra, and the walls were rebuilt under Nehemiah, that those whom He had cast out in anger, wrath, and great indignation from Jerusalem, and had scattered throughout the whole world, He had afterwards made them dwell confidently and be a people of God; and that the Lord had been their God, and the other things that the Scripture contains. But how can this be adapted to that time: That I will make them dwell confidently, and I will strike for them an everlasting covenant, or I will establish for them an eternal testament, cannot be thoroughly approved: indeed, those whom we have read and holy history narrates were often taken captive not only by neighboring nations, but also by the Persians and Macedonians, and by the Egyptians and Romans, and until now they serve. Therefore, all things must be referred to the advent of the Savior: which we see fulfilled in our time of faith, and the election of the remnant has been preserved according to the Apostle (Romans 9). And those who confidently dwell in Christ have been given one heart, according to what is written: Now the company of those who believed were of one heart and soul (Acts IV, 32). And he said, I am the way, the truth, and the life (John XIV, 6). And let them fear me all the days. For the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom (Proverbs IX). To all he said: if it does not fit with the Jews, it must be taken from our people: to whom it was, is, and will be good, not only to themselves, but also to their children after them. For He made an everlasting covenant with us and will not cease to show us kindness. And what follows: “And I will put my fear into their hearts, that they shall not depart from me,” (Jeremiah 32:40) He grants free will to choose, yet the fear that is given remains as a grace from the giver. And when I do good to them, I will rejoice. For He rejoices because He sees His creation saved. Hence, there is joy in heaven among the angels over one sinner doing penance. (Luke 15) And I will plant them, says [the Lord], in this land in truth, or (as the Septuagint translated it) in faith, so that it properly signifies the Christian people whose religion is faith. With all my heart, and with all my soul. If the words of the Savior are true, it is rightly believed that his heart and soul say, in the Gospel: I have the power to lay down my life, and I have the power to take it up again (John 10:18). But if we understand it from the perspective of God the Father, it is to be understood according to that saying: My soul hates your new moons and your sabbaths, and your festivals.
