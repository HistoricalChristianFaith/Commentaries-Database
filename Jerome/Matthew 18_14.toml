(Verse 14) So it is not the will of your Father who is in heaven that one of these little ones should perish. He refers to the previously stated proposition, of which he said: See that you do not despise one of these little ones; and he teaches this by means of a placed parable, so that the little ones may not be despised. And in what he says: It is not the will of your Father that one of these little ones should perish: whenever one of these little ones perishes, it is shown that it is not by the will of the Father.
