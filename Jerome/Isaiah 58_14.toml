(Verse 14.) Then you will delight in the Lord [Vulg. the Lord); and I will lift you up above the heights of the earth, and I will feed you with the inheritance of Jacob your father. For the mouth of the Lord has spoken. LXX: And you will trust in the Lord: and he will exalt you above the good things of the earth, and he will feed you with the inheritance of Jacob your father. For the mouth of the Lord has spoken. After you have called the delicate Sabbaths and have not moved your foot on the Sabbath to do servile work, nor have you spoken a word, that is, you have always been silent, and have fulfilled what is commanded: Restrain your tongue from evil, and let your lips not speak deceit (Psalm 34:14): then you will delight in the Lord and see that you are fulfilled: Delight in the Lord, and he will grant the desires of your heart (Psalm 37:4). Whether you have confidence in the Lord, according to what is written: Blessed is the one who trusts in the Lord. And in Jeremiah: Blessed is the man who trusts in the Lord, and the Lord will be his hope (Jeremiah 17:7). And elsewhere: It is good to trust in the Lord rather than to trust in man (Psalm 118:8). And the Lord will lift you up and exalt you above the heights and the good things of the earth. For the earth is soft, and the earth of the living is not downwards, but upwards. Finally, to Lot fleeing from the valley of Sodom and Gomorrah, it is said: Make yourself safe on the mountain (Genesis 19). And when he reached there, the sun rose for him in Segor. Concerning this land, the Lord said: Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth (Matthew 5:4): and many other things that we have frequently mentioned, among which is this: Honor your father and your mother, and you will live long on the earth that the Lord your God has given you (Exodus 20:12). Which cannot be completely true according to the letter. For many honor their parents and die quickly, while others who are parricides live for a long time. But that the land is situated in the heights, let us briefly recall the 36th Psalm, in which it is written: The meek shall inherit the earth, and shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace. After this, it is added: Wait for the Lord, and keep his ways: and he will exalt you, that you may possess the earth (Psalm 37:11): concerning which it is sung in another place, The righteous shall inherit the earth, and shall dwell on it forever and ever (ibid., 34). Which in itself is also impossible. For if the earth shall pass away, how can the righteous dwell on it forever and ever? From this we learn that there is a land that is situated in the heights. After this, it is added: And I will feed, or rather, the Lord will feed you with the inheritance of Jacob your father. For just as he who has faith is called the son of Abraham, so he who suppresses vices and sins is called the son of Jacob. And the one who imitates someone's virtue is called their son. But the good things of the land, which is situated in the heights, with which the son of Jacob is satisfied, must be understood as those things which eye has not seen, nor ear heard, nor have they entered into the heart of man (1 Corinthians 2). Concerning these, it is written in the Letter to the Hebrews: For those who say such things declare plainly that they seek a homeland: and if, indeed, they sought one, from which they had departed, they would have had an opportunity to return to it. But now they desire a better homeland, that is, a heavenly Jerusalem (Hebrews 11:14 et seqq.). From this we learn that the fable of a thousand years, in which again marriages and food and the conversation of earthly life are promised, must be rejected. For if in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like the angels; for they are sons of the resurrection (Matthew 22); and concerning the belly and food, the Apostle says: Food for the belly, and the belly for foods: but God will destroy both it and them (1 Corinthians 6:13), how can we seek the vices of the former mortal and corrupt flesh again, with an incorrupt and spiritual and immortal body? And we say these things, not because we deny the substance of the glorified body, but in order to completely remove the former works in those who are like the angels. Otherwise, even in this still existing body, through fasting and continence, and perpetual chastity and charity, we imitate the angelic virtues, and yet we do not lose the substance of our bodies. In order to believe that all these things will come to pass, let us know that they have been promised by God, whose mouth has spoken: so that just as in the hands there is activity, and in the feet there is movement, and in the belly there is generation, and in the ears and eyes there is hearing and seeing: so in the mouth let us understand the word of God.
