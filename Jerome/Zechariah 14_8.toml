(Verse 8.) And it shall be in that day, living waters shall come out from Jerusalem, half of them toward the eastern sea, and half of them toward the western sea; in summer and in winter it shall be. And the Lord shall be king over all the earth.\n\nLXX: In that day living waters shall go out from Jerusalem, half of them toward the first sea and half of them toward the last sea; in summer and in spring it shall be so; and the Lord shall be king over all the earth.\n\nAt that time (for this refers to the day that is known to the Lord alone, in which there will be no succession of light and darkness; but there will be perpetual light, as it is written in the Apocalypse: And the city shall have no need of the sun, neither of the moon, to shine in it; for the Lord God giveth it light (Rev. 21:23))), living waters shall come forth from Jerusalem, of which we have discussed previously, presenting the testimony of Ezekiel, of which half shall go toward the eastern sea, which the Greek books call the Asphaltic Lake, commonly known as the Dead Sea, because nothing can live in its waters. And the middle part leads to the farthest sea, which leads to Egypt, and it makes the shores of Palestine. In summer, he says, and in winter it will be so, that these waters which flow out from Jerusalem will not be frozen by the winter's cold, nor will they be dried up by the excessive heat of summer: although they have changed the springtime of winter, which does not fit the distinction of summer. And when the life-giving waters have entered both seas, and have softened the bitter waters with a sweet river: then the Lord will be king over all the earth. The water that comes forth from Jerusalem, that is, from the Church, indicates the teaching of the Savior: For out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem (Isaiah 2:3); according to what is written elsewhere: The earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea (Ibid., 11:9). The middle part of these waters shall go to the Eastern Sea, to the people of the Circumcision, who were chosen in the apostles and through the apostles; and the middle part to the Western Sea, so that those who sit down with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob may come from the East and the West. Certainly, let us understand the ancient Testament and the new Testament as the Eastern Sea and the Western Sea, which, unless it is sweetened by the river of the Savior and His spiritual understanding, is very bitter; with the letter dying, and the spirit giving life (Matthew 8). And what follows: In summer and in winter they shall be, is understood the living waters that come forth from Jerusalem, so that even in peace and in persecutions these living waters may not cease to flow. Whether because the Seventy translated it thus, or because in summer and in spring it will be as we say, during that time there will be no winter, but only spring and everlasting summer, when the voice of the turtledove will be heard in our land, and the fig tree will bring forth its ripening fruit, and the vineyards will flourish, and winter will pass away, and the rain will cease, and it will leave for itself (Song of Songs 2). During that time, spring will be necessary, because the flowers will appear in our land so that we may celebrate Easter and Pentecost, during which we pass from earthly things to heavenly things, and offer all our fruits to God. In the winter, the end of the season is the beginning of spring; in Pentecost, the beginning of summer, when we offer the labors of our hands and the fruits to God. Concerning this summer and everlasting spring, the righteous speaks to the Lord: 'You have created the dawn and the sun, you have shaped the summer and the spring' (Psalm 73:16, 17). Then the Lord will be king over all the earth, when we say: 'The Lord reigns, let the earth rejoice' (Psalm 97:1). And again: 'Tell it among the nations, the Lord reigns.' For indeed, He has established the course of the earth, which shall not be moved (Ps. XCV, 10). But the true understanding of the teaching of the Savior regarding the living water will be known by those who drink it and hear the Savior preaching: If anyone drinks of the water that I will give him, it shall become in him a fountain of living water, springing up unto eternal life (John IV, 14). And again: Whoever believes in Me (as the Scripture has said), out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water (John VII, 38). For just as one who drinks of his teaching will have within him a living fountain, so one who believes in him, according to what is contained in the words of Scripture, rivers of living water will flow out of his belly. Many refer the living waters to baptism, which are to be given to those thirsting in spring and summer, that is, in Easter and Pentecost, when what is written will be fulfilled: 'Be cleansed, become pure' (Isaiah 1:16).
