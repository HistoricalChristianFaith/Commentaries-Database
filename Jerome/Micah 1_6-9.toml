(Verse 6 onwards): And I will make Samaria a heap of stones in the field, when a vineyard is planted, and I will pour down her stones into the valley, and will lay bare her foundations. And all her carved images shall be beaten to pieces, and all her wages shall be burned with fire, and all her idols will I lay desolate: for she gathered it of the hire of an harlot, and they shall return to the hire of a harlot. Therefore I will wail and howl, I will go stripped and naked: I will make a wailing like the dragons, and mourning as the owls. For her wound is incurable; for it is come unto Judah; he is come unto the gate of my people, even to Jerusalem. LXX: And I will make Samaria a caretaker of fruits in the field, and a plantation of vineyards; and I will uncover its foundations and reveal all of its carved images, and all of its wages will be burned with fire, and all of its idols I will put to destruction, because it gathered them from the wages of prostitution, and destroyed them with the wages of prostitution. Because of this, it will lament and mourn, it will go barefoot and naked, it will make a lamentation like the dragons, and a mourning like the daughters of Sirens, because its wound has obtained, because it has come to Judah and has touched the gate of my people, even Jerusalem. According to the order of sins, there is an order of punishments. Samaria was the first to sin, and they made idols and worshiped calves instead of the Lord: therefore, let it perish first. I will destroy it when the Assyrians come, and I will make it like a heap of stones when a vineyard is planted, so that it is turned into mounds. And I will remove its stones into the valley. It was indeed situated in the mountains, where Sebaste is now, and it is where the bones of the holy John the Baptist are buried. And I will reveal its foundations. Such will be the ruin and the destruction of the city, that not only the walls and buildings will collapse, but even the foundations will be exposed to the very last stone. And all its sculptures and treasures, which were gathered by various kings, will be brought down and burned by fire, and reduced to nothingness. For the riches and abundant possessions, which were presumed to be the result of idolatry, will be taken to another harlot, that is, to Nineveh. Just as they committed fornication with the idols they made in their own land, so they will go to another land of idols and prostitution, that is, to the Assyrians. So far concerning Samaria. And because the same calamity will happen to Jerusalem (for it also sinned with a similar error, abandoning its God and making idols), therefore the prophet attributes a kind of personification to God, and under his own persona he expresses a lamenting affection, and says: About this I will mourn and wail; I will go stripped and naked (for I have lost ten tribes), and I will make a lamentation like jackals, and mourning like ostriches. For just as dragons roar with a terrifying hiss, according to the accounts of those who have written about natural history, at the time when they are defeated by elephants; and just as ostriches are forgetful of their eggs, as if they had not laid them, and leave their young to be trampled on by the feet of beasts in the sand (Job 39); as it is more fully described in the book of Job: so I also, stripped of children and naked, will go on my way. And I shall do this, because her wound is desperate, that is, Samaria. And the same sin, or rather the same punishment of sin, which destroyed Samaria, will come even to Judah, and even to the gate of my city Jerusalem. For just as Samaria was overthrown by the Assyrians, so Judah and Jerusalem will be overthrown by the Chaldeans. And indeed, as we understand, Samaria was once the Church of heretics, which, separated from God, became a gathering of the people; the Lord himself threatens that he will make it a place for the keeping of apples, an orchard and a planting ground for a vineyard. For it is much better to overthrow an useless city, and its stones with which it was built, to be thrown down, and to prepare it as an orchard and a plantation of vineyards, than to remain in the worst kind of construction. For when it has been destroyed, and its foundations have been revealed (by which it seemed to hide its mysteries, and to have firm doctrines on which it stood, and all idols appeared to have a kind of beauty, composed by skillful craftsmanship, and have been cut down by the ministers of God, that is, by the Ecclesiastical men), then in the place of the worst construction, various fruits of the Church will be born, and not only will they be born, but they will also be guarded, and the vineyard of Sorek will be planted, from which wine will be made, which the Lord promised to drink in the kingdom of the Father (Mark 14). Not only, however, will the foundations of that which was previously hidden in the earth be opened and brought forth into the open, and the idols which they had fashioned for themselves be overthrown; but even the glory and wealth which she seemed to possess through her fornication and her error will be consumed by my fire, of which I spoke in the Gospel: I have come to cast fire upon the earth, and how I wish that it were already kindled (Luke 12:49): and they shall be burned up and reduced to nothing, for they have been contracted not from the truth of doctrines, but from the fornication of the soul and from errors collected from here and there. For heretics, indeed, do not have riches coming from paternal inheritance, but daily they find what they cultivate, and they fashion idols for themselves with skillful hand and curious mind. Therefore, when their field has been converted into a custody of fruits, and prepared for vineyards, and the stones with which the city was built have been removed into the depths, and their foundations have been revealed, and all the carved and burnt images, and the rewards that they promised themselves with empty hope, and whatever they seemed to worship as God, have been reduced to nothing, because in the fornication of the soul, they had obtained all their price for themselves: then, understanding their former error, having turned back upon themselves, they will lament in those things at which they previously laughed, and they will mourn in those things in which before, in a certain manner, they rejoiced in their fornication. And the deponents will cast off from their feet whatever is deadly, and they will be barefoot, for the ground on which they stand is holy, and they will throw away all the clothes of their fornication, and they will be naked so that they can be clothed in the garment of Christ, and they will lament like dragons. For sometimes even dragons lament when they see the greatest dragon captured and hanging on the hook of a fisherman, and the sea deserted. And they shall lament like the daughters of the Sirens, for the songs of heretics are sweet, and deceive the people with their sweet voices. None can pass by their songs unless they stop up their ears and become deaf. Therefore, Samaria shall weep and mourn for these things, for the arrow of the Lord has wounded her, and she shall recognize the error of her ways. Not only has she sinned herself, but she also desires to bring her iniquity and error into the gates of Judah. It is said of her: She came up to Judea and touched up to the gates of my people, up to Jerusalem. She touched the gates, as we understand them with our ears. However, she could not enter the middle city: for if she had entered, she would have made Samaria from Jerusalem. How often we see some in the Church scandalized by the heretical teachings and seeking how to answer their questions, yet not leaving the Church, let us say, she came to Samaria, or the region of Samaria up to the confessing people, up to the ears of God's people, up to the ears of Jerusalem. For what is said touches as well the gates of my people, it is to be understood in general, so that it may be supplied, it also touches even the gates of Jerusalem. Up to this point, against Samaria and against Jerusalem, let us see the rest, which follows.
