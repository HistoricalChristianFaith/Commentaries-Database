But if He forbids us to judge, how then does Paul judge the Corinthian who had committed uncleanness? Or Peter convict Ananias and Sapphira of falsehood?

(Chapter VII - Verses 1, 2) Do not judge, so that you may not be judged. For with the judgment you judge, you will be judged; and with the measure you use, it will be measured to you. If judging is prohibited, what is the consequence of Paul judging the fornicator in Corinth (1 Cor. 5), and Peter rebuking Ananias and Sapphira for lying (Acts 5)? But he shows what he prohibits from the consequences, saying: just as you judge, you will be judged. Therefore, he did not prohibit judgment, but taught it.
