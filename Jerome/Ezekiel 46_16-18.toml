(Verse 16, 17 and following) Thus says the Lord God: If a prince (or leader) gives a gift to someone from his own sons, it shall be the inheritance of his sons; they shall possess it as an inheritance. But if he gives a legacy from his own inheritance to one of his servants, it shall belong to him until the year of release (for which Theodotius put the Hebrew word 'Deror'), but it shall return to the prince; however, the inheritance shall belong to his son. And the prince shall not take the inheritance of the people by violence, and from their possession: but out of his own possession he shall give an inheritance to his sons: that my people may not be scattered each one from his possession. Thus far the discourse is concerning the prince, now precepts are given concerning his heirs: indeed concerning gifts, inheritance, and legacies, to whom he ought to give them, and whose possession is either for a time, or eternal. If, says he, he shall give a gift or inheritance to his sons, they shall possess it: because it is due to them by the right of succession, and possession cannot pass from one to another. But if he has given any of his servants as a legatee, he shall possess them as long as the remission year, which is called the Year of Release (), or the jubilee, which is the fiftieth year, comes: when all sales and gifts revert to the previous owners: so that the servant has the use for a time, and the ownership of the possession of the prince's sons. But what follows: And the prince shall not take from the inheritance of the people by violence (Lev. XXIII), or as the Septuagint has translated, to oppress them, or as Aquila and Symmachus, to afflict and distress them: but he shall give his inheritance to his sons from his own possession: this rebukes not only the priests and princes of that time, but also our own, who become richer by the dignity of the priesthood and, besides what is owed to them by the Lord's disposition, take away from the poor by violence: or under the name of honor, strip the wealthy, so that they also leave nothing to their own sons, to whom paternal inheritance is due, except what has been left to them by their parents. Therefore, whoever is a wealthier priest, when he comes to the priesthood, should not give whatever excess he has to his children, but to the poor, and to holy brothers, and to the faithful domestic servants, who surpass the merits of children, so that he may render to the Lord what belongs to the Lord, who speaks in the Gospel: Whatever you have done to the least of these, you have done to me (Matt. 25:40). For he is received as a guest in the poor; he is visited in prison; he is clothed in nakedness; he drinks when thirsty; he is satiated when hungry. So that my people, he says, may not be scattered from their possession. For if the ruler has the power, either to receive or to take by force, or to hold under the pretext of honor, that which does not belong to him, and to leave it to his children, the people who were gathered in the name of God will be scattered and torn apart: either according to the Law, so that the inheritance of one gradually passes to another, and the cord of division perishes, through which perhaps the inheritance comes to each individual. Therefore, he disperses the people of God and takes away from them the eternal possession of faith, who abandons the gifts or goods of others, either through theft, robbery, flattery, seduction, or under the pretext of religion, to his own children, brothers, and relatives.
