We should not think that the glorious throne of God is only the throne of the temple, which was repeatedly destroyed, but that it is also every saint who is cast down and destroyed when he offends God by his multitude of sins, according to what is written: “You have cast his throne to the ground.” Nevertheless, the one who perishes from his own guilt is sustained by the clemency of the Lord, whereby the severity of the sentence is altered, lest the Lord invalidate his covenant in which he promised to be our coming salvation.

(Verse 21.) Do not put us to shame because of your name, and do not bring disgrace upon us. Remember your glorious throne; do not invalidate your covenant with us. We consider not only the Temple of Judah, which has often been destroyed, as the seat of your glory, but also every holy place where, as it is written, you threw down his throne to the ground. It is thrown down and destroyed when it offends God with the multitude of its sins. But even one who perishes by his own fault is sustained by the mercy of the Lord, which changes the severity of the sentence if the Lord invalidates his covenant by which he promised that we would be saved.
