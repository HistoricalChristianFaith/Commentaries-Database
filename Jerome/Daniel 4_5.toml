Verse 5. "'I beheld a dream which terrified me, and my thoughts while upon my bed...'" Let our opponents answer what kind of a dream the hostile power would have seen, unless perhaps everything he appears to possess in this world is a mere shadowy dream.

"'And the visions of my head greatly disturbed me.'" Note how Nebuchadnezzar realized that his visions were not those of his eyes and heart, but rather of his head, because it was for the glory of God's future servants that these secrets were being revealed to him.
