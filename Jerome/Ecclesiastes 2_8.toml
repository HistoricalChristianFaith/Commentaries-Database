"I
amassed even silver and gold for myself, and the treasure of kings and the
provinces; I provided myself with various singers and musical instruments, and
with every human luxury- chests and chests of them."  Divine scripture
always places silver and gold above speech and meaning. The dove in the sixty-seventh Psalm
represents this too, which is interpreted as a spirit, and is more noticeable
because of its silver wings, so that it hides the underlying significance of
the pallor of gold. But he gathers the
treasures of kings and of the provinces or kingdoms into the Church of
believers. He refers to those kings
about whom the psalmist writes "the kings of the earth were there and the
chiefs gathered together" [Ps. 2, 2.]. And he refers to those kingdoms to which the
Saviour orders us to raise our eyes [Cfr John 4.],
since now they burn with fear. The
treasures of kings can be called both the doctrines of philosophers and also
secular knowledge [Cfr I Cor. 1.],
which Ecclesiastes understands well: he takes hold of the wise men in their
wisdom, and squanders the wisdom of the wise, and reproves the discretion of
the prudent. The choirboys and girls are
those who sing with vitality and with intelligence. A male singer sings like a man who is both
strong and spiritual about heavenly matters. 
But a girl flits about the matter, which the Greeks call "hulen". 
Nor is she able to raise her voice loudly into the air. Therefore wherever a woman is mentioned in
the Scriptures and the weaker sex, we are to translate it according to an
understanding of the context. Pharaoh
does not want the male children to be allowed to live for example, but only the
females in this matter. [Cfr Ex. 1, 16.] And another point is that none of the saints
is said to have had a daughter [Cfr Num. 26,32 ; 27, 3.],
and it is only Salphaat, who died for his sins, that had all girls. Jacob is the father of one daughter amongst
the twelve patriarchs, but is endangered by her. [Cfr Gen. 30, 21 ; 34.] The pleasures also of mankind over wisdom
must be understood, which have many fruits and desires like paradise. We are admonished against them, saying,
"take delight in the Lord and he will give you the request of your
heart" [Ps. 36, 4.],
and in another place, "you will drink them as the torrent of your
desire". [Ps. 35, 9.] (I had wanted to shun reference to the female
sex, and even now use the distinction of the male, because the Latin language
does not take readily to this.) Aquila
explains about the wine-pourers, male and female, in a manner very different to
the fashion written here. For Solomon is
not naming the sexes of man, clearly either male or female, but types of dish,
and he calls them "kulikion" and "kulikia", which is written in Hebrew as "sadda "and "saddoth". Then Symmachus, who
was not able to express the idea word for word, translates this in a similar
way: "types of table and equipment". Therefore Solomon is believed to have had
either pitchers, wine goblets, or bowls arranged in chests, and which were
ornate with gold and with jewels. And he
drank from a "kulikio" in one, (that
is, a bowl) and from "kilikiois" in
other places, which are clearly smaller dishes; and the crowd of drinkers
received wine at the hands of his servants. 
Because we explain Ecclesiastes as being Christ, therefore wisdom,
having mingled her wine (as it says in Proverbs) calls out to those who wander
to come to her.  [Cfr Prov. 9, 2.3.] Now we must see the body of the Lord as a
very great bowl, in which is not pure divinity as there is in heaven, but there
God is blended with humanity on account of us, and wisdom is then poured out by
the apostles to smaller "kulikia",
small goblets and bowls held by believers throughout the world.
