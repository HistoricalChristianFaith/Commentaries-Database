(Verse 4, 5.) Behold, I have given him as a witness to the peoples, a leader and instructor to the nations. Behold, you shall call a nation that you do not know, and a nation that did not know you shall run to you, because of the Lord your God, and of the Holy One of Israel, for he has glorified you. See, I have given him as a witness to the nations, a prince and ruler of the nations; nations that did not know you will call upon you, and peoples who do not know you will seek refuge with you, because of the Lord your God, the Holy One of Israel, who has glorified you. He had provoked the Jewish people to believe, so that they would incline their ear and accept the eternal covenant that the Lord had promised to David, and to Abraham, and to his descendants, saying: 'In your seed all the nations will be blessed' (Genesis 22:18). The apostle Paul, explaining this, says, 'He did not say "seeds," but "seed," which is Christ' (Galatians 3:16). And because he knew that the unbelieving Jews would believe, he turned to the Gentiles, and says that he sent his Son as a witness to all the nations, who would announce his commandments and teachings to the people. He speaks of himself, saying, 'This Gospel must be preached in the whole world, as a testimony to all the nations' (Matthew 24:14). Finally, he refutes Pilate, who was acting arrogantly, with this statement: 'For this I was born, and for this I have come into the world, to testify to the truth' (John 18:37). Concerning whom the Apostle Paul writes to Timothy: 'For there is one God, and there is one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus, who gave himself as a ransom for all, the testimony to which was given at the proper time' (1 Timothy 2:5). Therefore, everything that is said must be referred to him, who, like a sheep led to the slaughter, and like a lamb before its shearer is silent, did not open his mouth. Concerning which it is said above: We saw him, and he had no form nor comeliness (Isaiah 53:2); and: He himself bore our sins and suffers for us. Those who previously did not know him have taken refuge in him, saying: Our God is our refuge and strength (Psalm 46:1); and again: Lord, you have been our dwelling place in all generations (Psalm 90:1). About their faith and what was said above, we read: Those to whom it has not been proclaimed will see, and those who have not heard will understand. This is the witness of all that the Father promised and provided for the world, the mystery of which Paul comprehends in his letter to the Ephesians: God, he says, is the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the glory (Eph. I, 3). And it is written: For the sake of the Lord your God and the Holy One of Israel, who has glorified you, and the glory that he had before the world was made. About whom the Prophet also testifies: The glory of God will appear (Heb. I), who is the splendor of glory and the form of his substance, when every tongue confesses that the Lord Jesus is in the glory of the Father (Phil. II). Who answered the Son, demanding the glory that he had before: And I have glorified, and will glorify. About whom also the Apostle John says: We have seen, he says, his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth (John 12:28; 1:14). Therefore, when he speaks of himself: In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, he is called the Father of glory; but when he speaks of himself who says in the Gospel: Why do you persecute me, a man who speaks the truth to you (John 8:4)? He is called the God of our Lord Jesus Christ. Not that there is one and another (which is the worst of many errors), but that the same Son of God, now in the glory of his divinity, now in our nature, which he deigned to assume, speaks with emotions.
