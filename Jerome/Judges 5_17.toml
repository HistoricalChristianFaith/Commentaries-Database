(Judges 5:17) Gad remained beyond the Jordan. And this is set forth as a reproach because while Reuben remained, Gad remained with him of equal mind. And Dan was free with ships. For seeing that the tribes of Reuben and Gad did not go with their brothers to battle, being terrified by fear, he took flight by being free with ships. Asher dwelt on the seashore and stayed in the ports. Likewise, this is set forth as a reproach because Asher, while dwelling on the seashore, stayed in the ports, choosing instead to flee rather than fight with his brothers.
