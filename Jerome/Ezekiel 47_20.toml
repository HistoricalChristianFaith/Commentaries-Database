(Verse 20) And the plague of the sea, the great sea from the border in a straight line, until you come to Emath, this is the plague of the sea. Of which the Book of Numbers writes more clearly and briefly. But the western plague will begin from the great sea and will conclude at the very end, that is, from sea to sea: to the torrent, namely the Rhinocorura, which flows into the sea, up to the place that is opposite the city of Emath in Syria, of which we have spoken above. But the setting sun, according to the laws of tropology, is always in the sea: always in the salt and waves, where shipwrecks occur daily, and the deaths of the wretched, and the loss of wealth and goods, and yet when we have endured all these with patience, we come straight to Emath, that is, to the truth of the Lord, who, having conquered persecutions, has promised us eternal rewards.
