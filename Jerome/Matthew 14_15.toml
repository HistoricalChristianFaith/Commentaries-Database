(Verse 15.) And when evening had come, his disciples approached him, saying: This place is deserted, and the hour has already passed. Send away the crowds so that they may go into the villages and buy themselves food. All things are full of mysteries. He departed from Judea and came to a deserted place. The crowds followed him, leaving their cities behind. Jesus went out to them, had compassion on the crowds, and cured their sick. And he did this not in the morning, not as the day was growing, not at noon, but in the evening, when the sun of justice had set.
