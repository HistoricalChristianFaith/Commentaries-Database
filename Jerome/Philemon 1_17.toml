"If therefore you have me as a partner, receive him as you would me." Philemon desired to have Paul as a partner, and believing in Christ, he truly wanted to make such progress as to become like Paul, so that he could share his chains with him. Let us consider how much praise Onesimus is given here, how much he is said to have profited: since he must be received in such a way as the Apostle, and so should desire his fellowship, as belonging to Paul. In brief what he says is this: If you want to have me as a partner, have Onesimus also, whom I have as a partner, and my son, whom I have as my own flesh: whom if you do not receive, nor desire to have, you yourself see that you are not able to have me.
