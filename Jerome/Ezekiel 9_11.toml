(Verse 11) And behold, a man who was clothed in linen, who had a writing utensil at his waist, answered saying, 'I have done as you commanded me.' LXX: And behold, a man who was clothed in a long robe and had a belt around his waist, answered and said, 'I have done as you commanded me.' He is the man who was commanded to pass through the midst of Jerusalem and put a mark on the foreheads of the men who sigh and cry over all the abominations that are done within it. He says that he has fulfilled the commandments of the Lord, and has marked the foreheads of the mourners with the seal of the letter Tau (or armed them). But the six men to whom the Lord commanded, saying: Go through the city following him, and strike; show no mercy to anyone until complete destruction, do not report such a thing. For they filled not the sentiment of joy, but of sorrow, which is proven not by words, but by actions. And in this place, instead of ποδήρη, which is translated by the Seventy as a long robe, Theodotion placed the Hebrew word Baddim (); Symmachus, a rope; Aquila, a main robe, or a stole. Symmachus also placed the tablets; Aquila, the inkwell; Theodotius, the helmet.
