"He who
moves about stones will be hurt by them; he who splits logs will be endangered
by them. "In Zechariah sacred stones are moved about
the earth. [Cfr. Zach. 9, 16.] For they do not stay firm in their place, but
revolve, and always inclining to other places, they hasten to move away. The Saviour also teaches about these living
stones in the city of the Apocalypse [Cfr. Apoc. 21, 18-27.],
and the apostle doesn't forget to mention the building of the Church. Therefore if anyone doing wrong by their
heresy, should take away those stones from the building of the Church, then he
will suffer torture afterwards. Aquila
and Symmachus write about this man, and where we have 'he who moves about stones,
will suffer from them', both write, "he who moves stones, will be wounded
by them". But because the Scripture
says very clearly, "he who moves about stones", or 'moves stones', he
does not add 'good' or 'bad'. Moreover
and to the contrary it must be understood, that the man of the Church seemingly
a bishop and elder, (if we are taking this according to the mandate of
Leviticus), took a stone away from the house of lepers, and was obliterated in
dust and ashes. [Cfr. Lev. 14, 45.] And he will suffer for this himself, because
he was forced to take away a stone from the Church of Christ and saying,
(according to the apostle), "to weep with the weeping, to mourn with the
mourners" [Rom. 12, 15.],
and "who is weak, and I burn not?" [II Cor. 11, 29.]. Also cutting wood, he will be endangered by
it. Heretics are non-fruit-bearing wood,
and copse that do not bear fruit. 
Pertaining to this too is that we must not plant a glade in the house of
God, and leafy openings, that is arbours of such sounding words are scorned. However learned and wise a man may be
therefore who chops this wood with the sword of speech, he will be endangered
by it, unless he diligently pays attention. 
This is similar to what follows, this will happen, "if iron is
shaped" and its appearance is changed. 
This means that if his argument is found to be weaker, or if he does not
have a point, in which each argument is well balanced, then the argument of his
heart is blunt. Then the strength of
wickedness will come upon him and fortify him. 
For this is what the Septuagint interprets this passage to mean: it
says, "and he is fortified by strength, and he will begin to have more
wisdom than strength; his wisdom will become strong, and superfluous, but it
will not help him who possesses it.
