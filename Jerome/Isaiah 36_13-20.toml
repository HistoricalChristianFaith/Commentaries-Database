Immediately then, he supplemented this threat with an enticement in order to deceive with counterpromises and temptations those whom he had not conquered with terror, saying on behalf of the king of the Assyrians: “Make peace with me and come to me,” or as we read in the book of Kings: “Do with me what is useful and come to me.” Both have the same meaning. Do, he said, what is to your own advantage and it will accrue to your blessing. In other words: Bless the king of Assyria and praise him, and confess him to be your lord that you might receive a reward. Also, live in your cities and enjoy your crops until I return from Egypt or until I restore captured Libnah. After I come, I will take you to a land much like your own, with grain and wine and oil. But he did not give a name for this land because he could not find an equal to the Promised Land. Yet he promised it nevertheless, for everyone desires to be in the land of his birth. Some think the land that he promised was Media, which has terrain similar in both location and foliage to that of Judea. Then he added: “Where is the god of Hamath and of Arpad and of Sepharvaim? Have they delivered Samaria from my hand?” This shows that Samaria will be subject to them for all of its days and therefore that it should be taken. If, he said, we were easily victorious over the ten tribes who had the protection of so many gods, how much more easily will we conquer you, even lonely Jerusalem, which has the protection of only one God?
