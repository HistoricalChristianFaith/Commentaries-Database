(Verse 12, 13.) And Jesus entered the temple of God and drove out all those who were buying and selling in the temple, and overturned the tables of the money changers and the seats of those selling doves. And He said to them, 'It is written: My house shall be called a house of prayer, but you are making it a den of robbers.' Then Jesus entered the temple area accompanied by the crowd of believers (who had spread their garments so that the colt could walk on them without being harmed). He expelled all those who were selling and buying in the temple, overturned the tables of the money changers, and scattered the seats of those selling doves. And he said to them, quoting from the holy scriptures (Isaiah 56) and (Jeremiah 7), that his Father's house should be a house of prayer and not a den of robbers or a house of merchandise, as it is written in another Gospel (John 2). First of all, it must be known that according to the commands of the most august Law, in the whole world, in the temple of the Lord, and from almost all the regions of the Jews, countless offerings were being sacrificed, especially on festive days, of bulls, rams, and goats; so that the poor would not be without offering, those who offered would present young doves and turtles; it often happened that those who had come from afar did not have victims. Therefore, the priests devised a way to take prey from the people, and they sold all the animals they needed for sacrifices, so that they would sell to those who did not have them, and they themselves would receive them again when bought. He dispersed this band of people who were frequently coming due to their lack of resources, those who were in need of expenses, and not only did they not have offerings, but they didn't even have birds and cheap gifts to buy. So they appointed moneylenders who would lend money under collateral. But because there was a law, as commanded in Leviticus 25 and Deuteronomy 23, that no interest should be received, and borrowed money could not bring any benefit, as it had no gain, and sometimes it could even result in loss, they invented another technique, that they would make 'Collybistas' instead of moneylenders, which the Latin language does not express the exact meaning of the word. Among them, what we call trinkets or cheap gifts are called collybadicuntur. For example, roasted chickpeas, dried grapes, and various types of fruits. Therefore, because the moneylenders, called Collybistae, could not charge interest, they would accept various goods instead of interest, so that they could demand what was not allowed in currency, but could be purchased with these items, as if Ezekiel himself did not preach this, saying: 'You shall not take interest and profits.' (Ezek. XXII, 12). The Lord, seeing such a trade or robbery in his Father's house, was stirred with zeal (as it is written in the 68th Psalm, verse 10: The zeal of thy house hath eaten me up), and he made for himself a whip out of cords, and drove out such a great multitude of people from the temple, saying: It is written: My house shall be called a house of prayer; but you have made it a den of thieves. For he is a thief, and he turns the temple of God into a cave of thieves, who seeks profits from religion, and whose worship is not so much the worship of God as it is an opportunity for business. According to the story, Jesus enters the temple of the Father daily, and drives out all, both bishops and priests and deacons, as well as lay people, and the entire crowd from His Church, and He has only one crime, that of buying and selling. For it is written: Freely you have received, freely give. He also overturns the tables of the money changers. Note, because of the greed of the priests, the altars of God are called the tables of money changers. And he overturned the seats of those who were selling doves, who were selling the grace of the Holy Spirit, and they do everything to devour the subject peoples, of whom it is said (as is said): They devour my people like bread (Ps. 13:4). According to simple understanding, doves were not in seats but in cages, unless perhaps the caretakers of the doves were sitting in seats. But that is completely absurd, because in seats, the dignity of teachers is more clearly indicated, which is reduced to nothing when it is mixed with profits. Concerning the churches, let each one understand concerning themselves. For the Apostle says: You are the temple of God, and the Holy Spirit dwells in you (I Cor. VI, 15, and II Cor. III, 16). Let there be no dealing in the house of our hearts, no buying and selling, no desire for gifts, lest Jesus enters angry and stern, and does not cleanse His temple except by using a whip, so as to make a house of prayer out of a den of thieves and a house of commerce.
