(Judges 5:19) Kings came and fought. The kings of the land of Canaan said, who were subject to King Jabin. The kings of Canaan fought. It repeats the same thing in Tanach. Tanach is indeed a province where the Kishon River is. Near the waters of Megiddo. Megiddo is a city situated on the Kishon River. And what is said, Near the waters of Megiddo, is understood near the Kishon River, the city of Megiddo. Yet they took nothing as plunderers. This is said in mocking, implying that not only did they not obtain any spoils, but they were also unable to save their own lives.
