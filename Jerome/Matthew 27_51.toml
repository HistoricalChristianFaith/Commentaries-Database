(Verse 51.) And behold, the veil of the Temple was torn in two from top to bottom. The veil of the Temple was torn, and all the sacred mysteries of the Law, which were previously covered, were revealed and passed on to the Gentile people. In the Gospel, which we often mention, we read that the threshold of the Temple, of infinite size, was broken and divided. Josephus also reports that the angelic powers, the former guardians of the Temple, together cried out: Let us leave these seats.
