In those days etc. The great clemency of God is astonishing; with the captivity already neat and the Babylonian army besieging Jerusalem, he nevertheless provokes the people to repentance, preferring to save the converted rather than to destroy wrongdoers.

before I. This is not as heresy supposes because Jeremiah existed before his conception, but because the Lord, to whom things not yet made are already made, foreknew that he was going to exist.

before etc. Fruthermore, when he says, "I appointed you a prophet to the nations," he wishes this to be understood: later on in this very prophet, we are going to read that he prophesied not only to Jerusalem but also to many of the surrounding nations.  Certain people understand this passage to be about the Savior, who was in the strictest sense a prophet to the nations and who called all nations through the apostles.  For that one, before being formed in the virgin's womb and coming forth from his mother's body, was truly sanctified in the womb and known in the Father, and the Father was always in Him.

After the beginning of Jeremiah's prophesying, in the thirty-fifth year of his prophetic career, Ezekiel began to prophesy to those who had been taken captive.

The Prophet Jeremiah, for whom this prologue is written, was seen among the Hebrews to be certainly more rustic in style than Isaiah and Hosea and certain other prophets, but equal in meanings, which the same Spirit obviously prophesied. Furthermore, his simplicity of speech happened from the place in which he was born. For he was from Anathoth, which is up to today a village three miles distant from Jerusalem, a priest from priests and sanctified in his motherâ€™s womb, dedicating with her virginity a man of the Gospel to the Church of Christ. This boy began to prophesy the captivity of the city and Judea both not only by the Spirit, but also with eyes of flesh. The Assyrians had already transferred the ten tribes of Israel, and now colonies of gentiles had taken possession of their lands. For this reason he prophesied only in Judah and Benjamin, and he lamented the ruins of his city in a fourfold alphabet, which we have presented in the measure of the meter and in verses. Besides this, the order of visions, which is entirely confused among the Greeks and Latins, we have corrected to the original truth. And the Book of Baruch, his scribe, which is neither read nor found among the Hebrews, we have omitted, standing ready, because of these things, for all the curses from the jealous, to whom it is necessary for me to respond through a separate short work. And I suffer because you think this. Otherwise, for the benefit of the wicked, it was more proper to set a limit for their rage by my silence, rather than any new things written to provoke daily the insanity of the envious.
