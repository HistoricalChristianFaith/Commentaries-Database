(Vrs. 36 seqq.) However, the Angel of God went out and struck down in the Assyrian camp 185,000 men; and when they arose in the morning, behold, all the dead bodies. Then Sennacherib king of Assyria departed and returned to Nineveh, and he lived there. And it came about as he was worshiping in the temple of Nesrach his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer, his sons, killed him with the sword; and they escaped into the land of Ararat. And Esarhaddon his son became king in his place. One hundred and eighty-five thousand brave men are killed by one Angel in one night, and the cruel death of the slain runs rampant without wounds, by the will of God, separating the souls from their bodies. On this, it is written in the Chronicles: And the Lord sent an Angel, who struck down every strong man, warrior, and prince of the army of the king of Assyria: and he returned with disgrace to his own land (2 Chronicles 32:24). He was saved for this reason, so that he would know the power of God and silence the blasphemous mouths: and he became a witness of that majesty, which he had recently condemned. And what he experienced: And they rose in the morning, whether Israelites or the rest of his armies, let us accept: although it is written in the Book of Kings, that when the king himself rose in the morning, he saw all the bodies of the dead (3 Kings 19). Pharaoh also suffered ten plagues in Egypt, so that he might perish in the end: which this person is also going to suffer. For when he returned to the city of Nineveh, the capital of his kingdom, and worshipped in the temple of his god Nesrach, as if he had achieved victory over his enemies, and walked triumphantly and joyfully in the shrine of his false deity, the despiser of the true God is killed in the temple of the false god. It was not the sword that was the weapon of the Angels, which was common to many, but the parricide of his sons. When they fled to the land of Ararat, which is known as Armenia, Asaraddon succeeded his father, whom the Scripture testifies sent inhabitants to Samaria so that the land would not remain uncultivated. But the region of Ararat in Armenia is a plain through which the Araxes River flows, of incredible fertility, near the foothills of the Taurus mountain, which extends all the way there. Therefore, the Ark in which Noah was saved with his children, when the Flood ceased, was not taken to the mountains of Armenia in general, which are called Ararat, but to the highest peaks of the Taurus mountain, which tower over the plains of Ararat.
