(Verse 18 onwards) But I said to their children in the wilderness: Do not follow the commands (or laws) of your fathers, nor keep their judgments, nor be defiled by their idols (or thoughts). I am the Lord your God. Walk in my commands, and keep my judgments, and do them, and sanctify my Sabbaths, that it may be a sign between me and you, and that it may be known (or that you may know) that I am the Lord your God. After the killing of the fathers who fell in the desert, he gives commands to his sons, in whose salvation he had mercy on the fathers. And he said, 'The eye of the Lord should not entirely destroy them and wipe them out, but should preserve the fathers in their sons.' And he testifies to the same things that he spoke to the fathers: that after they have walked in his commandments and kept his judgments and preserved the sanctification of the Sabbath, which is a sign given, then they shall know that he is their Lord God. However, the precepts and legitimate laws of the fathers, and their judgments, signify an unusual error: that they may not imitate the sins of those whose torments they witness.
