(Verse 21, 22.) And it came to pass in the twelfth year, in the tenth month (the Vulgate is silent on the month), on the fifth day of the month of our transmigration (or captivity), that the one who had fled (or been saved) from Jerusalem came to me, saying, 'The city has been devastated (or captured).' But the hand of the Lord had been upon me in the evening before the one who had fled came; and He opened my mouth until the morning, and I no longer remained silent with my mouth open. In the eleventh year of the reign of Zedekiah, in the fifth month, the city of Jerusalem was captured. This prophecy, however, in the twelfth year, in the tenth month, on the fifth day of the month of captivity or exile, when Jehoiachin was captured, shows that one year, four months, and twenty-five days after the capture of Jerusalem, a citizen of Jerusalem came to Babylon to announce the captured and devastated city. But one day before he came, who was to narrate this, in the evening the hand of the Lord came upon the prophet Ezekiel, who opened his mouth which had been closed for a long time, and whatever he was going to say, this happened before he could speak: nor did he remain silent any longer, seeing his prophecy fulfilled by action, and without doubt the people who were in Babylon, or those who were taken captive by prophetic prediction. For then the mouth of the prophet is opened, when what he had previously announced, he shows by action: and he proclaims with total freedom, things that are not yet to come, but either present or already past. This according to the literal sense. However, according to the anagoge, if Ezekiel is interpreted as the strength of God: but Christ is the power and wisdom of God (I Cor. I, 24), this must be understood that with the capture and overthrow of Jerusalem, whoever could escape the perfidy of the Jews, such as the apostles and the remnants that were saved, he himself declares to Christ that all the ceremonies of the Jews have been overthrown, which some people still think should be observed today, not hearing the Apostle's words: You have fallen from grace, you who are trying to be justified by the Law (Galat. V, 4). And therefore, the defenders of the synagogues in the churches of Christ, what do they proclaim? Therefore, after Jerusalem was captured and destroyed, the mouth of the Lord was opened through the apostles and the apostolic men, who can say: My mouth is open to you, O Corinthians; and: A great and effective door has opened to me (2 Corinthians 6:11). And this: I opened my mouth and drew in the breath (Psalm CXVIII, 131), which will never be silent, nor be heard with Israel: Listen, Israel, and be silent: but it will resound throughout the whole world, and will reveal the Gospel of Christ to the Gentiles. Therefore, according to this meaning, the twelfth year is referred to the twelve tribes, and the tenth month to the time of the Jewish propitiation, which is called ἱλασμός in Greek: and the fifth day of the month to the carnal senses, which all, captured by Jerusalem, and with the succession of the Gospel, have been shown to have been destroyed and passed away: and in the evening, that is, at the end of the world, the hand of the Lord was accomplished for the true Ezekiel, who had sung of the future ruins of the city through the prophets, and showed them to have been fulfilled in the morning.
