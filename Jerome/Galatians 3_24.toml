A custodian is given to infants to rein in an age full of passion and to restrain hearts prone to vice until tender infancy is refined by growth.… Yet the teacher is not a father, nor does the one being instructed look for the custodian’s inheritance. The custodian guards another person’s son and will depart from him when the lawful time of inheritance arrives.
