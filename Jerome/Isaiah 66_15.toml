By “the Lord will come in fire and with his chariots like a tornado or storm” we should understand him to be speaking of the angelic powers, when the Lord will come in the glory of the Father with his angels to judge the living and the dead. This is not to suggest, however, that the Lord himself is fire, but rather that the punishment to be sustained will feel like fire. Although Moses said and an apostle confirmed that “God is a consuming fire,” the Savior expressed the very substance of his divinity when he said, “God is spirit.” And there is a great difference between fire and spirit, according to the corporal understanding.… God is called “a consuming fire,” therefore, because he consumes our weaknesses, our stubble and briars and thorns, that is, the cares of this world, which cause the earth to be fruitless for the good seed, as it is said in the letter to the Hebrews: “But if it bears thorns and stubble, it is reprobate and near to being cursed, the end of which is destruction.”
