The unclean spirit before had been in the synagogue and had led them into idolatry. Of him it is written, “The spirit of harlotry has led them astray.” The spirit had gone out of a man and was roaming in the dry places in search of a resting place and could find none. He took with him seven other demons and returned to his former dwelling place. All these spirits were in the synagogue and could not bear the presence of the Savior. Indeed, “what harmony is there between Christ and Belial?” Christ and Belial could not abide in the same assembly. “Now in their synagogue there was a man with an unclean spirit, and he cried out, saying, ‘What have we to do with you?’ ” Who is asking, “What have we to do with you?” He is only one, but he cries out the recognition of many. He is aware that in his own defeat, his devils have been vanquished with him.
