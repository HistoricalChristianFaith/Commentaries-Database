But possibly you flatter yourself that since the bishop who has made you a deacon is a holy man, his merits will atone for your transgressions. I have already told you that the father is not punished for the son or the son for the father. “The soul that sins shall itself die.” Samuel too had sons who forsook the fear of the Lord and “turned aside after lucre” and iniquity.
