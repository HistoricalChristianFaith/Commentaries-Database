(Verse 5) Then you will see, and you will be wealthy, and your heart will be amazed and expanded: when the multitude of the sea turns to you, the strength of the nations will come to you. LXX: Then you will see, and you will be afraid, and you will be astonished in your heart: for the riches of the sea and the nations and the peoples will be transferred to you. When you lift up your eyes and see your sons and daughters coming quickly or being carried on the shoulders of the holy ones, then you will rejoice, and you will be flooded with sudden waters like rivers, and your heart will be amazed and expanded, hearing the Apostle say: My mouth is open to you, O Corinthians. And again: Expand yourselves, and us (2 Corinthians 6:11); lest you not be able to have Christ as a guest in your narrow heart, who says in the Gospel: My Father and I will come and make our dwelling with him (John 14:23). But that which is added in the Septuagint, 'and you shall fear,' is not found in the Hebrew. Unless perhaps after the greatness of joy, fear has entered lest such a great good be lacking. Is it not joy, to see riches and the multitude of the seas transferred and converted to oneself, and the strength of nations coming to oneself, so that whatever is in the world and the earth's orbit is one's own; and with faith strengthened, the nations say: I can do all things in him who strengthens me, Jesus Christ (Philippians 4:13)?
