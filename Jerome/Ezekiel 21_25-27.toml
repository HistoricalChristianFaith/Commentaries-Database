(Verse 25 onwards) But you, profane and wicked ruler of Israel, whose day has come at the appointed time of iniquity. Thus says the Lord God: Remove the turban and take off the crown. Is this not the one who exalted the lowly and humiliated the proud? I will bring upon it injustice, injustice, injustice, and this will not cease until the one comes to whom judgment belongs, and I will give it to him. Septuagint: And you, profane and unjust ruler of Israel, whose day has come, at the end of the time of iniquity. Thus says the Lord God: You have removed the diadem and placed the crown. This will not be the same. You have humbled the high and exalted the lowly. I will bring upon her iniquity, iniquity will I bring upon her: and she will not be like this until the one to whom it is due comes: and I will give it to him. Symmachus interpreted this passage as follows: But you, profane and unjust ruler of Israel, whose day comes at the appointed time of iniquity: Thus says the Lord God: She has removed the diadem and taken the crown: neither this nor that: she will raise up the lowly and humble the exalted. I will commit iniquity, iniquity, iniquity upon it. And this was not that one, whose judgment is, whom I am about to give. After the destruction of the city of Jerusalem and the captivity of the people, the speech is directed to the leader of Israel, whom no one doubts is signified by Zedekiah, in whom the reign of the kings of Israel from the lineage of David ended. The day, says he, has come upon you, which has been predetermined for a long time in you, and because of you the priesthood and kingdom of the people of Judah have come to an end. For indeed the cidaris is the distinguishing mark of the pontiff: the crown, that is, the diadem, the sign of the king. Is this not the cidaris, and this crown that did nothing by judgment; but for the imitation of the Babylonian king, whom he wanted to exalt, and whom he wanted to humble? Therefore, not once, nor twice according to the Septuagint, but three times I will put iniquity before you forever, which was not immediately taken into account by you, but until Christ comes, whose judgment it is, and the Father gives him the kingdom and the priesthood, or the Church gathered from the Gentiles: For the Father judges no one; but he has given all judgment to the Son (John 5:22). And in another place: God, he said, give your judgment to the king, and your justice to the son of the king (Ps. 72:1). This is the one to whom the power and eternal priesthood have been entrusted, of whom Jacob also spoke: The ruler will not fail from Judah, nor the leader from his thighs, until the one to whom it has been entrusted comes; and he will be the expectation of the nations (Gen. 49:10). In the place where we have interpreted: Is not this, beautifully translated by Symmachus, neither this, nor that. For he had said: Take away the crown, remove the diadem, he added, neither this nor that, that is, the kingdom will cease, and the priesthood. Hence those who were kings and priests until the coming of Christ, among whom one high priest Hyrcanus placed a diadem on his head, wanted in vain to claim both this and that, since the kingdom was not owed to him after Zedekiah, but to the one to whom it was entrusted, and who was the expectation of the Gentiles, about whom Malachi speaks: You, priests, who defile my name (Mal. 1, 6). And a little while later: My will is not in you, and I will not accept sacrifices from your hands. For from the rising of the sun to its setting, my name is great among the nations, and in every place a clean offering is sacrificed and offered to my name. This clean offering, without the blood of goats, rams, and bulls (Ps. 49), is fulfilled in the coming of Christ, when he came as the desired one of the nations, and the sun of righteousness rose, in whose wings there is healing (Hagg. 2).
