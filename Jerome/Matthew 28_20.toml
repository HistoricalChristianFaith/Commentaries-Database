(Verse 20) Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you. The main order: He commanded the apostles to first teach all nations, then to immerse them in the sacrament of faith, and after faith and baptism, to command what should be observed. And lest we think that what has been commanded is light and few, he added: All things whatsoever I have commanded you. So that whoever believes, who has been baptized in the Trinity, may do all the things that are commanded.


And behold, I am with you always, until the end of the age. He who promises to be with his disciples until the end of the age, and shows them that they will always be victorious, and that he will never leave those who believe in him. But he who promises his presence until the end of the world, does not ignore the day when he knows he will be with the apostles.
