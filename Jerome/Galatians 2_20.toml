Judas and the priests, with the princes, handed him over, and Pilate, to whom he was finally handed over, handed him over again. But the Father handed him over that he might save the abandoned world. Jesus gave himself, that he might do the Fatherâ€™s will. But Judas and the priests and elders of the people and Pilate unwittingly handed over their lives to death.
