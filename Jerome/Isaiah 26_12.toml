(Verse 12) Lord, you will give us peace: for you have accomplished all our works for us. LXX: Lord our God, give us peace: for you have restored all things to us. It is notable that after restoring our works to us, he will give peace, and how he will explain the reasons why he seeks peace. For all the works that have been done on earth, they claim to have endured torments, and it is just that after punishment and torture, they obtain mercy. Or else: Because the end of the world has come, and all the things that you spoke through the prophets have been fulfilled, and you have fulfilled all that you promised, grant us peace that surpasses all understanding.
