"I said
to myself: here I have acquired great wisdom, more than any of my predecessors
over Jerusalem, and my mind has had much experience with wisdom and
knowledge." Solomon was not greater than Abraham and
Moses, and other saints, but than those who were before him in Jerusalem. We read in the book of Kings that Solomon was
very wise, and he claimed this wisdom to have been given by God before all
others. [Cfr III Reg. 3, 5 sqq] It was then the eye of his heart that saw
great wisdom and knowledge in the world, since he does not say "I spoke much wisdom and knowledge" but "my heart saw much wisdom and knowledge." For indeed we are not able to speak out all
those things which we feel.
