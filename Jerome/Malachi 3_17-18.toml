(Ver. 17, 18.) And the Lord waited, and heard, and a book of remembrance was written before Him for those who fear the Lord and meditate on His name. 'They shall be Mine,' says the Lord of hosts, 'on the day that I make them My special possession. And I will spare them as a man spares his own son who serves him. Then you shall again discern between the righteous and the wicked, between one who serves God and one who does not serve Him.' LXX: And the Lord waited, and heard, and wrote a book of remembrance in His sight for those who fear the Lord and revere His name. And they shall be mine, says the Almighty Lord, on the day that I make, as a possession, and I will choose them as a man chooses his own son who serves him. And you shall return and see the difference between the righteous and the wicked, between one who serves God and one who does not serve him. These are the words of the righteous and those who fear God, speaking to each other and not wanting to hear or speak blasphemy. The Lord listens and hears, and a book of remembrance is written before him for those who fear and think of his name, so that when the day of judgment comes, he may give punishment to the blasphemers and rewards to those who fear him. However, a book was written, about which we read in Daniel: Thrones were set up, and books were opened (Dan. VII, 10). And they will be a possession of the Lord of hosts, in the day when the time of judgment comes. In Hebrew, possession is called Sgolla (), which Aquila interpreted as περιούσιον, and the others as περιποίησιν. Therefore, those who fear the Lord, those who have spoken with their neighbor and have answered words of blasphemy, will be a possession on the day of judgment, and He will spare them, because every man is under sin. Whether you choose them, just as a man chooses his son to be his servant. In this there is a twofold affection, both of a father towards his son, and of servitude towards a servant. And then those of you who now blaspheme and say: What benefit is it, because we have kept his commandments, and have walked sadly before the Lord? From their choice and happiness, you will know their misery, and turned to repentance, you will see what difference there is between the just and the wicked, and between one who serves God and one who does not serve Him.
