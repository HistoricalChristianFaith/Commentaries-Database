(Verse 21.) The tribe of Naphtali, a spreading vine, producing beauty in the next generation. In Hebrew it is written: Naphtali is a fruitful land, producing words of beauty, signifying that hot springs are born within the tribe itself, or that the region around the Sea of Galilee, watered by the flow of the Jordan River, is fertile. However, the Hebrews interpret it as prophesying an irrigated land and the words of beauty referring to Tiberias, which was considered to have knowledge of the Law. Furthermore, when they placed the irrigated field and the seventy twigs, which is called a loose branch, in Hebrew it is read as Ajala Sluaa (), which can also be translated as a released stag, showing the abundance of temporary crops and the swiftness of fertile land. But it is better if we refer everything to the teaching of the Savior, especially what He taught there, as it is also written in the Gospel.
