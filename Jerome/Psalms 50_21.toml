quote='''
Beware also of a blabbing tongue and of itching ears. Neither detract from others nor listen to detractors.… Keep your tongue from caviling, and watch over your words. Know that in judging others you are passing sentence on yourself and that you are yourself guilty of the faults that you blame in them. It is no excuse to say, “If others tell me things, I cannot be rude to them.” No one cares to speak to an unwilling listener. An arrow never lodges in a stone: often it recoils on the shooter of it. Let the detractor learn from your unwillingness to listen not to be so ready to detract.
