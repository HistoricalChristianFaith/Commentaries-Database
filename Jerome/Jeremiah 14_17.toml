(Verse 17) And you shall say to them this word: Let my eyes shed tears (or let your eyes shed tears) day and night, and let them not be silent (or let them not cease), for the virgin daughter of my people has been greatly afflicted, a very severe wound. This place can be understood in two ways, either that God himself mourns for his people, and his eyes do not cease to weep, or certainly he commands that the eyes of the peoples flow with tears, and it is no small thing that there is something to mourn; since the virgin daughter of his people has been struck with great affliction and an intolerable wound. Others think that these things are said from the perspective of the Prophet.
