(Vers. 8, 9.) But you have departed from the way, and have caused many to stumble in the law: you have made void the covenant of Levi, says the Lord of hosts. Therefore I also have made you contemptible and base before all the people, because you have not kept my ways, and have had respect of persons in the law. LXX: But you have turned aside from my way, and have made many weak in the law, you have corrupted the covenant of Levi, says the Almighty Lord. And I gave you contemptible and dissolute ones to all nations, because you did not keep my ways, but showed partiality in the law. This does not pertain to the person of Christ, nor to those who are dedicated to his worship, even if I remain silent, the wise reader understands. And the meaning is: I wanted to make you do what is contained in the previous chapter, and what I spoke through Moses in Deuteronomy: Give his teaching and truth to the righteous man (Deut. XXXIII, 8, sec. LXX), and the rest: but you have departed from the straight path, or deviated, as I said: Do not turn to the right or to the left (Deut. V, 32); and you have made many weak in the law, or caused them to stumble, as Aquila and Symmachus translated. To turn to the right is to abstain from the foods that God created for use; to condemn marriage and to fall into that which is written in another place: Do not be overly righteous (Eccl. 7:17). To turn to the left is to give oneself over to luxury and lust, and to cause scandal to many in the law. It is better for such a person to have a millstone tied around their neck and be thrown into the sea, than to cause one of the least of these to stumble. But many make the weak, who, having received the strength of faith in Christ, make them weak by their negligent behavior, of whom rightly it is said: You have made void the covenant of Levi, the covenant of life and peace, and other things which we have said pertain to the priest's duty. For this reason, I too have made you contemptible and lowly to all the people, so that they would despise you and trample upon your honor and glory: Because you have not kept my ways and have shown partiality in the law. Among all the sins of Levi, or those who are from Levi, the priests of God, that one is placed last and greatest, why they receive faces in the law, so that they consider not causes, but persons, despising the just poor, receiving and honoring unjust rich. To whom it is said in the eighty-first psalm: How long will you judge unjustly and accept the faces of sinners (Psalm 81:2)? And Paul says to the Galatians: God, he says, does not accept the person of man (Galatians 2:6). The apostle James more fully argues this sin and condemns it (James 2). However, whatever is said to the previous people, let us consider it also said to us, so that we may be more cautious in avoiding vices and not adopt a face against the law, nor prefer falsehood to the truth as worshippers of God.
