(Chapter XI â€” Verse 1) And the spirit lifted me up and brought me to the gate of the house of the Lord, which faces east and overlooks the rising sun. For the glory of the Lord had come out from the threshold of the temple and stood over the cherubim. And as the cherubim lifted their wings and rose from the ground, the glory of the Lord also stood at the entrance of the gate of the house of the Lord, facing east. And the prophet, unable to approach it himself, was lifted up by the spirit and taken to the same gate of the house of the Lord, which faces the sun of righteousness, as it is written: Behold the man whose name is the East (Zach. VI, 12), so that he would not remain in the temple, which was clouded by the veil of ignorance, but would stand at the gate of the house of the Lord facing east, where he could understand the sacred mysteries that follow.
