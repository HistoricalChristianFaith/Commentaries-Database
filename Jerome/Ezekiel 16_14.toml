In Ezekiel, God speaks to Jerusalem: “You were perfect through my beauty.” And this is the meaning of the text: “You were not perfect through your own works or through your own knowledge and the boasting of your heart but through my beauty, which I had put on you freely through my mercy.”

(Verse 14) And your name went out among the nations because of your beauty, for you were perfect in my splendor which I had placed upon you, says the Lord God. LXX: And your name went out among the nations in your beauty, for it was complete in the beauty which I had placed upon you, says the Lord God. Symmachus interpreted this passage more clearly: And your name went out among the nations, which was perfect because of my dignity, which I had placed upon you, says the Lord God. And this is the meaning: By my favors and my incredible generosity, you have obtained the title of queen, so that the speech of all nations would speak of you, and you would not be praised for your own merits and virtues, but for my perfect generosity. For unless the Lord builds the house, those who build it labor in vain. Unless the Lord guards the city, the guard keeps watch in vain (Ps. CXXVI, 1, 2). For neither the one who plants nor the one who waters is anything, but only God who gives the growth (1 Cor. III). For it is not the one who wills or the one who runs, but the mercy of God that makes a difference (Rom. IX, 16): so that after we have done everything we are commanded to do, we may say: We are worthless servants; we have only done what we ought to have done (Luke XVII, 10). Not that by the generosity of God, free will is taken away from man, but rather that freedom itself should have the Lord as its helper.
