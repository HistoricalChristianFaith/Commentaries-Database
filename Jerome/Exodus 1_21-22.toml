Because they feared God, they built up houses. Without the fear of God, a house cannot be built. If then with the fear of God houses were built by those who had not committed sin but rather did their building at God’s pleasure, we who have been captured, what must we do? Listen, sinner; we must fear God, indeed, to avoid sin; but after shipwreck there is the second plank of repentance. “When the house was being built after captivity.” “When the house was being built,” not “was built,” for repentance is without limit. To the just man who has died, repentance naturally is rendered superfluous. Whenever there is sin, always there is remorse of conscience. Hence the psalmist says was “being built.” While time lasts, the door is always open to repentance, for however long you shall live, as long as you live, you will fall into sin.
