(Verse 10) And when he entered Jerusalem, the whole city was stirred up, saying, 'Who is this?' And the people ((or Many)) were saying, 'This is Jesus, the prophet from Nazareth in Galilee.' As Jesus entered the city with the whole crowd, the city of Jerusalem was stirred up, amazed at the multitude, not knowing the truth, and saying, 'Who is this?' Indeed, we read in another place the angels saying: 'Who is this King of glory?' (Psalm 24:8). But to others who were doubting or asking, the lowly common people confess: starting from the least, in order to reach the greatest, and they say:

163 This is Jesus, the prophet from Nazareth in Galilee. The prophet whom even Moses had said would come, and who is specifically written with the article among the Greeks. From Nazareth in Galilee because he was brought up there: so that, like a flower of the field, he would be nurtured in the flower of virtues.
