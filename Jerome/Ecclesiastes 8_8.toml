"Man is
powerless over the spirit-to restrain the spirit; nor is there authority over
the day of death; nor discharge in war; and wickedness cannot save the
wrong-doer. "Our mind does not have the power to prevent
the spirit from being taken from us, and when the spirit leaves to the realm of
God, it helps nothing to shut out mouth and hold in our fleeting life. And when we are dead, the enemy of our life
will come and we are not able to take any rest. 
Note too the kings in one age, which destroying all our things
irreligiously led us by the hands to our death, but we were taken into the
ashes and the earth. Therefore we must
not mourn if we cannot know the future and we are often oppressed by more
powerful and wicked men, for all things end in death: for the proud and the
powerful the same end; he who has devastated all things does not deserve to
keep his life when it is taken away. 
Another meaning could be that the spirit that is the source of life
cannot be prevented from leaving any man, this is the rule of mortality. Above too he also spoke of this: "turning,
turning goes the wind" [Eccl. 1,6.]. We have no power in the day of our death, but
when we are alive our enemy is easily avoided. 
Similarly he who is in time of war and does not have the peace of God,
which overpowers all feeling, he will not have any discharge therefrom, about
which it is said to a bride, "your discharge is paradise with the fruit of
apples" [Cant. 4, 13.]. And because piety will not save him who has
it, piety will save the opposite, and impiety can be called the Devil and piety
our Lord Jesus Christ.
