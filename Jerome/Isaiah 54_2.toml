Here is the spiritual sense. Anyone who is in a tent does not have a secure and everlasting dwelling but is always changing places and hurrying on to the next.… For the end of “living in tents” is the taking possession of the eternal home, whose foundations do not shift nor are moved around. Those planted in the house of God, in his very atrium, flower so that from the blooms they may come to bear fruit and be able to say, “I am like an olive tree bearing fruit in God’s house.”
