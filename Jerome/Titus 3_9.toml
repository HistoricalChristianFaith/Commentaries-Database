But avoid foolish questions, and genealogies, and contentions, and strivings about the law; for they are unprofitable and vain. For there are many questions and divers contentions, wherefore Solomon said: "Those who seek God in the right way, find peace" (Proverbs 8:35). Therefore, those who do not seek God in the right way cannot find peace. There are many examples of those who seek God in the wrong way. The Jews seek God wrongly, hoping to find Him without Christ. Heretics, making a noise with vain words, seek that which they cannot find. Philosophers and barbarians, having different opinions about God, seek God. But because they do not seek in the right way, their questions are foolish, thinking that God may be comprehended by human senses. Therefore, Paul calls us away from these questions. Moreover, to the wise, and those things which are supported by the authority of the Scriptures, it is urged and provoked more, being knowledgeable of the precepts of the Savior, in which he says: Seek and you shall find, knock and it shall be opened to you, ask and it shall be given to you. For everyone who seeks finds, and who asks receives, and who knocks, it shall be opened to him (Luke 11); provided our body is not subject to sins, and wisdom will enter us. Let our understanding be exercised, let our mind be nourished daily by divine reading: and our foolish questions will not be questions. But he who said: Avoid genealogies and contentions and quarrels, which come from the Law, properly rebukes the Jews, who boast in it and think they have knowledge of the Law, if they hold the names of each one: which because they are barbaric, and we do not know their etymology, they are often uttered incorrectly by us. And if by chance we err in accentuation, in the length or brevity of a syllable, whether lengthening the short or shortening the long, our ignorance is wont to be ridiculed, especially in the case of aspirations and certain letters pronounced with throaty constriction. Now this happens because the Seventy Interpreters by whom the Divine Utterance was translated into the Greek language, have rendered the Heth and Ain and other similar letters, because they could not transfer them into the Greek language with the double aspiration, by adding other letters. For example they said 'Rahel' for Rachel, and 'Jeriho' for Jericho, and 'Hebron' for Chebron, and 'Seor' for Segor; but in other instances this method failed them. For we and the Greeks have only one letter s, but they three, Samech, Sade, and Sin, which have different sounds. Isaac and Sion are spelled with Sade, Israel with Sin, and do not sound as they are written. Seon, king of the Amorites, is spelled and pronounced with the letter Samech. Therefore, if we have not expressed these names and idioms of language, namely barbarian, in the way Hebrews express them, they are accustomed to laugh and swear that they completely do not understand what we are saying. Hence, it was our concern to correct all the books of the Old Law, arranged in six columns by the learned man Adamantius, written in the Caesarean library, from the authentic ones, in which the Hebrew itself is written in its own characters, and are expressed in the Greek letters on the margin. Aquila and Symmachus, as well as the Septuagint and Theodotion, follow their order. But some books and especially those written in verses among the Hebrews have three other variations added, which they call the fifth, the sixth, and the seventh translations, having gained authority without the names of interpreters. This immortal talent has given us, through his own efforts, the ability not to greatly fear the arrogance of the Jews; those who are happy with loose lips, a twisted tongue, a hissing spittle, and a hoarse throat. And there is another source of their pride, because just as we who are Latins, having Latin names and origins from our language, [that we learn] with greater ease from memory; so they, from a young age, have deeply absorbed the words of their own language [with] the most exact senses [possible]. From the beginning with Adam to the end with Zerubbabel, they run through all the generations from memory so quickly that you might think it is their own name that they are relating. We who have either learned other languages or have only later believed in Christ or even if we are infants made over to the Church, rely more on the sense of the Scriptures than their wording. If perhaps we do not know [the Latin] text so well, they believe themselves better [than us] in reciting names, in computing years, in [knowledge of] their childrenâ€™s children to the third and fourth generation, of their ancestors, grandfathers, and great-grandfathers. I heard from certain Hebrews in Rome who pretended to have believed in Christ, on the genealogies of our Lord Jesus Christ, which are written in Matthew and Luke; specifically that they do not agree with each other in number or in the equality of words, from Solomon to Joseph. This person disturbed the hearts of simple people as if he was bringing forth responses from some sacred inner-sanctums and oracles, despite the fact that he should have been seeking justice, mercy, and love of God instead, and after this, if it happened to arise, disputing names and numbers. We have perhaps said enough about the haughtiness of the Hebrews, more than was necessary, but we were given an opportunity to speak of the genealogies and the contentions and disputes that arise from the Law. The dialecticians, of whom Aristotle is the foremost, are accustomed to weaving nets of argumentation, and to attaching the loose freedom of rhetoric to the threads of syllogisms. Those who spend all their days and nights in questioning, answering, giving and accepting propositions and confirming and concluding them are thus called contentious, who argue not based on reason, but through their gut. If they do this, whose proper art is contention, then what should a Christian do other than completely shun contention? Even legal disputes should be completely discarded and the foolishness of the Jews abandoned. For they are useless and vain, which have only the appearance of knowledge: besides, they are not of advantage either to those who speak them, or to those who hear them. For what is it to me to know how many years Methuselah lived, or in what year of his age Solomon obtained a wife, lest perhaps it should be believed that Rehoboam was born in his eleventh year? and many things of this kind, which either are difficult to find on account of the variety of books, and (while they are gradually written faultily) unwonted errors: or even if we find them with great study and labour, we have known that they are of no value. It frequently happens that we have disputes about the Law, not for the sake of the desire of truth; but for the sake of the love of glory, while we wish to be respected as learned among those who hear us: or certainly we pursue base profits from this little rumour: For what profit is it to babble with foaming lips, and to bark like dogs: since a simple and moderate answer either can appease you, if it is true, or if it is false, can be corrected gently and quietly?
