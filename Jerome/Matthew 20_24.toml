(Verse 24.) And when the ten heard it, they were indignant at the two brothers. The ten apostles did not show indignation towards the mother of the sons of Zebedee, nor did they refer to the boldness of the woman making the request; but to the sons, because they, not understanding their own measure, were inflamed by excessive desire, to whom the Lord had also said: You do not know what you are asking. It is understood either from the Lord's response or from the indignation of the apostles that the sons sent their mother to make great requests.
