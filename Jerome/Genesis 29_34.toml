(Verse 34) And she conceived again, and bore a son, and said: Now my husband will be with me, because I have borne him three sons: therefore she called his name Levi. When we read, 'My husband will be with me,' Aquila interpreted it as, 'My husband will be attached to me,' which is the Hebrew word (), Illave. And among the Hebrew doctors, it is translated differently, so that they say, 'My husband will follow me,' that is, I have no doubt about the love of my husband for me: he will be my companion in this life, and his affection will lead me to death, and he will follow me: for I have borne him three sons.
