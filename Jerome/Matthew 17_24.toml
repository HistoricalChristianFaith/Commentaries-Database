After Caesar Augustus, Judea was made a tributary state and all the people were registered in the census. So Joseph and his kinswoman Mary had set off for Bethlehem. Once again, since Jesus had been brought up in Nazareth, which is a town of Galilee lying close to Capernaum, he is asked to pay taxes. Because of the magnitude of the miracles he had done, those who demanded this tax do not dare to ask him. Instead, they meet a disciple and maliciously ask whether he should pay taxes or defy Caesar’s will. .

(Verse 24) And when they came to Capernaum, those who received the didrachma came to Peter and said, 'Does your teacher not pay the didrachma?' He said, 'Yes.' After Augustus Caesar, Judea became subject to taxes, and all were registered. Hence, Joseph with Mary, his betrothed, went to Bethlehem to be registered. Again, since he was brought up in Nazareth (which is a town in Galilee, adjacent to the city of Capernaum), they demand taxes as custom dictates. Because of the magnitude of the signs, those demanding taxes do not dare ask for it directly from Jesus, but approach his disciple and ask maliciously whether he pays taxes or opposes Caesar's will; as we read in another place: 'Is it lawful to pay tribute to Caesar or not?' (Mark 12:14)



And when he entered the house, Jesus anticipated him, saying: “What do you think, Simon? From whom do the kings of the earth take toll or tribute? From their sons or from others?” And when he entered the house, before Peter could speak, the Lord asks, so that the disciples would not be scandalized by the demand for tribute; since they see him knowing what happened in his absence.
