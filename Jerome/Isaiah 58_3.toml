The unjust accuse the Lord of not respecting good works, and then they offer to God only hunger pangs of the stomach but not the work of virtue. Nor do they eat the foods that God created for believers and those who know the truth, to be received with thanksgiving. …This is what follows in the Septuagint: “And you wound all those who are subject to you,” [Is 58:3] or “afflict,” as in the better translation of Theodotion and Symmachus, which we follow with “and you are demanding of your debtors.” From this he shows that it is not without danger to demand repayment of a poor person who is insolvent or to refuse to return to a freezing debtor the garment that you took as collateral, lest his cry reach God. For one who has mercy on the poor lends to God. In contrast, whoever demands repayment from those who have nothing violates God.… The servant of the Lord … must not be litigious but be kind and imitate him who said, “Learn from me, for I am kind and humble of heart,” such that his humility would not be pretentious but of the heart, a humility that seeks the soul’s conscience rather than human glory.…
And we say this not to reprove the practice of fasting, through which Daniel, a man of passions, came to know the future and the Ninevites placated the wrath of God, and Elijah and Moses, after fasting for forty days, were filled with God’s friendship. The Lord, moreover, fasted for all those days of solitude in the desert in order to bequeath solemn days of fasting to us. But it profits nothing to endure an empty stomach and then to do other things that are displeasing to God.…
Nor should they disfigure their faces but wash them with water and anoint their heads with oil, about which John the Evangelist wrote, “You also have been anointed by the holy One,” through which the anointed were themselves made holy.
