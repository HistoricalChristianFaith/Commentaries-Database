Except that our belief in Christ raises us up to heaven and promises eternity to our souls, the physical conditions of life are the same for us as for the brutes.

"All
things come alike to all; the same fate awaits the righteous and the wicked,
the good and the clean and the unclean, the one who brings a sacrifice and the
one who does not. As is the good man so
is the sinner, as is the one who swears, so is the one who fears an oath. "These things which in themselves are neither good nor
bad but are called 'in-between' by the wise, (since equally things happen to
both the righteous and the wicked), they perturb each single man, especially as
to why they should happen thus, and therefore do not think they are being
judged, while there will be a distinction between all things in the future when
they have been done, yet now all things are confused. But he says: "there is one outcome for
the just and the unjust", he means either the outcome of hardships or of
death, and therefore they do not know the kingdom of God nor His hate. Those who bring sacrifice and those who do
not, and others in contrast who are not listed here must be seen in a spiritual
understanding, according to that verse which says, "sacrifice to God with
a troubled spirit" [Ps. 50, 19.].
