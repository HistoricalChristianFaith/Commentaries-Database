"Also when they shall be afraid of that which is high, and fears shall
be in the way. "That is, they will not be able to enter on
difficult tasks and with tired knees and frightened footsteps, will not be able
to go out in the open, and will fear the offence of steps." 
And the almond tree shall flourish, and the grasshopper shall be a
burden, and desire shall fail: because man goes to his long home, and the
mourners go about the streets. "The
speech now explains the limbs of a man of the Church through a metaphor. And when old-age comes his hair will grow
white, his feet will swell, his lust will grow cold and he will be destroyed by
death. Then he will be returned to the
earth, and then in the house of his eternity you will remember his tomb and his
ashes with reverence, and a crowd will walk before the mourners at his
funeral. But the flower of the almond-tree,
which we have in place of grey hairs, some interpret as the sacred thorn,
because, while the flesh of the buttocks decreases, the thorn grows and
flowers. More precisely, in that verse
which says, "the grasshopper will be a burden", you must note that
where we have in our manuscripts 'grasshopper', the Hebrew has "aagab", which is rather ambiguous for
us. For it can be translated as 'heel'
or as 'grasshopper'. Just as for example
in the beginning of Jeremiah, the word "soced"
if the accent is changed can mean 'a nut' or 'wakefulness'. And this is said to him: "what do you
see, Jeremiah?" and he replies, "a nut". [Ier. 1, 11.] And the Lord says to him, "you have seen
well, for I will wake over my work so that I might complete it." [Ier. 1, 12.] Or that explanation: it also has the
etymology of the word 'nut', because God is about to keep awake. And what the people has deserved it will be
given, is what the text seems to say. 
Thus now he shows the ambiguity of the word through its etymology,
showing that the legs of old men swell up and that gout weighs upon the organs. This does not happen to all men, but to most,
and this is "synecdoche" where a part
is called by the name of the whole. 
Indeed where we read 'desire' the Hebrew has "abiona. "This in itself has
many meanings, and is interpreted as 'love', 'lust', 'longing', or
'desire'. And it has the meaning, as I
have said above, that the lust of an old man grows cold, and the organs of
intercourse sag. But this is said
because these words are ambiguous, for although they mean 'almond-tree', and
'grasshopper', and 'desire' in his language, they also mean other derived words
in our language, and are derived from the forms which pertain to old-age. You must note too, that where the Septuagint
has the word 'almond-tree' the word itself is "soced", which is found in the beginning of Jeremiah. But there it is meant 'nut' but here it means
'almond-tree'. Symmachus has
interpreted this passage in a greatly different way, (though I am unsure of what
he means): for he says, 'and they will see even above these things from on
high, and they will wander, and waking he will fall asleep, and the strength of
his spirit will be dispersed.' For man
will go to the house of his eternity, and the weeping will wander in the
street. Laodicenus [Apollinaris Laodic.]
followed the interpretation of Symmachus, which the Hebrews do not like, nor
the Christians; for while he is far from the Hebrews' view, he rejects too the
interpretations of the Septuagint.
