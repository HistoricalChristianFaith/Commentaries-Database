(Verse 11) And the Lord will always give you rest, and will fill your soul with splendor, and will free your bones. And you will be like a well-watered garden, and like a fountain of water, whose waters will not fail. LXX: And your God will be with you always: and you will be filled as your soul desires, and your bones will become fat. And they will be like a drunken garden, and like a fountain, whose water will not fail. What is added at the beginning of this chapter in the Alexandrian manuscripts: And still praise will be in you always; and in the end your bones will rise like grass, and become fat, and they will possess the inheritance for generations upon generations. This is not found in Hebrew, nor even in the corrected and true copies of the Seventy: hence, it should be marked with an obelus. When the darkness, says he, of thine heart shall be dissolved in the rising light, and midday shall have arisen from palpable night, then wilt thou always have God as thy inhabitant, who shall fill thy soul with brightness. Of whom it is said in the Psalms: With thee is the principality of thy power, in brightnesses of the saints, from the womb before the morning star I begot thee  (Ps. 109:4) . Whether thou shalt be satisfied with all things which thy soul desireth, because thou also hast satisfied the hungry soul, and shalt be able to say:  Bless the Lord, O my soul, who filleth thy desire with good things  (Ps. 102:5) ; and thy bones shall be delivered from death and perpetual fire. Or, they will cause them to become thick again, which had been made thin by the hunger of speech of the Lord. And indeed, we can understand this both in a literal sense concerning the resurrection of bodies that are going to fall, and concerning the virtues of the soul, which the holy one speaks of in the psalm, 'All my bones will say, Lord, who is like you?' (Ps. 34:10). Regarding these matters, it is also written in Proverbs, 'Good fame fattens the bones' (Prov. 15:30). And to those who are promised rewards, Health will be to your body, and healing to your bones (Prov. XVI, 24). Concerning them it is written again, The Lord keeps all their bones, not one of them shall be broken (Ps. XXXIII, 21). On the contrary, the sinner, who has lost strength and virtue of the soul, laments and speaks: Our bones are scattered nearby the underworld (Ps. CXL, 7). For we cannot believe that the bones of sinners are not in hell, but near hell. And good fame fattens the bones (Prov. XV, 30), which does not pertain to the nourishment of the body. It follows: And you will be, or it will be, that is, either you or your soul, like a well-watered garden: of which it is written: A spring went out and watered the whole face of the garden (Genes. II, 6), which is read as 'garden' in Hebrew. We can say that this spring is none other than the one to whom it is said, With you is the fountain of life (Ps. XXXV, 10): which continually waters His Church and the hearts of all believers.
