So that the exiled people can be comforted and the purpose of God revealed, the prophet saw a very great vision. As far as its interpretation is concerned, all the synagogues of the Jews are silent beyond what a person can say.

In the middle of the fire or the torments of God is the likeness of amber, which is more precious than gold or silver, and after judgment and torments, which seem awkward and hard to those who suffer them, a flash of lightning more precious than amber appears, while all things are steered by the providence of God and what is considered punishment is in fact a medicine.

(Verse 4) And I saw, and behold, a whirlwind wind was coming from the north, and a great cloud, and a rolling fire, and brightness around it. And within it was something like the appearance of electric sparks, that is, from within the fire. LXX: And I saw, and behold, a spirit was coming from the north, carrying (or lifting) a great cloud within it, and a shining fire, and brightness around it. And within it was a vision like electric sparks within fire, and brightness within it. In the consolation of the migrating people, and in the revelation of God's sentence, the prophet sees the greatest vision. By its interpretation, all the synagogues of the Jews are rendered speechless, beyond those who say that it is beyond human, and they attempt something about this and about the building of the temple, which is written at the end of this prophecy. However, we, comparing spiritual things with spiritual things, according to the measure of our small intellect, can more suspect than explain. We will believe kind and faithful readers, seeking forgiveness, that they may favor our audacity, or rather the measure of our faith, rather than be angry. First of all, it must be known that the term spiritus, which we have interpreted as 'wind' in accordance with Aquila, and as 'blast' and 'stormy wind' in accordance with Symmachus and Theodotion, can be understood by others as coming from a favorable direction and by others as coming from an unfavorable direction. The Hebrew word Rua, depending on the quality of the places, can be understood as 'spirit,' 'soul,' or 'wind.' 'Spirit' as in: 'Send forth your spirit and they shall be created' (Ps. 103, 30). Soul: His spirit will go forth and return to its own land (Ps. 144:4). Wind: You will break the ships of Tarshish with a violent wind (Ps. 47:8). And elsewhere: Fire and brimstone, and a spirit of storms, is the portion of their cup (Ps. 11:7). Those who study the wind and the breath of the storm understand this: the anger and fury of God coming from the north, that is, from Nebuchadnezzar, and that Jerusalem will be captured after six years of this vision. This is the vision of the fifth year of the reign of King Joachin, who was the fifth king of Jerusalem during the reign of Sedeciah. We read that after six years, in the eleventh year of his reign, when the city was captured, he was taken to Babylon. It is revealed to those who dwell near the river Chobar and who willingly submitted themselves to the king that they have done well to obey God's judgment. In a short time, both the province of Judaea and the city of Jerusalem are to be captured. And when a great cloud is described, let us understand that it brings rains of destruction upon Judea, and showers of collisions. And the wrapped fire shows the future punishments and the evils of captivity. And the splendor around it signifies the open judgments of God. But those who think in the opposite way, that is, the good, understand the spirit that takes away, or lifts up, the Holy Spirit, who takes away vices and sins from people, or raises the fallen to sublime things, and makes them retreat from the very cold North wind, from which evils blaze up over the whole earth (Ecclesiasticus 43); and in Jeremiah, that terrifying pot is kindled from the face of the North wind (Jeremiah 1). They also refer to the great cloud in relation to the person of Christ, who came to Egypt of this world upon a light cloud: and properly it is called great in comparison with the lesser clouds, namely, the prophets and apostles and all the saints, of whom it is written: And thy truth unto the clouds (Ps. XXXV, 6); and: I will command the clouds that they rain no rain upon Israel (Isai. V, 6); and elsewhere: The cloud is the dust of his feet (Naum I, 3); and again: Clouds and darkness are round about him (Ps. XCVI, 2). And also the shining fire and the splendor around it, according to what is written: God is a consuming fire (Deut. IV, 24). The Savior says that he came to send fire upon the earth, and desires to burn in us and all who believe (Luke XI); although he brings terror and punishment to sinners, nevertheless he shines with splendor and is full of light and brightness. Therefore, he purifies us so that he may grant us greater joys in purity and purification.
