(Verse 16, 17.) Therefore, all who devour you shall be devoured, and all your enemies shall be carried into captivity; and those who plunder you shall be plundered, and all your plunderers I will give for prey. For I will restore health to you, and your wounds I will heal, declares the Lord, because they have called you an outcast: 'It is Zion, for whom no one cares.' And under Zerubbabel we know that these things happened, when the Babylonians and Chaldeans devastated the Assyrians, and then the Babylonians and Chaldeans, along with the Medes and Persians, captured Babylon and destroyed it. Then Zion began to have the Lord seeking, and the scar of its wounds was covered, and it was healed from its ailments, which is more fully and perfectly accomplished in Christ.
