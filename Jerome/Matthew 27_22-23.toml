(Verse 22, 23.) Pilate said to them: What then shall I do with Jesus, who is called Christ? They all said: Let him be crucified. The governor asked: What evil has he done? But they shouted even louder, saying: Let him be crucified. Pilate gave many opportunities to release the Savior. First, he compared him to a just thief. Then he asked: What then shall I do with Jesus, who is called Christ? That is, who is your king. When they replied, Let him be crucified, he did not immediately agree; but according to the suggestion of his wife, who had said: Have nothing to do with that righteous man, he also replied: What evil has he done? By saying this, Pilate absolved Jesus. But they shouted even more, saying: Crucify him. So that what was said in the twenty-first psalm would be fulfilled: Many dogs have surrounded me; A congregation of evildoers have encircled me. And that which Jeremiah said: My inheritance has become like a lion in the forest; They have raised their voices against me. Isaiah also agrees with this statement: I waited for them to do justice, but they did iniquity, not righteousness; they made a loud cry.
