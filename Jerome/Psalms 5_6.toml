What Scripture says in the words “you destroy all who speak falsehood” we should interpret as referring to heretics, both from the forward movement of the psalm and from the order within the movement itself. The doer of evil has, indeed, killed his own soul; but the heretic—the liar—has killed as many souls as he has seduced.… Every heretic is bloodthirsty, for every day he spills the blood of souls.… Deceitful is the right word. He is both a murderer and a practitioner of deceit. How is he deceitful? His words deliberately misrepresent the words of the Lord.… Just think of the condition of the heretic: the Lord abhors him!
