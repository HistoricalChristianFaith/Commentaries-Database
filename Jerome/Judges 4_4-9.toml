Because these nations have come as enemies against your people, let us hear what judgment the psalmist calls down upon them. “Deal with them as with Midian; as with Sisera.” You have read the book of Judges; this is that Midian whom Gideon defeated. “As with Sisera and Jabin.” Jabin and Sisera are the foes whom Deborah and Barak conquered. “At the torrent Kishon, who perished at Endor.” Deborah and Barak destroyed Sisera, the general of the army. So much for what Scripture says; learn now what it means. Lord, because they are so arrogant, because they have come with a mighty army, because their prince is Nebuchadnezzar9 the king of the Assyrians, because they are the forces of the sons of Lot, because they follow the example of the fallen angels, because in their pride they have claimed equality with you; for all these reasons, I beg of you to overpower them, not by a man but to their shame by a woman.“They became dung on the ground.” Who? Midian, Sisera and Jabin, these three became putrid on the ground like dung. The name Midian means “one who is negligent of judgment.” The warriors against your people are heedless of the judgment that is to come. Sisera is understood as “the vision of a horse.” Your people’s enemies are not of your flock or of your herd but are stallions that rage with madness over the fillies. Stallions are always ready for battle. “And Jabin.” Jabin means “discernment.” They who trust in their own wisdom and not in the glory of God rot on the ground like dung. They who were glorying in their army, whose king was the Assyrian, and who used to boast “I will scale the heavens,” not only fell down to earth but on the ground became dung.
