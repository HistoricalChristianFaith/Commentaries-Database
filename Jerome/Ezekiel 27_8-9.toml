(Vers. 8, 9.) The inhabitants of Sidon and Arad were your sailors. Your wise men, Tyre, became your captains. The elders of Biblos and their wise men provided sailors for the service of your various goods. All the ships of the sea and their sailors were in the service of your commerce. LXX: Your princes dwelled in Sidon and the men of Arad were your sailors. Your wise men, Sora, who were in you, they were your captains. The elders of Tyre and its wise men were in you: they strengthened your counsel, and all the ships of the sea, and their sailors became your servants in the west of the west. It was said above: Your neighbors who built you, have filled your beauty: before those who live far away come to them, he describes the aid of neighboring provinces. Your inhabitants, he says, or the princes of Sidon and Arad, which is a nearby island, your sailors. Your wise men, O Tyre, have become your governors. For the governing properly belongs to the wise, as Scripture says: 'Where there is no guidance, a people falls, but in an abundance of counselors there is safety.' (Proverbs 11:14) The elders or senior men of the Bible, and its wise men, provided sailors for your service, strengthened the counsel of Tyre, and provided various merchandise. And all the ships of the sea, with their sailors, were part of the trading people of Tyre, or in the far west. This, meanwhile, according to the letter. But according to mystical understanding, because Sidonians are interpreted as hunters, and Aradians, who lay down: we will say that Tyre is a glorious and most proud city, which, with the wind blowing, is to be destroyed afterwards, has citizens, or rather hunter princes, about whom it is written: Our soul has been taken like a sparrow from the trap of the hunters. For where we read hunters, in Hebrew it is written, of the Sidonians. These people come to the unwary souls, who are placed in high positions, in order to lead them to earthly things, and they become the steersmen, leading them to shipwrecks. But the wise men of Tyre, who are received in a bad way, through which they are wiser than the sons of light, themselves guide Tyre prepared for shipwreck. The elders of the Bible and its wise men provided sailors to Tyre for service, or they strengthened its counsel. The holy history tells that there were many seniors rejected by the Lord, and the juniors chosen as the symbol of the Synagogue and the Church. Senior Cain is added, and junior Abel is chosen (Genesis IV): Ishmael, the son of Abraham, is estranged from his father, and junior Isaac receives the inheritance (Genesis XXI). Among the sons of Isaac, senior Esau is a hunter and wanders in the forests, while junior Jacob simply dwells at home (Genesis XXV). And it is written in Malachi: Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated (Mal. I, 2). And rightly, according to the Apostle (Rom. IX, 13), they had done neither good nor evil in their mother's womb, so that one would be chosen and the other rejected, except that in the type, as we have said, the elder is repelled, and the younger assumed. All, he says, the ships of the sea and their sailors were in the people of the trading of Tyre, or in the furthest west. How is the Song of Songs called, and the age of ages, and the work of works; so that the greater song is compared to other songs, and the longer age to other ages, and the more useful work to other works: thus the West of the West is called, to signify the magnitude of the Western parts. And beautifully do the ships of the sea, and their sailors, and the rowers who assist the ship of Tyre, not go towards the East, nor towards the rising of the light, where the sun of justice is born, but towards the West of the West, where the light sets, and where the beginning of darkness is.
