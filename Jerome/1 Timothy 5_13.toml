Paul speaks of idle persons and busybodies, whether virgins or widows, such as go from house to house calling on married women. They display an unblushing effrontery greater than that of a stage parasite. Cast them from you as you would the plague. For “evil communications corrupt good manners,” and women like these care for nothing but their lowest appetites. They will often urge you, saying, “My dear creature, make the best of your advantages, and live while life is yours,” and, “Surely you are not laying up money for your children.” Given to wine and wantonness, they instill all manner of mischief into people’s minds and induce even the most austere to indulge in enervating pleasures.

It is true that in writing to Timothy the apostle from fear of fornication is forced to countenance second marriage.… He is offering not a crown to those who stand but a helping hand to those who are down. What must a second marriage be if it is looked on merely as an alternative to the brothel!
