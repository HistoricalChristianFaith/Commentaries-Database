Daniel, the prophet, says to Nebuchadnezzar, that the most High rules in the kingdom of humankind, and he will give it to whomsoever it shall please him, and he will appoint the lowest and the basest person over it. Ask him the reason why he appoints the lowest and the basest person as king and does what he wills; question the justice of the will of him of whom it is written, “He raises up the needy from the earth and lifts up the poor out of the dunghills, that he may place him with the princes, with the princes of his people.” Is he, perhaps, according to your [the Pelagians’] view, seeking glory and popular acclaim without judgment and justice, so that he raises the lowly to royal power and humiliates the powerful in exchange? Listen to the prophet, who says, “All the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as nothing before him.” For he has done whatsoever he wished in heaven and on earth, and there is no one who will resist his will or who can say to him, “Why have you done this?” His works are all true and his ways justice, and he can humiliate the proud.
