(Verse 32) And as they went out, they found a man of Cyrene, named Simon: him they compelled to bear his cross. Lest anyone think that this account is contradictory to the story of John the Evangelist. For he said that the Lord, going out of the praetorium, carried his own cross; but Matthew reports that they found a man of Cyrene, named Simon, whom they compelled to bear Jesus' cross. But this is to be understood, that Jesus, going out of the praetorium, himself carried his own cross; afterward they encountered Simon, to whom they imposed the task of carrying the cross. According to anagoge, the nations accept the cross of Jesus, and the obedient stranger carries the ignominy of the Savior.
