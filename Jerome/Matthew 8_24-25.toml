(Verse 24, 25.) But He was sleeping. And they came to Him and woke Him, saying, 'Lord, save us, we are perishing!' And Jesus said to them, 'Why are you afraid, you of little faith?' We read the foreshadowing of this sign in Jonah (Jonah 1), when, as the others were in danger, he was secure, and slept, and was awakened; and by the power and mystery of his passion, he saved those who woke him.
