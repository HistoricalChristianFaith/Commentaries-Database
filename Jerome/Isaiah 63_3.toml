Edom is by interpretation either “earthy” or “bloody”; Bosor either “flesh” or “in tribulation.” In a few words, [Isaiah] shows the whole mystery of the resurrection, that is, the reality of the flesh and the growth in glory. And the meaning is, Who is he that comes up from the earth, comes up from blood? According to the prophecy of Jacob, he has bound his foal to the vine and has trodden the winepress alone, and his garments are red with new wine from Bosor, that is, from flesh or from the tribulation of the world, for he himself has conquered the world. And, therefore, his garments are red and shining, because he is beautiful in form, more than the sons of humankind, and on account of the glory of his triumph they have been changed into a white robe; and then, in truth, as concerns Christ’s flesh, were fulfilled the words, “Who is this who is coming up all in white, leaning upon her beloved?” And there is also that which is written in the same book, “My beloved is white and ruddy.”
