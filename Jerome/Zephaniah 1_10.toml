(Verse 10.) And it shall come to pass in that day, says the Lord, there shall be a voice of crying from the fish gate, and a wailing from the Second Quarter, and a great crashing from the hills. LXX: And it shall come to pass in that day, says the Lord, there shall be a voice of crying from the gate of the mourners, and a wailing from the Second Quarter, and a great crashing from the hills. In the day of the sacrifice of the Lord, when he stretches out his hand over Judah and over all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the enemy army surrounds them, there shall be a voice of crying from the fish gate and a wailing from the Second Quarter, and a great crashing from the hills. They called it the Fish Gate, which leads to Diospolis and Joppa, and it was closer to the sea than all the roads to Jerusalem, as Ezra also relates: They built the Fish Gate, the sons of Assena, they covered it and set up doors, bolts, and bars (2 Nehemiah 3:3). But what he says, and the wailing from the second, signifies the gate of the second wall in the same region, as it is also written in the book of Kings: Then went Hilkiah the high priest, and Ahikam, and Achbor, and Shaphan, and Asaiah, to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvah, the son of Harhas, keeper of the wardrobe, who dwelt in Jerusalem in the second (2 Kings 22:14). But great contrition speaks from the hills of the mind of Zion and the higher part of the city: for when the higher and fortified parts of the city were occupied, it is easier to descend the slope. But if we want to accept that day which the Lord threatens, the day of judgment as mentioned above, at that time when the Ancient of Days will be seated, and the books will be opened, and the conscience of each person will be laid bare, then the voice of the cry of those repenting will be fulfilled from the gate (Dan. VII). For the first gate of the eyes will be the one through which sins will be presented before our eyes, and all the splendor and image of ancient crimes and vices and excesses will be brought forth into the open. Then that which is written will be true: Behold the man and his works before his face. Therefore, conscience will torment him, and after he has been struck with remorse and cried out at the first gate of the eyes, he will also howl at the second one, which we can understand with our ears. For through these very senses, by which vices had crept in, their punishment will be felt, when we see what we have done and, being instructed by words, listening to the entire order of sins, we will be compelled to wail, and in us whatever had been exalted will be crushed, and because of our blindness and deaf ears, it was unknown to us. Or certainly, when lofty words and erudition coming from on high crush and break us, and are fulfilled in action: I groaned with the groaning of my heart (Ps. 39:9), so that the sacrifice of a broken spirit may be pleasing to God (Ps. 50); in us, who are humans, and have not committed such great sins to be compared to mountains, the hills are broken. However, in the devil and his angels, the heights of the mountains will be crushed. Many believe, according to the history that we have recounted to the times of the Babylonians, that this should be understood as referring to the first coming of the Savior, when because of excessive sins and the clamor of the people: 'His blood be on us and on our children' (Matt. XXVII, 25), Jerusalem was surrounded by an army and consumed by a crowd of mocking children, namely Vespasian and Titus, the two bears (IV Kings II). Indeed, this understanding is more in line with our faith, but in such a way that we know it can also be consistent with the previous history, or at least be a type of the second and perfect destruction of Jerusalem. Moreover, it must also be noted (for the proverb () clearly means in Hebrew not the gate of those who wound, but the gate of the fish) allegorically, that the gate of the fish is in Jerusalem, through which good fish are brought in, having been separated from the bad, and they mourn while the others enter who remained outside. Certainly, at the end of the world and in the consummation, those who did not observe their baptism will mourn from the first gate of fishes; those who did not perform worthy penance will mourn from the second; there will be great sorrow over the hills, which were not bent down for sins to submit their necks and bewail their crimes. Through these two gates, the gate of baptism and the gate of penance, one enters or returns to Jerusalem, that is, to the Church of God.
