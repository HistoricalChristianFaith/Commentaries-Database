(Verse 28, 29) From the sound of the shouting of your helmsmen, the fleets will be thrown into confusion, and all who held the oar will come down from their ships. The sailors, and all the helmsmen of the sea, the shipmasters and the rowers, will stand on land, and they will wail loudly over you, and cry out bitterly. They will throw dust on their heads, and cover themselves with ashes (or spread ashes on themselves). And what follows: They will shave their heads because of you, and put on sackcloth; they will weep for you with bitter mourning, and take up a lamentation over you. In the Septuagint it is not found, but it is added in the Theodotian Edition. When Tyre falls, its governors will be troubled, and they will descend from their ships, and oarsmen and sailors and rowers, and all the governors of the sea, tossed by the waves, will finally stand on solid ground; and they will lament with a loud voice over it, which they previously enriched with their merchandise, and they will signify the bitterness of their minds with a clamor: and they will also throw dust or dirt on their heads, repenting of their earthly deeds. And they shall be sprinkled with ashes or calves, according to the Law (Num. XX), in order to be purified: or certainly they shall lay ashes upon themselves, according to that which is said to Jerusalem: Scatter the earth upon thy head, and lay ash beneath thee, and make lamentation (Jerem. VI, 16). And in the Gospel it is written: If these signs had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have done penance long ago in sackcloth and ashes (Luc. X, 13). And the Psalmist says: I have eaten ashes like bread (Psal. CI, 10). And they shave their head over Tyre, and they make baldness, which usually happens in mourning, at that time when the magnitude of sorrow has excluded all joy. But the apostles' hair was numbered, because they had consecrated their hair like the Nazarenes to the Lord (Matthew 10; Luke 6). And as long as Samson had hair, he possessed strength, but when his hair was cut off, he was captured by the Philistines (Judges 16). But when it is said, and they shall gird themselves with sackcloth, the old lust of the loins is condemned, so that those who lived in pleasures may afterwards live in austerity and hardness, repenting. The people of Nineveh had sackcloth. And again, it is said to Jerusalem: 'Wail to me like a bride wearing sackcloth, grieving for her husband as a virgin.' And they will mourn for you, it says, with bitter weeping. For it is better to enter the house of mourning than the house of feasting, so that they may mourn for Tyre and sing a mournful song, as the following Scripture adds. But in order to know the progress of those who mourn the falling, and who dwelled before in the heart of the sea, let the prophets teach us by their example: they themselves are commanded to mourn for Tyre, so that, after the time of repentance is fulfilled, it may be restored to its former state, and, taking up the lyre, may sound forth for the Lord. Read Isaiah. Some, though ridiculous (but still worth reading), interpret governors as bishops of heretics, counselors as priests, helmsmen as archdeacons, rowers and sailors as deacons, and carriers refer to the whole people. If they had added the devil as the shipmaster, they would have completed the tragedy. All of them will wail together and cry bitterly, and they will repent after they sense the shipwreck of their own ship and stand on land, and they will lose all the splendor of the false name of knowledge. And instead of joy and happiness, they will mark repentance with bitterness in their hearts.
