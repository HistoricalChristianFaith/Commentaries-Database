(Vers. 4, 5.) Because the Lord says these things to the eunuchs: If they keep my Sabbaths, and choose what I desire, and hold fast to my covenant, I will give them a place in my house and within my walls, and a better name than sons and daughters; I will give them an everlasting name that will not be cut off. LXX: Thus says the Lord to the eunuchs: Those who keep my Sabbaths, and choose what I desire, and hold fast to my covenant, I will give them a place in my house and a named place within my walls, better than sons and daughters; I will give them an everlasting name that will not fail. He had proposed two things, proselytes and eunuchs. First, he speaks about eunuchs and gives them instructions for living, and promises them future rewards. And after them, he comes to the proselytes, promising them similar things. Therefore, he speaks to the eunuchs who have said in despair, 'Behold, I am a withered tree' (Exod. 23), so that they may not consider themselves subject to the curse spoken of the barren: 'Cursed is the barren one who does not bear seed in Israel' (Deut. 7). Yes, he said, if they have kept my Sabbaths and chosen the things I wanted and not the things I allowed for the weakness of the listeners, and have faithfully kept my covenant or testament, I will give them a place in my house, and in my Temple, and in the strong walls of my city, and a better name to my sons and daughters, which will never be erased from memory. Those who are eunuchs, as we mentioned before, who are devoted to the things of God; to them speaks Wisdom, which is called by the name of Solomon: Blessed is the sterile and stainless woman, who has not known a bed in sin, she will have fruit in the visitation of souls. And the eunuch, who has not worked with his hand iniquity, nor thought evil against the Lord. For the chosen grace of his faith will be given, and a pleasing part in the temple of the Lord (Wisdom 3:13, 14). This one is fruitful in virginity; this eunuch exercises power in the kingdom of heaven, and violently seizes it. This one is the keeper of the sabbaths, so that he never engages in the works of marriages (I Corinthians 7). This one has chosen what the Lord willed, to offer more than what was commanded: to consider not his indulgence, but his will. This one holds the everlasting covenant of the Lord, so that he does not cease from prayer for a time, and again returns to it, but knows that he will be accepted in the house of the Lord, which is his Church, the best place. For there are many mansions with the Father (John XIV). And whoever is a eunuch, and does all the things that are written, will have the best place within its walls, so that he may become a tower of the Lord, and may stand in a priestly rank, and may have many spiritual children for the children of the flesh. It is said that such was the eunuch whom Jesus loved most, the Evangelist John, according to the accounts of Ecclesiastical history, who reclined on Jesus' breast (John 13); who, with Peter walking more slowly, ran to the Lord on the wings of his virginity (John 20); who, immersing himself in the mysteries of the divine birth, dared to say what all ages did not know: In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God; this was in the beginning with God (John 1, 2). Therefore, let all the mockery of the Jews cease, and let him no longer offer himself for ridicule, opening the kingdom of heaven to those of half-heartedness, when chastity does not lie in the weakness of the body, but in the willingness of the soul.
