The Lord seeing the centurion’s faith, humbleness, and thoughtfulness, straightway promises to go and heal him; “Jesus saith unto him, I will come and heal him.”.
As we commend the centurion’s faith in that he believed that the Saviour was able to heal the paralytic; so his humility is seen in his professing himself unworthy that the Lord should come under his roof; as it follows, “And the centurion answered and said unto him, Lord, I am not worthy that thou shouldestcome under my roof.”.
The thoughtfulness of the centurion appears herein, that he saw the Divinity hidden beneath the covering of body; wherefore he adds, “But speak the word only, and my servant will be healed.”
