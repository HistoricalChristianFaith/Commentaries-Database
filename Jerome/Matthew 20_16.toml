(Verse 16.) Is your eye evil because I am good? So the last shall be first, and the first last. For many are called, but few are chosen. This is the same meaning as the parable of the prodigal son in Luke, where the older son envies the younger and does not want to receive him when he returns and accuses the father of injustice. And so that we may know that this is the meaning we have said, the title and the end of this parable agree. So the last shall be first, and the first last. For many are called, but few are chosen.
