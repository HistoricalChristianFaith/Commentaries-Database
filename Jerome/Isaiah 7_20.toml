(Verse 20) On that day the Lord will shave with a hired razor, with those beyond the River, with the king of Assyria, the head, and the hair of the feet, and it will sweep away the beard, too. Some people think that this is a prophecy about the Assyrians, who, thirteen hundred years before they destroyed Jerusalem, ruled over the kingdom of Asia, Egypt, and Libya, and that they will be defeated by the Medes and Persians, and their empire will be destroyed. Others, however, believe that it refers to the Egyptians who were killed beyond the Euphrates River. But we believe that the hired razor, which is called the Assyrian in Jeremiah (Jer. 25), is indeed the instrument of the Assyrian king, whom in punishment of the sinful people, he also calls his own dove. Moreover, in the vision of Tyre (Ezek. 28), because he had worked very hard in building fortifications and carrying earth for the mound, and had been deprived of his wages when they fled, Egypt was given to him as payment and reward for his labor. Therefore, with this very sharp razor, and concerning those who live beyond the Euphrates River, namely the Assyrian king, the Lord will shave off all the hair and fur of the entire body from head to foot, as well as the beauty of the beard, which is an indication of manliness, from Judea, so that perhaps nothing, nothing beautiful remains in it, but that they may be compared to effeminate men, or rather, to dishonorable women.
