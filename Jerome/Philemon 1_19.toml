I, Paul, have written this with my own hand. I will repay it, not to mention that you owe me your very self." What he says is this: "Whatever Onesimus may have wronged you, I will repay. I, Paul, write this with my own hand. I will not remind you that you owe me your very self. But I say this as speaking to a stranger. Moreover, if I should regain my right due to the message of Christ, which I have preached to you, and you have become a Christian, you owe yourself to me. So if you are mine, and all your possessions are mine: Onesimus also, who is yours, is mine. Therefore, I could use him as my own; but I leave it to your will, so that you may have a reward by forgiving.
