(v. 14, 15) For just as a man going on a journey called his servants and entrusted to them his goods. And to one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one, each according to his ability. Then he went away. This man, the head of the household, undoubtedly is Christ, who after his resurrection victoriously ascended to the Father and, calling the apostles, handed down the gospel teaching, not giving more to one and less to another based on generosity and stinginess, but according to the abilities of the recipients: just as the Apostle says that he fed those who could not receive solid food with milk (I Cor. IV). And finally, he who had made five talents also gained ten, and he who had made two gained four, receiving the same joyful reward; not considering the magnitude of the gain, but the willingness to strive. Let us understand the various gifts that have been given to each, whether it be five, two, or one talent. In the first, let us consider all the senses examined: In the second, understanding and actions: In the third, reason, which separates humans from animals.
