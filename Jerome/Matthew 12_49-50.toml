(Verses 49, 50.) Behold my mother and my brothers. For whoever does the will of my Father who is in heaven, he is my brother and sister and mother. These are my mother, who daily begets me in the souls of believers. These are my brothers, who do the works of my Father. Therefore, he did not deny his mother, as Marcion and Manichaeus believed, that he was born from a phantom; but he preferred the apostles to kinship, so that we may also prefer the spirit to the flesh in comparison of love. Behold, your mother and brothers are standing outside, seeking you. Some of the Lord's brothers suspect that Joseph had children by another wife, following the delusions of the apocryphal writings and inventing a certain Melcha or Escha as a little woman. But as it is contained in the book that we wrote against Helvidius, by the brothers of the Lord, we understand the children of Mary's sister, who is said to be the mother of James the Lesser and Joseph and Judas, whom we read are called the brothers of the Lord in another place in the Gospel. But Scripture demonstrates that brothers are called consobrinos. Let us also say differently: The Savior speaks to the crowds, teaching the nations from within. His mother and brothers, that is, the synagogue and the Jewish people, stand outside and desire to enter, but they become unworthy of his word. And when they ask, inquire, and send a message, they receive the answer that they are free to enter and believe if they wish, but they cannot enter unless they ask someone else.
