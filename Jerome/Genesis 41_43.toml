(Verse 43.) And the herald cried out before him, and he set him over all the land of Egypt. Aquila translates it as: And he cried out in his presence with adgnition. Symmachus, interpreting the Hebrew speech, says: And he cried out before him 'Abrech' (). Therefore, it seems to me that the title 'herald' or the act of adgnition in greeting or adoring Joseph can be understood not so much as the Hebrews transmit it, saying 'tender father,' which is transferred in this speech; for 'Ab' means father, and 'Rech' means tender or most tender; and Scripture indicates that in wisdom indeed he was the father of all, but in age he was a young man and a boy.
