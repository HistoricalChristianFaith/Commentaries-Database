(Chapter 56, Verse 1) Thus says the Lord: Keep justice, and do righteousness, for my salvation is near to come, and my righteousness to be revealed. The Seventy, instead of righteousness, have translated mercy, the rest likewise. With the prophecy of the nations being fulfilled, which speaks of the coming of the word of God, changing the thorn and the nettle into cypress and myrtle, Isaiah speaks to the listeners of that time, urging them to do all that is right and prepare for the coming of the Savior, for He is the justice and mercy of God. For if the thoughts of the Saints are judgments: and we should have trained senses to discern between good and evil, why do we not always hold judgment, so that we do not despise the person of the poor in judgment, nor be intimidated by the power of the rich: but rather judge great as small, knowing according to Moses that the judgment of the Lord is, who judges the judges (Deut. I); according to which it is also read in the psalm: God stands in the congregation of the gods: but judges among the gods (Ps. LXXXI, 1). This that is now said: Keep judgment, and do justice, is similar to: Blessed are they that keep judgment, and do justice at all times (Psalm 105:3); so that they may justly pursue what is just. Although in the name of justice, every place seems to signify to me that whoever has done one justice is said to have fulfilled all the virtues that follow one another and adhere to one another: so that whoever has one, has them all, and whoever lacks one, lacks them all. This is what the fourteenth psalm signifies: He who walks blamelessly, and works righteousness (Ps. XIV, 2). And elsewhere it is written: Learn righteousness, you who dwell on the earth (Isai. XXVI, 9). And the words of the saints testify that the Savior, who became our righteousness, holiness, and redemption, is the mercy of God (I Cor. I): And God has sent forth his mercy and his truth (Ps. LVI, 4).
