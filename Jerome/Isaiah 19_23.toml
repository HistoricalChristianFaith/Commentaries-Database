(Verse 23) On that day there will be a road from Egypt to Assyria, and Assyria will enter Egypt, and Egypt will enter Assyria; and the Egyptians will serve Assyria. Before the coming of Christ, each nation had its own king, and no one could go from one nation to another; but in the Roman empire, all became one. Let the learned reader review the ancient histories, and from the Euphrates to the Tigris, let them know that the whole region in between was inhabited by the Assyrians. Therefore, what the ancient Assyrians, whom we now call Syrians, called the whole from a part. Now, when it is said that the Egyptians serve the Syrians, it should be understood either that the Roman legions, equipped with Syrian soldiers, guard Egypt, or that there is trade between the two nations, and the cities of Syria benefit from the abundance of Egypt, just as, conversely, Egypt is irrigated by the goods of Palestine and Phoenicia. Some of our people mistakenly refer this to a thousand years and pronounce that it will happen in the manner of the Jews at the end of the world, when the Antichrist, coming from Assyria, will possess Egypt and Ethiopia.

(Verse 23) On that day there will be a highway from Egypt to Assyria. The Assyrians will go to Egypt and the Egyptians to Assyria. The Egyptians will worship with the Assyrians. As we have shown, the preceding events have been for the good of the Egyptians. Five cities in their land will speak the language of Canaan and swear allegiance to the Lord of Hosts. They will have an altar to the Lord in their midst, as well as a marker, testimony, sign, and savior to deliver them. The Egyptians will recognize the Lord and offer sacrifices, gifts, and vows. They will be healed and return to the Lord, finding favor and healing once again. Therefore, it should be understood that serving the Assyrians is also for the good of the Egyptians. For the Apostle serves the believers in order to make them gain (1 Corinthians 9). And Esau submits to his brother Jacob (Genesis 33), in order to become a partaker of his blessings. Therefore, those who were saved first from the Gentiles and have the altar of the Lord in themselves, will save those who persist in hardness through their servitude, and through their mixture and association with them, they will go to the Assyrians, so that they may bring the Assyrians to Egypt; and afterwards they may be able to reach the Israelite people. For this reason, I believe that a faithful woman should serve an unfaithful man, in order to gradually draw him from Egypt and Assyria to Judaea.
