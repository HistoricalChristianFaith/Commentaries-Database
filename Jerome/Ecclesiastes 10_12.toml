"The
words of a wise man win favour, but a fool's lips devour him. "Foolishness, if it is happy in its rusticity, will know
less evil. But now he wages war against
wisdom, and whatever prudence he sees in a learned man, he does not take to be
incited by enthusiasm. For a wise man
speaks words of knowledge, words of thanks, which are of use to those that hear
them, but the lips of a fool do not receive what is said, as it is said; on the
contrary they try to trip up a wise man and make him similar to a fool. And in fact a wise man is taught when a
foolish man speaks in his ear, and you could almost say that his words are lost
in the deep swell. Therefore he is
blessed, who speaks in the ear of a wise man.
