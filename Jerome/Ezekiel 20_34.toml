(Verse 34) And I will bring you out from the peoples and gather you out of the countries where you were scattered, with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm, and with wrath poured out I will reign over you. 'I will not let you be in the nations any longer, nor will I allow you to be held in everlasting captivity, but I will bring you out from the peoples, and gather you from the countries where hostile necessity has dispersed you to serve. However, I will do this not to destroy and obliterate you, but to be your king.' From which we also understand that what the heretics call the cruelty of the Creator, sounds like mercy: while he is angry and furious for this purpose, and pours out all his fury, in order to draw them back to his kingdom, who have chosen to serve the tyranny of demons.
