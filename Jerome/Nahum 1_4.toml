(Verse 4) Rebuking the sea, and drying it up, and leading all the rivers to the desert. It is described according to the power of God, who will avenge Israel's adversaries, showing that it is not difficult for Him to destroy the Assyrians, whose majesty even includes the ability to change the elements. Or certainly because we have already said that this is a prophecy about the end of the world, and you can simply understand this: When the consummation of the world comes and the heaven and earth pass away, the sea and rivers will also dry up. But to me, reading this in the Psalms: The great and wide sea, in which are creeping things innumerable, both small and great beasts. There the ships pass through. This dragon which You have formed to play there (Psalm 104:25-26), seems worthy of the goodness and mercy of God to destroy all the bitterness and saltiness of the sea by its threat, and to humble the dragon reigning in the waters, and to dry up the abyss of malice in which small creepy things swim, innumerable whose worth is not to be numbered, for they are united with the dragon. Also leading rivers into the desert, it is draining all false knowledge of name, which, rising against God, it waters with the river of eloquence and the flow of words, and twisting whirlpools, it is carried with the amazement of spectators into the abyss. Look at Plato, behold Demosthenes, also Cicero, both philosopher and orator, and consider the leaders of the heretics, about whom there were Valentinus, Marcion, Bardesanes, Tatian, and you will not doubt about the rivers. But all of these things the Lord Jesus will consume with the breath of his mouth and destroy with the brightness of his coming, and he will lead to the deserts. And at the same time, observe that according to the title, which is inscribed: The Assumption of Nineveh: the book of the vision of Nahum the Elkoshite, rightly and in a figurative sense, the world is understood to represent Nineveh, and the rivers of its eloquence will dry up in its culmination.

Basan and Carmel are sick, and the flower of Lebanon is withered. Metaphorically, by Basan and Carmel and Lebanon, a fertile region and mountains adorned, the devastation of Assyria is shown, because once powerful and flourishing and ruling over many nations, it will be laid waste by the wrath of the Lord. We can also understand this as referring to the end of the world, where the powerful and noble, who abound in great riches, will suddenly perish and it will be said to them: Fool, tonight is the time when your soul will be taken from you, and what you have prepared, whose will it be? (Luke 12:20). Furthermore, according to the interpretation of names, because Basan signifies confusion and ignominy, we affirm that at the consummation of the world, all things worthy of shame and disgrace will be weakened when the Lord comes. Not only will sins be brought to nothing, but even Carmel, which signifies the knowledge of circumcision, as well as those who seem rich and flourishing in good works, will tremble and be filled when Christ comes. And that which is said in the Gospel will be fulfilled: 'When the Son of man comes, will he find faith upon the earth?' (Luke 18:8). Indeed, as wickedness increases, the love of many will grow cold, and because of this, the wrath of God will come.
