Have recourse, O Lord, always to your mercy, and sustain the weakness of my flesh by your divine assistance. “What have I to do,” he says, “with you also, you sons of Zeruiah? Let Shimei curse. The Lord has bidden him to curse David. And who shall say to him, ‘Why have you done so?’ ” For the will of God is not to be discussed but kindly accepted.… Therefore, the commandments of God are possible, which we know David had kept; and, yet, we find holy people growing weary in maintaining justice forever.
