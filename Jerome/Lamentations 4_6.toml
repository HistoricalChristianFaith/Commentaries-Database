Need we be surprised that, when saints are compared, some are better, some worse, since the same holds good in the comparison of sins? To Jerusalem, pierced and wounded with many sins, it is said, “Sodom is justified by you.” It is not because Sodom, which has sunk forever into ashes, is just in itself, that it is said by Ezekiel, “Sodom shall be restored to its former estate,” but that, in comparison with the more accursed Jerusalem, it appears just. For Jerusalem killed the Son of God; Sodom through fullness of bread and excessive luxury carried its lust beyond all bounds. The publican in the Gospel who struck his breast as though it were a collection of his worst thoughts and, conscious of his offenses, dared not lift up his eyes, is justified rather than the proud Pharisee. And Tamar in the guise of a harlot deceived Judah, and in the estimation of this man himself who was deceived, was worthy of the words, “Tamar is more righteous than I.” All this goes to prove that not only in comparison with divine majesty are people far from perfection, but also when compared with angels and other people who have climbed the heights of virtue. You may be superior to someone whom you have shown to be imperfect and yet be outstripped by another; and consequently you may not have true perfection, which, if it is perfect, is absolute.
