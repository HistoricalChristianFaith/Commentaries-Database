(Verse 25) If they called the head of the household Beelzebub, how much more his household members! Therefore, do not fear them. Beelzebub is an idol of Accaron, which is called the idol of flies in the book of Kings (2 Kings 1). Beel is the same as Baal: Zebub means fly. Thus, they called the prince of demons by the filthy name of the most impure idol, which means fly, because of the filth that destroys the sweetness of oil (Ecclesiastes 10).
