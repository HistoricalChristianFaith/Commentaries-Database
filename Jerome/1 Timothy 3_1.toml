Should the entreaties of your brethren induce you to take orders, I shall rejoice that you are lifted up and fear lest you may be cast down. You will say, “if a man desire the office of a bishop, he desires a good work.” I know that; but you should add what follows: such a one “must be blameless, the husband of one wife, sober, chaste, prudent, well-prepared, given to hospitality, apt to teach, not given to wine, no striker but patient.” … Woe to the man who goes in to the supper without a wedding garment.
