(Verse 11 and following) And I answered and said to him, 'What are these two olive trees on the right and the left side of the lampstand?' And I answered the second time and said to him, 'What are these two olive branches which are beside the two golden pipes, from which the golden oil pours out?' And he said to me, 'Do you not know what these are?' And I said, 'No, my lord.' And he said, 'These are the two anointed ones who stand beside the Lord of the whole earth.' LXX: And I answered and said to him, 'What are these two olive trees on the right side of the lampstand and on its left side?' And I answered a second time and said to him, 'What are the two olive branches which are beside the two golden pipes, which pour out the golden fluid from themselves?' And he said to me, 'Do you not know what these are?' And I said, 'No, my Lord.' Then he said, 'These are the two sons of fatness who stand before the Lord of the entire earth.' Asking the prophet what the two olive trees meant, one of which stood at the right side of the lampstand and the other at the left, the Lord or the angel of the Lord refused to answer. When the prophet understood this, he inquires a second time, saying: What are these two branches of the olive trees or two golden pipes, which in Hebrew are called Sinthoroth (in Greek, μυξωτῆρες), and which are themselves the two μυξωτῆρες upon which the two branches or two olive trees are placed, made of the purest gold. And when the prophet asked about the two branches, and was again questioned by the angel whether he knew what the two branches signified, and he said, 'No, Lord,' the angel of the Lord answered: 'These are two sons of oil, as Symmachus wished, or of splendor, as Aquila interpreted, that is, of brightness, or of richness, as the Septuagint translated, or of clarity, as Theodotion rendered: they stand before the Ruler of all the earth.' We read above about the two olive trees that were on the right and left of the lampstand. And therefore, the one who now asks about them, does not deserve to hear, because he does not remember the previous things, or because what was said there is obscure, he desires to hear more clearly here, or surely the silence of the angels confutes his stubbornness, because he claims to know greater things, although the Hebrews confirm that when he asked about the olive trees, he heard nothing, because he did not ask properly, nor did he inquire about everything he should have known. Finally, afterwards he inquires more fully, adding the olive branches or sprigs, about which he had remained silent above; for there he said: What are these two olive trees? here he asks; What are these two olive sprigs? metaphorically because, just as straight tree trunks are like ear heads, so these are covered by a certain wall of branches and leaves and rise up on high. Some of our people interpret the two olive trees as the Son and the Holy Spirit, and the middle lamp as God the Father. But I do not know how, without blasphemy, they accept one on the right, the other on the left. The branches or the clusters of olives also point to the incarnation of the Savior and the likeness of the dove of the Holy Spirit, because we cannot see the whole olives, but only a certain part and, so to speak, the little branches of the incarnation of Christ and the manifestation of the Holy Spirit shown to us. Others understand the two Testaments, the Gospel on the right, the Law on the left, because in the former there is a spiritual meaning, in the latter a physical one; and because we cannot explain the whole Gospel or the whole Law, and now we know in part and prophesy in part (1 Cor. 13:9), and we are not yet able to understand what is perfect. There are those who interpret the two branches of olives or the two ears of grain as representing the priesthood and the Law, which bring joy to the whole earth. Others believe that Enoch and Elijah, one of whom pleased God in uncircumcision and the other in circumcision, were taken up to heaven with their bodies (Genesis 5 and 1 Samuel 2). As for splendor, oil, fatness, and brightness, in Hebrew we read 'Isaar' (according to what is written in the Psalms about the joy and happiness of the saints: 'They shall be satisfied with the fatness of your house' - Psalm 36:8). The word 'πιότης' (or 'πιότητος') in Greek signifies more fatness than abundance. We have spoken these things as best we could and as far as the powers of our talent allowed, briefly touching upon the various opinions of the Hebrews and our own. If anyone should speak better or rather more truly, we willingly defer to them.
