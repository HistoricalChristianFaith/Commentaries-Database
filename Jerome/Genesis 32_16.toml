(Verse 16.) And Abraham heard Ephron, and Abraham weighed out to Ephron the silver, which he had spoken of in the hearing of the sons of Heth. In Hebrew, as we have written here, his first name is spelled Ephron and his second name is Ephran. For after he was overcome by the price, in order to sell the burial place for silver, even though Abraham was urging him, the letter vau, which is read as o by them, was removed from his name: and he was called Ephran instead of Ephron, with the Scripture signifying that he was not a man of consummate and perfect virtue who could sell the memories of the dead. Therefore, let it be known that those who sell graves, and are not compelled to accept a price, but extort it even from those unwilling, should have their name changed and their deserved fate be undone, since even the one who unwillingly receives it is secretly condemned.
