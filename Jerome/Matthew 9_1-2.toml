(Chapter 9, Verses 1-2) And Jesus got into a boat and crossed over, and came to his own city. And behold, they brought to him a paralytic lying on a bed. And Jesus seeing their faith, said to the paralytic: Take heart, my son, your sins are forgiven. By his city, we understand none other than Nazareth, from where he is also called the Nazarene. And they brought him, as we said before, a paralytic lying on a bed, because he himself was not able to enter. But Jesus, seeing not the faith of the one who was being offered, but of those who were offering, said to the paralyzed man: Have confidence, my son, your sins are forgiven you. Oh, wonderful humility! He calls despised and weak, dissolved in the joints of all his limbs, his son, whom the priests did not consider worthy of touching. Or certainly he calls him son because his sins are forgiven him. According to the allegory, sometimes the soul, lying in its body, with all the powers of its limbs dissolved, is offered to the Lord to be healed by the perfect teacher, and if it is healed by his mercy, it receives such great strength that it immediately carries its bed.
