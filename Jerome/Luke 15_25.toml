Or he says, You never gave me a kid, that is, no blood of prophet or priest has delivered us from the Roman power.
Now in that which he says, You have killed for him the fatted calf, he confesses that Christ has come, but envy has no wish to be saved.
Or after having said, &#8220;This is boasting, not truth,&#8221; the father does not agree with him, but restrains him in another way, saying, You are with me, bythe law under which you are bound; not as though he had not sinned, but because God continually drew him back by chastening. Nor is it wonderful that he lies to his father who hates his brother.
Or, in another way, all justice in comparison of the justice of God is injustice. Therefore Paul says, Who shall deliver me from the body of this death? and hence were the Apostles moved with anger at the request of the sons of Zebedee.
