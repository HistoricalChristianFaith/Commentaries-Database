In Jeremiah, we read concerning the future kingdom …, “They shall all know me, from the least to the greatest of them.” The context of this passage clearly shows that the prophet is describing the future kingdom. But how can there possibly be in it a least or greatest, if all are to be equal? The secret is disclosed in the Gospel: “Whoever shall do and teach, he shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven; but whoever shall teach and not do shall be least.” - "Against Jovinianus 2.27"
