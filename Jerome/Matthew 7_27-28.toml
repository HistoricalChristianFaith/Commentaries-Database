(Verse 27, 28) Whoever built his house on sand: and the rain descended, and the rivers came, and the winds blew, and they beat upon that house, and it fell: and great was the fall thereof. And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished these words, that the multitudes were astonished at his doctrine. The foundation which the Apostle, the architect, laid (I Cor. 3), is one, our Lord Jesus Christ. Upon this stable and firm foundation, and by itself a strong structure founded on massive support, is built the Church of Christ. Truly, every heretic's discourse is built for the purpose of collapsing upon a super unstable arena which cannot be securely cemented together nor reduced into one bond.
