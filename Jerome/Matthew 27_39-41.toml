(Verse 39 seqq.) And those passing by were blaspheming him, shaking their heads, and saying, 'Vah! You who destroy the temple of God and rebuild it in three days, save yourself; if you are the Son of God, come down from the cross.' Similarly, the chief priests, mocking with the scribes and elders, said, 'He saved others; he cannot save himself. He is the King of Israel; let him come down now from the cross, and we will believe in him. He trusts in God; let God deliver him now, if he desires him; for he said, "I am the Son of God."' But he, mocking, says that the foolish people had produced false witnesses.
