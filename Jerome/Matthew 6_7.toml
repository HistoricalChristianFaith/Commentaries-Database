(Verse 7.) But when praying, do not speak much, as the Gentiles do. For they think that they will be heard because of their many words. Therefore, do not be like them. If a Gentile speaks much in prayer, then a Christian should speak little. For God is not the listener of words, but of the heart. (Wisdom 1:6).
