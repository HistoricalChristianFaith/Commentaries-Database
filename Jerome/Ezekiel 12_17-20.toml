(Verse 17 and following) And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: Son of man, eat your bread with agitation (Vulgate adds but); and drink your water with haste and sorrow. And say (Vulgate says you shall say) to the people of the land: Thus says the Lord God to those who dwell in Jerusalem, in the land of Israel: They shall eat their bread with solicitude, and drink their water in desolation, so that the land may be desolate because of the multitude of its inhabitants, because of the wickedness of all who dwell in it. And the cities that are now inhabited shall be desolate, and the land shall be a desert: and you shall know that I am the Lord. LXX: And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: Son of man, you shall eat your bread with sorrow, and your water with torment and distress. And you shall say to the people of the land: Thus says the Lord God to the inhabitants of Jerusalem concerning the land of Israel: They shall eat their bread with scarcity and drink their water with dismay, so that the land may be desolate and its fullness be destroyed. For in impiety all who dwell in it and their cities which are inhabited shall be desolated, and the land shall be scattered, and you shall know that I am the Lord. After the prophecy of the prince and his companions, which was shown under a bodily image, came to the people: and whatever is said by the prophets is referred by the prophet to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, that in the evil of the siege, they eat their bread in distress and poverty, and drink their water with torment and tribulation. But these things, says the prophet, are spoken to you, that you may speak to the people of your land and say: Thus says the Lord to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, who are in the land of Israel: You will endure the evil of being besieged by Nebuchadnezzar and the Chaldeans, famine and thirst; so that all the land with its abundance may be destroyed, indicating by it those who inhabit it. And lest they think that this happens to them without cause: Say to them that because of their crimes and impiety, all the cities of Judah will be reduced to solitude, and all cultivation of the land will perish, so that they may know the wrathful God, whom they did not want to recognize as merciful. Can we, the inhabitants of Jerusalem, who believe in Christ, say, those who dwell in the Church. And if they have deserved by his sins the offense, let them eat bread with poverty, and drink water with mourning and distress: not food of bread, nor drink of water, but hunger, supporting the word and doctrine of God (Amos 8). For when, either by the fault of princes, who are to be captured and delivered to the Babylonians, or by our own hardness, we have lost the word of God, and have not deserved to have useful waters: then in sorrow and scarcity, we shall take our food, and the earth will lose the multitude of believers, and the cities, which are understood in the whole world as the Church, will be desolated, and the land will be deserted, so that all may know that the Lord has been offended. And indeed we can understand this even in times of persecution.
