(Chapter 31, Verse 1) In that time, says the Lord, I will be the God of all the tribes of Israel (or the people of Israel), and they will be my people. Unless the thought of the Lord is fulfilled and his fury rests upon the head of the wicked, the Lord cannot be the God of all the tribes of Israel. But he says this to the remnant who have been saved. Now if what has been said to us is opposed to us: I will be the God of the people of Israel, or all the tribes of Israel, let us consider the example: If you were children of Abraham, you would do the works of your father (John 8:39). And the Apostle writes: See Israel according to the flesh (I Cor. X, 8). From which he teaches that there is another Israel according to the spirit. Therefore, that Israel is the one who perceives God with the mind, or is the most righteous of the Lord, and such a people will be the people of God.
