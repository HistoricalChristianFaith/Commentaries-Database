Or, because by the Apostles the whole human race is seasoned.

That is, if the doctor have erred, by what other doctor shall he be corrected?

The illustration is taken from husbandry. Salt, though it be necessary for seasoning of meats and preserving flesh, has no further use. Indeed we read in Scripture of vanquished cities sown with salt by the victors, that nothing should thenceforth grow there.

(Verse 13) You are the salt of the earth. The apostles are called salt because through them the entire human race is season

25 Quod si sal evannerit, in quo salietur? Si doctor erraverit, a quo alio doctore emendabitur?

It is worthless beyond nothingness, except to be thrown out and trampled by men. An example is taken from agriculture. For salt, indeed, as a condiment for foods, and for drying meats, it is necessary, but it has no other use. Certainly, we read in the Scriptures that certain cities, sown with the salt of the victors' anger, so that no sprout would arise in them (Judith IX). Therefore, let the doctors and bishops beware and see: the powerful endure torments powerfully (Wisdom VI, 7); and there is no remedy, but to lead the ruins of the ancestors to Tartarus.
