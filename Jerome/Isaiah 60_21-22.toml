(Vers. 21, 22.) But your people, all the righteous, will inherit the land forever, the offspring of my planting: the work of my hands for glorification. The least will become a thousand, and the smallest will become a mighty nation. I, the Lord, will do this suddenly in its time. LXX: Your people, all the righteous, will always possess the land: preserving the plantation, the works of their hands for glory. The one who is small will become a thousand, and the least will become a great nation. I, the Lord, will gather them in due time. After the days of mourning and completion, when sadness turns into joy, the people of Zion will be completely righteous, not for a short time, but forever. And because they are righteous, they will possess the gentle land. It is not surprising if the land of the meek and the living holds the good things of the promise, which the Prophet yearns for, saying: I believe to see the good things of the Lord in the land of the living (Ps. 26:13), since it is the offspring of the Lord's planting and the work of His hands to glorify God. For every plant, my heavenly Father has not planted will be uprooted. (Matt. 15). According to the Septuagint, the people who keep God's plantation and the works of the Lord will be saved in the glory of the Creator. God speaks about a good plantation through Jeremiah: I planted you a good and true vine, which is called the vine of Sorec in Isaiah. (Isa. 5). And because Paul, with the consciousness of Christ speaking in him, could say: Be imitators of me, as I am of Christ. (1 Cor. 11:1), therefore he spoke to the Corinthians: I planted, Apollos watered, but God gave the increase. (1 Cor. 3:6). For they who are planted in the house of the Lord shall flourish in the courts of our God (Psalm 92). Then the one who was small shall become a thousand, and the least shall become a mighty nation, hearing from the Lord: You shall have authority over five or ten cities (Luke 19:17, 19); so that he shall be called a chiliarch. And he who, along with the Apostle, said: To me, the least of all the saints, this grace was given (Ephesians 3:8), shall be a prince of a great nation in the heavens, when the Lord sends his angels at the appointed time, and they gather together to him all the saints, from the highest heaven to the highest of it (Matthew 24): not only from Israel, but also from the people of the Gentiles, whom he was signifying when he said: And I have other sheep that are not of this fold, and it is necessary for me to gather them, so that there shall be one flock and one shepherd (John 10:16). But this will happen suddenly, so that when all things are desperate, then they will gather into the strongest nation. Although we see this being fulfilled in part in the Church every day, it will be more fully completed in the consummation of the world and in the second coming of the Savior.
