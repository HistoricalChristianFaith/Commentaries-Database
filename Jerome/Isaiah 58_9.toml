[Daniel 9:21] "While I was still speaking in my prayer, behold the man Gabriel, whom I had seen at the beginning of the vision." He calls the previous vision preceding this one the beginning. The effect of his prayer was considerable, and the promise of God was fulfilled which says, "While thou art yet speaking, lo, I am at hand" (Isaiah 58:9). And Gabriel appears not as an angel or archangel, but as a man (vir), a term used to indicate the quality of virtue rather than specifying his sex.

"...he quickly flew to me and touched me at the time of the evening sacrifice." It is stated that he flew, because he had made his appearance as a man. It is said that it was at the time of the evening sacrifice, in order to show that the prophet's prayer had persisted from the morning sacrifice even unto the evening sacrifice, and that God for that reason directed His mercy towards him.

One who is not bound by such chains of sin is found only with difficulty. And a soul is rarely discovered who does not have this extremely heavy collar around its neck, oppressing it with such terrestrial work that it cannot gaze at heaven at all, but only the earth. This also recalls the woman in the Gospel whom Satan conquered for eighteen years, keeping her bent over and unable to look toward heaven. …Similarly, if we refrain from doing the things just mentioned and if we accomplish the deeds that are to be outlined, so that we would give food to the hungry … with our very soul, helping them in whichever way we are able to help, and this “not begrudgingly or under compulsion,” but giving from the soul, thus we receive more benefits than we give, for “God loves a cheerful giver.” This means that we should saturate the hungry or afflicted soul, instead of restoring it just partially, and if we suffer with the suffering and mourn with those who mourn, then our light will arise in the darkness, that light that said, “I am the light that came into the world so that all who believe in me would not remain in the darkness” but “have the light of life.” For “the lamp of our body is the eye; if it is good, our entire body will be illuminated.” …
We can identify this fountain with none other than that to whom it was said, “With you is the fountain of life,” which irrigates his church unceasingly, along with the heart of every believer.
