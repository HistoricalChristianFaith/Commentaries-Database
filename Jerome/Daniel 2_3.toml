Verse 3. "And the king said to them, 'I have seen a dream, and from the confusion of my mind I do not know what I have seen.'" There remained in the king's heart only a shadow, so to speak, or a mere echo or trace of the dream, with the result that if others should retell it to him, he would be able to recall what he had seen, and they would certainly not be deceiving him with lies.
