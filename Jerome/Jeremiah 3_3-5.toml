No, a widow must take every precaution not to overstep by an inch the bounds of chastity. For if she once oversteps them and breaks through the modesty that becomes a matron, she will soon riot in every kind of excess. So much so that the prophet’s words shall be true of her, “You have a whore’s forehead, you refuse to be ashamed.”

When they go out, they do their best to attract notice and with nods and winks encourage troops of young fellows to follow them. Of each and all of these the prophet’s words are true, “You have a whore’s forehead. You refuse to be ashamed.” Their robes have but a narrow purple stripe, it is true. And their headdress is somewhat loose, so as to leave the hair free.
