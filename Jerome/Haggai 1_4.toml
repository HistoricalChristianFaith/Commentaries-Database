(Verse 4.) And now thus says the Lord of hosts: Set your hearts upon your ways. Let there not be a time for speaking one thing and doing another: turn my commandments immediately into action. For the Lord is all-powerful who commands, and truly the authority of the all-powerful God is not light. Until now, your hearts have been enslaved to vices, without order, without a teacher, pursuing your desires wherever they led. But now the Lord commands you to prioritize charity within yourselves and to set your hearts upon your ways, so that you do nothing without judgment and consideration. Let the lamp of the law always go before your feet, and say: Lamp to my feet is Your law and light to my paths (Ps. 118:105). Indeed, it is thus: Because you say, it is not the time to build the house of the Lord, and you yourselves dwell in houses that are sinking into the depths, while my house is deserted: consider, at the command of the Lord, and bring to mind what you have done, and what you have suffered.
