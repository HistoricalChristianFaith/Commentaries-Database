(Verse 50.) And Jesus said to him: Friend, why have you come? Then they drew near and laid hands on Jesus, and seized him. The word 'Friend' should be understood either in the opposite sense, or certainly according to what we have read above: Friend, how did you enter here without a wedding garment? (Matt. XXII, 12)?
