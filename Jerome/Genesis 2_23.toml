(Verse 23.) Now this is bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man. It does not seem to sound in Greek and Latin why she is called Woman, because she was taken out of Man; but the etymology is preserved in the Hebrew language. For Man is called 'Is', and Woman is called 'Issa'. Therefore, she was rightly called Woman from Man. Hence, Symmachus also desired to preserve the etymology even in Greek, saying: She shall be called ἀνδρὶς, because she was taken from ἀνδρός, which we can say in Latin: She shall be called virago, because she was taken out of Man. Furthermore, Theodotius suspected another etymology, saying: This will be called 'assumptio' because it is taken from a man. Indeed, 'Issa' can be understood according to the variation of accent and assumption.
