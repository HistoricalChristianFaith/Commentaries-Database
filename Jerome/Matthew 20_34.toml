Jesus stood still, because they being blind could not see their way. About Jericho were many pits, crags, and abrupt precipices; therefore the Lord standsstill, that they might come to Him.
The Creator bestows what nature had not given; or at least mercy accords what weakness had withheld.
They then who had sat shut up in Jericho, and knew only to cry with their voice, afterwards follow Jesus, not so much with their feet as in their virtues.
By the two blind men are generally understood the Pharisees and Sadducees.
