(Verse 34.) But Jesus, having mercy on them, touched their eyes: and immediately they saw, and followed him. He touches their eyes and provides as an artist what nature had not given. Or certainly what weakness had taken away, he restores with mercy. And immediately they saw, and followed him. Those who were previously sitting in Jericho, contracted and blind, had heard that he was passing by, and now they follow Jesus, not so much with their feet as with their virtues.
