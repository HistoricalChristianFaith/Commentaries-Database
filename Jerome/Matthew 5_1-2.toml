(Chapter 5, Verses 1, 2.) But Jesus, seeing the crowds, went up the mountain, and when he had sat down, his disciples came to him. And opening his mouth, he taught them, saying, 'The Lord goes up to the mountains, so that he may draw the multitudes to higher things with him. But the crowds are not able to ascend. And the disciples follow, to whom he speaks not standing, but sitting and huddled. For they were not able to understand him shining in his majesty.' According to the letter, some of the simpler brothers think that he taught the Beatitudes and the rest that follow on the Mount of Olives, which is not at all the case: for from what precedes and follows, the place is shown to be in Galilee, which we thought was either Mount Tabor or any other lofty mountain. Finally, after he finished his speeches, it immediately follows: But when he entered Capernaum.
