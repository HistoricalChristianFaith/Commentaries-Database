(V. 12) But the sons of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer darkness. The sons of the kingdom signify the Jews, over whom God reigned before. They shall be cast out into outer darkness. Darkness is always within, not without. But because he who is expelled from the Lord leaves behind the light, therefore outer darkness is so named.

There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. If there is weeping of the eyes, and gnashing of teeth demonstrates the bones: therefore, the resurrection of the bodies and their members that had fallen is true.
