(Verse 14.) But they said: Some say John the Baptist, others Elijah, and others Jeremiah, or one of the prophets. Jesus says to them, I wonder that some interpreters seek the reasons for each individual's errors, and weave a lengthy argument about why some thought that our Lord Jesus Christ was John, others Elijah, others Jeremiah, or one of the prophets. If they could be mistaken about Elijah and Jeremiah, how did Herod mistake John, saying: I myself beheaded John, he has risen from the dead, and powers are at work in him (Mark 6:16).
