(Verse 21) Therefore, thus says the Lord: Behold, I will bring destruction upon this people, and they shall fall into it (whether weakness, and they shall be weakened by it), fathers and sons together, neighbor and friend, and they shall perish. We see all the things that the Lord has threatened against this people come to pass: for every day they fall into their blasphemies, and they have no strength within them, but every weakness is found among them. The sons follow in their fathers' blasphemies; and every day they receive that imprecation: His blood be upon us and upon our children (Matthew 27:25); and not only they themselves, but also their neighbors and friends, and all who follow the Law and the Prophets according to the letter, and not according to the life-giving spirit, shall likewise perish, for all have sinned together.
