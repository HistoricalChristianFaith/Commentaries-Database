Heretics do not have Christ, the Truth, on their lips because they do not have him in their heart.… Heretics are unhappy people; they are whited sepulchers, full of dead people’s bones.… Arius, Eunomius and other heretics have tongues like arrows, jaws like empty tombs.… “Open” is well said, for whenever anyone has been deceived enough to enter that tomb, the heretic is ready and draws him right in. The mouths of heretics are forever gaping.… They mean one thing in their heart; they promise another with their lips. They speak with piety and conceal impiety. They speak Christ and hide the Antichrist, for they know that they will never succeed with their seduction if they disclose the Antichrist. They present light only to conceal darkness; through light they lead to darkness.
