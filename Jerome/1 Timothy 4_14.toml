The apostle clearly teaches that presbyters are the same as bishops.… Writing to Titus the apostle says, “For this cause I left you in Crete, that you should set in order the things that are wanting, and appoint presbyters in every city, as I had instructed. If any be blameless, the husband of one wife, having believing children not accused of wantonness or unruly. For a bishop must be blameless as the steward of God.” And to Timothy he says, “Neglect not the gift of prophecy that is in you, which was given you through the laying on of hands of the presbytery.”
