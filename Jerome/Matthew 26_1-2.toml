The Passover, called in Hebrew Phase, does not come as most think from πασχεῖν 'to suffer,' but from the Hebrew word signifying 'to pass over;' because the destroyer passed over when he saw the blood on the doors of the Israelites, and smote them not; or the Lord Himself walked on high, succouring His people.

After the two days of the shining light of the Old and of the New Testament, the true Passover is slain for the world. Also our Passover is celebrated when we leave the things of earth, and hasten to the things of heaven.

Let them blush with shame who think the Savior dreaded death and said out of fear of suffering, “Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me.” After two days, about to celebrate the Passover, he knew that he was to be betrayed and crucified. However, he did not turn away from the snares or take flight in fear. While the rest were unwilling to proceed, he remained unruffled when Thomas said, “Let us go that we may die with him.” Wishing to put an end to the earthly festivity and to declare the truth in the passing shadow of Passover, he said, “I have earnestly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer.” Indeed, “Christ, our paschal lamb, has been sacrificed” if we eat it with “the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.” Furthermore, because he says, “After two days the Passover will be here” and omits a simple explanation, we should seek what is holy. After two days of the brilliant light of the Old and New Testaments, the Passover is celebrated for the world. This Passover, called pesaḥin Hebrew, is not named after Christ’s suffering as many believe.It refers to the “passing over,” when the destroying angel saw the blood on the doors of the Israelites, passed by and did not strike them down. In other words, the Lord, giving help to his people, came down from above. Our passing over—that is to say, pesaḥ—will be celebrated if we put behind us both earthly things and Egypt and move on to heavenly things.

(Chapter 26, Verses 1 and following) And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished saying all these words, He said to His disciples: You know that after two days the Passover will take place, and the Son of Man will be handed over to be crucified. Let those who think that the Savior feared death be ashamed, and let them realize that He spoke out of fear of suffering when He said, 'Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from Me' (Luke 22:42). He knew that He would be handed over to be crucified two days after the Passover, and yet He does not avoid the snares, nor does He flee in fear, to the extent that, even when the others do not want to go, He continues boldly, as Thomas says: 'Let us also go, that we may die with Him' (John 11:16). And desiring to put an end to the carnal celebration, and while the shadow is passing, to restore the truth of Easter, he said: ‘With desire I have desired to eat this pasch with you, before I suffer’ (Luke 22:15). Indeed, our pasch is sacrificed, Christ, if, however, we eat it in the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth (1 Corinthians 5:7). Furthermore, when he says ‘After two days the pasch shall be’ (Matthew 26:2), let us seek with a simple understanding that which is sacred, without neglecting the sacrament. After two days of clear light, the true Passover of the world is celebrated, of the old and new Testament. The Passover, which is called in Hebrew Phase (), is not named after suffering as many suppose, but after the passage: because the exterminator, seeing the blood, passed over the doors of the Israelites and did not strike them. Or rather the Lord himself, providing assistance, walked above his people. In the book of Exodus (Ch. XI, XII), which we will discuss more fully if life permits, we can find more about this. But our passage, that is, the Passover, is celebrated in such a way that, leaving behind earthly things and Egypt, we hasten to heavenly things.
