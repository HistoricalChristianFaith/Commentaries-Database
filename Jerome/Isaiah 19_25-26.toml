(Verse 25, 26.) On that day, Israel will be a third with Egypt and Assyria, a blessing in the midst of the earth, whom the Lord of hosts has blessed, saying: Blessed be My people Egypt, and the work of My hands Assyria, and My inheritance Israel. Israel will be a third with Egypt and Assyria, to mix together the full measure of its blessing, and those who had previously been hostile to it will be joined by this bond of blessing; and Egypt will be the people of God, and Assyria the work of His hands, but Israel will be His inheritance. Blessed is the Egyptian to the Lord, because he is blessed by the company of the Israelites. And the work of his hands is Assyrian, because in him he has shown his mercy. But Israel alone can say: The Lord is my portion (Lam. 3:24); he who sees God with the mind, and is called his inheritance.
