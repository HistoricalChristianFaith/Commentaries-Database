(Chapter 6, Verse 1) Take courage, sons of Benjamin, in the midst of Jerusalem; and in Thecua sound the trumpet; and on Bethacherem raise a sign (or banner), for evil has been seen (or appeared) from the North and great destruction. No one is ignorant of Jerusalem situated in the tribe of Benjamin. We also see Thecua, a village situated on a mountain and separated from Jerusalem by twelve miles, every day with our own eyes. Among these is another village, which is called Bethacherem in the Syriac and Hebrew languages, and it too is situated on a mountain. Therefore, what he says is this: because Nebuchadnezzar is coming soon from the North, and the nearby captivity is imminent, O inhabitants of Jerusalem, seize your weapons, and sound the trumpet in Tekoa; and raise the banner in Beth-cherem, saying, so that you may be able to resist against the enemy. Benjamin means son of the right hand; Tekoa means trumpet; Beth-cherem means vineyard city. Let us apply all these things to the Church: so that if it sins, and the onslaught of persecution comes, it may prepare itself to resist.
