“And salvation, along the way of his steps.” Note the exact words, “his steps,” where there are no rocks, where there are no thorns or thistles, where the path is even, where he may walk, where he cannot stumble. Let us, therefore, make way for the Lord in our heart, that way for which John [the Baptist] was giving his life’s effort.… Although formerly we faced obstacles of thorns and thistles, although we had stones, he declares to us in Isaiah, “clear the highway of stones.” He proclaims this, furthermore, lest he stumble on them when he is ready to walk in the way of our heart. Now the stones that he bids us to throw out from our way are our sins. Christ does not walk in our heart if there is any sin there. He stumbles at once against these stones. “And salvation along the way of his steps.” Let us prepare the way, and Jesus will set his steps in it.
