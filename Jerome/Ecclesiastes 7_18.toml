"Do not
be too wicked, and do not be foolish: why should you die before your time? "When God says, "I do not want the death of the
dying, only let him return and live" [Ezek. 18, 32.],
it suffices to have sinned only once. We
ought to raise ourselves up after a catastrophe. For just like those who argue about worldly
matters, the swallow knows how to protect its young from poppy seeds, and
wounded roes seek wild marjoram to cure themselves. Then why are we ignorant that the cure of
repentance is proposed for sinners? But
he says, "do not delay in an world that is not yours". We know that Chore, Dathan, and Habiron, on
account of their uprising against Moses and Aaron, were suddenly eaten up by a
gap in the earth, and in emendation of others, many were judged before the day
of judgement even in their lifetime. [Cfr. Num. 16.] Therefore he says, "do not add sins to
sins, lest you cause God to punish you"
