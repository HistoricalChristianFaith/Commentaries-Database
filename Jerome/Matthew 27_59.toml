(Verse 59.) And taking the body, Joseph wrapped it in a clean linen cloth. Through the simple burial of the Lord, the ambition of the rich is condemned, who cannot even be without riches in their tombs. However, we can understand spiritually and also feel that the body of the Lord should be wrapped not in gold, gems, and silk, but in pure linen cloth; although this also signifies that he wrapped Jesus in a clean linen cloth, who received him with a pure mind.
