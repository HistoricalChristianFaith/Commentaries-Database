"I said to myself: Come, I will experiment with joy and enjoy pleasure. That, too, turned out to be futile." After I detected that pain and labour were in the
essence of wisdom and the accumulation of knowledge, and nothing else except
vain and endless struggle, I felt joyful that I would overflow with excess,
accrue riches, amass great wealth, and take temporary pleasures before I
die. But even in this I saw my vanity,
for past pleasures do not help the present, and do not fill up what is
empty. It is not just the pleasures of
the flesh however, but also spiritual joys that are a temptation for one who
possesses them. Hence I desired greatly,
because I had been grabbed by this incentive and the angel of Satan too, who
had knocked me down with such force that I could not recover. Solomon says about this "Don't give me
riches and poverty"  [II Cor. 12, 7],
and immediately writes underneath "lest I be full and a liar" [Prov. 30, 8.],
and lest I should ask, "who is looking at me?" [Prov. 30, 9.],
for the devil strikes down in abundance righteous men. In the apostles it is also written,
"lest enraptured by his pride, he should fall into the judgement of the
devil " [I Tim. 3, 6.],
that is 'into such a judgement, as the Devil himself falls ". But having said this, spiritual joy, just as
the other kinds, is claimed to be vanity, because we see it through a mirror
and in mystery. But when it has been
seen for what it is, then it is called vanity for no reason, but rather
truth.
