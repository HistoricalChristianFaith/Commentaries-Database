(Vers. 3, 4.) \"And he entered inside (or into the inner court) and measured the front (or threshold) of the gate to be two cubits, and the gate to be six (or ten) cubits, and the width of the gate to be seven cubits (or, the width of the gate from one shoulder to the other being seven cubits on each side). And he measured its (or the doors') length to be twenty cubits and its width to be twenty cubits in front of the temple. And he said to me: This is the Holy of Holies.\ « Let us make progress, for greater progress always opens up for us. After entering the temple, we once again enter inside, or as the Septuagint translated, the inner courtyard, in whose front, or Ael, for which Symmachus, around the gate, Theodotus Aelam, Hebrew Ul (), Aquila door, we interpret the front, there were two cubits. So, according to the higher meaning, we enter by the dual number to that place where the Holy of Holies is located. » And the gate itself was six cubits, through which we entered and obtained eternal rest, which is demonstrated in the number seven. For this reason, the Seventy translated it, and the width of the gate was seven cubits on this side and seven cubits on that side, in Hebrew and other editions only seven cubits were placed in the width of the gate. However, what follows: And its length was measured, or as the Seventy translated it, the doors were twenty cubits, for which in most codices forty are contained according to the Seventy, it also signifies a width of twenty cubits in front of the face of the temple, that which before the face of the temple and its entrance, the measure of past labor and struggle always comes to us. For just as the number two possesses a double relationship in individual numbers, so do the decades have the same relationship. And consider this: entering inward through the gateway of two cubits in width, and having six cubits in depth, and seven cubits in width on each side, and twenty cubits in length, and the same in the very doors of the temple, let it be taught by the prophet what that place is, or by what name it is called. For he said to me: This is the Holy of Holies. But if, as Scripture calls it, it is before the temple, or before the Holy of Holies, how great a blessedness must we think there is in the innermost parts of the temple! Concerning which the prophet speaks: This is labor in my sight, until I enter into the sanctuary of God, and understand their last things (Ps. 77:16-17). But this should also be noted, that in the description of the tabernacle it is said 'Holy of Holies' in the plural number; but here 'Holy of Holies' in the singular number, so that after the holy things we come to the holy: just as after many songs we come to the Song of Songs, which is the song of all songs, and in singing it, we are joined in the embrace of the Bridegroom.
