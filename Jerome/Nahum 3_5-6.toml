(Verse 5, 6.) Behold, I am coming to you, says the Lord of hosts, and I will reveal your shame before your face, and I will show your nakedness to the nations, and your disgrace to the kingdoms. And I will cast abominations upon you, and afflict you with insults, and make you an example. LXX: Behold, I am coming to you, says the Lord Almighty, and I will uncover your backside over your face, and I will show your confusion to the nations, and your disgrace to the kingdoms, and I will cast abomination upon you according to your uncleanness, and make you an example. Because you have sold, O Nineveh, nations in your fornications, and families in your sorceries, and have spread your feet as a public whore to all divided lands: therefore I myself will come to you to overthrow you, I will not send an angel, I will not trust others to judge you. I will uncover your private parts before your face, so that what you did not see before will be placed before your eyes. I will show your nakedness to the nations, and your shame to the kingdoms, so that those who fornicated with you will despise you, mock you, and treat you with contempt, and you will be an example to all who see you. But all these things are narrated under the metaphor of the adulterous woman, who, when she is caught, is brought into the middle and exposed before the eyes of all. Indeed, this is fully described through a prophetic sermon in the Book of Ezekiel, also concerning Jerusalem. However, they are more truly and usefully said about the world, to which the true doctor came from heaven, both to cut off and to heal. Behold, I am your Lord almighty, and because I am almighty, I can heal all diseases. And what is impossible for others is possible for me. I will reveal your behind on your face, that is, my virtues, precepts, and teachings, which you have cast behind your back. Although you do not deserve it, I will make you see. For I had commanded you concerning my teachings, that they should always be moved before your eyes, bound and hanging. But you, despising the command of the one who orders, left them behind your tracks, so that not only did you not do them, but you did not even deign to see what I had commanded. Indeed, I will make you see and understand your errors, which before, when you were blind and reckless, you thought were virtues. After this, I will also reveal your nakedness to the nations you have sold yourself to in your prostitution, so that they are not captivated by your love, but rather see your dirty and shameful body from within, which they were initially drawn to by its surface. With you, they will cease to prostitute themselves. I will also show the dishonor that you have brought upon kingdoms that are greater than nations, which you yourself created in order to have. And I will cast upon you the abomination according to your uncleanness, so that as you are unclean, you may appear unclean; and do not deceive many who were once united with you, who became one body with you. And I will make you an example, so that the terrifying likeness of punishment may prevent the likeness of wrongdoing (II Cor. V).
