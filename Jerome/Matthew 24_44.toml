Having declared that “of that hour knoweth no man, but the Father only,” Heshews that it was not expedient for the Apostles to know, that being ignorant they might live in perpetual expectation of His coming, and thus concluding the whole, He says, “Watch therefore” And He does not say, ‘Because we know not,’ but “Because ye know not,” showing that He Himself is not ignorant of the day of judgment.
And by the instance of the master of the household, He teaches more plainly why He keeps secret the day of the consummation.
