(Vers. 13 seqq.) These are the measurements of the altar: in the true cubit, which is a cubit and a handbreadth (or παλαιστὴν) in his bosom, the cubit was in length, and its width was measured from its lip to the surrounding palm of one hand. This was also the trench of the altar. From the bosom of the earth to the outermost base, it was two cubits in height, and the width of one cubit. And from the smaller base to the larger base, it was four cubits, and the width of one cubit. But the altar itself was four cubits high, and from the altar up to the horns there were four horns. And the altar was twelve cubits long, twelve cubits wide, a square with equal sides. And there was a ledge fourteen cubits long, fourteen cubits wide on its four corners, and a crown around it half a cubit high, and a rim one cubit wide around it. Its steps were turned towards the East. LXX: And this is the measure of the altar in perfect cubits and παλαιστῆς, the height of which is a cubit all around and the width of a cubit, and the lip of it around the edge is one palm. And this is the height of the altar from the bottom of the base to its great propitiatory, which was beneath two cubits, and the width of a cubit. And from the smaller propitiatory to the larger propitiatory are four cubits: and the width of a cubit and the ariel are four cubits: and from the ariel to the upper horns are cubits. But the altar had twelve cubits in length, and twelve cubits in width, with four corners. And the mercy seat had fourteen cubits in width, with four parts. And its ledge went around it by the measure of a half cubit, and its circuit by a cubit. And its steps faced toward the east. It is written: Who can discover the depths and wisdom? (Ecclesiastes 1:2). And: O depth of wisdom and knowledge of God (Rom. XI, 33): 'Whose deep depth, and who shall find it?' It is much if we desire to compare the temple of Solomon to this temple, and all its parts and tabernacles. But because this is very difficult, for the time being let us compare the altar that was shown to Ezekiel, the altar that we read about in Exodus, in a small part (Exod. XXXVIII). There an altar is described, five cubits in length and five cubits in width, that is, square, and three cubits in height: but here, departing from the senses by five, it tends towards union, in which the perfect cubit, or truest, is placed, to which is joined a palm, that is, π α λ α ι σ τ ὴ, the sixth, as we said above, having a part of a cubit. But in its bosom, that is, the altar, there was an elbow, which indeed received those things that were consumed by fire, and another elbow in its width: so that the interior, that is, the secrets, and the spaces of the altar that are shown in its width, would be terminated by one elbow. But what follows: And the measurement up to its edge, for which Aquila, Symmachus, and Theodotion placed a boundary, the Seventy interpreted as a cubit again. Of which word, as I have already said, I cannot know the reason; nor can I confidently say in what language it is spoken, unless I remind the reader that I have now transferred the definition above the crown. And this is briefly demonstrated, that around the altar itself, that is, on the edge and in a circular manner, there was a lip and, as it were, a crown resembling a lily, having in appearance great beauty. This definition, or rather invention, extended in circumference by the span of one palm, or in width by the παλαιστῆς. The bottom and depths of the Altar, or its profundity and height, for which it is called in Hebrew Gab, from the bosom of the earth to the highest foot, or to the maximum propitiatory, were two cubits, and its width was one cubit. For the lower and deep parts, cohesive with the earth, are contained in the dual number, which is also used for unclean animals (Genesis 7); but the upper parts, reaching to the foot or propitiatory, which Theodotus himself calls by the Hebrew name Azara, have a width of one cubit, so that the dual number passes into the solitary; and the good of marriage, which is lower, may attain to the blessedness of union. And what follows: And from the smaller threshold to the larger threshold, four cubits, and the width of one cubit, for which it is written in the Septuagint: And from the smaller mercy seat to the larger mercy seat; and Theodotus translated in both Azara, it is to be understood that the smaller mercy seat is a stone cut from the mountain without hands, and the larger mercy seat is the stone itself that grew into a great mountain and filled the whole earth (Dan. II). Or, in another sense, the propitiatory is less when he took on the form of a servant (Philippians 2) and the propitiatory is greater when he received the glory that he had with the Father before the world was made (John 17). For we first come to know the humbler aspects of Christ and thus reach the height of his divinity. And yet the propitiatory of both natures, that is, of the lower and the greater, belongs to the sacrament of one altar. But between the two propitiatory [covers], the smaller and the larger, there were four cubits, signifying the four elements of the world, which themselves also come to a height of one cubit. And this should be noted, that in the measurement of the altar, the first cubit in width is not joined to anything, but is perfect in its own unit: but the second cubit of the width, after two cubits, increases to the top, and the third cubit, after the smaller and larger propitiatory [covers], tends to the mystery of one cubit through the four elements; and one and another, and a third cubit in the altar of the Lord, are by no means first, second, and third; but let it be said to be one and one, and one. But Ariel was four cubits long, and from Ariel upwards there were four horns: or, as it is said in the Septuagint, from Ariel to the top of the horn there was one cubit. Ariel, as most people understand, is interpreted as 'my light is God.' Regarding this, in the prophet Isaiah, where it is written: 'Woe to you, Ariel, the city David besieged, or surrounded,' we have spoken more fully. But as I think, it means 'lion' or 'mighty one of God,' a name that properly refers to the altar, in which there is either the illumination of God or the lion and his strength, as Jacob said to Judah: 'Judah, you are like a lion's cub. You have climbed up to the prey, my son. You have crouched down and stretched out like a lion or a lioness. Who will dare to awaken you?' But there are four sides, and it has four horns; whether the upper parts of the four horns are finished with one cubit, so that the measure of the Gospels and the strength running throughout the whole world may be demonstrated under the illumination of God and the strength of the lion, and may reach the divine confession in one cubit. And so that gradually the darkness of the present place may become more manifest, it follows: And Ariel is twelve cubits in length, with twelve cubits in width, a quadrangle with equal sides. What no one doubts pertains to the twelve tribes, which are written in the Book of Revelation, and to the number of the Apostles, concerning whose sacrament I remember having spoken above (Rev. 7). Moreover, through the four sides of the world, the twelve cubits together make forty-eight cubits of the priestly cities, so that with these, as if foundations divided throughout the whole world, the strength of the Church may be solidified. Furthermore, the step, for which the Septuagint rendered it 'propitiatory' and Theodotion as 'azara' above; Symmachus 'peridromēn', that is, 'circuit', fourteen cubits in length and fourteen in width, has at its four corners a crown half a cubit in circumference; for which, once again, the Septuagint rendered it 'gisum', and [meaning] 'bosom', or, according to Symmachus, its completion and perfection, one cubit in circumference, secretly suggests that our Lord, who is truly called the propitiatory not only for our sins, but for the whole world, came through fourteen generations from Abraham to David; and again, through another fourteen until the captivity of Jeconiah, and by the sacrament of the same number descended to earthly things: so that in the fourteenth triad and the sacrament of the divine gift, he would save the four corners of the world, of which it is written: 'Many will come from the east and the west, and from the north and the south, and will recline at table with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven' (Matthew 8:11). And what follows, the crown, or gisus around it, signifies the propitiatory, which had a half cubit, and the bosom of the propitiatory, or the completion and perfection, which Symmachus interpreted as περιδρομὴν, had one cubit; this signifies that both sinners and the righteous are saved by the propitiation of the Lord, as the apostle Paul says: 'We have been reconciled to God through the blood of His Son' (Rom. 5:10). And it is said of sinners that they have a measure of half a cubit in circumference; yet they are saved by the mercy of the Creator, as it is written in the Psalm: You will save them as if they were nothing (Ps. 55:8). Regarding the righteous, it is said that they are saved in a singular and perfect number, and they imitate one divinity, as the same Apostle says: God was in Christ, reconciling the world to himself (2 Cor. 5:19). And what is mentioned at the end of this testimony, and its steps turned towards the East, these steps should be understood as the twenty-four books of the Old Testament, which had harps in the Apocalypse of John (Rev. 5), and crowns on their heads: or the sacrament of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, in which true propitiation is given to us. And to speak more clearly, therefore the number of steps is left uncertain, so that no matter how diligently we may be able to ascend to higher things, we may consider ourselves placed in lower things, and think of that of the Psalmist: They go from strength to strength (Ps. LXXXIII, 8).
