(Verse 16.) And taking from your garments, you made for yourself lofty things sewn on here and there, and you fornicated upon them, as it has not been done, nor will it be in the future. LXX: And you took from your garments, and you made for yourself sewn idols, and you fornicated upon them, and you will not enter, nor will it happen. Symmachus interpreted this passage as follows: And when you took from your garments, you made for yourself lofty multicolored things, and you fornicated in them, things that have not been done nor will be in the future. Pro consutis et versicoloribus et excelsis, sive idolis, Aquila et Theodotio ἐμβολίσματα transtulerunt, quod significat diversos pannos hinc inde consutos, et instar emplastri factum idolum, quasi πολύῤῥαφον vestimentum. Vestivi, inquit, te versicoloribus, et induta es bysso, et polymito, et multarum varietate formarum. Tu autem vestimenta tua quibus mealargitate donata es, tulisti: et fecisti tibi idola, vel excelsa, quae Hebraice dicuntur Bamoth (), quod numquam ante factum est, neque fiet; ut quae acceperis ad ornatum, transtuleris ad injuriam donatoris. What can be understood literally about the above Jerusalem is that it has assigned all the precepts of the Law and the abundance of riches and all things to idols, which no other nation has done or will do. For all the nations that have served idols from the beginning are not guilty of such a great crime. But our Jerusalem, which is interpreted as the vision of peace, is divided by heretics when they, taking one and another testimony of the Scriptures from their own places, try to attach them to those things with which they cannot be joined. To whom and above we read in the same prophet: Woe to those who consume pillows under every elbow hand, and make coverings over the head of the whole age (cf. XIII, 18): the Lord, prohibiting this from happening, speaks in the Gospel: No one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment. Otherwise, the new piece pulls away from the old, and the tear becomes worse. Nor do they put new wine into old wineskins (cf. Matthew IX, 16, 17). There are Nazarenes who strive to adapt the observance of the old Law to the grace of the Gospel. And all heretics attempt to impose an interpretation that agrees with their own ideas, while the Domincan tunic, which is woven throughout, cannot be torn apart, but woven by the Holy Spirit it receives no division. What is said according to the LXX, 'You shall not enter, nor shall it exist,' signifies this: when you make idols of perverse doctrines, which you consider superior, and you commit fornication with them, believing in what you yourself have fabricated, you will not be able to enter the temple of God. And your idols shall not have substance, nor shall they endure forever, as the Apostle says: For we know that there is no idol in the world (I Cor. VIII, 4).
