"Furthermore,
I have observed beneath the sun: in the place of justice there is wickedness,
and in the place of righteousness there is wickedness. I mused: God will judge the righteous and the
wicked, for there is a time for everything and for every deed, there." The
meaning of this is clear but is cloaked by the cloud of interpretation. He says: I sought truth and righteousness
under the sun and I saw that even among the benches of judges truth is not
valued, but gifts. Or differently: I
thought some kind of justice present in this world and either took the pious
man on his own merit, or punished the impious for his crimes; and I found the
opposite to that which I had been thinking. 
For I saw a righteous man here suffer much injustice and an impious man
made to rule instead of being punished for his crime. But thinking to myself afterwards and
considering it carefully I understood that they judge not in respect of God and
treating each case one by one, but rather reserve judgement for the future, so
that all are judged equally and receive there according to their will and
effort. For this is what he says:
"and there is a time for everything and for every deed, there", that
is, in judgement when God will have begun to judge, then there will be truth,
now injustice prevails in the world. 
Such as when we read in Wisdom, Sirach wrote: "lest you say, what
is this or what is that? For all things are sought in their own time" [Eccli. ?].
