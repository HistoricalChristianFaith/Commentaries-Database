But if you think that God is seen by those who are pure in heart in this world, why did Moses, who had previously said, “I have seen the Lord face to face, and my life is preserved,” afterwards plead that he might see him distinctly? And because he said that he had seen God, the Lord told him, “You cannot not see my face. For no one shall see my face and live.” For this reason also the apostle calls him the only invisible God, who dwells in light unapproachable, whom no man has seen nor can see.
