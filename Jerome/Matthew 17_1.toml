Now it is asked how after six days he took them and led them separately onto a high mountain, whereas the Evangelist Luke established the number at eight. The answer is easy because in Matthew the days in the middle are counted, but in Luke the first and last are added. For Luke does not say after eight days Jesus took Peter and James and John but “now about eight days after.”
