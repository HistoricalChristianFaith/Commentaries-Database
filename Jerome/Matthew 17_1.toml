Now it is asked how after six days he took them and led them separately onto a high mountain, whereas the Evangelist Luke established the number at eight. The answer is easy because in Matthew the days in the middle are counted, but in Luke the first and last are added. For Luke does not say after eight days Jesus took Peter and James and John but “now about eight days after.”

(Chapter 17 - Verse 1) And after six days, Jesus took Peter and James, and John his brother. Why Peter, James, and John are separated from the others in some places in the Gospels, or what privilege they have over the other apostles, we have frequently discussed. Now it is asked how he assumed them after six days, and led them to a high mountain apart: since the evangelist Luke mentions the number eight (Luke 9). But the answer is easy, because here the intermediate days are placed, the first and the last are added. For it is not said: After eight days Jesus took Peter, and James, and John; but on the eighth day.

He leads them to a high mountain apart. To lead the disciples to the mountains is part of the kingdom. They are led apart, because many are called, but few are chosen (Matthew 20:16 and 22:14).
