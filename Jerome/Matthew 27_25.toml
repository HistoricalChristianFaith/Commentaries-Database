(Verse 25) And all the people answered and said, 'His blood be on us and on our children.' This curse persists upon the Jews until the present day, and the blood of the Lord is not removed from them. Hence, Isaiah speaks: 'If you raise your hands to me, I will not listen to you. For your hands are full of blood' (Isaiah 1:15). The Jews leave the best inheritance to their children, saying, 'His blood be on us and on our children.'
