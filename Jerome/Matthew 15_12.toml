(Verse 12.) Then his disciples approached him and said to him, 'Do you know that the Pharisees were scandalized when they heard this word? From one speech, all the superstitious observance of the Jews had been eliminated; those who considered their religion to be based on the eating and abstaining from certain foods.' And because the term 'scandal' is frequently used in Ecclesiastical Scriptures, let us briefly explain what it means. Σκῶλον and scandalum can be translated as 'stumbling block,' 'fall,' or 'the stumbling and falling of the foot.' Therefore, when we read this: 'Whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin, it would be better for him if a great millstone were put around his neck and he were thrown into the sea.'
