"Woe to
you, O land, whose king acts as an adolescent, and whose ministers dine in the
morning. Happy are you, O land, whose
king is a man of dignity, and whose ministers dine at the proper time- in
strength and not in drunkenness. "He seems in fact here to reprove the young
king and to condemn indulgent judges, which in another place has been called
wisdom that is weakened by age, and even in other places mature age which is
made frail by pleasure.  On the other
hand he seems to approve the king with good morals, who is appointed
easily. He also seems to praise those
judges who nonetheless prefer pleasure to the business of the town, but after
much toil and the running of the township, are forced to eat as if by
necessity. But I find more holy what
seems to lie hidden in the text, because those who depart from old laws and
despise the precepts of their ageing fathers, are called young men in the
scripture; they who do not heed the commandments of God, and desire to change
the laws of mankind. The Lord of Israel
threatens in Isaiah [Cfr. Is. 8, 1-7.],
because the people did not want the waters of Shiloah that flows in silence,
and averted the ancient stream, choosing for themselves the rivers of Samaria,
and the surges of Damascus. "And I
will give", he says, "children to be their princes, and babes shall
rule over them" [Is. 3, 4.]. Read also Daniel and you will find the old
God of Days. [Cfr. Dan. 7, 9 sqq.] Or read the Apocalypse of John where the head
of the Saviour is said to be white and snowy, and you will find it to be like
white wool. Look at Jeremiah too because
he was wise and his hair was purported to be white because of his wisdom, and
he is forbidden to call himself a young man [Cfr. Ier. 1, 7.]. Woe to the land therefore whose king is the
devil, who always desirous of new things, and even rebels against its parent in
the case of Abessalon, who regards as judges and leaders those, who love the
pleasures of the world, and who say before the day of death comes, "let us
eat and drink, for tomorrow we die" [Is. 22, 13.]. For the other part is the blessed land of the
Church whose king, Christ, is the son of all peoples. He is descended from Abraham and Isaac, and
Jacob, also from the stock of all the prophets and saints, for whom sin was not
conquered. On account of this they were
indeed children. Born of these was the
virgin, more freely Saint Mary, who had no offspring, no seed from her flank,
but all of her fruit burst out in flower, speaking in the Song of Songs:
"I am the flower of the field and the lily of the valley" [Cant. 2, 1.]. His leaders too are apostles and all are
saintly, who see their king as the son of all men, the son of a free woman; not
of the slave woman Agar, but born of Sara in freedom. And they do not eat in the morning, or
quickly. For they do not seek enjoyment
in their time, but eat in their time, and when the time for retribution will
come, they will eat in strength, and not in disorder. Every good thing of this world is a disorder,
but an everlasting strength in the future. 
Just this is said in Isaiah: "look at those who serve me, they will
eat; but you will go hungry." [Is. 65, 13.] And again, "look at those who serve me,
they will be happy; but you will shamed." [Is. 65, 14.]
