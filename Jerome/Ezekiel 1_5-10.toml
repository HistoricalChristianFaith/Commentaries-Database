The four-faced creature that we met in the Apocalypse of John and in the beginning of Ezekiel’s prophecy that had the face of a man, the face of a calf, the face of a lion, the face of an eagle, has also special significance for the text we are considering. In Matthew, this human being has the face of a man; in Luke, an ox; in John, an eagle; in Mark, the lion crying in the desert.

The Gospels are joined to each other. They stick together, and they run hither and thither in different ways in the whole circle of their flight. And they do not have an end to their flight, nor do they ever rise above and fall down, but they always move to higher places.

The face means the beginning of the Gospels, from which the man and the lion, that is, the nativity of Christ and the voice of prophecy crying in the wilderness, are on the right-hand side; but the ox, that is, about the victims and the sacrifice of the Jews, is on the left, is abolished and is transformed into a spiritual priesthood … just so that all things may hold fast to him and be thought of as in one body; and the eagle, which is over the nativity and is over the prophecy that is fulfilled in the coming of Christ and over the priesthood that it surpasses, and is beyond all these things, refers to the spiritual nativity, how the Father is the Son and the Son is the Father.

Most people interpret the man, the lion and the ox as the rational, emotional and appetitive parts of the soul.… And they come with a fourth part that is above and beyond these three and that the Greeks call συνειδησιν: that spark of conscience that was not even extinguished in the breast of Cain after he was turned out of paradise and by which we discern that we sin, when we are overcome by pleasures or frenzy and meanwhile are misled by an imitation of reason. They reckon that this is strictly speaking, the eagle, which is not mixed up with the other three but corrects them when they go wrong.
