(Verse 8.) But a great crowd spread their garments on the road. Notice the difference in each person. The apostles put their garments on the donkey, while the crowd, which is more humble, lays their garments in front of the donkey's feet, so that it does not stumble on a stone, step on a thorn, or fall into a ditch.

On the other hand, some were cutting branches from the trees and spreading them on the road. They were cutting branches from fruit-bearing trees, with which the Mount of Olives is planted, and spreading them on the road in order to make the crooked straight and the rough places smooth, so that Christ, the victor over demons and vices, could walk more easily and securely in the hearts of believers.
