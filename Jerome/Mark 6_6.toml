Jesus is called the son of a workman, of that one, however, whose work was the morning and the sun, that is, the first and second Church, as a figure of which the woman and the damsel are healed.
Oftentimes also the origin of a man brings him contempt, as it is written, “Who is the son of Jesse?” for the Lord “hath respect unto the lowly; as to the proud, He beholdeth them afar off.”
