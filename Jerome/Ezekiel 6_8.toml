(Verse 8.) And I will leave among you those who have escaped the sword among the nations, when I scatter you among the lands. And they shall remember me, the ones who were delivered, among the nations where they were taken captive. That which the Lord speaks to Elijah: I have left for myself seven thousand men who have not bowed the knee to Baal (1 Kings 19:18); and the Apostle Paul writes: And now at this present time, there is a remnant according to the election of grace that has been saved (Romans 11:5), which may be applicable to this chapter. For indeed the Apostles, who were of the seed of Israel and had fled the sword, are therefore reserved, so that they might be scattered into the lands and preach the Gospel among the nations, and be remembered among the nations of God, in which they were living during the time of captivity. And it can also be said that some were reserved from the captivity of Judah, so that they might be remembered among the nations and preach the power of His name. The peoples of the heretics who were able to escape the sword of their destruction, and the wicked faction that had been incited against God, will remember the name of God, repenting and rejoicing that they were captured by the men of the Church.
