(Verse 29 onwards) Are not two sparrows sold for an assarion? Yet not one of them falls to the ground apart from your Father's will. But even the hairs of your head are all numbered. So do not fear; you are more valuable than many sparrows. Therefore, whoever confesses Me before men, I will also confess him before My Father who is in heaven. But whoever denies Me before men, I will also deny him before My Father who is in heaven. The Lord's discourse is attached to itself, and the following depend on the preceding. Wise reader, always beware of a superstitious understanding; so that you do not conform the Scriptures to your own senses, but join your senses to the Scriptures, and understand what follows. Above he had said: 'Do not fear those who kill the body, but cannot kill the soul'; now he speaks consequently, 'Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? And not one of them will fall to the ground without your Father.' And the meaning is this: If small and worthless animals do not perish without God as their author, and if there is providence in all things, and those things which are destined to perish do not perish without the will of God, then you who are eternal should not fear living without the providence of God. This meaning I have stated above: Look at the birds of the air, for they neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not worth more than they? And afterwards: Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow, and so on. But if the grass of the field, which is here today and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, God clothes it, how much more will he clothe you, you of little faith! Some forcefully interpret the two sparrows as representing the soul and the body. Even five sparrows, according to Luke (Luke XII), which are sold for two pennies, are referred to the senses. But how that understanding is adapted to the whole body of the Gospel message is not of little difficulty. But even the hairs of your head are all counted. Therefore, do not be afraid; you are of more value than many sparrows. The deeper meaning of our previous explanation is expressed: that those who can kill the body should not be afraid, for they cannot kill the soul, and if even small animals do not fall without God's knowledge, how much more so for humans, who are supported by apostolic dignity! Moreover, when it is said that even the hairs of your head are all counted, it shows the immense providence of God towards humans and signifies His ineffable affection, that nothing about us escapes God, and even the smallest and most insignificant things do not elude His knowledge. They mock the ecclesiastical intelligence in this place, who deny the resurrection of the flesh, as if we were all saying that even the hairs that have been counted and cut by the barber will rise again, when the Savior did not say, 'But all the hairs on your head will be saved,' but 'They are counted.' Where there is number, the knowledge of number is demonstrated, not the preservation of the same number.
