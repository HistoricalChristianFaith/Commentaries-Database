Barabbas the robber, who had provoked a riot among the crowds and committed murder, was released to the Jewish people.… Now Jesus, having been delivered up by the Jews, was absolved of guilt by Pilate’s wife and was called a just man by the governor himself. Moreover, the centurion declared that he was truly the Son of God. The learned reader may be hard pressed to explain the fact that Pilate washed his hands and said, “I am innocent of the blood of this just man,” and later handed over the scourged Jesus to be crucified. It is important to realize that Jesus was dealt with according to Roman law, which decreed that whoever is to be crucified must first be beaten with whips. Thus Jesus was handed over to the soldiers for scourging, and their whips did their work on that most sacred body and that bosom which held God. This came about so that, in keeping with the words “many cords of sins” and with the whipping of Jesus, we might be free from scourging. As holy Scripture says to the just man: “The whip did not draw near to your tabernacle.”

(Ver. 26.) Then he released to them Barabbas, but Jesus, after he had been scourged, he handed over to them to be crucified. Barabbas, a robber, who had caused insurrections in the crowds, who was a murderer, was released to the Jewish people, that is, the devil, who reigns in them even to this day, and therefore they cannot have peace. But Jesus, being handed over by the Jews, is acquitted by Pilate's wife, and is called just by the governor himself. And the centurion confesses that he is truly the Son of God. The learned reader may wonder how it is fitting for Pilate to have washed his hands and said, 'I am innocent of the blood of this just man,' and then handed over Jesus to be crucified after he had been scourged. But it should be known that he served the Romans' laws, which decreed that whoever is to be crucified should first be scourged. Therefore, Jesus was handed over to the soldiers to be scourged, and they tore into that most sacred body, capable of containing the heart of God, with lashes. However, this was done so that, as it is written: 'Many are the scourges of the wicked' (Psalm 31:10), by him being scourged, we might be freed from scourges, as the Scripture says to the righteous man: 'No scourge shall come near your tent' (Psalm 90:10).
