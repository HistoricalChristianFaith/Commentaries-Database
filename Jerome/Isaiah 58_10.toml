(Verse 10.) If you remove the chain from your midst, and you cease to extend your finger, and to speak what is not helpful. When you pour out your soul to the hungry, and satisfy the afflicted soul, then your light shall dawn in the darkness, and your darkness shall be as the noonday. LXX: If you remove from yourself the yoke, and the pointing of the finger, and the speaking of murmuring, and you give your bread to the hungry from your soul, and satisfy the humble soul, then your light shall dawn in the darkness, and your darkness shall be as the noonday. The Hebrew word Mota (), which is interpreted as an iron torque in Jeremiah (Jer. XVIII), is read twice in the present chapter. In that place where we have said above according to the Septuagint: Dissolve the obligations of violent exchanges, by one word Mota we may know that they have put violent bonds, for which Aquila translated error, Symmachus translated declination, and Theodotion κλοιὸν, that is, torque. Again, in the present place where we translate: If you remove the chain from your midst, and for chain Septuagint translated συνδεσμὸν, that is, binding or bond; Aquila, as above, interpreted error; Symmachus, agreeing with Theodotion's ideas ((Al. conceding)), put torque. This is said about the variety of interpretation. Otherwise, the meaning is connected as follows: The morning light will arise for you, and your health will quickly arise; and your righteousness will go before you, and the glory of the Lord will crown you. And when you pray, he will immediately hear you, and he will show himself to be present. This is true, only if you add these things to the previous works, in order to remove from yourself the obligation and the chain with which your soul is bound. About which Peter spoke to Simon: 'For I see that you are in the gall of bitterness and in the bond of iniquity' (Acts 8:23). And Paul was grieved, as he observed the city of the Athenians bound by the obligation of idolatry. For each person is bound by the ropes of their own sins (Proverbs 5). And concerning these bonds of the soul, David prayed in the psalm: 'Cleanse me from my hidden faults, O Lord, and spare your servant from the deeds of others' (Psalm 19:13). It is difficult to find someone who is not bound by these chains. It is rarely found a soul that does not have this heavy burden encircling its neck, weighing it down with earthly pursuits, so that it does not look to the heavens but only to the earth. This is also reflected in the Gospel story of the woman whom Satan had bound for eighteen years, so that she was bent over and could not see the heavenly things (Luke 13). Therefore, it is said, if you remove this chain from the midst of your heart and break these kinds of bonds, and if you also extend your hand, as three other interpreters render this phrase, and refrain not only from thinking or doing evil, but also from speaking ill of your neighbor and pointing out each person's faults as if with a finger, and if you avoid speaking what does not benefit your soul, considering not your own faults but the errors of others, then you will receive what the following passage adds. Most of our people understand the ordination of clergy, which is fulfilled not only by the invocation of the voice, but also by the laying on of hands (so that, as we have laughed at in some cases, the clandestine invocation of the voice may ordain unknowing clerics), in this way: they take as evidence the writing of Paul to Timothy: Do not lay hands on anyone too hastily and thereby share in the sins of others (1 Tim. 5:22). For it is not a light matter to cast pearls before swine and to give what is holy to dogs (Matt. 7); and to attribute the ordination of the clergy, not to the holy and most learned in the law of God, but to their followers and ministers of lowly duties; and what is more shameful for them, to the prayers of little women. In considering the wisdom of Christ's Apostles, who, to demonstrate the danger of ordination, connected the torments of sinners: You shall not partake in others' sins. Therefore, just as in the ordinations of evil men, the one who appoints them is a participant in their sins, so in the ordination of the saints, the one who chooses them is a participant in their righteousness. It follows: And the word of murmuring is understood to mean, 'from the common,' if you remove it from yourself. But the word of murmuring is when God speaks against us: Let the murmuring of this people cease from me, and they shall not die; and we refer our sins to God, in order to excuse ourselves for our sins, and we say: The heat of the body overcame me, the incentives of youth overcame me, God created me this way: poverty forced me to steal. Therefore, if we do not do those things which are said, and if we do those things which are to be said, let us not give our bread to the hungry as before, but our soul, so that we may help him however we can, and let us not do it with sadness and necessity, but willingly, receiving more than giving charity. For God loves a cheerful giver, so that we may not refresh the hungry or the afflicted partially, but fully satisfy them; and let us grieve with those who grieve and mourn with those who mourn, then our light shall rise in the darkness, he who says: I am the light that came into the world, so that everyone who believes in me does not remain in darkness, but has the light of life. For the eye is the light of our body: if it is simple, our whole body will be full of light. But if it is evil, our whole body will be full of darkness. And it will be said to us: If the light that is in you is darkness, how great is that darkness! Let us consider with what virtues we may come to the light of God, so that darkness may be turned into noonday, and let us say with the bride: Where do you pasture, where do you rest at noon?
