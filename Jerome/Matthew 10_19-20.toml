When then we are brought before judges for Christ's sake, we ought to offer only our will for Christ. But Christ who dwelleth in us speaks for Himself, and the grace of the Holy Spirit will minister in our answer.

(Verse 19, 20.) But when they hand you over, do not worry about how or what you should say. For it will be given to you in that hour what you should say. For it is not you who speak, but the Spirit of your Father who speaks in you. Above, he said: For they will hand you over to councils and flog you in their synagogues, and you will be brought before governors and kings for my sake. Therefore, when we are brought before judges because of Christ, we should only offer our own will for Christ. Moreover, Christ himself, who dwells within us, will speak for himself, and the grace of the Holy Spirit will be ministered in answering.
