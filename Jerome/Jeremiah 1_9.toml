(Verse 9) And the Lord put forth his hand, and touched my mouth: and the Lord said unto me, Behold, I have put my words in thy mouth. It is to be noted that here the hand of God is sent, which touches the prophet's mouth, and it is said to him: Behold, I have put my words in thy mouth; but in Isaiah it is written: And one of the seraphims flew unto me, having a live coal in his hand, which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar: And he laid it upon my mouth, and said, Lo, this hath touched thy lips; and thine iniquity is taken away, and thy sin purged (Isaiah 6:6-7). For there, because he was of solid and perfect age, he himself confesses openly that he has unclean lips, and he dwells in the midst of a people with polluted lips. So, one of the Seraphim is sent, who does not touch his mouth with his hand, but with tongs and a burning coal, to take away his iniquities and cleanse his sins. Now, it is the hand of God Himself that is sent, through which all things are accomplished, and which is called the arm in another place: not to take away sins, which he had not committed many in his childhood; but to bestow the grace of speech. Furthermore, Ezekiel devours the book, both inside and outside, containing both divine mysteries and simple history. Jeremiah's mouth is touched, and the words of the Lord are given to him, so that he may receive confidence in preaching. And beautifully, according to the letter, a hand is sent, so that seeing the likeness of human limbs, it does not fear the touch of the hand.
