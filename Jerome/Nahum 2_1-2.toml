Chapter 2, verses 1 and 2: He who scatters has ascended before your face, guarding the siege: consider the way, strengthen your loins, greatly fortify your strength. For just as the Lord has repaid the pride of Jacob, so He will repay the pride of Israel. Because the desolators have scattered them and spoiled their branches. I am compelled by necessity to turn my course between the rocks and the cliffs, with imminent shipwreck, so as to navigate between the history and allegory of my discourse, and to be cautious lest it suddenly collide. Indeed, according to the fables of the poets:

Scylla threatens on the right side, Charybdis on the left, unrelenting. If we flee the rocks, we plunge into the deep; if we avoid the swirling whirlpools, we are thrown onto the rocks. The Lord is my witness that in all I have said according to the Hebrew, I am not speaking in my own sense, which is an argument used against false prophets, but rather following the interpretation of the Hebrews, from whom I have learned a great deal over a considerable time, and I must simply indicate what I have learned to my own people. Certainly, it will be at the discretion of the reader, when he goes through both, to judge which one he should follow more. Now, the speech is turned to Nineveh (and hence the prophets are especially obscure because suddenly, while something else is being discussed, the person is changed to others) and it is said to her: Nebuchadnezzar, who will besiege you, is coming to you, who will devastate the fields in front of your mouth, pursue the farmers, plunder the countryside, and also keep you enclosed herself. Therefore, because war is imminent for you, behold, the joyful prophet now predicts: carefully consider and behold what may happen to you. Strengthen your loins, that is, prepare yourself: gather strength greatly, that is, gather an army: just as the Lord avenged Judah from the pride of Sennacherib, with his army being killed in Judah, and he himself being slain by his own sons: so will he avenge Israel, that is, the ten tribes that are possessed by Nineveh. For both the Assyrians devastated and destroyed both Judah and Israel, and under the metaphor of the vine, they corrupted the offspring of both (or 'of both trees').

LXX: Contemplate the way, hold your loins, strengthen yourself vigorously, because the Lord has turned away the disgrace of Jacob, as the disgrace of Israel: for those who shook them off have shaken themselves off, and their branches have been demolished. Three things are commanded to the Jews. First, that they contemplate the way, and diligently look at the path by which they will walk, according to what is written in Jeremiah: Stand in the ways, and ask for the eternal paths, and see what the good way is; And walk in it (Jeremiah 6:16): so that when we stand in many ways, we may come to that way which says: I am the way (John 14:6). Then it is said to him, to hold his loins, that is, to mortify his body after the election of the way, and to subject himself to servitude, lest, preaching to others as a king and master, he himself be found reprobate (1 Corinthians IX). It is now too long to say how the virtue of the devil is chiefly in the loins, and how the promise is made to David: I will set the fruit of thy loin upon thy throne (Psalms CXXXI, 11). And that of the Apostle: For as yet Levi, who received tithes, paid tithes in Abraham: For he was yet in the loins of his father, when Melchisedech met him (Hebrews VII, 10). And that John is girded with a leather belt (Matth. III), and that the disciples are commanded by the Savior: Let your loins be girded (Luke XII, 35). And the Apostle to the Ephesians: Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth (Ephes. VI, 14): for although exercise is very beneficial, and a life of self-control is superior to the mortification of the loins, yet nothing mortifies them so much as the knowledge of the truth. Hence it is said: Gird your loins with truth. For if the truth is Christ, he who believes with his whole mind in Christ has mortified his desires in Christ. Thirdly, it is commanded to be strengthened exceedingly: 'You have chosen,' he says, 'the way, you have held tight to your desire, take on virtue, so that you may be able to fight against your enemies.' And lest perhaps you doubt, a reason is given to you why you should hope: 'The Lord has turned away the disgrace of Jacob, just as he has turned away the disgrace of Israel,' which is ambiguous: either he has turned away the disgrace of Jacob himself, which he was inflicting on others, or he has turned away the disgrace which Jacob was enduring from others. But it seems to me better that the insult which Jacob used to do to others should be turned away from the Lord. For it is not of such great virtue to endure injury done by others, as it is of the grace of the Lord to be unable to do injury, being gentle, meek, and tranquil. It is asked, how injury is turned away from Jacob, just as it had been turned away from Israel. After Jacob wrestled with the angel, he deserved to receive the name Israel (Genesis XXXII), and because he saw God, he ceased to do injury. Just as Israel, the understanding or man who sees God, and always thinking about God, does not know how to do wrong, so every insolence and outrage is turned away from Jacob, that is, from the supplanter, from him who is still in the struggle and supplants enemies. But in order that we may know how wrong is taken in a bad sense, Solomon is witness, saying: Eyes full of contempt, a wicked tongue (Prov. 6). But how according to both interpretations wrong is turned away from Jacob, which was first turned away from Israel, the following passage makes clear: Because they shook them off, and demolished, or corrupted, their scourges. The angels, he says, of each one who daily behold the face of the Father (Matthew XV, 10), shook off whatever dust had adhered to Jacob and Israel. Hence also the feet of Peter are washed (John XIII). And through the prophet it is said: Shake off the dust, and arise, Jerusalem (Isaiah LII, 2). It is also commanded to the disciples by the Savior: Shake off the dust from your feet (Matthew X, 14). And in the Psalms it is written: Like arrows in the hand of a mighty one, so are the children of the shaken off (Psalm CXXVI, 4). Therefore, the mind is inclined towards insult, not only by Jacob, but also by Israel: because whatever was earthly in them and formed from the lower elements, this was shaken off and purified by the ministering angels, or rather by the guardians and teachers, who not only expelled them, but also scattered the vices which temporarily satisfy the senses and are like whips and branches devoid of fruit, as the Lord says: Every branch that abides in me and bears fruit, my Father cleanses, that it may bear more fruit; but what does not abide in me and does not bear fruit, my Father cuts off and throws into the fire (Matthew 15).
