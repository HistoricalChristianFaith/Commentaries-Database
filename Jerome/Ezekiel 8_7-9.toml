(Verse 7 and following) And He brought me to the entrance of the courtyard, and I saw, and behold, there was a hole in the wall. And He said to me, Son of man, dig through the wall. So I dug through the wall, and there was a doorway. And He said to me, Go in and see the wicked abominations that they are committing here. This is what I have translated: And I saw, and behold, there was a hole in the wall. This is not found in the Septuagint. And because everything is shown as if in a picture, he says that he saw a hole in the wall and was commanded to dig through it and make it wider, so that he could enter and see what was outside that he could not see before. By which it is shown that, both in the Church and in each of us, greater sins are shown through small vices, and as if through certain holes, one can reach great abominations. For from the fruits the tree is known (Matthew 12:33, 34); and from the abundance of the heart, the mouth speaks. Words bursting forth are a sign of the interior man: just as lustful language sometimes reveals cunningly hidden vices; and a hidden greed signifies a desire for small things on the inside. For greater things are revealed to the lesser, and conscience cannot be disguised by expression and eyes, while a luxurious and wanton mind shines forth in the face; and the secrets of the heart are revealed by bodily movement and gestures.
