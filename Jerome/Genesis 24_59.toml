(Verse 59.) And they sent away their sister Rebecca, and her belongings, and Abraham's servant, and the men who were with him. In Hebrew, it says: And they sent away their sister Rebecca, and her nurse, and Abraham's servant, and his men. For it was fitting that a virgin setting off for marriage without her parents should be comforted by the consolation of her nurse.
