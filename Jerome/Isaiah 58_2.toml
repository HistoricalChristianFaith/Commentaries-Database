Here, however, because they were sinners to whom it was to be proclaimed and because they dwelled in the lowlands, the prophet is not commanded to ascend the mountain. Instead, he is asked only to raise his voice like a trumpet and announce to them that wars are coming.… For the Lord draws near to those who draw near to him and to those who rightly follow what is just and thus are able to say, “It is good for me to cling to God.” For if Almighty God is the Father of truth and justice, then whoever is deceptive and unjust is unable to draw near to God, of whom it is written: “Evil people may not live in your presence, nor will the unjust endure before your eyes.”

(Verse 2) They search for me day after day and desire to know my ways, like a nation that has done righteousness and has not forsaken the judgment of their God. LXX likewise. This specifically applies to the Jews, who run to the synagogues every day and meditate on the law of God, desiring to know what Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and the other saints have done, and diligently studying the books of the Prophets and Moses, reciting the divine commands. To them, the following is most fittingly applied: The wicked seek me out but will not find me. For thus it is written: Everyone who seeks, finds (Matt. VII): whoever does not find, is convicted of seeking badly; for the Lord is found by those who seek Him in goodness, and is revealed to those who are not incredulous towards Him. Therefore, for those who have forsaken the justice and judgment of God, by what names is Christ revealed, as the Psalmist says: O God, give your judgment to the king, and your justice to the king's son (Ps. LXXI, 1): for Christ has become for us redemption, holiness, and righteousness (I Cor. I): in vain do they boast of knowledge of the law, when the holy one boasts not in knowledge of the Scriptures, but in works, saying: I have run the way of your commandments, when you have enlarged my heart (Ps. CXVIII, 31).
