Here, however, because they were sinners to whom it was to be proclaimed and because they dwelled in the lowlands, the prophet is not commanded to ascend the mountain. Instead, he is asked only to raise his voice like a trumpet and announce to them that wars are coming.… For the Lord draws near to those who draw near to him and to those who rightly follow what is just and thus are able to say, “It is good for me to cling to God.” For if Almighty God is the Father of truth and justice, then whoever is deceptive and unjust is unable to draw near to God, of whom it is written: “Evil people may not live in your presence, nor will the unjust endure before your eyes.”
