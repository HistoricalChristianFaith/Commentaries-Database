(Verse 7) The four faces to one, and the four wings to one, and their feet were straight feet, and the sole of their feet was like the sole of a calf's foot, and they sparkled like the appearance of burnished brass. And the hands of a man were under their wings on their four sides. LXX: And the four faces to one, and the four wings to one, and their legs were straight, and they had winged feet. And they sparkled like flashing bronze, and their wings were light, and the hands of a man were under their wings on their four sides. Of the four animals, whose appearance was a likeness of a human (only in such a way that each had four faces, and four wings, and straight legs, and the sole of their feet was like the hooves of a calf, or, as the eagle interpreted it, round, which the LXX completely omitted), of the shining sparks of bronze, and of their light feathers, which are not mentioned in Hebrew, of the hand of man also under their wings in four parts, and the rest which the prophetic speech describes, we will endeavor to explain what it seems to say to us, when we briefly summarize the opinions of each person. Some claim that the four Gospels, which we have also followed in the preface of the commentary on Matthew, are designated by the names of these animals: Matthew, because it describes Jesus as a man: The book of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham. They attribute it to Mark the lion: The beginning of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, as it is written in the prophet Isaiah: The voice of one crying in the wilderness: Prepare the way of the Lord, make his paths straight (Isaiah 40:3). Calves, to the Gospel of Luke, which begins with the priesthood of Zacharias. Eagles, to the beginning of John, who, soaring to the heights, began: In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. Regarding what we think about these, we have said in the aforementioned work, and more fully in the Apocalypse of John (Chapter IV), the appearance and names of these animals refer to the four Gospels (or, to the Evangelists). We will try to explain in their proper place how the description of all animals can be adapted. But others, who foolishly follow the wisdom of philosophers, think that there are two hemispheres in the two temples of the Cherubim, us and the Antipodes, as if humans were lying on their backs and falling. Many, according to Plato, attribute the rational soul, the irascible soul, and the concupiscent soul, which he calls the logical, the spirited, and the appetitive, to man, lion, and calf: placing reason, knowledge, mind, and counsel, as well as the same virtue and wisdom, in the citadel of the brain; but attributing ferocity, anger, and violence to the lion, which resides in the gall. Moreover, they place desire, luxury, and the craving for all pleasures in the liver, that is, in the calf that clings to the works of the earth. And they consider as a fourth thing, which is beyond and outside these three, what the Greeks call συντήρησιν, which is the spark of conscience that is not extinguished even in Cain's heart, after he was cast out of paradise. And it is by this spark that we, conquered by pleasures or by madness, and sometimes deceived even by the semblance of reason itself, feel that we sin. How properly they are appointed to eagles, not mixing themselves with the three, but correcting the three wandering ones; which in the Scriptures we sometimes read is called the spirit, who intercedes for us with unutterable groanings. For no one knows the things that belong to man, except the spirit that is in him. Whom Paul also, writing to the Thessalonians, prays that they may be preserved sound in soul and body. And yet this very conscience, according to what is written in Proverbs: The wicked man, when he comes into the depth of sins, contemns it (Prov. XVIII, 13): we see certain individuals being precipitated and losing their place, who do not even have shame and modesty in their transgressions, and deserve to hear: Your face has become like that of a harlot, you did not want (Al. you do not know) to be ashamed (Jerem. III, 3). Therefore, God guides this chariot like a charioteer, and restrains it running with uncontrolled steps, making it obedient, and forces it to obey His command. We will also discuss the nature of the soul, that is, the soul of man, which is called the microcosm by the same philosophers. Some believe that the four elements of the world, namely fire, air, water, and earth, are simply represented in four animals, according to the opinion of Hippocrates. How these elements mix with each other, and how they seem to be joined together and touch each other, and how they have four distinct species and forms in one animal, is not the purpose of this work. They also consider the four wheels rising from the earth to the heights, joined to each other by four-formed animals or the mixture of the same elements, or the cycle of the four seasons, which is completed by nine months, and the turning year, which has received its name from the fact that it always turns and returns to itself. Of these things, it has been beautifully said in one verse:

Spring, summer, autumn, winter, and months, and years. And it is said: There was a wheel in a wheel, they think to signify the year in the year. About which another poet (Virgil, II Georg.) says:

And in its own footprints, the year rolls on. They also want this sky, which we observe, to be understood as a likeness of crystal: under which four living creatures roll and pass. And they think that the throne of sapphire-colored, and the man sitting above it in human likeness, described the omnipotence of God, who rules over all things and has everything under his feet. And, finally, it is said: This is the vision of the likeness of the glory of God, through which, as through a certain picture and image, providence is demonstrated. And just as the feet of animals are said to be straight, and the hoof of a calf, or round, to soar from earthly things to heavenly things, and with all angles cut off, to follow roundness, which is the most beautiful of all shapes. To show shining sparks, indicating all things full of light, and the hands of man under the wings of both man himself, and lion, and calf, and eagle: so that reason may support all things, and lift them up from earthly humility to heavenly things. These things can be referred to both the Gospels and everything we have mentioned above. I remember hearing about four passions, which Cicero discusses in detail in his Tusculan Disputations: joy, sadness, desire, and fear, of which two are present and two are future, symbolized by four animals, about which Virgil also briefly speaks in Book VI of the Aeneid.

From here they fear, desire, grieve, and rejoice: the things that should be subject to the rule and power of God; and which, on the contrary, the four virtues - Prudence, Justice, Fortitude, and Temperance - are set against or imposed upon, in order to be governed by their authority. They completely neglect to mention how these virtues are adapted to the faces of man, lion, calf, and eagle. On these matters, the same philosopher and orator discuss in three books addressed to their son concerning duties. I have read a brief dispute by a certain Catinaeus, whom the Syrians call 'subtle,' that is, sharp and ingenious, which asserts that the arrangement of the twelve tribes of the camp can be described in the wilderness, towards the East and West, North and South, which are joined together by love and kinship, and this is the wheel within a wheel, which is guided by the spirit and protected by a cloud in the desert, and illuminated by a column of fire at night; they do not return to Egypt, but always hasten to go to the promised land. But the eagle in the midst represents the Holy of Holies, and the face of the man represents the whole of Israel; the lion represents the royal scepter of Judah; the calf represents the priestly and Levitical tribe. In addition, the face of the eagle symbolizes the divine vengeance and retribution from heaven, overseeing everything, and prepared to tear apart the sinner, as it is said in Hosea: 'As an eagle over the house of God' (Hos. 8:1), that is, the temple. And in the same prophet Hosea (17), the great eagle with large wings and claws, which has the ability to enter into Lebanon, is understood to represent Nebuchadnezzar, whom even now signifies as coming, and sitting upon such a four-wheeled chariot like a charioteer, governing and commanding what is to be done or not to be done. However, he says, it is said to the people who live in Babylon, that if they submit their necks to God and obey his restraints, they will earn his help again, and they will regain the land which they had lost.
