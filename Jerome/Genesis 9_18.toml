(Chapter 9, Verse 18) The sons of Noah who came out of the ark were Shem, Ham, and Japheth. The Septuagint translators often struggled to render the letter Heth (), which has a double aspiration sound, into Greek. They added the Greek letter chi (Ï‡) to instruct us to aspirate in such words. Therefore, in this passage, they translated Cham as Ham, because Ham is called "Ham" in the Hebrew language, and in Egyptian language, Egypt is called "Ham" until this day.
