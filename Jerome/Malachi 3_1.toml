Chapter 3, Verse 1: Behold, I send (or will send) my angel, and he will prepare the way before me: and immediately he will come to his temple, the Lord whom you seek, and the angel of the covenant whom you desire. LXX: Behold, I will send my angel, and he will prepare the way before me: and suddenly the Lord whom you seek will come to his temple, and the angel of righteousness whom you desire. This the Lord interpreted in the Gospel according to John the Baptist, saying: This is he of whom it is written; Behold, I send my angel before your face, and he will prepare your way before me (Matthew 11:10); and he did not use the same words that the translators of the LXX rendered. Marcus the evangelist also, combining two testimonies of Malachi and Isaiah in the discourse of one prophet, began as follows: The beginning of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, as it is written in the prophet Isaiah: Behold, I send my angel before your face, who will prepare your way (Mark 1:2). This we also read in other words in Malachi. And what follows: The voice of one crying in the wilderness: Prepare the way of the Lord, make straight his paths (Isaiah 40:3), is said by the prophet Isaiah. And immediately explaining both testimonies, he says: There was, he said, John in the wilderness, baptizing and preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins (Mark 1:4). But even the evangelists have interpreted the prophecy of the prophets concerning John, and while they agree in meaning, they differ in wording. For what the LXX translated as 'Make straight the paths of our God,' Mark and Luke said, 'Make straight his paths.' But John said, 'Prepare the way of the Lord.' From this it is clear that the apostles, the evangelists, and the Lord Himself, do not follow the authority of the LXX translators, whom having knowledge of the Hebrew language, they do not need; but they transfer from the Hebrew what they have read, not caring about the syllables and punctuation of the words, as long as the truth of the meaning is transferred. Indeed, we have taught that they did this in many places, especially in the book which is titled by us, on the best method of interpretation, it is confirmed by many testimonies together. Therefore, what is said: Behold, I send my angel and he will prepare the way before my face, it is said in the person of Christ, that he sent John into the desert of Judea to preach the baptism of repentance, for the remission of sins. But what follows: And immediately he will come to his temple, the Lord whom you seek, and the angel of the testament whom you desire, he speaks of himself as if of another, according to the custom of the Scriptures. There is no doubt that this Lord is the Savior, who is the Creator of all, and is called the Angel of the Covenant, and the Angel of Great Counsel. However, others think that what is said, 'Behold, I send my angel and he will prepare the way before me,' is spoken from the person of the Father. And what follows, 'The Lord whom you seek will suddenly come to his temple, the Dominator and the Angel of the Covenant whom you desire,' they understand as being said by the Lord Savior himself. But John prepares the way and makes straight paths for the hearts of the faithful of our God, in which, because of wickedness and unbelief, God could not walk first. However, the temple or the Church is interpreted, or each of the faithful in the Church: Build spiritual houses, a holy priesthood, offering spiritual sacrifices, and acceptable to God through Christ Jesus (I Peter 2:5). But to those who believe: Do you not know that you are the temple of God, and the Spirit of God dwells in you (I Corinthians 3:16)? The Jews understand this which is said: 'Behold, I send my angel', to refer to Elijah the prophet, and what follows: 'He will immediately come to his temple, the ruler whom you seek' they attribute to the anointed one, that is, their Christ, whom they say will come at the end of time. But I wonder how the course of events does not teach them the truth. For if the ruler will find his temple, which is destroyed down to its foundations, or if it is to be rebuilt by another before Christ comes, what more will their Christ do, since all things have already been restored by another? Our Lord, in the Gospel, interpreting Elijah the prophet, speaks of John the Baptist, saying: If you want to know, he is Elijah who is to come (Matthew 11:14), of whom also the same prophet whom we have been discussing writes at the end: Behold, I am sending to you Elijah the prophet before the great and terrible day of the Lord comes (Malachi 4:5). But how John is Elijah, he has given us the way of understanding, by mentioning that he came in the power and spirit of Elijah.
