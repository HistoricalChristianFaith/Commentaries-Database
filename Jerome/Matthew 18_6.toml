This can be viewed as a general sentence against all who raise a stumbling block. Yet according to the context of the discourse, it can also be understood as spoken against the apostles. In asking who was greater in the kingdom of heaven, they seemed to have just previously been contending among themselves for honor. If they persisted in this misbehavior they could lose those whom they were calling to the faith, if they should see the apostles fighting among themselves for honor.But when Jesus said, “It would be better for him to have a great millstone fastened around his neck,” he is following the rite of the province and telling how among ancient Jews this was the punishment for major crimes, that they be sunk in the deep with a rock attached to them. It is better for him, because it is much better to receive a short, quick punishment for one’s sin than to be reserved for eternal tortures. For the Lord will not punish the same fault twice.

(Verse 6.) But whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin, it would be better for him if a millstone were hung around his neck and he were drowned in the depth of the sea. Note that whoever is scandalized is little: for the greater ones do not receive scandals.

Let him be hanged with a millstone around his neck, and let him be thrown into the depths of the sea. Although this general idea can be applied against anyone who causes scandal, it can also be understood in the context of the apostles, who seemed to be competing with each other over rank when they asked who was the greatest in the kingdom of heaven. If they had remained in this vice, they could have caused those whom they called to the faith to stumble through their scandal, as they saw the apostles fighting amongst themselves for honor. But when he said, 'It is expedient for him that a millstone be hung about his neck,' he speaks according to the custom of the province, with which the punishment for more grievous crimes among the ancient Jews was that they should be plunged into the deep with a stone fastened to them. It is expedient for him, because it is much better to receive a brief punishment for a fault than to be preserved for eternal tortures. For the Lord will not judge twice for the same thing (Nahum 1).
