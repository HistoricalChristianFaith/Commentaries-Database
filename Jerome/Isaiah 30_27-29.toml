(Vers. 27 seqq.) Behold, the name of the Lord comes from afar: His burning anger and heaviness to bear. His lips are filled with indignation, and his tongue is like a devouring fire. His breath is like a torrent overflowing to the middle of the neck, to destroy nations for nothing, and the bridle of error that was in the jaws of the people. It shall be a song to you, like the night of a holy solemnity, and the joy of the heart, like one who goes with a flute, to enter the mount of the Lord, to the mighty one of Israel. LXX: Behold, the name of the Lord comes after a long time: burning wrath with glory, the speech of his lips, full of anger, and the anger of fury like fire will devour, and his spirit like water in a valley, drawing will come up to the neck, and it will be divided to disturb the nations with vain error, and error will be cast aside, and it will take them in their sight. Should you always rejoice and enter into my holy things constantly, as if celebrating and rejoicing at feasts, to enter with a pipe to the mountain of the Lord to the God of Israel? Let us first speak according to the Hebrew. They depend on the preceding things which are said. The prophetic word had caught those who, despising the help of God, were fleeing to the Egyptians because of fear of the Babylonians, and it threatened that those who went down there would die. And again, after the punishments, he promises that those who wanted (or rather, didn't want) to hear him would not only dwell in Jerusalem under Zerubbabel, Ezra, and Nehemiah, but also that he would promise greater blessedness to all who believe in the word of God, in the consummation of the world, when the rivers of waters will run through all the mountains and hills, and many will be killed, and towers will fall. The moon and the sun will also receive a brighter light when the Lord binds up and heals the wounds of his people. Some may argue that these things were accomplished to an excessive degree in the times of Cyrus, who released the captivity of the people and filled the land of Judah. Therefore, because rewards have been promised to the good and obedient, now on the contrary, punishments are declared for the wicked and contemptuous, so that the Lord may fulfill his plan and come to punish sinners after a long time, and pronounce judgment upon all, and destroy the impious with the breath of his mouth, whom he calls the bridle of the peoples: not to rule over them, but to draw those subject to him to ruin. He also uses the analogy of a river overflowing and reaching up to the neck to testify that the end of all things has come. Just as the river suffocates the one it reaches up to the neck, so too the judgment of God will not allow anyone to escape unpunished. But when He loses the bridle that was on the jaws of all nations, and has brought them to nothing, then, He says, there will be a song for you, O saints, who obey my commands, like the night of a holy solemnity, when you came out of Egypt and threw off the yoke of Egyptian slavery in the solemnity of the Passover, saying at the Red Sea when Pharaoh was drowned: 'Let us sing to the Lord, for He is gloriously magnified' (Exodus 15:1). And with such great joy in your hearts that you imitate those who, carrying the first fruits to the temple and offering gifts in the presses of God, go with their pipes, demonstrating the joys of their heart through song. I have briefly explained these things according to the Hebrew language. However, it should be noted in both editions that it is not the Lord, but the name of the Lord that comes after a long time, as it is said in the Psalms: 'Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord, the Lord God, and he has shined upon us' (Ps. CXVII, 26). And he himself speaks in the Gospel: 'I have come in my Father's name, and you have not received me' (John V, 43). It is said to come after a long time, with human impatience speaking: 'How long, O Lord, will you forget me? Forever?' How long will you turn your face away from me? (Ps. XII, 1). His burning fury also comes with glory, so that the one we despise in humility, we may fear in majesty. This very thing is also written in the psalms: God will come manifestly, our God will not keep silent. Fire will burn before him, and there will be a mighty tempest around him (Ps. L, 3, 4). He himself speaks in the Gospel (Luke XII, 49): I have come to cast fire on the earth, and how I wish it were already kindled! Again in another psalm it is read: The voice of the Lord cutting through the flame of fire (Ps. XXVIII, 7), so that whatever is in the manner of hay, wood, and straw, the flame would consume. Hence, God is also said to be a consuming fire (Deut. IV). And it is inferred: The fury of his wrath will devour like fire, and many of our people interpret the fury of the Lord's wrath as the devil, to whom we are handed over for punishment, who, according to the book of Samuel, incited David to number the people of God (II Reg. XXIV). And the Apostle says: to deliver such a Satan to the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved (I Cor. V, 5). But this same fury, and so the fury of the Lord will do nothing by his own will, but what has been commanded to him. Hence it follows: The speech of his lips is full of wrath. His spirit also like water in a valley, drawing near even to the neck, to make punishments overflow upon sinners. He will be divided according to the quality of his merits, to destroy and trouble the nations which false error had deceived, so that they may understand themselves to be overthrown. When it is said of such people, who prevailed in the power of this world and delighted in their own error, that they will not always do this. And certain of our people think that this place and the whole content of the chapter is against heretics and all dogmas that are contrary to the truth, because when the time of judgment comes, they will not enter his holy mountain, that is, the Church of the Lord, so that they may not gather riches under the name of religion and indulge in luxury, as if celebrating the feasts of the Lord. The Jews understand concerning the nations of Gog and Magog, which they believe will come from the North, that is, from the regions of Scythia, about which Ezekiel speaks more fully (Ezek. 19).
