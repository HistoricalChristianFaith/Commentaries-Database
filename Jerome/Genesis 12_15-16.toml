(Vs. 15 and 16) And the princes of Pharaoh saw her, and they praised her to Pharaoh, and she was brought into Pharaoh's house. And Abram benefitted because of her, and he had sheep, and cattle, and donkeys, and male and female servants, and mules and camels. Although the body of holy women does not see blemish, but the will does, and Sarai can be excused because, in the time of famine, she could not resist being alone in foreign places, with her husband conniving; however, the ugly necessity can also be excused in another way: that according to the book of Esther, whatever pleased the king among the women, for six months she was anointed with myrtle oil, and for six months she was in various perfumes and women's treatments, and only then she entered the king's presence. And so it happened that Sarai, after pleasing the king, while she was being prepared for a year to enter the king's presence, and Pharaoh gave many gifts to Abraham, and Pharaoh later was struck by the Lord, she still remained untouched by his concubinage.
