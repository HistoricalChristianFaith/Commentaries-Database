Be careful, reader, to understand the number three to refer to the mystery of the Trinity, which is the gate of those who go to God. The Father is in the Son, and the Son is in the Father, and the Holy Spirit is in each, which is the number three, and there is one gate for those who after baptism in the Trinity arrive at salvation.
