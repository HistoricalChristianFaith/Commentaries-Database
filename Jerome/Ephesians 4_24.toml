The metaphors of creating and establishing are never spoken of in Scripture except in great works. The world is created. A city is established. But observe that a house, however grand it may be, is more commonly said to be built than established or created. Note then that it is a great work of God when it is said that “the new person is created by God in Christ.” This creature towers over the other creatures. This creature alone is said to have been established in the same way as the world was established, from “the beginning of God’s ways,” when all the elements first came into being.
