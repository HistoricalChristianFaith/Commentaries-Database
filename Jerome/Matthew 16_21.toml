(Verse 21) Then Jesus began to show his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem, and suffer many things from the elders, chief priests, and scribes, and be killed, and on the third day be raised. And the meaning is: Proclaim me then, when I have suffered these things, because it is not profitable to publicly proclaim Christ and make known his majesty to the people, who after a little while will see him whipped and crucified, and suffer many things from the elders, chief priests, and scribes. And now Jesus suffers many things from those who crucify the Son of God again (Heb. VI): and when the elders are thought to be in the Church, and the high priests, following the simple letter, kill the Son of God, who is wholly felt in spirit.
