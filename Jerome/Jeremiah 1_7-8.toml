You should not consider the matter of age, he said, for you have learned through another prophet’s words that “a man’s gray hair is his wisdom.” May you only be willing to continue, for you will have me as a companion by whose assistance you will accomplish everything: “Open your mouth, and I will fill it.” Neither should you consider the number of those against whom you are about to speak, but consider me only, who is with you to deliver you, says the Lord. The Lord delivers, however, not so that the prophet will be free of persecutions and difficulties, for we read that he was severely afflicted. Instead, the Lord liberates one who suffers everything to overcome these tribulations rather than yielding to them.
