(Verse 27.) But when I speak to you, I will open your mouth, and you shall say to them: Thus says the Lord God: Let him who hears, hear; and let him who remains quiet, remain quiet; for the house is rebellious. What we read in Ecclesiastes: A time to be silent, and a time to speak (Ecclesiastes 3), is also supported in prophetic speech: that it is wise to both be silent and speak in due time, and to give food to our fellow servants at the appointed time. Therefore, Isaiah also said to the unbelieving people: I kept silent, will I always be silent? says the Lord (Isaiah 65). Therefore, he who kept his mouth closed for a long time due to the multitude of sins, because he saw that some could be converted, about whom it was said: Let him who has ears to hear, hear; and let him who is at peace with evil, be at peace; and let him cease: therefore, speaking with an open mouth, not by his own will, but by the command of the Lord, he speaks to the people. However, this is what we have set forth: Let him who has ears to hear, hear; and let him who is at peace, be at peace; for which the Septuagint translates: Let him who has ears to hear, hear; and let him who is unbelieving, be unbelieving; the second edition by Aquila translated it as follows: Let him who has ears to hear, be heard; and let him who leaves, be left. And he said: To you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God; but to them that are without, all things are done in parables. (Mark 4:11)
