(Verse 4-7) How the oppressor has ceased: the tribute has ceased! The Lord has broken the rod of the wicked, the staff of rulers, that struck the people in anger with a continual stroke, that ruled the nations in wrath with a relentless persecution. The whole earth is at rest and quiet; they break forth into singing. This is the lamentation with which the people of Israel bewail themselves, 'How the Lord has become weak and powerless, the conqueror of the nations who once plundered everything!' That man, I say, who was the staff of the wicked, who fiercely struck down all with his scepter and royal rod, whose blow could not be withstood, who even cruelly pursued those fleeing: how he has rested and been humbled, and all the land has conspired for his downfall, only making the voice of rejoicing heard.
