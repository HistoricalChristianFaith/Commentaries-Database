The poor widow cast only two pennies into the treasury; yet because she gave all she had it is said of her that she surpassed all the rich in offering gifts to God. Such gifts are valued not by their weight but by the good will with which they are made.

I pass on to the widow in the Gospel who though she was but a poor widow was yet richer than all the people of Israel. She had but a grain of mustard seed, but she put her leaven in the measures of flour; and, tempering her confession of the Father and of the Son with the grace of the Holy Spirit, cast her two pennies into the treasury. All the substance that she had, all her possessions she offered in the two testaments of her faith. These are like the two seraphim which glorify the trinity with threefold song5 and are stored among the treasures of the church. They are like the two legs of the tongs by which live coal is caught up to cleanse the sinnerâ€™s lips.
