A kind and merciful Lord and Master does not envy His servants and disciples ashare in His powers. As Himself had cured every sickness and disease, He imparted the same power to His Apostles. But there is a wide difference between having and imparting, between giving and receiving. Whatever He does He does with the power of a master, whatever they do it is with confession of their own weakness, as they speak, “In the name of Jesus rise and walk.” .
The Evangelist couples the names throughout in pairs. So he puts together Peter and Andrew, brothers not so much according to the flesh as in spirit; James and John who left their father after the flesh to follow their true Father; “James the son of Zebedee and John his brother.” He calls him the son of Zebedee, to distinguish him from the other James the son ofAlphaeus.
The other Evangelists in this pair of names put Matthew before Thomas; and donot add, “the Publican,” that they should not seem to throw scorn upon the Evangelist by bringing to mind his former life. But writing of himself he both puts Thomas first in the pair, and styles himself “the Publican;” because, "where sin hath abounded, there grace shall much more abound.” .
Simon Chananaeus is the same who in the other Evangelist is called Zelotes.Chana signifies ‘Zeal.’ Judas is named Scarioth, either from the town in which he was born, or from the tribe of Issachar, a prophetic omen of his sin; for Issachar means ‘a booty,’ thus signifying the reward of the betrayer.
