(Verse 4.) Simon the Cananaean. He is the one who is referred to in another Gospel (Luke VI) as Zealot. For Chana means zeal. Thaddaeus the apostle is said in the Ecclesiastical History to have been sent to King Abgar of Edessa, who is called by the evangelist Luke Judas, the son of James; and elsewhere he is called Lebbaeus (Acts I), which means little heart. And it is believed that he had a triple name: just as Simon was also called Peter (Mark III); and the sons of Zebedee were called Boanerges (or Banerges), because of the firmness and greatness of their faith.



And Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him. He took his name either from the village or city where he was born, or from the tribe of Issachar, so that it was born by some prophecy into the condemnation of itself. For Issachar is interpreted as wages, to signify the price of the traitor.
