What good will marriage be to me if it is to end in slavery to the haughtiest of kings? What good will little ones be to me if their lot is to be that which the prophet sadly describes: “The tongue of the sucking child cleaves to the roof of his mouth for thirst; the young children ask for bread and no one breaks it unto them”? In those days, as I have said, the virtue of continence was found only in men: Eve still continued to travail with children. But now that a virgin has conceived in the womb and has borne to us a child of whom the prophet says that “government shall be on his shoulder, and his name shall be called the mighty God, the everlasting Father,” now the chain of the curse is broken. Death came through Eve, but life has come through Mary. And thus the gift of virginity has been bestowed most richly on women, seeing that it has had its beginning from a woman. As soon as the Son of God set foot on the earth, he formed for himself a new household there; that, as he was adored by angels in heaven, angels might serve him also on earth.
