What is called in Greek kophos is more commonly known as deaf rather than dumb, but the Scriptures indiscriminately use kophos to mean dumb or deaf. Spiritually, just as the blind men receive light, so too the dumb manâ€™s tongue is loosened that he may speak and give glory to him whom he once rejected. .
