(Version 2-4.) You have multiplied the nation, you have not magnified the joy: they shall rejoice before you, as they rejoice in the harvest, as conquerors exulting for the spoils, when they divide the spoils. For the yoke of their burden, and the rod of their shoulder, and the scepter of their exactor you have overcome, as in the day of Midian. For every violent plunder with tumult: and the garment mingled with blood shall be for burning, and food for the fire. LXX: You have brought down a large portion of the people in your joy, and they shall rejoice in your presence, as they are accustomed to rejoice in the harvest, and as those who divide the spoils: for the yoke that was upon them, and the rod from their neck, has been taken away. For the rod of the oppressors shall be broken, as in the day of Midian. For every garment rolled in blood is for burning, fuel for the fire. We put both editions in dark places so that the diligent reader may recognize how much the Vulgate translation differs from the Hebrew truth and others. To the very light that appeared to the people in darkness, that is, to the Lord the Savior, an apostrophe is made. And it is said to him: You have multiplied the nation, that is, you have filled all nations with the knowledge of you; but you have not magnified the joy. According to which the Apostle says that he has perpetual sorrow for his brothers who are Israelites (Rom. X). And Jonah is grieved that the Ninevites have been saved in such a way that the gourd, or Ciceion, withered (Jonah IV). And the Lord himself speaks in the Gospel: I have come only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel (Matt. XV, 24). And in his suffering he said, 'Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from me (Mat. XXVI, 39).' This passage means: If it is possible for the multitude of the Gentiles to believe without the destruction of the Jews, I reject suffering. But if they are to be blinded, let all the nations see, let your will be done, Father. So when Christ comes and the people of Christians are gathered from all nations, then the Apostles will rejoice, like harvesters rejoice in the harvest, of whom the Lord spoke: The harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few (Matth. IX, 37). And as conquerors rejoice, who divide the captured booty. For when a strong one has been captured and bound, his whole house is plundered, and the spoils are divided (Matthew 12). But you, O Lord and Savior, have removed the burden of his yoke, that is the devil, who once rejoiced in the world, who ruled over all nations, who pressed down the necks of all with the heavy yoke of bondage; and you have taken the rod with which he used to strike everyone, and compelled him to pay tribute for his sins, and you have lifted it from their shoulders: and you have made them serve you in freedom without any army and without shedding blood with your hidden hand: just as you once granted victory to the people of Israel over the Midianites under Gideon (Judges 7). For just as a garment, which is stained with human blood, cannot be washed, but when stained with blood, it is burned with fire so that the stains of foul blood may be destroyed along with the garment, in the same way the violent plunder, turmoil, and crowds of the devil, by whom he had subjected the human race to himself, are assigned to the fires of hell. Not all, but only a certain part of the people, are said to have believed, as it is significant; although you have led in joy because of what they said, others have interpreted differently and praised. And when, in the remaining [senses], they hold the same meaning, they gather a stole by deceit, and change garments, adding that he is about to give back, that is, the devil: namely, that he will give back all the souls that he had stripped with the help of God, with their former adornments: not only himself, but also his attendant demons: to whom, if the choice is given, they would rather choose to perish in flames than to lose the spoils.
