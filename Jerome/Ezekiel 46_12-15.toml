(Verse 12 and following) When the prince offers a voluntary burnt offering or a voluntary peace offering to the Lord, the gate facing east shall be opened for him, and he shall offer his burnt offering and his peace offering as is customary on the Sabbath day. Then he shall go out, and after he has gone out, the gate shall be closed. He shall also offer a year-old lamb without blemish as a burnt offering to the Lord every day. He shall offer it in the morning and in the evening. And he shall offer as a grain offering a sixth of an ephah of grain and a third of a hin of olive oil, mixed with the grain offering. This is a perpetual ordinance to the Lord. You will make a lamb and a sacrifice, and oil every morning, a perpetual burnt offering. Where we read immaculate, in Hebrew it is written Thamim (), which the Aquila perfectum. And where LXX Manaa (): Theodotion, sacrifice; Aquila and Symmachus, they translate as gift. But for what we said, spontaneous, LXX translated as ὁμολογίαν, that is, confession: and for prince, they translate as leader, for this Nasi () signifies. Moreover, there is still talk of a prince, about whom Isaiah speaks: Behold, I have given him as a witness to the nations, a prince and a teacher among the nations (Isaiah 55:4). And Ezekiel says: And I, the Lord, will be their God, and David will be their prince among them (Ezekiel 34:24). Therefore, when this prince acts willingly and says: May the voluntary and spontaneous offerings of my mouth be pleasing to you, Lord (Psalm 119:108): the voluntary burnt offering, which means offering oneself entirely to God, and the peaceful voluntary offerings, which are not mentioned earlier; for it is written: And the priests shall offer his burnt offering and his peace offerings: and concerning the voluntary and spontaneous offerings, which are now mentioned, it is completely silent, so that they are not done out of necessity, but out of free will: after the burnt offering, he shall offer the peaceful offerings and reconcile with God. Whereas virginity is greater than marriage (I Cor. VII), because it is not demanded, nor is it returned, but it is offered. The propitiatory offerings, which are called Selamim in Hebrew, are interpreted as salvific by the LXX: so too the reconciliation of the peace offerings is the salvation of the one offering them. Therefore, when the prince has done this, the gate will be opened to him; or according to the Septuagint, the gate that faces the East will be opened for him; that is, that gate about which it is written: 'This is the gate of the Lord; the righteous shall enter through it' (Ps. CXVII, 20), and from where the sun of justice arises. And he will make his burnt offering, and his peace offerings: of which we have now spoken. He shall do it alone, because it is his spontaneous sacrifice, and the priests shall not offer these things for him, nor shall they mix the sacrifices with the people. And at any time the burnt offering or the peace offering, which is offered voluntarily, has the gate of the Lord reserved: neither shall he observe the sabbath, but all days shall be to him as a day of rest. Finally, after he has offered the burnt offering and the peace offerings, he shall immediately go out, and the door shall be closed after him, or the door shall be closed: so that his privilege as prince may be preserved, and his sacrifices may not be mixed with the people. And because he had said in general, a voluntary holocaust, or a peaceful voluntary offering to the Lord, and had not added a bull or a calf, and a ram or a sheep, and a male goat for sin, he teaches what the holocaust itself should be: saying, 'You shall make a yearling immaculate lamb a holocaust; and not on certain days, but daily, and not at any hour, but in the morning, morning he shall make it; particularly every morning, when the sun rises and the beginning of light appears.' About whom David speaks in the psalm: In the morning, you will hear my voice; in the morning, I will stand before you and see (Ps. 5:4). And in another place: Weeping may tarry for the night, but joy comes with the morning (Ps. 30:6). And again: O God, you are my God; early will I seek you (Ps. 63:1). But as for that spotless lamb, or perfect and year-old lamb, Isaiah explains more fully, saying: He was led like a sheep to the slaughter, and as a lamb before its shearer is silent, so he did not open his mouth (Isa. 53:7). And Jeremiah: But I was like an innocent lamb led to the slaughter; I did not know (Jer. XI, 19). And John the Baptist: Behold the Lamb of God, who takes away the sins of the world (John I, 29). This is the lamb that was sacrificed in Egypt, whose blood the doorposts of faith are marked with, and the destroyer is excluded (Exod. XII). And the year of the Lord's favor, and the day of retribution. And the reader should not be surprised if he is also called prince, and priest, and calf, and ram, and lamb, since in the Holy Scriptures we read of him as Lord, and God, and man, and prophet, and staff, and root, and flower, and prince, and judge, and king, righteous, and justice, apostle, and bishop, arm, servant, ointment, shepherd, son, and child, only-begotten, and first-born, door, way, angel, arrow, wisdom, and many others, all of which, if I were to want to recount the testimonies, would require their own book. Therefore, the high priest himself will perform the sacrifice of that immaculate and yearling lamb in the holocaust, which is offered every morning. This sacrifice is called the Manaa, and it consists of a sixth part of an ephah of fine flour. A sixth part of an ephah is half a modius. For if an ephah is a tenth part of a cor, which is three modii, then undoubtedly a sixth part of an ephah makes half a modius. Of oil, a third part of a hin is offered, in order to mix it with or sprinkle it upon the sacrifice of fine flour, which is a legitimate, perpetual offering to God that is never interrupted. It is offered at all times, from the rising of the sun, so that what is written at the end of this chapter may be fulfilled: 'He shall offer a lamb for a sacrifice and oil every morning, a perpetual holocaust.'
