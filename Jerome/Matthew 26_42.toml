(Verse 42.) Again, for the second time, he went away and prayed, saying: Father, if this chalice cannot pass away, unless I drink it, let your will be done. He prays for the second time, that if Nineveh cannot be saved in any other way, unless the gourd withers, let the will of the Father be done, which is not contrary to the will of the Son, as he himself said through the prophet: To do your will, O God, I desired (Ps. 39:9).
