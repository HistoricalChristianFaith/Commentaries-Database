(Chapter 43, Verse 11) And bring gifts to the man, some resin, and honey, incense, and resin, and turpentine, and nuts. Or, as Aquila and Symmachus translated, almonds. Therefore, we have included this chapter to know where in our codices the term 'incense' is found, in Hebrew it is 'Necotha' (), which Aquila translated as storax. From which the house of 'nechota,' which is read in Isaiah (39:21), is understood to be the most obvious cell for incense, or storax, as different fragrances are stored in it.
