(Verse 11.) He ties his young donkey to the vine, and the colt of the donkey to the choice vine. In Hebrew it says, He ties his young donkey to the vine, and in Sorec, his donkey's colt to the choice vine: which colt of the donkey, that is, the Gentile people whom Jesus has taken over, that is, the Apostles' vineyard, who are from the Jews, he has joined together. And in Sorec, that is, the chosen vine, he has tied the donkey, over whom he has taken control, the Church gathered from the nations. And what he says, my son, he addresses to Judas himself, because Christ will do all of this. But it should also be known that where we read: Alligating to its vine its foal, can be read as 'its foal' in Hebrew, its city, with the same meaning demonstrated by other words in the Church, of which it is written elsewhere: A city that is set on a hill cannot be hidden (Matt. 5:15). And the streams of the river make the city of God glad (Psalm 46:5).
