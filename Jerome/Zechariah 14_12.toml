(Verse 12) And this will be the plague with which the Lord will strike all the nations that have fought against Jerusalem. The flesh of each one standing on their feet will rot away, and their eyes will rot away in their sockets, and their tongue will rot away in their mouths (Septuagint: their mouths). The Scriptures testify to the nations that will suffer, those that will fight against the city of the Lord: 'They will stand,' it says, 'on their own feet, and their flesh will waste away and flow off, and their eyes will decay, and from their openings they will fall out; their arrogant tongue, which blasphemed against the people of God, will dissolve into pus, and within the fortification of their teeth it will decay. It is clear to everyone that the Romans who destroyed Jerusalem did not suffer these things, unless perhaps the Jews claim that those nations, which were to fight against the golden and jeweled Jerusalem, would suffer them.' But we will say that all the persecutors, who afflicted the Church of the Lord, received in the present age what they did, even if we remain silent about future tortures. Let us read the Ecclesiastical histories, what Valerian, what Decius, what Diocletian, what Maximian, what the cruelest of all Maximinus, and recently Julian, suffered: and then we will prove by facts, even according to the letter, that the truth of the prophecies has been fulfilled, that their flesh has rotted away, and their eyes have decayed, and their tongue has dissolved into filth and pus. Moreover, if the cruelty of God towards heretics seems to be shown in this saying, let it be understood that all these things happen so that good things may increase as evil things decrease. For whoever stands in the Lord and with the Lord, his carnal things flow away so that spiritual things may arise, and the eyes that were seeing poorly fall from their sockets so that others may be put in their place, who can receive the Lord with the prophet saying: To you I lift up my eyes, you who dwell in the heavens (Ps. 122:1). And the blaspheming tongue will decay, so that another tongue may be born, which glorifies God, and can say: My tongue shall meditate on your righteousness, your praise all day long (Ps. LXX, 15). Therefore Simeon, receiving the Infant in his arms and foretelling the future, says: Behold, this Child is set for the fall and rise of many (Luke II, 34), so that the evil may fall, and the good may rise. Therefore the Lord also said: For judgment I have come into this world, that those who do not see may see, and those who see may become blind (John IX, 39). The people of the Gentiles did not see, but after the faith of Christ, they began to behold the light of truth, which speaks through the prophet: The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, for which reason he has anointed me to bring good news to the poor, to proclaim release to the captives, and recovery of sight to the blind, and to set at liberty those who are oppressed (Isaiah 61:1-2), of which it is written: The wisdom of a man enlightens his face (Ecclesiastes 8:1). And in the Psalms we read: The Lord gives sight to the blind, or makes them wise (Psalm 146). For this signifies more the wise. The Jews saw; and because they did not want to receive the light, they were covered in eternal blindness.
