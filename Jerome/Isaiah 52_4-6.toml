(Verse 4 and following) Because thus says the Lord God: My people went down into Egypt at the beginning, to dwell there as strangers: and Assur without any cause has oppressed them. And now what have I here, says the Lord? For my people have been taken away for nothing: their rulers have acted unjustly, says the Lord, and my name is constantly blasphemed all day long. Therefore, on that day my people shall know my name, because I myself am the one who spoke, behold, I am here. LXX: For thus says the Lord: My people went down into Egypt to sojourn there, and they became slaves in Assyria. And now, what will happen here, says the Lord? For my people have been taken away for no reason; you marvel and wail. Thus says the Lord: Because of you, my name is constantly blasphemed among the nations. Therefore, on that day, my people will know my name, for I myself am present. He reproaches the people of Judah and predicts what is to come. Those who descended to Egypt by their own will and travelled in the land of Goshen during a time of necessity and famine (Genesis XLVII): later suffered slander by the Assyrians, whom they had not harmed, and were taken into captivity in Babylon (2 Kings XVII, 25). From this, it is inferred: 'And now, what do I have here, says the Lord?' And the meaning is: I have nothing left that would cause me to remain in this region, from which my people was taken away for nothing, and sold into captivity because of their sins, and like a wild bull caught in a net, either by the strength of the Romans or by the snares of the devil, by which it is held captive until now. But in order to allow these things, their rulers and masters acted unfairly; those who, according to Symmachus and Theodotion, will howl; those who, according to Aquila, will weep, when they have been handed over to torments. For they are the ones who incited the people against the Savior, so that they might shout with one voice: Crucify, crucify such a one (John 19:15). Concerning whom he had already said: The Lord himself will come with the elders of the people and with its princes. But why have you set my vineyard on fire and plundered the poor in your houses? (Is. III, 14) Therefore, according to the Septuagint, it speaks to them: Because of you, my name is always blasphemed among the nations. And it should be known that, among the nations, my name is not blasphemed in Hebrew, but absolutely, so that it may be understood, my name is constantly blasphemed in your synagogues: on the days and nights they blaspheme the Savior, and under the name, as I have often said, of Nazarenes, they heap curses upon Christians three times a day. Therefore, while they blaspheme and curse the Lord, his people, of whom it has been frequently said, that is, the Christian people, will know the name of him who is to come in the name of the Father. And for this reason, they will know, because he who spoke previously through the prophets will personally teach the people. According to the Septuagint, God speaks to Israel that he descended into Egypt by his own will. As Moses said in Deuteronomy: 'Your fathers went down to Egypt with seventy souls' (Deut. 10:22), and they were violently taken captive by the Assyrians. Where is it said to them: And now what are you doing here? what are you doing in the land of Judah, who after the death of the Prophets, laid hands on the Son of God? Or surely to the angelic powers, and the guardians of the Temple, God speaks to the Angels: What are you doing here, why do you not leave the blaspheming people? which Josephus also relates (Book VI, Jewish Antiquities, c. 12): suddenly the doors of the Temple opened, and were spontaneously unlocked, which many men could hardly close, and a voice came out from the inner sanctuary of the Temple, saying: Let us leave these seats. Considering the appropriateness of their words, let us depart from what they did not say, but let us go on to the people of the nations. Therefore, the veil of the Temple from the top to the bottom was torn in two parts, to expose all the Jewish ceremonies, and at that time be fulfilled what is said in this same Prophet: The law will go forth from Zion, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem. And He shall judge between many nations even unto the farthest (Isaiah 2:3-4). For their sound went out into all the earth, and their words unto the ends of the world (Psalm 19). And in every place incense is offered to God, and a pure offering (Malachi 1), when the prophetic word is fulfilled: They shall remember and return to the Lord all the ends of the earth: and all the families of the nations shall worship in his presence; for the kingdom is the Lord's, and he shall rule over the nations (Psalm 22, 28-29). Therefore it is said to the princes of Judah: Be amazed, and howl, for you are the cause of the ruin of the people. Furthermore, according to the anagogical sense, we can say that the people of God of this age willingly descend into Egypt when they are more lovers of pleasures than of God, and do not heed that prophetic message: Woe to those who go down to Egypt for help (Isaiah 31:1). When someone is stained with vices and dwells in a place of waters and rivers, not having the dryness of chastity, then they will be violently handed over to the Assyrians to be ruled by them, who will later accuse and convict them of sin. For they are both enemies and avengers, of whom he speaks to Israel: And now what is to you and the way of Egypt, that you drink the water of Geon: and what is to you and the way of the Assyrians, that you drink the water of the rivers (Jer. II, 18). Therefore, whoever descends into Egypt, and from the heights of Jerusalem falls to lower things: going to Jericho, the other Egypt, he receives many wounds from the robbers, it is said to him: And now what is this to you? What on earth and in the Church of God do you pretend to be, you who have descended to Egypt with zeal and desire, and are possessed by Assyrians, and have been captivated? And you should wail and lament even more; because because of your vices and sins, the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles. As it is said in Ezekiel: You have defiled my name among the Gentiles (Ezek. XXXVI, 20). And just as the Lord speaks to his disciples in the Gospel: Let your light shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father who is in heaven (Matth. V, 16): so, on the contrary, when we do evil works, the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of us. Therefore, whoever has knowledge of the name of God and that he was created in his image and likeness, will not be ignorant, but will dwell in the light. And it will be in the day, of which Abraham rejoiced that he saw it (John 8); of which also the holy David speaks: This is the day that the Lord has made, let us rejoice and be glad in it (Psalm 118:24). For those who have enlightened themselves with the light of knowledge, and have eternal light, which is promised to those who believe: The Lord will be your eternal light (Isaiah 60:20), they walk honorably in the day, and are the children of light and day; and they will know him who says to Moses: Go, say to the children of Israel, 'I AM who I AM' (Exodus 3:14): and they will recognize that he whom they had known before in the saints, is also present with them.
