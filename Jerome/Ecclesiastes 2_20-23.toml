"So I
turned my heart to despair of all that I had achieved by toiling under the
sun. For there is a man who laboured
with wisdom, knowledge and skill, yet he must hand on his portion to one who
has not toiled for it. This too is
vanity and a great evil. For what has a
man in return for all his toil and his stress, which he toils beneath the
sun? For all his days are painful, and
his business is a vexation; even at night his mind has no rest. This, too, is vanity!" Previously he has spoken about the uncertainty of an
heir and not knowing whether he will be foolish or wise, the master of the
works of another. But even now he seeks
the same things but this time the meaning is different, because he might leave
his wealth and labours perhaps to his son, to a neighbour, or someone he knows. Nevertheless it happens time and time again
that one man enjoys in the work of another, and "sweet toil is to the dead while pleasures are for the living." He thinks of himself as every single one and
he will see with how much toil he composes his books, how "often he turns
his pen, again he will write those things which are worthy of law" [Horat. Sat. I. 10, 72/73.],
and for the man who does not work he will give him his own share. For what good to the wealth of the earth, as
I have said clearly, are wisdom, knowledge and virtue, in which he said he had
laboured? For although he may be
virtuous, wise and knowledgeable he spurns worldly things.
