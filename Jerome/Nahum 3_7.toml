(Verse 7) And it shall come to pass, that whoever sees you will flee from you, and say: Nineveh is laid waste; who will mourn for her? In Hebrew, there is no 'head', but we have added it to make the meaning clearer. Finally, Symmachus interpreted it as follows: And whoever sees you will depart from you and say: Nineveh is dispersed, who will mourn with her? Moreover, the Seventy: And it shall come to pass, that whoever sees you will descend from you and say: Wretched Nineveh, who will lament for her? Where shall I find a consolation fitting for her? ** Whoever sees the ruins of Nineveh, and sets it up as an example for all, will be filled with awe and wonder, and will say: Nineveh is destroyed, who will shake their head at you? That is, who will grieve for you, who will be your comforter? As long as you were powerful, like a cruel mistress, you had no pity for the old ((or old men)) or the little ones: you did not look upon the small ones: you did not prepare a companion for your mourning, because you did not want to have a partner in ruling. But whoever despises these earthly things, and looks down on the evil deeds of the witchcraft of Nineveh, and is not ensnared by its false beauty when they see all its ugliness within, and begins to hate what others love, they will flee and reject it, or as it is said in the Septuagint, they will descend. For as long as we honor earthly things, and think them to be lofty, we are like those who were once on the summit of pride, and we admire the beauty of Nineveh. But when we consider its nature, and despise all earthly goods as lowly, subjecting ourselves to the power of God's hand, then we will have mercy on the Ninevites, and we will judge all earthly goods as worthy of lamentation, and we will say: Wretched Nineveh, how many are ensnared by your snares, how many are bound by your chains! Who do you think will break free from you and descend from your pride, and judge you as miserable? But when he says, 'Who, do you think, is the faithful and prudent steward?' (Matthew 24:45)? And, 'Who is wise and will understand these things?' (Hosea 14:10)? And, 'Who shall ascend into the mountain of the Lord?' (Psalm 23:3)? Who, then, will lament over Nineveh? Who will be found, who, burdened with this tabernacle, will say with Paul, 'Wretched man that I am, who will deliver me from the body of this death?' (Romans 7:24)? We see every day, if death comes close to someone and they realize that they are being taken away from this world due to fever, injury, or any kind of illness, they panic, tremble, and cling to the embrace of the beautiful prostitute, barely able to be pulled away from her body. But what follows: Where can I find consolation, or a consoler for you, who can tune the chord? It is yet spoken in the persona of the one who will rebound or descend from Nineveh, and say: Miserable Nineveh, who will mourn for her? Discussing the confusion of this age, in which nothing can please anyone forever: but what pleased displeases, and what displeased, pleases again. Who, therefore, can be found as such a consoler? And (so to speak) a lyric writer and a harpist who can bring its dissonant strings into one harmony, and make the vocal sound praise to God? What we have explained, which is to bring together a chord, or one bringing together a chord, is called in Greek, ἁρμόσαι χορδὴν, but we have not found it in Hebrew, nor in the translations of others, but instead the beginning of another speech: Are you better than Amon who dwells in rivers? Therefore, it seems to me that it should be more closely connected with the following.
