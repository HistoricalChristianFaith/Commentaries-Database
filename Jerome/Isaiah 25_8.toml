“Where, O death, is your strife? Where, O death, is your sting?” Commenting upon the power of this testimony, Paul infers “the sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law. Yet thanks be to God, who gave us victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.” Because he interpreted the resurrection of the Lord in this way, we dare not nor are we able to interpret it differently. Death can be understood as hell and as the devil, who was strangled by the death of Christ. In this connection, Isaiah also said, “Growing stronger, he devoured death,” and again, “the Lord has wiped every tear from every face.” The two brothers who divided from one another at death, according to the history of that time, are understood to be Israel and Judah, that what was then partially prefigured might now be known fully and that Israel and Judah might be liberated and redeemed along with every human family. - "Commentary on Hosea 3.13.14–15"
