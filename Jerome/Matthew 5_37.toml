This was allowed under the Law, as to children; as they offered sacrifice to God, that they might not do it to idols, so they were permitted to swear by God; not that the thing was right, but that it were better done to God than to daemons.
Lastly, consider that the Saviour does not here forbid to swear by God, but bythe Heaven, the Earth, by Jerusalem, by a manâ€™s head. For this evil practice of swearing by the elements the Jews had always, and are thereof often accused in the prophetic writings. For he who swears, show either reverence or love for that by which he swears. Thus when the Jews swore by the Angels, by the city of Jerusalem, by the temple and the elements, they paid to the creature the honour and worship belonging to God; for it is commanded in the Law that we should not swear but by the Lord our God.
Therefore Evangelic verity does not admit an oath, since the whole discourse of the faithful is instead of an oath.
