Many maintain that these words of the psalm refer to the devil; they mean, unless you will have been converted, unless you will have repented, you will be in the power of the devil. “He will bend and aim his bow.” The devil always has his bow ready, and he is ever alert to shoot his arrows and strike us down.… They whose hearts are burning with lust and passion are the very ones whom the devil conquers.… The psalm did not say for those who are about to burn—that is, about to burn from his arrows. The hearts of those he sees already burning, no matter whose they are, are his target.
