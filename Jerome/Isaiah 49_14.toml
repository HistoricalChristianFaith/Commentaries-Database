We have often mentioned that Jerusalem and Zion in the holy Scriptures ought to be understood in four ways, one according to the Jews and when the Lord lamented in the Gospel, “Jerusalem, Jerusalem, who killed the prophets.” … Second, as the congregation of the saints that in the peace of the Lord and in the mirror of virtues is rightly called Zion, about which it is said, “Your foundations are in the holy mountains, the Lord loves the gates of Zion above all the temples of Jacob.” For it is not the foundations of the Jewish Zion that we saw were destroyed that was loved by the Lord, as if what was loved by the Lord could be destroyed. Third, “Jerusalem” means the host of angels and rulers and powers and all that is set up for God’s ministry.… Fourth, by “Jerusalem” is called that which the Jews and Judaizing Christians read of in the Apocalypse of John, a text they do not understand; they think of Jerusalem as golden and jeweled and coming down from the heavens, whose dimensions and enormous width are also described in the last part of Ezekiel.… There is no doubt that here the congregation of the saints remembers and complains in a tearful voice that it has been deserted and left destitute of the Lord’s help.
