"There
is a sickening evil that I have seen under the sun; riches hoarded by their
owner to his misfortune, and he loses those riches in some bad venture. If he begets a son, he has nothing in
hand. As he had come from his mother's
womb, naked will he return, as he had come; he can salvage nothing from his
labour to take with him. This too, is a
sickening evil: Exactly as he came he must depart, and what did he gain in exchange
for toiling for the wind? Indeed, all
his life he eats in darkness; he is greatly grieved, and has illness and
anger." Take what follows as linked to what is written above:
while Ecclesiastes describes wealth, even he is not able to enjoy his riches and
on many occasions endangers himself on account of them. Nor to his heir does he leave what he has
amassed; but even he and his son, just as they came nude, will return nude to
the earth and nothing of their toil will accompany them. Surely apathy is the worst, to be tortured by
thought on account of riches, and wealth will perish. And are we able to take it with us when we
die, in sadness, in mourning, in indignation, in laws or to seek it in vain
toil? And all this is according to the
apparent simple meaning of the text. But
as we are lifted higher, it seems to me that it speaks about the philosophers,
or the heretics, who amass riches of doctrines into their wickedness, and nor
are authors able to follow any usefulness, nor leave perpetual fruit for their
followers. But even they and their
disciples return to the earth and lose their riches, from him who said, "I
will lose the wisdom of the wise men, and I will reprove the prudence of the
careful." [I Cor. 1, 19.]
Truly
in fact, just as they left their mother's womb, (apparently as from a heretical
church), contrary to this about which it is written: "but Jerusalem which
is above is free, which is the mother of all." [Gal. 4, 26.]
Thus
they go nude to become a spirit, and work for nothing. Those who examine, lack examination, and they
are carried on every wind of doctrine, nor do they have the light, but eat
their sacraments in the darkness. They
are always ill, and are easily moved to anger, storing up anger for themselves
for the day of anger, and they do not have the favour of God.
