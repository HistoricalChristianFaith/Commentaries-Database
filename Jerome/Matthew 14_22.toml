(Verse 22.) And immediately Jesus compelled his disciples to get into the boat and go ahead of him across the sea, while he dismissed the crowds. He instructed the disciples to cross over and compelled them to get into the boat, which shows by his words that they unwillingly left the Lord, as they did not want to be separated from him even for a moment.
