(Chapter 2, verses 1, 2.) Woe to the deceitful one who has a male in his flock and makes a vow, sacrificing something weak to the Lord. For I am a great king, says the Lord of hosts, and my name is feared among the nations. + And now, to you, O priests, I give this command: If you will not listen and if you will not set it on your heart to give glory to my name, says the Lord of hosts, I will send poverty upon you and curse your blessings, yes, I have cursed them, because you have not set it on your heart. LXX: And cursed is the one who is powerful and has a male in his flock, and his vow is upon him, and he sacrifices a weakling to the Lord. For I am a great King, says the Lord Almighty, and my name is renowned among the nations. And now I have this command for you, O priests. If you do not listen and if you do not set your heart to give glory to my name, says the Lord Almighty, I will send a curse on you, and I will curse your blessings. Indeed, I have already cursed them, because you have not set your heart to honor me. This which is written, and I will scatter your blessing, is added in the Septuagint, and is not found in Hebrew. Whatever the human mind can find to excuse its sin and defend itself with false satisfaction, this divine word, foreseeing it, rebukes and condemns. And the meaning is, because you offer the blind and the lame and the sick, and this is not from your own, but from robberies and spoils and the tears of the miserable, and moreover you say, we offer what we have from labor and poverty: therefore I say generally, that your own conscience may accuse you. Certainly you hide poverty and the injustice of captivity, and the weakness of your family affairs: listen to what I say: Cursed is the deceitful one who has a male in his flock, and making a vow he sacrifices an inferior one to the Lord. If you do not have a male, the curse does not harm you. By saying this, he shows that they have what is best and offer what is worst. Therefore, priests, this commandment is for you, you have done what is wicked in contempt of me. But because I prefer the repentance of a sinner to death, I say even now: If you refuse to listen and understand, so as to give glory to my name, which is terrible among the nations, I will send a true plague to you, so that you will not lie; but, compelled by the lack of all things, you will say that you do not possess the best things to offer. And I will curse, he says, your blessings, that is, those things which you now possess through my blessings; whatever is blessed by you will be cursed by me. And I will curse them, implied by your blessings; for you did not want to understand what is being said; for it is said: you have not set it upon your heart. We can receive the curse and deception of the Jewish people, who, although they had in their flock the male Lord Savior, and the spotless Lamb who takes away the sins of the world (John 1), and being warned by the prophecy of all the prophets, to sacrifice and accept the ram, which was caught by its horns in the thicket of Sabec (Genesis 22), they did not want to do this; but instead, they sacrifice the weak to the Lord, crucifying the Savior, and choosing Barabbas, the author of robbery and sedition (John 18), who is interpreted according to mystical understanding as referring to the devil: and for those despising and preferring the devil to the Savior, the name of Christ is horrible among the nations, who have received the passion of the Lord and fearfully honor Him. It can also be said about us: If we, created by God, wise and possessing a nature suitable for sacred disciplines, neglect our own skill and give ourselves to vices and excesses, and having power, we sacrifice the weak to the Lord. However, our prayer is weak and tainted, when it is corrupted by anger, envy, enmities, and other disturbances of the soul: if we offer a gift at the altar and remember that our brother has something against us, we do not proceed and make amends to him (Matthew 5:23). And so the Apostle commands: 'I desire therefore that the men pray in every place, lifting up holy hands without anger and dispute' (I Tim. II, 8). And the shepherd is the one who knows our thoughts and the senses of our virtues, as it is said in the one hundred and second Psalm (Verse 1): 'Bless the Lord, O my soul, and let all that is within me bless his holy name'. If he governs his flock well, he fulfills that blessing: 'Blessed shall be the offspring of your cattle and the produce of your ground' (Deut. XXVIII, 4). But if he who naturally possesses masculinity, that is, strength, rigidity, and robustness, sacrifices lightness or excessive femininity and lasciviousness, or if he is weakened and corrupted by various disturbances of the soul, he will feel within himself that which is written: The powerful endure torments powerfully (Wisdom 6:7). And: To whom much is given, much will be demanded from him (Luke 8). Therefore, it is specifically said to priests that if they refuse to listen and hold it in their hearts, so as to give glory to the name of the Lord through good conduct (Romans 2); but on the contrary, his name is cursed among the nations because of them, he will send upon them poverty of all good things, and will turn their blessings into a curse. Those who abuse their health for pleasure, and turn their wealth into luxury, and tarnish their good reputation with impure conduct, they change the blessings of God into curses. Indeed, it is specifically the priests who are commanded, and their blessings are turned into curses when they do not bless the saints with true heartfelt affection, like Isaac with Jacob, and Jacob with the patriarchs, and Moses with the twelve tribes (Genesis 27 and 49, and Deuteronomy 23), but they deceive the hearts of the innocent with sweet words and blessings (Romans 16), and those who act wickedly are blessed by them, and they flatter sinners as long as they are rich and indulge in their vices, of whom it is said: My people, those who call you blessed are leading you astray and causing you to stumble in your paths (Isaiah 3:11).
