(Chapter XXXII, verse 1 and following). The word that was spoken to Jeremiah by the Lord in the tenth year of King Zedekiah of Judah, was the eighteenth year of King Nebuchadnezzar. At that time the army of the king of Babylon was besieging Jerusalem, and the prophet Jeremiah was confined in the courtyard of the prison, which was in the palace of the king of Judah. For King Zedekiah of Judah had locked him up, saying, 'Why do you prophesy, saying, "Thus says the Lord"? Not only the words and deeds of the prophets are an example to us for virtue. Jeremiah could have announced prosperity and enjoyed the friendship of King Zedekiah, but he preferred to obey God rather than men (Acts 5), and he who can destroy both soul and body in hell, rather than he who could only have power over the body (Matthew 10). And it should be noted that it was the tenth year of Zedekiah's reign, with Jerusalem already besieged and consumed by sword, famine, and plague, and captivity imminent. Yet Zedekiah persists in his decision, and to some extent demonstrates his clemency by ordering that he not be confined in a prison, but in the courtyard: a form of free custody, so that he could not escape, as if the entire Jerusalem, closed by fortifications, were not a common prison for its inhabitants. This is the twenty-second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar, who in the fourth year of King Jehoiakim's reign took control. However, the reason for the king's anger is that he speaks in the name of God, and he was commanded to do so.
