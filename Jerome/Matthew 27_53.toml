(Verse 53.) And many bodies of saints who had fallen asleep were raised. And coming out of the tombs after his resurrection, they went into the holy city and appeared to many. Just as Lazarus, who was dead, rose again, so too many bodies of saints rose again to show the rising of the Lord (John 11). And yet, although the tombs were opened, they did not rise before the Lord rose, so that he would be the firstborn of the resurrection from the dead. But let us understand the holy city, in which they [the risen ones] were seen, either as the heavenly Jerusalem, or as this earthly one, which was previously holy. Just as Matthew is called a tax collector, not because he still remains a tax collector, but because he retains the former title. The city of Jerusalem was called holy because of the temple and the holy of holies, and in distinction from other cities where idols were worshipped. When it is said 'truly', they appeared to many, it is shown that the resurrection was not general, which would appear to everyone: but specific to many, so that those who were worthy could see.
