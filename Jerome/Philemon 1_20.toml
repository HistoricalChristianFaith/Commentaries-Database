The Apostle enjoys only him who has in himself many, coherent virtues and all that Christ, for various reasons, is called- wisdom, righteousness, continence, gentleness, self-control, chastity. And lest one think that he means that enjoyment with which we mutually delight one another, he added ‘in the Lord,’ to make it clear that the enjoyment which someone has without the Lord is a quite different kind of enjoyment.
