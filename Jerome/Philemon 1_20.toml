"So, brother, I might enjoy you in the Lord." The Latin language does not clarify the Greek word 'proprietatem'. What he says, "yes, brother, yes" is something like the adverb of flattery. But we interpreters sound more flowing and diluted as "so, brother," something else more than what is written. For as Anna's Hebrew word frequently translated by the seventy interpreters as "oh yes", indicates a prayerful attitude in their own language. Hence sometimes Symmachus translated Anna as "I pray," that is, "I beseech." We also suffer the same strength in the Greek language that Greeks sustain in the Hebrew language. What he says, "I might enjoy you in the Lord," is understood as something far more than it is thought. The Apostle enjoys nothing but that which has many virtues and sings in itself, and everything that is called Christ for a variety of reasons: namely, wisdom, justice, self-restraint, gentleness, temperance, chastity: Philemon invokes these to abound in them, so that he himself may be fulfilled in enjoying them. And lest you think that fruition is said, in which we often delight in the presence of our own, he added, "in the Lord:" so that from the fact that the name of the Lord is added, it is understood that there is another enjoyment, by which one enjoys without the Lord.

"Renew my being in Christ." Thus just as Philemon wanted to enjoy him in the Lord, so he wants his own being Onesimus, whom also previously he called by the same name, to be renewed through Philemon, and it is said ambiguously: whether it is Onesimus' being in Christ that is of Paul, or whether it must be said that Onesimus' being is to be renewed through Philemon in Christ. If you wish to understand the former, correctly you will say that Onesimus is of Paul's being in Christ whom he begot in Christ's chains. If the latter applies: Onesimus is to be renewed in Christ through Philemon, as he is trained by his teachings in Christ.
