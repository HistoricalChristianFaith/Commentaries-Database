“God is able from these stones to raise up children to Abraham.” He calls the Gentiles stones because of their hard heart. We read in Ezekiel: “I will revive their stony heart and give them a heart of flesh.” He shows the hardness in a stone and the softness of flesh. In other words, this passage indicates the power of God, who made everything out of nothing and can produce a people out of the hardest stones.
