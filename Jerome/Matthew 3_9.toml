“God is able from these stones to raise up children to Abraham.” He calls the Gentiles stones because of their hard heart. We read in Ezekiel: “I will revive their stony heart and give them a heart of flesh.” He shows the hardness in a stone and the softness of flesh. In other words, this passage indicates the power of God, who made everything out of nothing and can produce a people out of the hardest stones.

(Verse. 9.) God is able to raise up children of Abraham from these stones. He calls them ethnic stones because of the hardness of the heart. Read Ezekiel: I will take away the heart of stone from you and give you a heart of flesh (Ezek. XXXVI, 26). In the stone, hardness is shown, in the flesh, softness is shown. Or it simply indicates the power of God, that he who created everything out of nothing can also create a people from the hardest stones.
