(Chapter 13, Verse 4) And Abram went up out of Egypt, he and his wife, and all that he had, and Lot with him, into the wilderness. Now Abram was very rich in livestock, in silver, and in gold. And he went on his journey from the South as far as Bethel. It is said that Abram went up from Egypt in a splendid manner. But there is a contradiction to this idea in what follows: how could he have become very rich upon leaving Egypt? This is explained by the Hebrew word used, which means Abram was heavily burdened, that is, βαρύς σφόδρα: for he was burdened by the weight of Egypt. And although they may seem to be riches of cattle, gold, and silver, yet if they are of Egypt, they are burdensome to a holy man. Finally, not as we read in the Septuagint, 'He went back from where he came into the desert unto Bethel,' but as it is written in Hebrew, 'He went on his journey by way of the south unto Bethel.' Therefore, he departed from Egypt not to enter the desert that he had left in Egypt, but to come by way of the south, which is opposite to the north, to the house of God, where his tabernacle had been in the midst of Bethel and Ai (also called Gai).
