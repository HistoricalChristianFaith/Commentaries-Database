(Chapter I, Verse 1) The word of the Lord that came to Zephaniah, the son of Cushi, the son of Gedaliah, the son of Amariah, the son of Hezekiah, in the days of Josiah, the son of Ammon, king of Judah. The Septuagint similarly. The Hebrews report that the father or grandfather of any prophet is mentioned in the title, indicating that they themselves were also prophets. Therefore, Amos, one of the twelve prophets, who said, 'I am not a prophet, nor am I the son of a prophet, but I am a herdsman and a gatherer of sycamore fruit' (Amos 7:14), does not have his father's name mentioned in the title. If this is true, Sophonias the prophet, whom we are now attempting to explain, received a prophetic name, so to speak, and was born from the glorious lineage of his ancestors; for he had Chusi as his father, Godolias as his grandfather, Amarias as his great-grandfather, and Ezechias as his great-great-grandfather: and he himself completed such a team of horses as the last charioteer. Some have translated the name Sophonias as "watchtower," others as "hidden by the Lord." Therefore, whether it is interpreted as a watchtower or as hidden by the Lord, both meanings apply to the prophet. For it is said also to Ezekiel: Son of man, I have made you a watchman for the house of Israel (Ezek. III, 17). And in another place: The Lord does nothing unless he reveals his secret to his servants, the prophets. And the title of the ninth psalm is interpreted as for the hidden things of the son. Therefore, this prophet, who was in the watchtower and stationed on high, and knew the mysteries of the Lord, was the son of Cush (which is interpreted as humility, or my Ethiopian, about whom we will discuss later), and he also had a grandfather named Godoliah, who is called the greatness of the Lord, and a great-grandfather named Amariah, who also turns into the word of the Lord: and a great-great-grandfather named Hezekiah, which means the strength of the Lord. About the strength of the Lord, the word of the Lord was born. And from the word of the Lord, the magnitude of the Lord was born. And from the magnitude of the Lord, humility was born, so that when someone reaches perfection, they may say: I am not worthy to be called an apostle (I Corinthians 9). And that in the Psalms: Lord, my heart is not exalted, nor are my eyes lofty (Psalm 130:1). Up until now, we have stumbled like one in a downward slide, and running on level ground, in what Chusi, even my Ethiopian, interprets. For after so many virtues, how can the name of the Ethiopian sound in praise? And indeed, if the Scripture had said 'Chus', that is, Ethiopian, the question seemed unsolvable; for Chus was born of Cham. But in what he says, 'Chusi', that is, my Ethiopian, it seems to sound a mystery: that he who was once an Ethiopian, turned to repentance (according to what is said: 'Ethiopia shall stretch out her hands to God' (Ps. 68:32)). And in another place (Ps. 71, 9): Ethiopians shall fall before him. Let the bride say in the Song of Songs: I am black, but beautiful, O daughters of Jerusalem (Song of Songs 1, 4). We also read in Jeremiah that Abdimelech, an Ethiopian eunuch, pleased God (Jer. 38). And in the Acts of the Apostles, we learn that the Ethiopian eunuch of the queen Candace had such a devotion to the Scriptures and the Law of God that he would read them in his chariot, and came to Jerusalem to worship the Lord in his temple (Acts 8, 9). Where such faith is crowned with fitting reward, and Philip the evangelist is sent to him, and immediately he is taught, believes, is baptized, and is saved. And not only is he a eunuch, but with the additional descriptor of man, he is an Ethiopian eunuch. For because he was a eunuch for Christ's sake, and had castrated himself for the sake of the kingdom of heaven, therefore he had not lost the label of man. And rightly also does Zephaniah, like the son of Cush, that is, the Ethiopian, in the later books write of the repentance of the Ethiopians: Through the rivers, he says, of Ethiopia, they shall bring my offerings from there. This is about the genealogy of Zephaniah, who prophesied in the days of Josiah. However, the days are also called of Elijah those who were enlightened by him: just as the days of Josiah, who had risen to the Lord (for Josiah means the lifting up of the Lord) and he was a righteous man. The history also writes about his praises, as well as the Chronicles and the Book of Kings (2 Kings 23 and 2 Chronicles 34). And he had a father named Ammon and a grandfather named Manasseh (2 Kings 21). We read that Manasseh, after many crimes and after the captivity in Babylon, repented and obtained the mercy of the Lord, who turned him to better things. And because of his faith, by which he believed in God, he called his son ἐπώνυμον, that is, Ammon: since Ammon () means faith. At the same time, consider that the ten tribes, that is, the kings of Israel, are not mentioned above, but only the kings of Judah. For indeed, the ten tribes had been taken into captivity by the Assyrians under King Hezekiah, the father of Manasseh (2 Kings 17). This is in the prologue and in the title of the book of Zephaniah, concerning the generation and time. Now let us see what the prophecy itself contains.
