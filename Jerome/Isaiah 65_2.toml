(Verse 2) I have stretched out my hands all day long to an unbelieving people, who walk in a way that is not good, following their own thoughts. LXX: I have stretched out my hands all day long to an unbelieving and contradicting people, who have not walked in the good way but after their own sins. This, which is said above, 'I appeared to those who did not ask for me; I was found by those who did not seek me,' the Apostle Paul, writing to the Romans, after he had explained concerning the role of the Gentiles, added: But to Israel he says, 'I have stretched out my hands to an unbelieving and contradicting people' (Rom. 10:21), who, though overcome by the Lord's blessings and witnessing signs beyond human capability, said, 'This man does not cast out demons, except by Beelzebub, the prince of demons' (Luke 11:15). And again: You are a Samaritan and have a demon (John 8:48). And again: Though you are only a man, you make yourself out to be God (John 10:33). And elsewhere: This man is not from God, for he does not keep the Sabbath (John 9:10). And many other things that would take too long to tell. Finally, when he stretched out his hands to the unbelieving people from the cross and said, 'Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing' (Luke 23:34), those nearby said, 'Bah!' He who destroys the Temple, and in three days builds it up again: let him come down now from the cross, and we will believe him. He saved others, himself he cannot save. (Matt. XXVII, 40) . And Simeon, taking the child in his arms, prophesied about him: Behold, this child is set for the fall and rising again of many in Israel, and for a sign which shall be spoken against. (Luke II, 34) . In Rome, the Jews speak to Paul: We have heard of this sect, that everywhere it is spoken against. (Acts XXVIII, 41) . We can extend our hands and receive in the generosity of the giver, because he denies nothing to those who ask: but immediately restores health to the leper when he asks (Matth. VIII): and receives eyes to the blind man from birth (John. IX): and the hungry, apart from children and women, were satisfied with thousands of people in the desert (Matth. XIV). They signify extended hands and the mercy of a parent who eagerly receives their children into their embrace. Those who walked in the wrong way and followed their own thoughts. To them the Lord speaks through the Prophet: Turn your foot away from the rough path (Prov. IV, 27). For they loved strangers and, like a prostitute, said: I will go after my lovers (Hos. II, 5). And leaving the good way, which is said in the Gospel: I am the way (John XIV, 6), they walked along the wide and spacious road that leads to death, and followed their own thoughts, which the Prophet, avoiding, implores the Lord: Cleanse me from my hidden sins, O Lord, and spare your servant from strangers. If the dominion had not dominated me, then I will be blameless (Ps. XVIII, 13, 14). And the Apostle teaches that those who did not have knowledge of God should be handed over to a reprobate mind and evil works, so that they do things that do not befit them (Rom. I). But let us, the Psalmist, say with our voice: Lead me in the right way (Ps. CXXXVIII, 24).
