"A time
for weeping and a time for laughter." Now is the time for weeping and in the
future it will be the time for laughter: for "the blessed weep, since they
themselves will laugh." [Luc. 6, 21.] "A time for bewailing and a time for
dancing. "For this reason they
are seized in the Gospel, those to whom God says " I have lamented for you
and you have not moaned; I sang and you did not dance." [Luc. 7, 32.] We must moan at present so that afterwards we
can dance that dance, which David danced before the arc of the covenant [Cfr II Reg. 6, 14.],
and displeasing to the daughter of Saul he was more pleasing to God.
