(Verse 23) But He answering, said: He that dippeth his hand with me in the dish, he shall betray me. Oh, the wondrous patience of the Lord! He had said first: one of you shall betray me. The traitor persists in evil, making it more evident, yet without clearly indicating his name. With the others saddened, holding back their hands, and denying the food to his mouth, with audacity and impudence, by which he was to betray, he even sends his hand into the dish with the master, in order to falsely testify to a clear conscience.
