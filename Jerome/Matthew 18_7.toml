(Verse 7) Woe to the world because of scandals. For it is necessary that scandals come, but woe to the man through whom the scandal comes.

Not that it is necessary for scandals to come, otherwise those who cause scandal would be without guilt, but since it is necessary for scandals to occur in this world, everyone is exposed to scandal due to their own fault. At the same time, Judas, who had prepared his mind for betrayal, is struck by a general consensus.
