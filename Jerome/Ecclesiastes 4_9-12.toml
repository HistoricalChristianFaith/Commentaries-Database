"Two are
better than one, for they get a greater return for their labour. For should they fall, one can raise the
other; but woe to him who is alone when he falls and there is no one to raise
him! Also, if two sleep together they keep warm, but how can one be warm
alone? Where one can be overpowered, two
can resist attack; A three-ply cord is not easily severed!" 
After the misfortunes of loneliness in which he has been seized, and he
who torments himself in acquiring wealth without a definite heir, now the
subject of companionship is treated. And
it asks what good ther is in a tent of friends and what comfort there is in
company, since one man's distress or domestic strife is lifted by another's
help, (any man who has a faithful friend will sleep better all that night, than
he who sleeps only with his wealth which he has amassed. And if a stronger enemy rises up against one
man, the weakness of one is sustained by the comfort of friends. And just as two differ from one if they are
joined in love, so the tent of three is stronger. For even true charity, which has been
violated by no envy increases as much in number as it grows in strength. And this idea is conveyed in relatively few
words. But since previously we have
placed the discussion of the intelligence of certain men before Christ, those
things which are still left must be discussed by the same order. It is better for two to be equal, than
one. For it is better for a man who
lives alone to have Christ, than alone to leave himself vulnerable to
ill-intentioned plots. Since the reward
of the tent is shown at once in the very usefulness of society. For if one man fell, Christ would raise up
his partner. Woe indeed to him who
collapses, he will not have Christ rising up in him. For if one sleeps, that is, if he had been
dissolved by death and had Christ with him, he will revive more quickly having
been made warm and given life once again. 
And if the devil, being stronger in his attack, should attack a man, the
man will stand, and Christ will stand in place of this man, in place of his
companion. Not because virtue is weak
(the virtue of Christ alone) against the devil, but because the decision of man
is left free and for us, who are dependent, but virtue itself will become
stronger through fighting. And even if
the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit should come, that friendship is
not broken easily. But although it is
not broken easily, it will be broken nonetheless at some point. And the cord from the apostle to Judas was
threefold: but after the breaking of the bread Satan entered him and that cord
was broken. More precisely what he says
above is, "and even if two are sleeping, then they will be warm: and how
will one keep warm on his own?" We
can take an example from Elisha, because he is in a pact with a lad, and slept
with him and warmed his body, and in this way revived the recovering boy. [Cfr IV Reg. 4, 32-36.] Unless therefore Christ sleeps with us and rests
in death, we are not able to receive the heart of eternal life.
