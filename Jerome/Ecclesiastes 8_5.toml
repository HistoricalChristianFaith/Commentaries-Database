"He who
obeys the commandment will know no evil; and a wise man will know time and
justice. "Notice here in particular that 'he will know
no evil' has been written instead of 'he will not suffer' or even 'evil will
not be in him'. Likewise it has also
been written about the Saviour, "for he has made him to be sin for us, who
knew no sin." [II Cor. 5, 21.] Instead of 'evil' too Symmachus interprets
this phrase as saying, "he who keeps the commandment will experience no
wickedness". But he teaches that we
should keep the command of a king, and know why and when he orders.
