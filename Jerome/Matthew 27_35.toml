(Verse 35.) And when they had crucified him, they divided his garments, casting lots, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying: They divided my garments among themselves, and upon my vesture they cast lots. And this was prophesied in the same psalm: They divided my garments among themselves, and upon my vesture they cast lots (Psalm 22:18).
