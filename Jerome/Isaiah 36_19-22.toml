(Verse 19 and following) Where is the God of Hamath and Arpad? Where is the God of Sepharvaim? Have they delivered Samaria from my hand? Who among all the gods of these lands has delivered their land from my hand, that the Lord should deliver Jerusalem from my hand? But they were silent and did not answer him a word. For the king had commanded, 'Do not answer him.' This shows that all these gods have served Samaria, and that is why it has been captured. But, he said, if we easily overcame ten tribes with such great gods presiding over them, how much more easily will we conquer you, or rather Jerusalem alone, with one God as our ruler? And all the people remained silent and did not answer him anything. For they had received a command from the king not to answer him. Truly, Ezechias is just, doing everything faithfully and with wisdom. Therefore, he had ordered them not to answer the Assyrian blasphemer, so as not to provoke him to greater blasphemies. Where it is written: Do not kindle the coals of a sinner (Ecclesiastes 8:13); and in the psalm we read: When the sinner rose up against me, I was silent and humbled myself, and I kept silent about the good things (Psalm 38:23); and again: Set, O Lord, a guard at my mouth, and a fortified gate at my lips: do not incline my heart to the words of evil (Psalm 140:3).
