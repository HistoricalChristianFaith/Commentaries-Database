(Chapter 40, Verse 1) After these words, the chief of the king of Egypt's wine cellar sinned. Where we have placed 'chief of the wine cellar' in Hebrew it is written 'Masec', that word which we have recently read in the name of Abraham's servant, whom we can call the cupbearer according to the custom of the common people. Nor should this office be considered lowly, since it is of the utmost dignity even among barbarian kings to offer a cup to the king: Indeed, poets have written about Ganymede and Jove, that he entrusted his beloved to this very duty.
