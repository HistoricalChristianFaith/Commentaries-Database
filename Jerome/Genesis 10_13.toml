(Verse 13) And Mesraim fathered Ludim, and Anamim, and Laabim, and Nephtuim, and Phetrosim, and Chasloim, from whom came the Philistines and the Caphtorim. Except for the Laabim, who were later called Libyans, and the Chasloim, who were later called Philistines, whom we incorrectly call Palestinians, the other six nations are unknown to us, for they were destroyed in the Ethiopian war and their names have been forgotten. But they possessed the land from Gaza to the furthest boundaries of Egypt.
