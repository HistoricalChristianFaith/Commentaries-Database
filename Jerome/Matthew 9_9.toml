Out of respect and deference, the other Evangelists were unwilling to call him by the common name of Matthew but said Levi. So Matthew went by a double name in accordance with what Solomon noted: “An accuser is righteous at the beginning of his words.” And in another place: “Tell your sins, and you will be justified.” Matthew also calls himself a publican to show his readers that no one must despair of salvation if he has changed for the better, for he was suddenly changed from a publican to an apostle.

(Verse 9) And as Jesus passed on from there, he saw a man sitting at the tax booth, named Matthew. And he said to him, 'Follow me.' And he rose and followed him. The other evangelists, out of respect and honor for Matthew, did not want to use his name openly, but they said, 'Levi,' for he had two names. But Matthew himself, according to what is commanded by Solomon (or rather, it is said), 'The righteous is an accuser of himself at the beginning of his speech' (Proverbs 18:17). And in another place: Confess your sins, that you may be justified (Isaiah 43:26). Matthew calls himself and the tax collector, in order to show to the readers that no one should despair of salvation if they have turned to better things; since he himself was suddenly changed from a tax collector to an apostle. Porphyry and Julian the Emperor argue in this place, either the incompetence of the lying historian, or the foolishness of those who immediately followed the Savior, as if they irrationally followed anyone who called them, when there were so many virtues and signs that the Apostles had seen before they believed. Certainly, that very brilliance and majesty of hidden divinity, which also shone forth in a human face, was able to draw those who saw it for the first time to itself by its appearance. For if this power is said to exist in a magnet and amber, so that they attract rings, straws, and stalks to themselves, how much more could the Lord of all creatures draw to himself those whom he wished?
