From the lesser number of men [four thousand], less remains; from the greater number [five thousand6], more is left over. Four thousand menâ€”fewer certainly in number, but greater in faith. The one who is greater in faith eats more, and because he does, there is less left over! I wish that we, too, might eat more of the hardy bread of holy writ, so that there would be less left over for us to learn.
