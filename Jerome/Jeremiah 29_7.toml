[Daniel 4:27] "'Wherefore, O king, let my counsel meet with thy favor, and make up for thy sins by deeds of charity, and thine iniquities by showing mercy to the poor. Perhaps God will forgive thy transgressions.'" Since he had previously pronounced the sentence of God, which of course cannot be altered, how could he exhort the king to deeds of charity and acts of mercy towards the poor? This difficulty is easily solved by reference to the example of King Hezekiah, who Isaiah had said was going to die (Isaiah 38:1); and again, to the example of the Ninevites, to whom it was said: "Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be destroyed" (Jonah 3:4). And yet the sentence of God was changed in response to the prayers of Hezekiah and the city of Nineveh, not by any means because of the ineffectualness of the judgment itself but because of the conversion of those who merited pardon. Morever in Jeremiah God states that He threatens evil for the nation (Jeremiah 18:7-8), but if it does that which is good, He will alter His threats to bestow mercy. Again, He affirms that He directs His promises to the man who does good; and if the same man thereafter works evil, He says that He changes His decision, not with regard to the men themselves, but with regard to their works which have thus changed in character. For after all, God is not angered at men but at their sins; and when no sins inhere in a man, God by no means inflicts a punishment which has been commuted. In other words, let us say that Nebuchadnezzar performed deeds of mercy toward the poor in accordance with Daniel's advice, and for that reason the sentence against him was delayed of execution for twelve months. But because he afterwards while walking about in his palace at Babylon said boastingly: "Is this not the great Babylon which I myself have built up as a home for the king by the might of my power and the glory of my name?" therefore he lost the virtue of his charitableness by reason of the wickedness of his pride.

"It may be that God will forgive thy sins." In view of the fact that the blessed Daniel, foreknowing the future as he did, had doubts concerning God's decision, it is very rash on the part of those who boldly promise pardon to sinners. And yet it should be recognized that indulgence was promised to Nebuchadnezzar in return, as long as he wrought good works. Much more, then, is it promised to other men who have committed less grievous sins than he. We read in Jeremiah also of God's direction to the people of the Jews, that they should pray for the Babylonians, inasmuch as the peace of the captives was bound up with the peace of the captors themselves (Jeremiah 29:7).

He also adds, “Seek the peace of the city or the land,” “for in its peace will be your peace.” This is confirmed by the apostolic exhortation: “I urge, first of all, that intercessions, prayers, requests and thanksgivings be made for all persons, for kings and all who are in high office, that we might live a quiet and tranquil life in all reverence and chastity.” Furthermore, according to the mystical understanding, after we are expelled on account of our sins from Jerusalem, that is, the church, and delivered to Nebuchadnezzar, about whom the same apostle said “delivered to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that his spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord,” and again, “they are those whom I delivered to Satan, that they would learn not to blaspheme,” we must not be careless or idle, so as to despair inwardly of salvation, but first we must build homes—on rock, not on sand—the kind of homes that the midwives built in Exodus because they feared the Lord. Second, we must plant gardens or orchards, the kind that the Lord also planted in paradise in Eden, placing within it the tree of life, about which it is written, “The tree of life is for those who will receive it, and blessed is the one who lays hold of it.” Third, we must take wives, one of whom is wisdom, about whom Solomon wrote, “Love her, and she will keep you. Embrace her, and she will exalt you,” and, in another passage, “I sought to make her my bride, and I became enamored of her beauty.” Nor is the one spouse, wisdom, sufficient for us, unless we have the others as well: fortitude, temperance and justice, that we might generate many children with them. We also must give our daughters away to men, that the truth of the faith, which is translated into sons, might espouse good works, which refers to daughters, and good works be united to those healed by faith. And we must multiply the number of such fruitful sons and daughters, so that, destroying what is childish and growing into perfection, we may deserve to hear, “I write to you, fathers, because you know him who is from the beginning,” and may say to our children, along with the apostle, “I have begotten you in Christ Jesus through the gospel.” Let us furthermore seek the peace of the city and land in which our church is located, that we might deserve to return to it from whom we were transferred by the judgment of the Lord, to live in the error of “confusion.” For if the church will receive us, we will have peace. The mercy of the Lord must also be taken into account, who commanded us to pray for our enemies and to do good to those who persecute us, that we would not be content with our salvation alone but would also seek the salvation of our enemies.
