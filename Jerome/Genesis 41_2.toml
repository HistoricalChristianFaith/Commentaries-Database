(Chapter 41, Verse 2) And behold, seven cows were coming up from the river, attractive to look at, well-fed and well-built, and they were grazing in the meadow. In Genesis it is written as Achi (Ἄχα), which is neither a Greek nor Latin word. Even in Hebrew it is corrupted: it is said to be Ahu (אָחוּ), which means 'in the marsh'. But because the Hebrew letters Vau and Yod are similar and only differ in size, the Seventy Interpreters translated Ahu as Achi and, according to their custom of expressing double aspiration, they joined the Hebrew letter Heth with the Greek letter Chi (χ).
