(Verse 8.) Who ever thought about this regarding Tyre, once crowned? Again, read Ezekiel (Ezek. XXVII), and you will learn of the great glory of Tyre from the lamentation of its prince. He calls it crowned because just as a king raises his head adorned with a diadem among a great multitude of people, so Tyre, shining and rich in wealth, adorned with gold and gems, silk and purple, was considered a queen among all nations.


Whose merchants were the principal ones, and his attendants were distinguished in the land. We marvel at the envoy of Pyrrhus who once said of the city of Rome, I have seen a city of kings. Behold, long before those times, the merchants and attendants of Tyre, the principal and distinguished ones, are described in such a way as to demonstrate the greatness of wealth, since a Tyrian merchant could be called a king in the words of another.
