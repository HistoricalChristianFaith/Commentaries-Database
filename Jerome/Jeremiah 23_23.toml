He was fully conscious of his own wound and the power of him from whom nothing can be hidden, who says through the prophet, “I am a God near at hand and not a God afar off.” For nobody can escape the notice of him who fills heaven and earth, and nobody can conceal from him the secrets of his heart. - "Against the Pelagians 2.27"
