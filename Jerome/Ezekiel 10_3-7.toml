(Verses 3 and following) And he entered in my sight. But the cherubim stood at the right side of the house, when the man entered, and the cloud filled the inner courtyard. And the glory of the Lord was lifted up from the cherub to the threshold of the house, and the house was filled with the cloud, and the courtyard was filled with the splendor of the glory of the Lord. And the sound of the wings of the cherubim was heard up to the outer courtyard, like the voice of God Almighty speaking. And when he commanded the man who was dressed in linen, saying: Take fire from the middle of the wheels, which are between the cherubim: he entered and stood beside the wheel. And the cherub stretched forth his hand from the midst of the cherubim to the fire that was between the cherubim, and took and put it into the hands of him that was clothed with linen: who took it and went out. And there appeared in the cherubim the likeness of a hand of a man under their wings. Then the prophet, seeing the vision, approached the man who was clothed in a long linen garment or tunic. And according to the Septuagint now they change the interpretation, the holy vestment, when among the Hebrews it is called Baddim, and the other interpreters persist in the translation they have begun. However, as it is said in the second part, he entered into the midst of the wheels, which are beneath the Cherubim, to fill his hands with burning coals. When he had entered, he stood only next to the wheel, either out of sadness for the punishment of Jerusalem, or out of astonishment at the greatness of glory, he himself did not put his hand into the fire, but one of the Cherubim, that is, the Cherub, put his hand into the fire and took the fire, which was in the midst of the Cherubim, and gave it into the hand of the one who was clothed in linen garments. The one receiving went out; and yet Scripture does not say what he did, so that it would leave the narration of the sad event to our understanding rather than subjecting it to our eyes. But when the man entered, who was dressed in linen garments, the Cherubim stood on the right side of the house, so that they seemed to hold the right part of the house of God, as holy and heavenly powers, and those who are sent for punishment, of whom it is written: 'He sent upon them the heat of his anger, fury and indignation and trouble, a sending of evil angels.' (Psalm 78:49), may be believed to possess the left parts. And when the glory of the Lord was lifted up from the cherub, who was about to deliver coals of fire to the man; and it passed over to the threshold of the house, immediately the cloud, darkness, and gloom fill the inner courtyard. For in the presence of the majesty of the Lord, no punishments are carried out, and the glory of the Lord is seen in the courtyard, of which it is written: The sound of the wings of the cherubim was heard as far as the outer courtyard. For the Hebrew word for sound is used instead of the Latin word voice: and this sound had a resemblance to the voice of God Almighty speaking. Why they translated it as seventy: as the voice of God Saddai (); which Aquila, Symmachus, and Theodotio translated as suitable, which signifies strong and powerful. Note, reader, in which they agree, and in which they differ, so that from the comparison of both, without our admonition, you may understand the divine sacraments, and that which I mentioned before, that both in the firmament and on the throne, and in the hand of man, it is not called untruth but resemblance. For now we see in a mirror, dimly, but then face to face. Now I know in part, but then I shall know just as I also am known. (I Corinthians 13)
