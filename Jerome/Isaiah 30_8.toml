(Verse 8.) Now, write for them on a tablet. Carefully inscribe it in the book: and it shall be a testimony until the last day. The Hebrews say that in the Prophets there is one spirit, and all times are connected before the Lord. Jeremiah commands, and it is God's command, that he writes on a tablet when entering Egypt, which is made of imperishable wood. Or, as Symmachus translates, on a wide board. But to the Jews, without a doubt: and he had explained it carefully in the book, so that there is no difficulty in reading it, so that when the prophecy is fulfilled, they will then understand that the speech of the prophets was true. We will quickly run through the obvious points, so that we can dwell on the more obscure ones.
