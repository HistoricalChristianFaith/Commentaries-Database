(Verse 19, 20.) Again I say to you: if two of you agree on earth about anything they ask, it will be done for them by my Father in heaven. For where two or three are gathered in my name, there am I among them. The above discourse has encouraged us towards harmony. Therefore, it promises a reward so that we may hasten eagerly towards peace, as it says that it will be present among two or three. Similar to the example of a tyrant, who wanted to prove that he had captured two friends (when one returned to see his mother and gave his friend as a surety for himself), so he wanted to test one, and release the other. And when he returned on the appointed day, marveling at the faith of both, he asked that they have a third. We can also understand this spiritually, that where the spirit and soul and body agree and do not have war between themselves of different desires (or pleasures); with the flesh desiring against the spirit, and the spirit against the flesh, they obtain from the Father whatever they seek about any thing. And there is no doubt that the request of good things is certain, where the body wants to have those things which the spirit wants.
