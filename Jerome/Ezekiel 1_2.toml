(Verse 2) While I was among the captives by the river Chebar, the heavens were opened, and I saw visions of God in the fifth month: it was the fifth year of the exile of King Joachin. As the captive people sat by the rivers of Babylon, David prophesied in the spirit: By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down and wept (Psalm 137). Now, Chebar, either it is the name of the river, or certainly, according to its interpretation, which is translated as "grave," it signifies the Tigris and Euphrates, as well as all the great and weighty rivers that are said to be in the land of the Chaldeans. And understand that the heavens are open not by the division of the firmament, but by the faith of the believer, because the celestial mysteries are revealed to them. Hence, in the baptism of the Savior, when the Holy Spirit descended upon him in the form of a dove, we read of the heavens being opened (Matthew 3), and through their opening, the visions of God are revealed. Not just one vision, but multiple visions, as the Lord says through the Prophet: 'I will multiply visions and as a likeness, I have been made in the hands of the prophets' (Hosea 12:10). These are the visions that the entire prophecy of Ezekiel weaves together. According to the Hebrews and other interpreters, the migration is called Joachin and not captivity, as the LXX translated. For he was not captured when the city was conquered, but by his own will, he was taken to Babylon. Therefore, let the first migration be called Joachin, that is, Jechoniah: but let the second or final captivity be called Zedekiah.
