Having healed the daughter of this Chananæan, the Lord returns into Judæa, as it follows, And Jesus departed from thence, and came nigh unto the sea of Galilee.

What the Latin translator calls 'debiles' (maimed), is in the Greek χυλλοὺς which is not a general term for a maimed person, but a peculiar species, as he that is lame in one foot is called 'claudus,' so he that is crippled in one hand is called χυλλός.

He said nothing concerning the maimed, because there was no one word which was the opposite of thisa.

He goes up into the mountain, that as a bird He may entice the tender nestlings to fly.
