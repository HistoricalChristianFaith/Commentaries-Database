(Vers. 8, 9.) Their burnt offerings and their sacrifices will please me on my altar: for my house will be called a house of prayer for all peoples, says the Lord God, who gathers the dispersed of Israel: I will still gather together those who have been gathered to him: All the beasts of the field, come to devour, all the beasts of the forest. LXX: Their burnt offerings and sacrifices will be acceptable on my altar. For my house will be called a house of prayer for all nations, says the Lord, who gathers the dispersed of Israel: for I will gather a congregation to him. All wild animals, come, eat, all wild animals of the forest. We learn more fully about the difference between sacrifices and burnt offerings in Leviticus. Burnt offerings are those that are completely burned on the altar. The victims and offerings, of which part is offered on the altar, part is handed over to the priests. Therefore, it should not be believed that the offerings of foreigners and eunuchs are required in the Jewish rite. But we must know that eunuchs offer burnt offerings, those who consecrate themselves fully to God; while foreigners offer victims, who are temporarily dedicated to prayer, of whom God speaks: The sacrifice of praise has glorified (alternatively, will glorify) me; and in another place: Offer to God the sacrifice of praise (Psalm 49:14). Concerning these victims and burnt offerings, the Lord speaks through Hosea: 'I desire mercy and not sacrifice; the knowledge of God rather than burnt offerings, which are offered on the altar of the Lord' (Hosea 6:6). This is testified by John in the Apocalypse, when he saw souls of martyrs under the altar (Apocalypse 6). From this, one of the Seraphim took a coal with tongs and brought it to Isaiah to cleanse his lips (Isaiah 6:6). This is the altar and the tabernacle, to which all things made in Exodus refer, on which spiritual offerings were presented to God (Exodus 38). Furthermore, concerning bodily sacrifices and burnt offerings, God also testifies the same thing: 'Why do I need the multitude of your victims?' says the Lord. I am full of burnt offerings of rams and the fat of lambs, and I do not desire the blood of bulls and goats. For my house shall be called a house of prayer for all nations. Not for one nation of Judah, nor for one place of Jerusalem and the city, but for the whole world: not of bulls and goats and rams, but of prayer. By the testimony, the Lord denounced those who were selling the gifts of the Holy Spirit under the name of doves in the Temple, and sitting in the seats of pestilence, and having the tables of money-changers (Matthew 21 and John 2), doing all things for the sake of shameful profit, not knowing what is written: 'You have received freely, give freely' (Matthew 10:8). But the Lord promised that these things would come to pass, he who gathers the scattered Israel. To whom also Peter the Apostle writes an Epistle, concerning whom the Evangelist speaks: 'But this he said not of himself: but being the high priest of that year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for the nation. And not only for the nation, but to gather together in one the children of God, that were dispersed' (John 11:51-52), and that what was said might be fulfilled: 'A congregation of people shall surround thee: and for this cause return thou on high' (Psalm 7:8). But when the remains of Israel were gathered together by the Apostles, and the flock, who had been previously scattered, were united into one, all the beasts are provoked to come and devour Israel, that is, those who refused to believe, of whom the Apostle says: For their end will come upon them (Philippians 3). And the Lord in the Gospel: But when you see Jerusalem surrounded by an army, then know that its desolation has come (Luke 21:20). Or it must be said, that they are given over to beasts to devour, whom the Prophet detests, saying: Do not hand over to beasts the souls professing to You (Ps. 73,19): concerning these tropological beasts, which have devoured a certain part of the Lord, and we read above (In Ch. IX), Syria from the rising sun, and the Greeks from the West, who devour Israel with all their mouth. And in Jeremiah: Israel, the wandering sheep, the lions have driven her away: the first king of Assyria devoured her, and the last king of Babylon will crush her bones (Jeremiah. 50, 17). This can also be said, that when the people of Israel, full of rage, first provoked the nations to faith, so that they would come to the Church and eat the heavenly bread, and be satisfied with the flesh of the Lamb, which killed many from the army of Abessalon, in the deserted forests.
