quote='''
(Verse 35) In this way, my heavenly Father will also do to you, unless each one of you forgives his brother from your heart. This is a frightening statement, if the divine judgment is turned and changed according to our own judgment. If we do not forgive our brothers for small offenses, God will not forgive us for great offenses. And because each one can say: I have nothing against him, he knows: he has God as judge, I do not care what he wants to do, I have forgiven him; he confirms his own judgment and destroys all pretense of false peace, saying: Unless each one of you forgives his brother from your heart.
