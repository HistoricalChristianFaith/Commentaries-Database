Spiritually we may say; When they shall persecute you in one book or one passage of Scripture, let us flee to other volumes, for however contentious the adversary may be, protection will come from the Saviour before the victory is yielded to the enemy.

Beelzebub is the idol of Accaron who is called in the book of Kings, the God of flies; 'Bel,' signifying idol; (2 Kings 1:3.) 'zebub,' a fly. The Prince of the d√¶mons He calls by the name of the foulest of idols, which is so called because of the uncleanness of the fly, which destroys the sweetness of ointment.
