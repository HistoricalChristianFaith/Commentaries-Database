(Verse 16.) But Jesus said to them: Of course. Have you never read that from the mouths of infants and nursing babies you have perfected praise? How moderate is this statement, and how balanced is the response, not giving in to slander? He did not say what the Scribes wanted to hear, that children do good, to testify to me, nor did he say they are mistaken: they are children, you should forgive their age; but he brings forward an example from the eighth psalm, to strengthen the testimony of the Scriptures through the words of children, when the Lord is silent.
