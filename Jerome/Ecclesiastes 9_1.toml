"For all
this I noted and I sought to ascertain all this: that the righteous and the
wise together with their actions are in the Hand of God; whether love or hate
man does not know; all preceded them. "Symmachus also interprets this more clearly,
saying: I kept all these things in my heart so that I could expound all things,
since the righteous and the wise, along with their works are in the hand of
God. And besides neither friendship, nor
hatred is known to man; yet all things are not certainin their presence, because
they happen similar to all, both to the righteous and to the wicked alike. More precisely the meaning is this: I
dedicated my heart even to this and wanted to know whom it is that God loves,
and whom He hates. And I found too that
even the work of the righteous is in the hand of God, but though, whether they
are loved by God or not, now they know it cannot be and they remain undecided
as to whether they should keep on doing what they are doing until it is
approved, or pray. In the future
therefore they will know and all will be on their faces, that is 'will precede
them' when they leave this life. 
Knowledge of that matter then will come to them, since then is the
judgement, but now the struggle. And
whosoever remains confused as to whether they should keep on through the love
of God, as Job, or through hate, as several sinners, will not be able to know
for certain.
