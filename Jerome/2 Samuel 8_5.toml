In the second book of Kings [Samuel], where David defeated the Moabites, Scripture records the measuring out of two separate lines for life and two for death. The significance of setting aside some Moabites for life and others for death is made clear by the story of Orpah and Ruth. Orpah, who turned back to idolatry and her ancient country, was destined for death; Ruth, following her mother-in-law, whose name means “pleasant,” says, “Your people shall be my people, and your God my God.” - "Homilies on the Psalms, Alternate Series 61 (Ps 15)"
