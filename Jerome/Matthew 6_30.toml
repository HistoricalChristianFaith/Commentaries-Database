For, in sooth, what regal purple, what silk, what web of divers colours from the loom, may vie with flowers? What work of man has the red blush of the rose? The pure white of the lily? How the Tyrian dye yields to the violet, sight alone and not words can express.
Tomorrow in Scripture is put for time future in general. Jacob says, “So shall my righteousness answer for me tomorrow.”
