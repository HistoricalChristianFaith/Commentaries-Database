(Verse 18 and following) And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: And you, son of man, set before yourself two ways, and let the sword of the king of Babylon come. From one land they will both go out, and by hand he will take a decision: he will cast lots at the head of the city's road. You shall set a road, so that the sword may come to Rabbah of the sons of Ammon, and to Judah, and to Jerusalem, the fortified. For the king of Babylon stood at the crossroads, at the head of the two roads, seeking divination, mixing arrows. He questioned the idols, consulted the entrails. To his right, a divination was made concerning Jerusalem, to set up battering rams, to open the mouth in slaughter, to raise the voice in lamentation, to set up battering rams against the gates, to heap up a siege mound, to build fortifications. And it will be as if he is consulting in vain their oracle, imitating the rest of the sabbath, but he himself will remember the iniquity in order to capture it. Therefore, thus says the Lord God: Because you have brought your iniquities to memory and have revealed your transgressions, and your sins have appeared in all your thoughts; because of this, I say, you will be taken captive by the hand. I know that in this place, according to the Septuagint interpreters, I have read the diverse exposition of a certain law, Rabbath of the sons of Ammon, referring to the Gentile people. But to Judah and Jerusalem, to those who gather under the name of Christ, and to those who give dignity to his name, the king of confusion, the devil, stands at the head of every road and lies in wait in secret. And he fulfills that verse: 'They have placed a stumbling block in my path' (Ps. 139). And he stands at the crossroads, desiring to hold onto those who are his, or to acquire new servitude for himself. And he always goes to the right, namely, to those who are situated on the right side, in order to conquer them, to exult in their destruction, to take miserable Jerusalem by force and by the gathering of earthly works. And first of all, so that it seems that he is doing nothing, and striving in vain. But by recalling their iniquities, those who dwell in the Church, indeed even bring to mind the opposing powers with their evil works, they bring to light all the sins of the people and their thoughts, and for this reason they are captured, because they have heaped up old crimes with new ones. Another person may have said this: the truth of the history begun by us must be pursued. When, he said, the divine word had spoken to me: Prophesy, son of man, and speak to the sword and say: Sword, sword, and the rest that the prophecy of the sword contains; a second time the word of the Lord came to me, saying: Do you want, son of man, to know who this sword is, and to learn more clearly the person of the raging sword? Listen to what I say: set up two roads, so that through them the sword of the king of Babylon may come, who will indeed go by one route of the Chaldeans, but when he comes through the desert and wilderness to the crossroads of the land of Arabia, which is called the sons of Ammon, one road leads to Jerusalem on the right side, but the left leads to Rabbath of the sons of Ammon, which is the capital city and is now called Philadelphia: remember, he says, the annihilation that happened to the Assyrian king when 185,000 were killed in one night, he will fear to turn to the right and go against the heavily fortified Jerusalem; but he will stand at that junction, and according to the customs of his people, he will consult the oracle, to send his arrows into the quiver, and mix them, or label them with the names of each, to see whose arrow comes out, and which city he should besiege first. Now the Greeks call this kind of divination belomancy, or rhabdomancy. Therefore, he consulted the idols and examined the entrails. The divination pointed to his right, indicating that he should march against Jerusalem, besiege it, build ramparts, set up battering rams, construct fortifications, surround the city, open his mouth for slaughter, and stir up the roaring and howling of his exultant army. By doing this, he said, he would appear to the inhabitants of Jerusalem to consult an oracle in vain and, like someone spending his time on Sabbath leisure, to engage in play and accomplish nothing. But the king of Babylon, not relying on his own strength, but on the wickedness of the people, which he knows has offended God, and has added sins of the fathers to new offenses, and all their transgressions have been revealed; and for this reason he will not hesitate in victory, because he trusts in the wickedness of Jerusalem. These things, according to the Hebrew, from which the Septuagint diverge in many places not so much in meaning as in words.
