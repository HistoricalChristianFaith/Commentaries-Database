[Ezekiel] is not carried away by the greatness of the visions, but he falls on his own face through knowing the fragility of the human being.

(Chapter 2, Verse 1) And I saw, and fell on my face, and heard the voice of the one speaking. The greatness of the visions did not lift me up, but the awareness of human frailty caused me to fall on my face. Therefore, even the Apostle Paul, after the ascent to heaven and paradise, and the hearing of ineffable words, says that a messenger of Satan was given to him, who would buffet him so that he would not be exalted (1 Corinthians 12). And Abraham fell on his face after hearing the words of God. And yet, because he had fallen not through sin, but through humility, he is lifted up by the Lord, and he is commanded to hear His words (Gen. 17). It must also be known that to fall on one's face is one thing, and to fall backwards is another. Abraham, after he heard of the birth of Isaac, fell on his face and laughed (1 Sam. 4). But Eli, who had sinned, fell backwards. And it is written about Dan in Genesis: Let Dan be a serpent in the way, biting the horse's heel, and let the horseman fall backwards, waiting for the salvation of God (Gen. 49:17-18). For because he had fallen from the horse by the snake's bite, therefore he awaits the coming of the Savior. And in the Gospel according to John, those who had come to apprehend the Lord, after he answered: I am, fell backward to the ground (John XVIII, 6); his words, who had said to Moses: Go, tell the children of Israel: The One who is, has sent me to you (Exodus III, 14), they could not bear.

And he said to me: Son of man, stand on your feet, and I will speak to you ((Vulg. with you)). He could not hear the word of God while lying down, but he hears with Moses: But you stand here with me (Exodus XXXIV, 2). Which Daniel also recounts happening to him (Daniel X).
