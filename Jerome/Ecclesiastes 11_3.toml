"If the clouds are full of rain, they empty
themselves upon the earth: and if the tree falls toward the south, or toward
the north, in the place where the tree falls, there it shall be. "Keep the commandments that have been taught to you
above so that the clouds above you will break open in rain. For wherever you have made your home and seat
for the future, whether to the east or facing the north, when you die you will
remain there. Differently: as I have
said above 'send your bread over the water and divide it to all who ask'. Since when the clouds are full they pour
their riches down on mortals, and you are as a tree: however aged you may be,
you will not live forever, but one day suddenly struck by the storm of death
like a storm of winds, there where you fall you will lie forever. The time of your end will come whether you
may be stiff and savage, or mild and merciful. 
Differently: God is addressed in the Psalms: "you are truth up to
the clouds" [Ps. 35, 6.],
and in Isaiah God warns the sinner of the vineyard, "I will command the
clouds not to rain down" [Is. 5, 6.]. Therefore the clouds are as prophets or holy
men, who have amassed many talents in their mind, so that he can rain his
teachings of doctrine down on others and say, "their speech should be
awaited just as rain, and they will pour out rain across the earth" [Deut. 32, 2.],
to which is replied, "let the earth hear the words of my mouth" [Deut. 32, 1.]. But this follows: "and if a tree falls
to the east, or to the north, in the place where it falls, there it will
remain." We can take the example of
the book of Hebrews, in which is written, "God will come to Teyma" [Heb. 3,3.],
which some interpreters have taken to mean that God will come from the south,
and when I come to think about it the south is always used in a good
context. This can be seen in Song of
Songs: "arise oh north" that is 'return' and 'go away'; "and
come O south wind" [Cant. 4, 16.]. Therefore a tree, if in this life it falls
and is cut in its state of mortality, either must sin before while it stands
and is then placed in the north afterwards, or if the south winds takes away
all its worthy fruit, it will lie wounded in the south. The text does not mean any tree, but only if
it lies to the north or south. This
means the same as that which is written: "I will say to the north wind,
come, and to the south wind, do not hold back" [Is. 43, 6.]. Nowhere teaches about the south wind and the
east wind together, saying that they blow, since it is fitting for them to be
among those regions, because they are blown afterwards to the south and
east. Therefore it blows from the north
to the south and the south wind blows its inhabitants to the east. And they are not able to blow out if they
remain in their ancient palaces.
