Because of the weakness of the sin nature, Paul says, the law cannot be fulfilled. Hence the Jews keep the commands and traditions of the elders rather than Godâ€™s commands, performing neither the whole body of the law (which is impossible) nor the spirit of the law, which they did not understand. .
