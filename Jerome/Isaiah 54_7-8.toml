It is clear that in no way is this said to Jerusalem, which never ruled over the whole world, but to the church of Christ whose inheritance is the whole world.The Lord left [the church] for a brief moment, momentarily hiding his face; then he took it up in his everlasting mercy and changed its former sadness into joy. This is how it is said in the Hebrew. Yet according to the Septuagint it says that [the church] is not like an abandoned and fainthearted woman summoned by God and is not like a wife despised from her youth, and accordingly he had left her and turned away from her only for a brief period, that he might take pity on her in eternity. If the Jews and those of a Judaizing tendency among us say that here is Israel abandoned for a brief period and that God takes pity on her in the coming of the Messiah, and understand a brief period in comparison with the whole eternity, why do they not allow us to say that the brief period is the time for which the nations were abandoned, who were rejected of God during adolescence, but who later in old age pursued his eternal mercy, especially when in the calling of the time of Israel the crowd of Gentiles were never shut out, but a door of returning was opened to them as proselytes? It appears we are excluded from their calling only for a short time, if by their eternal exclusion we are allowed a return to God. For we have spoken of an eternal exclusion if they do not act penitently.… The sinful soul was rejected by God, not because of God’s hatred, but because of his timing, so that, weighed down with a load of evils she might return to her former husband and not despair of having lost the substance of the father’s kindness.
