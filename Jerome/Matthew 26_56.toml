(Verse 56.) But all this has happened so that the Scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples, leaving him, fled. What are the Scriptures of the prophets? They have pierced my hands and feet (Psalm 22:17); and elsewhere: He was led as a sheep to the slaughter (Isaiah 53:7). And in another place: He was led to death because of the iniquities of my people (Ibid., sec. 70).
