Like an eagle, the Lord spreads his wings over us, his nestlings. There the Lord is compared with the eagle guarding its young. The simile therefore is appropriate that God protects us as a father and as a hen guarding her chicks lest they be snatched away by a hawk. Nevertheless a different interpretation is also permissible. “With his pinions he will cover you”: he will be lifted up on the cross; he will stretch forth his hands to shelter us. “And under his wings you shall take refuge.”

The song in Deuteronomy says that he bore the people of Israel upon his shoulders and like the eagle guarded them. This same versicle may be interpreted also of the Savior because on the cross he gave us the shelter of his wings. “Under his wings you shall take refuge.” “All the day long I stretched out my hand to a people unbelieving and contradicting.” The hands of the Lord lifted up to heaven were not begging for help but were sheltering us, his miserable creatures.
