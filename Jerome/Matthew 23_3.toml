He is tempted by the Pharisees and surrounded by their lies. According to the psalmist, “The arrows of children are their snares.” Nevertheless, on account of the dignity of the priests and their reputation, he encourages the people to obey them, considering not their works but their teaching. What he says is this: “The scribes and Pharisees sit upon the throne of Moses,” showing this as a throne of teaching about the law. And we ought to accept this because of what is said in the psalms: “He does not sit in the seat of scoffers” and “He overturned the seats of those who sold pigeons.”
