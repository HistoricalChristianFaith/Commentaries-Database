(Chapter 26) And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the first month, on the first day of the month, the word of the Lord came to me, saying: Son of man, because Tyre (or Sidon) has said of Jerusalem: Aha, the gate of the peoples is broken, it is turned to me, I shall be filled, it has become desolate; therefore thus says the Lord God: Behold, I am against you, Tyre (or Sidon), and I will bring many nations against you, as the sea brings up its waves. And they will break down the walls of Tyre, and destroy its towers, and I will sweep away its dust from it, and make it a shining rock. The drying up of the fishing nets will be in the midst of the sea, for I have spoken, says the Lord God, and it will be a plunder to the nations. Also, her daughters in the field will be killed by the sword, and they will know that I am the Lord. Accordingly, the order of prophecies is woven together. He spoke against the sons of Ammon and Moab and Seir, who are also Edomites, and against the Philistines who are on the coast, and who hold the same boundary on the shore of the sea. After the Philistines, the region of Phoenicia follows, whose metropolis is the city of Tyre, which is called Sor in Hebrew and Syriac. And because Jerusalem was captured, it also rejoiced and insulted, saying: The gates of the peoples are broken, I have the safest harbor, and when they are destroyed, all the multitude turns to me, which was ruled by its authority, and because it is deserted, therefore I will be filled, and whatever was full before will be turned into a wilderness. Therefore, because you have spoken these things and insulted the ruins of Jerusalem, which was destroyed by the judgement of God because of its sins, I will not come against you through messengers or through anyone else, but I myself will be against you, Tyre, and I will cause the Babylonians to rise up like the waves of the sea against you, along with many nations, with which the walls and towers of your city will be destroyed to the point where they will fall to the ground and its dust will be scraped off or blown in various directions, and it will be humiliated to the point where it will be compared to the shiniest rocks. And there will be such great desolation in the once most populous city that fishing nets will be spread out a For I, the Lord, have spoken, and my words cannot be made void, and I will deliver them to be plundered by the nations. Also her daughters, who are in the countryside or in the field, that is, on the coast of Phoenicia, cities and towns, villages and castles, will be killed by the sword: metaphorically, because he called them daughters, he puts the killing by the sword, so that they may know by the end of things that I am the Lord, who commanded these things to happen. According to the tropology, since the Hebrew word Sor is translated into distress, every soul that is occupied with disturbances can be called Sor, which, when she sees Jerusalem being overthrown by the judgment of God for her sins and vices, in which the temple and the vision of peace were, she exults and thinks that the once famous empire of the city is to be transferred to herself. And this is also accepted in conflicting doctrines and in worldly men, when they see a holy man fall through negligence and rejoice and exult, as if their own resurrection were the downfall of others. Therefore the Lord threatens that He Himself will fight against such men and cause many nations, like sea waves, to rise up against them, destroying in them everything that seems most fortified and strong, and thus overturning all their arguments, so that they are reduced to dust. He should also cause the nets and fishing equipment by which the multitude was previously deceived to cease, and to be spread out and dried in the deserted soil of the city, so that other fishermen may take their place, whom the Lord has sent to fish. Moreover, he should cause his daughters, who were previously kept as if in a bridal chamber and were not easily believed by anyone in mystical and more secret teachings, to go forth and be extended in public, and to be cut down with the sword of the Church, so that they may understand that He himself is the Lord, who both temporarily left Jerusalem on account of its sins and destroyed the defenses of Tyre on account of its insolence and joy.
