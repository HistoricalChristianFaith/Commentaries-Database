(Verse 28) And do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather fear him who can destroy both soul and body in hell. Truly, the soul is invisible and incorporeal, according to the denser substance of our body. And it will certainly be punished and feel torments when it receives its original body, so that it may be punished with the one with whom it sinned.

But rather fear Him who is able to destroy both soul and body in Gehenna. The name Gehenna is not found in the old books, but is first mentioned by the Savior. Let us therefore inquire what is the occasion of this statement. We have read more than once that there was an idol of Baal near Jerusalem, at the roots of Mount Moriah, where the Siloam flows. This valley and plain of small fields was irrigated and wooded, full of delights, and a grove consecrated to the idol. But the people of Israel had fallen into such great madness, that they sacrificed in the desolate vicinity of the temple, surpassing the strictness of religion with their delights, and they burned or initiated their sons into demons. And that place was called Gehenna, that is, the Valley of the Sons of Hinnom. This is written in the Book of Kings (2 Kings 23), Chronicles (2 Chronicles 28), and Jeremiah (Jeremiah 7, 19, and 32) in great detail. And God threatens that He will fill the place itself with the bodies of the dead, so that it may never be called Topheth and Baal, but may be called Polyandrium, that is, a burial mound of the dead. Therefore, the future punishments and eternal torments by which sinners are tormented are denoted by the name of this place. Moreover, we read in the book of Job (Job 24) that there are two hells, one of excessive heat and one of cold.
