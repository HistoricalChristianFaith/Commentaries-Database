(Chapter 6, Verse 1) Be careful not to practice your righteousness in front of others to be seen by them. Otherwise, you have no reward from your Father in heaven. When you give to the needy, do not announce it with trumpets, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and on the streets, to be honored by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full. But when you give to the needy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing, so that your giving may be in secret. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you. From all these things it is gathered that they are hypocrites who do anything in order to be glorified by men. It seems to me also that he who says to his brother: 'Let me remove the speck from your eye' (Matthew 7:4), does this for the sake of glory, in order to appear righteous himself. Therefore it is said to him by the Lord: 'Hypocrite, first remove the beam from your own eye.' Thus, not virtue but the motive for virtue has reward with God. If you veer slightly off the right path, it doesn't matter whether you go to the right or to the left, because you have lost the true way.
