But what is said in Hebrew, namely, that “they will seek me who previously did not inquire about me,” means that those who once had no knowledge of God later sought the Lord and came to know him by means of revelation. Indeed, the Lord revealed himself to Paul at a time when he was persecuting the church of believers. He also said to Peter the apostle: “Blessed are you, Simon bar Jonah, for flesh and blood did not reveal this to you but my Father who is in heaven.” And Moses was seeking the same thing when he said to God, “If I have found favor with you, show yourself to me openly, that I may behold you.” Anticipating the opprobrium of Christ amid the greater riches of the treasures of Egypt, Moses longed for the just rewards of things to come and contemplated the invisible God with his soul, as though he could see him.
