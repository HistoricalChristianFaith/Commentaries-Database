But what is said in Hebrew, namely, that “they will seek me who previously did not inquire about me,” means that those who once had no knowledge of God later sought the Lord and came to know him by means of revelation. Indeed, the Lord revealed himself to Paul at a time when he was persecuting the church of believers. He also said to Peter the apostle: “Blessed are you, Simon bar Jonah, for flesh and blood did not reveal this to you but my Father who is in heaven.” And Moses was seeking the same thing when he said to God, “If I have found favor with you, show yourself to me openly, that I may behold you.” Anticipating the opprobrium of Christ amid the greater riches of the treasures of Egypt, Moses longed for the just rewards of things to come and contemplated the invisible God with his soul, as though he could see him.

(Chapter 65, Verse 1) They asked me who did not ask before me: they found me, who did not seek me. I said, behold me, behold me to a nation that did not call upon my name. 70: I appeared to those who did not seek me: I was found by those who did not ask me. I said, behold me in a nation that did not invoke my name. In the mixed prayer of the people, in which he had said: Why have you made us stray, O Lord, from your way: you have hardened our hearts, so that we do not fear you (Isaiah 63:17)? He replied, as the Jews would have it, God the Father; as we maintain, the Lord and Savior: to such an extent am I not harsh and cruel, that I prefer the repentance of a sinner to their death: nor do I reject penitent children, who, however, have preserved the dignity of their own name, so that I even desire to save strangers (Ezek. XXXIII). For those who did not seek me, nor were able to say: Whom Moses wrote about in the Law and the prophets, we have found Jesus (John I, 45); I appeared to them, of whom the Prophet testifies elsewhere: Those to whom it has not been announced about him will hear; and those who have not heard, will understand (Isa. LII, 15). But you who meditate on the law of God day and night, you boast in vain of repentance, the works of which you do not perform. Hence the evangelists and apostles, desiring to confirm the coming of the Lord with testimonies from the Old Testament, said: 'That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet' (Matt. 1:22). The centurion did not seek the Lord, and he heard from the Lord: 'I have not found such great faith, not even in Israel' (Luke 7:9; Matt. 8:10). The Syrophoenician woman did not understand the words of the Prophets, but she is praised by the voice of the Lord: O woman, great is your faith. Regulus (John 4), who is called βασιλικὸς in Greek, which we can more correctly interpret as palatinum from the royal court, found not only healing for his son, but for the whole of his household. And what is said in Hebrew: Those who did not ask of me have sought me, is referred to the same meaning: that those who did not previously have knowledge of God, later seek the Lord, and come to know him through revelation: as happened to Paul when he persecuted the Church of the believers, he was revealed (Acts 9). And to the Apostle Peter, he said: Blessed are you, Simon Barjona: for flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven (Matt. XVI, 17). This was what Moses sought when he spoke to God: If I have found grace in your sight, show yourself to me manifestly, so that I may see you (Exod. XXXIII, 13). Desiring the greater riches of the treasures of Egypt, he endured the reproach of Christ, looking forward to the recompense of the future, and he contemplated the invisible God as if he could see Him with his mind. Of whom it is read in the Psalms: 'The hope of all the ends of the earth, and of those who are far away on the sea' (Psalm 64:6). And in Genesis: 'He shall be the expectation of the nations' (Genesis 49:10). And what follows: 'I said: Behold me: to a nation that did not invoke my name' (Exodus 3:14), fits that sense: 'He who is, sent me to you.' Who, being in the form of God, did not consider it robbery to be equal with God, etc. (Philippians 2); but calling all the nations of the world, he made one nation of his own name, the Christians.
