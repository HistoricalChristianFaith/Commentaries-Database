This is what we read elsewhere: “He shall save the humble in spirit.” But do not imagine that poverty is bred by necessity. For he added “in spirit” so you would understand blessedness to be humility and not poverty. “Blessed are the poor in spirit,” who on account of the Holy Spirit are poor by willing freely to be so. Hence, concerning this type of poor, the Savior also speaks through Isaiah: “The Lord has anointed me to preach good tidings to the poor.”

(Verse 3.) Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. This is what we read elsewhere: And the humble in spirit will be saved (Psalm 34:16): But lest anyone should think that poverty, which is sometimes borne out of necessity, is being preached by the Lord, he added 'in spirit,' so that you would understand it as humility, not as lack. Blessed are the poor in spirit, who are poor by choice for the sake of the Holy Spirit. Therefore, concerning such poor, the Savior also speaks through Isaiah: The Lord has annointed me; therefore, he has sent me to preach to the poor (Isaiah 61:1).
