This is what we read elsewhere: “He shall save the humble in spirit.” But do not imagine that poverty is bred by necessity. For he added “in spirit” so you would understand blessedness to be humility and not poverty. “Blessed are the poor in spirit,” who on account of the Holy Spirit are poor by willing freely to be so. Hence, concerning this type of poor, the Savior also speaks through Isaiah: “The Lord has anointed me to preach good tidings to the poor.” .

He spoke to them sitting and not standing, for they could not have understood Him had He appeared in His own Majesty.
The “poor in spirit” are those who embrace a voluntary poverty for the sake of the Holy Spirit.
