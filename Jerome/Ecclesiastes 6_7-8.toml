"All
man's toil is for his mouth, yet his wants are never satisfied. What advantage then has the wise man over the
fool? What less has the pauper who knows
how to conduct himself among the living? 
"All that men
toil at in this world is consumed by the mouth and taken to be digested in the
stomach after it has been ground down by the teeth. And when a little bit has pleased the
palette, it seems to create a desire, so long as it is held in the mouth. But when it has passed down to the stomach
the difference between foods is no longer distinguishable. And after all these things the spirit of a
man who eats is not filled up; or then he desires again what he has eaten, and
is as wise as the fool without food, who does not know how to live, and the
poor man asks for nothing else but for how he is to sustain the organs of his
meagre body, and not die through starvation. 
Or because the spirit takes no gain from the food of the body, and food
is of equal use to a wise man and a fool, and the pauper wanders therefrom, to
where he has seen wealth to be. This is
better understood regarding a man of the church, who learned in the heavenly
Scriptures, holds all his toil in his mouth yet his spirit is not filled, for
he always desires to learn. And in that
respect the wise man has more than the fool, since when he feels himself to be
poor, he presses that pauper, who is called blessed in the Gospel, to
understand those things which are of life, and walks the restricted and narrow
path, which leads to life, and he is poor from wicked deeds and knows where
Christ, (who is life) is to be found.
