For this is spoken especially to the Apostles, whom He would have not to hear only as the multitude, but to understand as having to teach others.
Or the Apostles are called Scribes instructed, as being the Saviour’s notaries who wrote His words and precepts on fleshly tables of the heart with the sacraments of the heavenly kingdom, and abounded in the wealth of ahouseholder, bringing forth out of the stores of their doctrine things new and old; whatsoever they preached in the Gospels, that they proved by the words of the Law and the Prophets. Whence the Bride speaks in the Song of Songs ;“I have kept for thee my beloved the new with the old.”
