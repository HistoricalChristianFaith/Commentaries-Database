(Verse 52.) Therefore, every learned scribe in the kingdom of heaven is like a master of a household who brings forth from his treasure new and old things. The apostles were instructed, the scribes and notaries of the Savior, who recorded his words and precepts on the tablets of the fleshly heart, in the sacraments of the heavenly kingdoms, and they possessed the wealth of the household, casting forth from their treasure new and old teachings: so that whatever they preached in the Gospel, they would confirm with the voices of the law and the prophets. Wherefore the Bride also in the Canticles saith: 'I have kept for thee my brother, both New and Old.' (Cant. VII, 13)
