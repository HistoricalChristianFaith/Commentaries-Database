Verse 36. "'And my nobles and officers sought me out and I was restored to my kingdom, and all the greater magnificence accrued to me.'" Well then, according to those who argue against the historical character of this account, all the angelic powers are going to seek out the devil again, and he will increase to such a degree of might, that the very one who formerly exalted himself against God is going to be greater than he was before his sin.
