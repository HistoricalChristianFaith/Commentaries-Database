The peacemakers (pacifici) are pronounced blessed, they namely who make peace first within their own hearts, then between brethren at variance. For what avails it to make peace between others, while in your own heart are wars of rebellious vices.

(Verse 9.) Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called the children of God. Those who first make peace in their own hearts, and then among quarreling brothers. For what good is it to reconcile others through you, when there are wars of vices in your own soul?
