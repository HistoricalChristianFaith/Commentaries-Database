(Verse 10.) Because just as thorns embrace each other, so their feast will be consumed by those who drink together, like straw full of dryness. Septuagint: Because they will be reduced to thorns down to their foundations, and will be eaten like a rolling wheel surrounded, and like straw full of dryness. The three different types that the Lord placed in the parable of the sower (Matt. 13), except for the good soil, which produces a thirtieth, sixtieth, and a hundredth, seem to me the prophet to be replying, one which falls beside the road, and another that is among the rocks, and a third that is among the thorns: which indeed the Apostle also points out about those who do not build well on the foundation of Christ (1 Cor. 3), showing that some build with wood, hay, and straw. Therefore let us carry the wood to that which is now called: Because they will be reduced to thorns even to their foundations. But the hay refers to that which follows: And it will be consumed like the wrapping around a piece of meat. Moreover, the chaff is clearly referred to the chaff, of which it is now said: And it will be like chaff full of dryness. Therefore the Lord will not twice take vengeance on the same thing, because the malice that had arisen in the authors of heresy will be consumed even to its foundation and roots. But even if someone among them seemed to have a display of words, that is, empty leaves that only please the eye, like the volvola, which is called σμίλαξ in Greek, it will be devoured and consumed into nothingness. Volvola (also called Vulvula) is a plant similar to ivy, which is usually surrounded by vines and branches, and it creeps along. Whatever also seems to have the pomp of a harvest in them, but does not have ears and grains of wheat, like straw filled with dryness, will be handed over to the fire. This is according to the Septuagint. However, according to the Hebrew, the covenants and relationships of the heretics are like thorns embracing each other, and their feast and mysteries, because they also claim to have the Lord's table, are a covenant of thorns, a feast and drink of those who eat and drink together. For when the drunkards of the vineyard of Sodom blaspheme against the creator with their ravenous mouths, is it not a feast of the senses? Yet it will be consumed by its own authors, like straw full of dryness.
