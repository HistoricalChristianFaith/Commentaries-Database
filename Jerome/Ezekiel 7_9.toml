(Verse 9.) And my eye shall not spare, neither will I have compassion: but I will lay (or give) upon you your ways, and your abominations shall be in your midst, and you shall know that I am the Lord who strikes. He subjects the causes of severity and sternness, or, as heretics think, the cruelty of God that his eye does not spare nor have compassion, saying: I will give you your ways, and your abominations shall be in your midst; so that you may feel what you have done, and seeing your abominations either before you or placed in the midst of all, you may correct your error with repentance, and turning away from your former works, when you hate what you have done, then you shall feel that he himself is the Lord (Heb. XII). He who strikes in order to correct and chastise every son whom he receives.
