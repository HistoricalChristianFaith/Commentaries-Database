"His
talk begins as foolishness and ends as evil madness. The fool prates on and on, but man does not
know what will be; and who can tell him what will be after him? "So far the discussion has been about the fool, whose
lips teach the wise man, or according to another interpretation, his lips make
himself corrupt. The beginning and the
end of his speech are foolishness and evil madness; or as Symmachus has
translated it, confusion, or some kind of inconsistency of words. For while he doesn't keep to the one opinion,
he thinks he can escape sin in the many arguments he speaks at the same
time. But he does not remember all those
who have gone before him, and does not know what will happen after him, and so
is confused in ignorance and the darkness, promising himself false knowledge;
by this he thinks that he is wise, and that he is learned, if he uses lots of
words. This can be taken to refer to the
heretics, who do not heed the words of wise men, but continue to argue
different sides so they intertwine the beginning and end of their speech in
vanity, confusion, and madness; and though they know nothing, they speak more
than they know.
