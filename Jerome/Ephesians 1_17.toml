It is this God of the incarnate man who is the Father of glory, wisdom and truth, who gives the Spirit of wisdom and revelation to those who believe in his Son so that they may become wise and contemplate the glory of the Lord with unveiled face. When this wisdom and revelation have made them wise and opened to them the mysteries that were hidden, it follows at once that they have “the eyes of their heart enlightened.”
