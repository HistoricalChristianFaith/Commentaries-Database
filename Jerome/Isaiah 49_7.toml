Theodotion translated, “To him who despises life, who is an abomination to the people, who is a servant of princes”—which clearly suits the person of Christ. For the good Shepherd gave his life for the sheep and despised it, he who was an abomination to the nation of the Jews …, one who was the servant of princes and so humble that he stood before Annas and Caiaphas and was sent to be crucified to Pilate and Herod.… The “peaceful and opportune time” and “the day of salvation” are the Savior’s passion and resurrection—when he prayed on the cross, “God, my God, why have you abandoned me?” And God kept him or formed him as death was overcome and gave him to be a covenant of the people of the Jews, or at least to those of them who believed, to waken the land that was lying in the errors of idolatry and to possess the lost or deserted inheritance that did not have God living there.
