Theodotion translated, “To him who despises life, who is an abomination to the people, who is a servant of princes”—which clearly suits the person of Christ. For the good Shepherd gave his life for the sheep and despised it, he who was an abomination to the nation of the Jews …, one who was the servant of princes and so humble that he stood before Annas and Caiaphas and was sent to be crucified to Pilate and Herod.… The “peaceful and opportune time” and “the day of salvation” are the Savior’s passion and resurrection—when he prayed on the cross, “God, my God, why have you abandoned me?” And God kept him or formed him as death was overcome and gave him to be a covenant of the people of the Jews, or at least to those of them who believed, to waken the land that was lying in the errors of idolatry and to possess the lost or deserted inheritance that did not have God living there.

(Version 7.) Thus says the Lord, the Redeemer of Israel, his Holy One, to the despised soul, to the abhorred nation, to the servant of rulers. Kings shall see and arise, princes, and they shall worship because of the Lord, for he is faithful, and the Holy One of Israel who has chosen you. LXX: Thus says the Lord, who delivers you, the God of Israel. Sanctify him who despises his own soul, who is an abomination to the nations, who is the servant of rulers. Kings shall see him and rise up, and princes shall adore him because of the Lord, for the Holy One of Israel is faithful and has chosen you. For what we have said, 'He has transferred us to the contemptible soul, to the abominable nation, to the slave of lords, Theodotius', applies clearly to him who despises the soul, who is an abomination to the nation, who is a servant of princes, which clearly applies to the person of Christ. For he himself, the good shepherd, has laid down his life for his sheep (John 10), and he has despised him who is an abomination to the Jewish nation, whom they curse three times a day with the name 'Nazarene' in their synagogues. He was a servant of the princes, and so humble that he stood before Annas and Caiaphas; and he was to be crucified by Pilate and sent to Herod. This interpretation was agreed upon by Aquila, and partly by the Septuagint, although they changed the meaning and made it weaker, interpreting 'pro gentes' as 'pro gente' and 'pro servos' as 'pro servo'. Others are of the opinion that this is said in reference to the Jewish people, who despised their own soul and are an abomination to the whole world; and they serve the princes, of whom it is written: 'They devour my people as bread.' (Psalm 13:4). But a better interpretation is above Christ. Therefore, which Father, once the redeemer and Holy One of Israel, speaks to the son? Kings will see and princes will rise, and they will worship, when he comes in the glory of the Father with his Angels, and he will sit on the throne of his glory, judging the living and the dead: then everyone will worship him because of the Lord his Father, who chose him. Or it is to be understood in this way: Kings whose heart is in the hand of God, and the princes of the Church of God, will worship you: for the Lord, the Holy One of Israel, who chose you, is faithful. But all these things apply to him who despises his own soul, who is despised by the nation, who is a servant of princes.
