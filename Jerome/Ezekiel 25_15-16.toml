(Vers. 15, 16.) Thus says the Lord God: Because the Philistines acted in vengeance, and took revenge with wholehearted malice, and filled ancient enmities; therefore thus says the Lord God: Behold, I will stretch out my hand against the Philistines, and I will destroy the killers and annihilate the remnants of the coastal region. And I will inflict great vengeance upon them in furious rebukes, and they will know that I am the Lord when I execute my vengeance upon them. LXX: Therefore, thus says the Lord God: Because the aliens have committed vengeance and have provoked wrath, insultingly, from the heart, in order to destroy forever; therefore, thus says the Lord God: Behold, I will stretch out my hand against the aliens, and I will destroy or kill the Cretans, and I will destroy the remnants of the coastal region, and I will bring upon them great vengeance in the fury of wrath, and they shall know that I am the Lord God when I execute my vengeance upon them. After the sons of Ammon, Moab, and Seir, who themselves are also Edomites, and through Lot and Esau are linked to the people of Israel and the house of Judah by kinship, came to the Philistines, whom the Seventy Translators translated as ἀλλοφύλους, that is, foreigners, not by the general name of all the nations that are not of the Jewish race, but by the specific name of their own race, which is now called Palestine, with the letter P changed to Pi (π) according to the Greek custom, just as we celebrate the Hebrew Phase () in Greek and Latin as Pascha. The Philistines are interpreted as those who fall by the cup, who themselves were intoxicated by the golden cup of Babylon, and they rage and insult with their whole heart, remembering the ancient enmities against old Israel, from whom they were separated from God's people. And when the Lord says, 'Vengeance is mine, and I will repay' (Deuteronomy 32:35), they themselves take revenge by killing and fulfilling the old hatred. On account of this, they will feel the outstretched hand of the Lord above them, which will kill the killers. For this reason, the Cretans, not knowing what they wanted, interpreted the Seventy (LXX), together with Aquila and Symmachus, and Theodotion, the Hebrew word Chorethim (), as either murderers or murder. This was not only said in the present place, but also in Zephaniah where it is said against the Philistines: Gaza will be plundered, and Ashkelon will be laid waste, and Ashdod and Ekron will be uprooted. Woe to the inhabitants of the coast, the inhabitants of Crete, the word of the Lord is against you, O Canaan, land of foreigners, and I will destroy you from your dwelling place, and Crete will become a pasture for shepherds, and a resting place for sheep (Zeph. II, 4 ff.). And here, when the Seventy translated to Crete, the other translators rendered ὄλεθρον (Al. κάῤῥον) as 'interfection' or 'perdition'. About this, in the aforementioned prophet, with God's help, we have said what seemed to us. Hence, the two legions of David, one of which was called Phelethi and the other Cerethi (2 Kings 15), received the name Cherethim (Al. Cherethim), because they would kill and slaughter, that is, the name of the slain. And the Lord will destroy all the remaining parts of the maritime region, which is beaten by the salty (false) waves, and he will not inflict small but great punishments in his anger, so that his anger may have an end to mercy, and after he has taken revenge, rebuking with fury, then the Palestinians will know that he himself is the Lord.
