Just as anyone who tosses a stone straight up into the air and is foolish enough not to move out of its way is struck on the head and wounded by his own stone, in the same way, the devil downs himself by his own arrogance; the pride that exalts him is the same pride that defeats him. “His mischief shall recoil on his own head.” All the devil wants is to hold his head up high, but he cannot. Why can he not? Because his “mischief shall recoil on his own head” and crush him down.
