(Chapter 4, verse 1 onward) Behold, for the day is coming, burning like a furnace, when all the proud and all the evildoers will be stubble; and the coming day will set them ablaze, says the Lord of hosts, so that it will leave them neither root nor branch. But for you who fear my name, the sun of righteousness shall rise with healing in its wings. You shall go out leaping like calves from the stall. And you shall trample the wicked, for they will be ashes under the soles of your feet, on the day when I act, says the Lord of hosts. LXX: For behold, the day is coming, burning like an oven, when it will burn them up, and all the aliens and all the evildoers will be stubble; the day that is coming shall set them ablaze, says the Lord of hosts, so that it will leave them neither root nor branch. But for you who fear my name, the sun of righteousness shall rise, with healing in its wings. You shall go out leaping like calves from the stall. And you shall tread down the wicked, for they will be ashes under the soles of your feet, on the day when I act, says the Lord of hosts. For the wicked have made me labor in their speeches, and have said: Every one that doth evil, is good in the sight of the Lord, and such please him: and if it be not so, who will confront him? and since he is good to those who serve him not, they have said: Where is the God of justice? And behold I speak these things to justify myself, for I am full of complaints against the ungodly; but if I had a cause, I would just speak, and would not fear him as he is. And when He shall have inflamed and burnt them, He will leave in them no root nor germ of wickedness. This is what the impious will suffer on the day of judgment. On the contrary, it is said what will happen to those who fear the name of God: And the sun of justice shall rise upon you, who ((elsewhere: because)) will judge all things truly: and neither good nor evil, neither virtues nor vices, shall be able to remain hidden. And health shall be in His wings, to carry the repentant on His shoulders, according to what is written in Deuteronomy: Spreading His wings, He has received them, and has carried them on His shoulders. (Deut. XXII, 11). Then those who are now included in the world as if in prison will go out, and they will leap like calves from the herd, or like calves freed from chains. Hence the Apostle says: I desire to be dissolved, and to be with Christ (Philippians 1:23), so that he may go out and leap like a calf freed from chains, and like a victim of the Lord. And he is not content with the end of this joy; but he will trample on the wicked when they become ashes. Hence, there is also an imprecation for the righteous: But the God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet swiftly (Romans 16:20). Abraham spoke to the Lord, feeling himself to be like the ashes of divine majesty: 'I am dust and ashes' (Gen. XVIII, 27); and therefore he will see the sun of justice, and will rest among its chosen ones, and carried by him, he will be raised up to the heavens. But he, through pride, said: 'I will set my throne above the stars, I will be like the Most High' (Isai. XIV, 13); he will be cast down to the earth, and will be like ashes under the feet of the holy ones, when the day of the Lord of judgment comes.
