Look at this instance from Zechariah where the Evangelist John quotes from the Hebrew, “They shall look on him whom they pierced.” We read in the Septuagint, “And they shall look on me because they have mocked me.” In the Latin version, we read, “And they shall look on me for the things that they have mocked or insulted.” Here the Evangelist, the Septuagint and our own version all differ. And yet, the divergence of language is atoned for by oneness of spirit.
