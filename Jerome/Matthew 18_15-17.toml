What follows, Even so it is not the will, &c. is to be referred to what was said above, Take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones; and so He shows that this parable was set forth to enforce that same saying. Also in saying, It is not the will of my Father which is in heaven that one of these little ones should perish, He shows that so oft as one of these little ones does perish, it is not by the Father's will that it perishes.

If then your brother have sinned against you, or hurt you in any matter, you have power, indeed must needs forgive him, for we are charged to forgive our debtors their debts. But if a man sin against God, it is no longer in our decision. But we do all tho contrary of this; where God is wronged we are merciful, where the affront is to ourselves we prosecute the quarrel.

Thy brother is to be reproved in private, lest if once he has lost a sense of shame, he should continue in sin.

For in saving another, salvation is gained for ourselves also. Chrys What you should do if he does not yield is added, If he will not hear thee, take with thee one or two. For the more shameless and stubborn he shows himself, the more studious should we be of applying the medicine, and not turn to wrath and hate. As the physician, if he see that the disease does not abate, he does not slack, but redoubles his efforts to heal. And observe how this reproof is not for revenge, but for correction, seeing his command is not to take two with him at first, but when he would not amend; and even then he does not send a multitude to him, but one or two, alleging the law, That in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may stand. (Deut. 19:15.) This is that you may have witnesses that you have done all your part.

Or it is to be understood in this way; If he will not hear thee, take with thee one brother only; if he yet will not hear, take a third, either from your zeal for his amendment, that shame or admonition may move him; or for the purpose of meeting before witnesses.

If yet he will not hear them, then it must be told to many, that he may be held in abhorrence; so that he who could not be saved by his own sense of shame, may be saved by public disgrace; whence it follows, If he will not hear them, tell it to the Church.

That He says, As a heathen and a publican, shows that he is to be more abhorred, who under the name of a believer does the deeds of an unbeliever, than those that are openly gentiles. Those He calls publicans, who pursue worldly gain, and levy contributions by trading, cheating, and villainous frauds, and perjuries.

(Verse 15 and following) But if your brother sins against you, go and confront him between you and him alone. If he listens to you, you have gained your brother. But if he does not listen, take one or two more with you, so that by the testimony of two or three witnesses every word may be confirmed. If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church. And if he refuses to listen even to the church, let him be to you as a Gentile and a tax collector. If our brother sins against us, and he harms us in any way, we have the power, indeed the necessity, to forgive our debtors as is commanded. But if someone sins against God, it is not within our power. For divine Scripture says: If a man sins against another man, the priest will pray for him. But if someone sins against God, who will pray for him? On the contrary, we are kind in the face of God's injustice, and in our own insults we exercise hatred. However, the brother must be rebuked privately, so that if he has once lost shame and modesty, he may not remain in sin. And if indeed he listens, we gain his soul, and through the salvation of another, we also acquire salvation for ourselves. But if he refuses to listen, let a brother be called in. And if he does not listen to him, let a third person be called in, either to correct him or to meet with witnesses. But if he refuses to listen to them as well, then it is necessary to bring in many people, so that he may be held in detestation, and let him who could not be saved by shame be saved by disgrace. However, when it is said, 'Let him be to you as a Gentile and a tax collector,' it is shown that there is a greater detestation for someone who acts as a faithful person under the title of an infidel than for those who openly identify as Gentiles. For publicans are called according to tropology, those who pursue worldly gains and demand taxes through dealings and frauds, thefts, and wicked perjuries.
