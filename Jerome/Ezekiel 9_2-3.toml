(Verses 2, 3) And behold, six men were coming from the way of the upper gate, which faces north, each with his weapon of destruction in his hand. And there was one man among them clothed in linen, with a scribe's inkhorn at his side. They went in and stood beside the bronze altar. And the glory of the God (Vulgate: Lord) of Israel went up from the cherub on which it rested to the threshold of the house. And he called to the man clothed in linen, who had the scribe's inkhorn at his side. According to the lines, which we have interpreted alongside Symmachus, LXX, ποδήρη; Theodotius translated the Hebrew word Baddim (); Aquila, the chief, interpreted. Again, when we said, and the writer's inkwell at his kidneys, they put LXX: And a sapphire belt on his kidneys; Theodotius, the scribal pen in his hand; Aquila, μελανοδοχεῖον, that is, the writer's inkwell at his loins; Symmachus had writing tablets at his kidneys. And when we moved, the threshold of the house, the Seventy and Theodotion, the open area, that is, placed the entrance under the sky. As for the vase, which each man held in his hands, only the Seventy interpreted it as an axe. Therefore, in order to atone for the sins of man, who were made on the sixth day of the creation of the world, six men come and descend from the upper gate, or as the Seventy translated, the heights to the North. And each person had an ax in their hands, about which John speaks: For now the ax is laid to the root of the trees. Every tree that does not bear good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire (Matt. III, Luke III, 9). And in the middle of the six men there was one, that is, the seventh, dressed in the garments of a high priest, made of linen, and he had a scribe's inkwell at his kidneys, with which he would record the sins of all and separate the number of holy individuals from the sinners: or a sapphire belt of the color of a sapphire stone, which is in the ornaments of the high priest. Six men went out and stood next to the brazen altar. There were two altars: one for burning incense, golden inside; and the other in front of the temple, bronze for burnt offerings. They are said to stand ready by the altar to carry out the commands of the one who commands, so that if they see any sins not forgiven there, they may know the judgment of the Lord and subject themselves to his punishment. The glory of the God of Israel also ascended, or was taken up, from one Cherub and went to the threshold, or to the inner court of the house and vestibule, which is not covered but enjoys the freedom of the air. The glory of the Lord Himself called the man, who was in the attire of a high priest and had an inkwell in his loins, and said what the Scripture testifies. Some interpret the six men as six Angels who obey the will of God, and they understand the one who had the attire of a high priest as the Savior; in accordance with that, the Priest is both the Angel of great counsel and that which is said: You are a priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek (Psalm 110:4). However, what the Seventy translated as 'podērē' is one of the eight vestments of the high priest, which is called 'talaris' in Latin; and it receives this name because it reaches down to the feet. I know that I published a book about the vestments of the high priest many years ago, and I am sending the reader the explanation of it. For I cannot say everything in every place, and when I asked Aquila and Theodotion what the Hebrew word 'כַּ֫סְתָּ֥ח' meant, they replied to me in Greek that it is called 'καλαμάριον', because it is adorned with reeds. We call ink 'atramentarium' because it contains ink. Many people call it a more significant name, 'thecas', because they are the cases of writing quills. Of the four Cherubim, one Cherub is sent from the glory of the Lord's majesty to speak to the one who was clothed in the garments of the pontiff. And although many think that 'τὰ χερουβεὶμ' should be said in the neutral gender and plural number, we must know that 'Cherub' is singular in number, masculine in gender, and its plural is 'Cherubim' of the same gender: not because there is gender among the ministers of God, but because each thing is called by different genders according to the properties of their language. Angels are called by the plural number Malachim, and Cherubim, and Seraphim of the same kind and number. Furthermore, Sabaoth, which is interpreted as hosts or armies and virtues, are called by the feminine gender, plural number, and end in the final syllable Oth (). However, those who want the Savior to be understood under the figure of a pontiff use the example from the Book of Revelation of John, in which it is written: And I turned and saw a voice that spoke with me. And when I turned, I saw seven golden candlesticks; and in the midst of the candlesticks one like unto the Son of man, and so on.
