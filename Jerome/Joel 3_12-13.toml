(Verse 12 and following) Let the nations arise and come up to the Valley of Jehoshaphat, for there I will sit to judge all the surrounding nations. Send in the sickles, for the harvest is ripe. Come and go down, for the winepress is full; the vats overflow, for their wickedness is multiplied. LXX: Let all the nations arise and come up to the Valley of Jehoshaphat, for there I will sit to judge all the surrounding nations. Send in the sickles, for the grape harvest is ripe. Come in and tread, for the winepress is full, and the wine vats overflow, for their evil deeds are abundant. And these things are interpreted in two ways according to a higher meaning. Some people understand that the nations will ascend into the valley of Josaphat, which means the judgment of the Lord, and sit there before God, so that He may judge all the nations that come from every direction in a favorable manner. In this way, the saints will gather against the adversaries of God and send forth their sickles to reap the ripe harvest of the enemies, and they will come and go, treading on the wine vats, because there is a vintage present, and the must is so abundant that the wine vats cannot contain it. And so, in order to understand what the vintage is and what the full winepress signifies, he has introduced the multiplication of their malice, and without a doubt it signifies those who have congregated against the Lord. But others say that the nations will rise up and come together in the Valley of Josaphat and sit before the Lord, so that he may judge all nations. They assert that they will prepare themselves and gather all the weapons of the fighters, and in the valley of Josaphat they will be cut down by the sickles of the Lord. For the time of judgment had come against them, and their evils had grown so much that they overcame God's patience. For the Amorites were expelled then, when their sins were fulfilled. The Jews interpret this place as referring to the fierce nations of Gog and Magog, about which we have spoken above, believing that in the last time, when Jerusalem is restored, they will come against God's people during a thousand-year reign, and in the Valley of Jehoshaphat, which is situated to the east of the temple, they will fall ((another reading: rage)). For the time of their destruction has come, and the time of pouring out blood is imminent.
