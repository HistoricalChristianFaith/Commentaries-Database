Also in Isaiah it says, “the Lord of powers will come out and wage war, and will rouse his zeal and will shout in triumph over his foes with strength.” For God will come out from his place, once he is compelled to break his peace and gentleness and kindness for the sake of putting sins right, who, although by his nature is sweet, has been made bitter by our flaw, not in himself but in those suffering, to whom the torments are bitter. It is he who elsewhere spoke by the prophet, “I am God, and I do not change.” - "Commentary on Zechariah 3.14.3–4"
