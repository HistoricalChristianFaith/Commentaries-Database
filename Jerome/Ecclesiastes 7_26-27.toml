"I
applied my heart to know, and to search, and to seek out wisdom, and the reason
of things, and to know the wickedness of folly, even of foolishness and
madness. And I find that woman is more
bitter than death, whose heart is snares and nets, and her hands are as bands:
whoever pleases God shall escape her; but the sinner shall be taken by her. "The Septuagint here has: "I even applied my heart
that I should know". Symmachus has
interpreted this saying, 'I have looked into all things with my reasoning to
know, to distinguish and to find out.' 
Since therefore Ecclesiastes had said above that he had tried to know
all wisdom and the more he sought it the more it eluded him, now he says even
that he sought out another thing in his wisdom, for wickedness precedes all
things in human affairs, and that affair is first and foremost in impiety,
stupidity, madness, and insanity. He
also says that he found woman to be the cause of all evil, since through her,
death came into the world and took the most prized spirits of men. And even for all adulterers, it is like there
is a coat of mail on their heart, the heart that makes the souls of adolescents
soar upwards. And when this happens to
the mind of a wretched lover, it pushes him into first position, and he is not
allowed to look back at his feet, but like a snare or noose it ensnares the
heart of a youth. 'For he has chains
around his wrists', which Aquila interpreted as being, 'for his hands are in
chains'. For he can convince, but he
doesn't have the strength and can't pull himself to those who are
unwilling. Those things destroy him, who
was righteous and good before God; but the sinner who has been captured will be
led down to his death. Let us not think
that Solomon held this opinion about women thoughtlessly, he speaks only those
things that he has experienced. For this
reason he fears God, since women have captured him. And these interpretations are very
literal. But according to the spiritual
understanding of this passage, either we should take every sin made in general,
and call it 'woman' and 'wickedness', for example, she who sits behind the fa√ßade
of woman in Zechariah above the talent of lead. [Cfr. Zech. 5, 7.] Or we can take woman to be the devil
metaphorically on account of effeminate men; or indeed idolatry, and so that we
might proceed more closely, the church or heretics, which calls the fool to
itself by reasoning, so that he receives stolen bread, and stolen water, the
false sacrament, and is led to be baptised in polluted water.
