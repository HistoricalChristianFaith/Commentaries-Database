It is very marvelous how they can buy water without money and do not drink it but eat it. For he who came down from heaven is himself both bread and water.â€¦ We read that he mixed wine and wisdom in his bowl, telling all the fools of this age and the world who do not have wisdom to drink, that we buy not only wine but also milk, which signifies the innocence of little ones. The manner and type of this remains today in the Eastern churches, where wine and milk are given to the newborn in baptism.

(Chapter 55, Verse 1) All you who are thirsty, come to the waters, and you who have no money, hurry and buy and eat; come, buy wine and milk without money and without price. Why do you spend money on what is not bread, and your labor on what does not satisfy? LXX: You who are thirsty, go to the water, and you who have no money, go, buy and eat, and walk, and buy wine and fat without money and without price. Why do you spend money, and your labor not for satisfaction? The Hebrew word Oi (), which I mentioned earlier in the prophecy against Ariel (Isaiah chapter 29), was ambiguous, and it could either mean an interjection of calling or woe. Here at the beginning of the chapter, it is not read as a lament, but with the emotion of calling. Therefore, since he had said that every earthen vessel against the Church should be crushed, and every voice and tongue that had rebelled against the knowledge of God should be overcome, he calls believers to the river of God, which is filled with water, and whose flowing brings joy to the city of God, so that they may drink from the fountains of the Savior, who spoke to the Samaritan woman: If you knew the grace of God, and who it is that says to you, give me something to drink, you would have asked him, and he would have given you living water. The water that I shall give him shall become in him a well of water springing up into eternal life (John 4:10, 14). Of these waters He cried out in the Temple: If any man thirst, let him come to me, and drink. He who drinks of the water that I shall give him, rivers of living water shall flow out of his belly (Ibid., 37, 38), signifying the Holy Spirit, whom those who believed in Him were to receive, as also the Prophets did declare in mystic language: My soul thirsts for the living God (Psalm 42:2); and again: With you is the fountain of life (Psalm 36:10). He himself spoke of himself, saying: They have abandoned me, the fountain of living water, and they have dug for themselves broken cisterns that cannot hold water (Jeremiah 2:13). These waters are scattered by the clouds, to which the truth of God reaches. As it is written: Let the clouds scatter righteousness (Isaiah 45:8, Septuagint). And it is commanded to those who are thirsty, that they must not drink the turbid waters of Sion and the swollen torrents of the Assyrians, but rather go to the waters of Siloam, which flow silently, and not fear the poverty of speech, if perhaps they do not have silver (Isaiah 45; Jeremiah 2), but listen to the Apostle saying: By grace you have been saved (Ephesians 2:8); and the Lord said to the disciples: Freely you have received, freely give (Matthew 10:8). They amazingly buy water without money; and they do not drink it, but eat it. For he himself is both the water and the bread, which descends from heaven (John VI). Therefore, what is read in some copies, 'Buy and drink,' has been changed by ignorant writers, who thought it would be more consistent if water were drunk rather than eaten. And money is also very bad, or silver, which the Scripture condemns, saying: Money that is given with deceit will be considered as a broken piece of a pot (Proverbs XXVI, 23, sec. LXX); and in another place: Your silver is worthless (Jeremiah VI, 30). And silver is compared to the words of God: The words of the Lord are pure words, like silver that is tested in a furnace of earth, refined seven times (Psalm 12:6). Therefore, despising that silver and wealth, with which we cannot buy the waters of the Lord, let us go to Him, who, holding the chalice of the Sacrament, spoke to the disciples: Take and drink, this is my blood, which will be shed for you for the forgiveness of sins (Matthew 26:27, 28). He mixed wine and wisdom in his cup, challenging all the fools of the world who have no wisdom, to drink. And not only wine, but also milk, which symbolizes the innocence of children, as is still practiced today in Western Churches. It is given as wine and milk to those reborn in Christ. Concerning this milk, Paul also said: 'I gave you milk to drink, not solid food' (1 Corinthians 3:2). And Peter: Desire the rational milk, as newborn babes (I Pet. II, 2) . Therefore, even Moses, understanding wine and milk in the passion of Christ, testifies in mystical language: His eyes are gracious from wine, and his teeth white from milk (Genes. XLIX, 12) . For they translated milk into fat in the present passage. Concerning this, the holy David says in the psalm: Let my soul be filled as with fatness and abundance (Psal. LXII, 6) ; and in another place: He fed them with the fat of wheat, and filled them with honey from the rock (Psal. LXXX, 17) . Those who desire nothing other than mystical flesh. To which the Lord urged his disciples, saying: Unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you will not have life in you (John 6:54). Therefore, he was handed over in Gethsemane, which signifies a valley of fatness, or the fattest. At the same time, he rebukes those who follow secular wisdom and the perverse doctrines of heretics, as well as the traditions of the Pharisees, and all false knowledge that exalts itself against God, and who pay great prices and work constantly for money in that discipline in which there is no bread, and they sweat for food in which there is no satisfaction. From which it is shown that wisdom must be sought, which is not in the leaves and flowers of words, but in the marrow and fruits of senses; which does not fly past the ear, but refreshes the mind. And in order to learn this, we do not cross seas, nor do we need great expenses, but the word is near in our mouth and in our heart.
