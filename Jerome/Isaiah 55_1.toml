It is very marvelous how they can buy water without money and do not drink it but eat it. For he who came down from heaven is himself both bread and water.â€¦ We read that he mixed wine and wisdom in his bowl, telling all the fools of this age and the world who do not have wisdom to drink, that we buy not only wine but also milk, which signifies the innocence of little ones. The manner and type of this remains today in the Eastern churches, where wine and milk are given to the newborn in baptism.
