At the same, the reader should examine carefully that it does not say that the devil was standing triumphantly as a victor, but that he was at a halt in the contest and was being held in the battle line and in uncertainty—no, indeed, he was not victor, since he had not yet begun to fight. As for the words “to accuse him,” the devil was his adversary, just as we said, because Jesus was clothed in garments that were filthy with our sins. After Satan heard the command, “May the Lord who has chosen Jerusalem rebuke you!” he stood no longer on the right but retired behind him and crawled under his feet. Without delay, Jesus the high priest dons the long garment and is clothed in shining raiment, and in harmony with kingly authority—with the hands of Zerubbabel—[he] lays the foundation of the church and erects the spiritual Jerusalem.

You can search them out for yourself from sacred Scripture without my help. And it will become clearly evident to you that this likely is the age of which it was said, “Believe not in friends and trust not in princes,” and that the prophecy is now being fulfilled: “The leaders of my people have not known me; they are foolish and senseless children. They are wise to do evils, but to do good they have no knowledge.” We should rather pity such people than hate them and should rather pray for them than revile them. For we were created to bless and not to revile. Thus also Michael, when he was arguing with the devil over the body of Moses, did not dare to bring an accusation of blasphemy against him even for such a serious offense but said, “May the Lord rebuke you.” Even in Zechariah, we read something similar to this. “The Lord rebuke you, O Satan, and the Lord that chose Jerusalem rebuke you.” And so we also pray that those who refuse to be rebuked by their friends with humility may be rebuked by the Lord.
