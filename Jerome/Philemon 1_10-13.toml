"I beseech you concerning my son, whom I have begotten in chains, Onesimus, who was once useless to you, but is now useful to both you and me, whom I have sent back to you. But you, receive him, that is, my own heart, whom I wished to keep with me, so that he might serve me on your behalf in the chains of the gospel. " In wishing to obtain what he asks for, he now asserts that he is pleading not for Philemon's slave, but for his own son. And regarding that son whom he has begotten in the chains of the gospel, that is, which he endured for the sake of Christ's gospel: who, although he was once useless to his master (for a slave who steals and runs away harms no one but his own master), now on the contrary, by way of compensation for his usefulness to both his master and Paul, and to others through Paul, he deserves more love than he had previously deserved hatred. He says, "Who was useless to you at one time." "To you alone," he says, "not to others: but now it is useful to both me and you." It is useful to the master in that he could serve Paul as his master; Paul, however, is useful in this: that he could minister to him in the Gospel while he was being held in prison and chains. And at the same time we admire the magnanimity of the apostle and his fervent mind in Christ. He is held in prison, is bound in chains, is oppressed by the filth of his body, by separation from his loved ones, is cramped by penal darkness, and yet he feels no wrong, he is not tortured by pain, he knows nothing else but to think about the Gospel of Christ. He knew the slave, he knew the fugitive, he knew that he had been converted to the faith of Christ by a kidnapper. It is a great effort for a man to persevere in what he has begun. Therefore, he impresses, repeats, and urges his son and the son of bonds, and minister of the Gospel who is imprisoned, that Philemon, praised only in the preface, would not dare to refuse, lest he appear unworthy of his own praises. And what he says: "But you accept him, that is, my heart," this is what I said a little earlier, that "heart" signifies the internal affection of the heart and the full willingness from the soul, when everything that is in us is received from the one asking. But otherwise, all children are the parents' hearts.
