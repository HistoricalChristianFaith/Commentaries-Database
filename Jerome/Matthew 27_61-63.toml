(V. 61 seqq.) Now there was there Mary Magdalene and the other Mary, sitting opposite the sepulchre. And on the next day, which followed the day of preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered together to Pilate, saying: Lord, we remember that that seducer said, while he was yet alive: After three days I will rise again. But the rest having left the Lord, the women persevered in their duty, expecting what Jesus had promised; and therefore they were the first to see the risen Lord, for he who perseveres to the end shall be saved (Matthew 10:22; 24:13).
