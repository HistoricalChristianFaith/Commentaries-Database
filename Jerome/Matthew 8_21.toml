(Verse 21.) And another of his disciples said to him: Lord, allow me first to go and bury my father. What is the similarity between a scribe and a disciple? The former calls him master, the latter confesses him Lord. The former desires to go and bury his father due to an opportunity for piety; the latter promises to follow him wherever, not seeking a master, but seeking profit from the master.
