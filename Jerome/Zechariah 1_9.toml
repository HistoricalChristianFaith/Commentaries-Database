“I will hear what the Lord God proclaims in me.” The prophet is praying for the people and speaks while God is speaking in him: “I will listen to what the Lord God is proclaiming in me.” You perceive that God does not speak in the ears but in the heart, as Zechariah says: “The angel who spoke in me answered me.” The angel is understood to be our Lord, who is proclaiming the will of the Father and who, in Isaiah, is called the angel of the great counsel. I will listen to the voice of the Lord God within me; I shall attend with the ear of my heart that I may hear what the Lord God speaks in me.
