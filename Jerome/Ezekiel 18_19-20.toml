(Verse 19, 20.) And you say: Why did not the son bear the iniquity of the father? Clearly, because the son has practiced judgment and justice, has kept all my commandments and has done them: he shall live. The soul that sins, it shall die. The son shall not bear the iniquity of the father: and the father shall not bear the iniquity of the son. The righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him. He answers the question that the listener could have proposed in the opposite way. He often says, they say, why did the righteous son not bear the iniquity of the father? To which he himself responds: Clearly, because the son has acted well, and has not committed the father's offenses. And it is right, just as a sinner dies in his own wickedness; so the righteous live in their virtues: and let the soul that has sinned die; and let the one who has kept God's commandments live.
