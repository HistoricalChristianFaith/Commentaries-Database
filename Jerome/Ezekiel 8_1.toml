Chapter 8, Verse 1. And it came to pass in the sixth year, in the sixth month, on the fifth day of the month, I was sitting in my house, and the elders of Judah were sitting before me. In the fifth year of the exile of Jehoiachin, in the fourth month, on the fifth day of the month, we read about a previous vision to the prophet. But now, in the sixth year of the same king, in the sixth month, on the fifth day of the month, a new vision is mentioned. From this, it is clear that these events, which are written, occurred after a year and two months, and either the prophecy was interrupted for a year and two months, or it spanned the entire fourteen months that the previous discourse covers. But in the sixth year and the sixth month, and on the fifth day of the month, which are numbers that refer to the creation of the world, and (( Al. ad)) the carnal senses, which perceive earthly things and do not yet contemplate heavenly things, the prophecy will not astonish one who understands that the word is directed to the elders of Judah. Among them, seventy held censers, and twenty-five worshiped the sun in the temple, and the prophet sat in his house, fleeing the crowd. And the elders of Judah sat before him, either desiring to hear the prophet's words or plotting against him. And those who are called elders of Judah are said to refer not to Israel, that is, to the ten tribes that were previously captured, but to those who were taken into captivity from the tribe of Judah with Jechoniah, let us understand.
