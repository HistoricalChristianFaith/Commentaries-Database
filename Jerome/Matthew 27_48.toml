(Verse 48.) And immediately one of them, running, filled a sponge with vinegar and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink. And these things were done so that the prophecy would be fulfilled: They gave me vinegar for my thirst (Psalm 68:22). Even to this day, the Jews and all the unbelievers give Jesus vinegar and gall to drink on the Sunday of his resurrection; and they give him wine mixed with myrrh to make him sleepy, so that he does not see their evil.
