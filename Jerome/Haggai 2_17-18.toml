(Verse 17 onwards) Now set your hearts from this day and above, before the stone was placed upon stone in the temple of the Lord. When you approached a heap of twenty measures, and it became ten, and you entered the winepress to press out fifty jars, and it became twenty. I struck you with blight and mildew and hail in all the work of your hands, yet you did not return to me, says the Lord. LXX: And now set your hearts from this day, and upward, before a stone was laid upon a stone in the temple of the Lord, when you were sent to the storehouse of barley twenty sata, and they became ten sata of barley. And I struck you with barrenness, and with mildew, and with hail, in all the works of your hands: and you returned not to me, saith the Lord. Although all the offerings that you presented to me on the altar were contaminated (since you did not build the temple, every gift is defiled); I now urge you, O people, to reflect on the past and consider what has been done, that is, everything from the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month of the second year of Darius. Embrace in your mind everything that has happened and why, and how much you have endured, so that when fortunate things happen to you in the future, you will know the reason why. Therefore, before you started building the temple and laying stone upon stone, when you approached the heap and thought you had twenty bushels, could you not have collected barely half? Or according to the Septuagint: When you poured twenty bushels of barley into a vessel called a cysele, and you thought that even though you were pouring barley, the food for the animals, you would still be secure with those twenty bushels, could you not later, having returned to the vessel, find barely ten bushels? When you approached the winepress, you saw grapes, and your eyes promised you fifty amphorae: I do not mean half, but you could hardly squeeze out twenty amphorae. And I did this by striking you with burning wind, and the corruption of the air, and the dying crops, and the empty husks of grain, and the clusters of vines, so that I might provoke you to come to my notice by the weight of evils: and still there was no one who would return to me. The Hebrew [prophet] includes in these words the entire content of this passage - from the statement: And now lay your hearts from this day and higher up, until the place where it is said: a vineyard and fig and pomegranate tree, and olive wood has not blossomed, from this day I will bless, thus he explains (or Alb.: he explains): Certainly now the foundations of the temple are laid; therefore, from this day on which you have laid the foundations (since in the past I punished you with sterility, and hunger, and hail, and drought, and there was no one among you who would turn to me through these plagues), lay your hearts in the future and henceforth, and see that all things flow to you in a prosperous course. But this will happen because you have begun to build my temple: not having confidence in the sole altar, you despise the building of my house. In short, we can say that it is in vain for some to offer gifts to God and think that God can be appeased by alms and offerings when they themselves have not built a temple for the Holy Spirit within themselves. For then alms and gifts offered on the altar are beneficial when someone has built the temple of God within themselves and after the building of the temple, they present gifts on the altar. Furthermore, according to the moral interpretation, it is also said to us who now believe in Jesus Christ, if, however, we believe and demonstrate the truth by the work of faith, that we should return in mind to that time when we were Gentiles, serving daily in vices, and we had not built a temple for God within us. But just as an architect and most skillful mason joins one stone to another, and fastens the lower to the upper with lime and gypsum: so too the architect (whom the apostle himself claims to be: 'As a wise architect, I have laid the foundation' - 1 Corinthians 3:10), and whom the Lord threatens to destroy the temple of Jerusalem) knows how to join works to works, and gradually build the temple of God. But the foundation of this temple is laid by Jesus, on whom everyone sees what he builds: one builds with gold, silver, precious stones; another with wood, hay, straw. And three good things are opposed by three contrary evils. These are the stones from which the Lord promises to rebuild Jerusalem: Behold, I will set your carbuncle stone, and your foundations sapphire, and I will set your battlements with jasper. I won't think according to Jewish fables and foolish imaginings that God will build Jerusalem with gold and precious stones, but with living stones. Stones that now roll on the ground, being in accordance with the nature of stones, either fiery like a carbuncle, or completely heavenly and brought to the throne of God, like a sapphire, or shining with innocence and the simplicity of good works, like a crystal. Therefore, it is said to us that we should consider what we have achieved before we built the temple of God within us. When you approached, he said, a heap of twenty bushels became ten: or according to the Septuagint: When you put twenty bushels of barley into the sieve, they became ten bushels of barley. For whatever virtues and good works we seemed to have before Christ, it was not wheat, but barley: and that barley, it did not give us a hundredfold fruits as we read about Isaac, but we could hardly find even half of our labor's worth from it, and it was said to us: Have you suffered so much in vain? But even when we entered the winepress and calculated fifty wine amphorae (a number which, when completed after seven weeks, includes the unity of divinity), and thought we had wine, which gladdens the heart of man, the sacred number thirty would be taken away from us (in which the Lord is baptized, and Ezekiel sees the vision at the beginning of his prophecy, and according to the Hebrew, priests approached the service of God), and twenty were left. Esau, who loves numbers, knowing that Jacob takes pleasure in this number, sends certain animals as a gift, twenty and twenty. Also, notice that Jacob himself, though holy (but at that time he was not with his father Isaac, that is, with laughter; nor with his mother Rebecca, that is, with patience; but he had neighboring Assyrians, and he lived in Mesopotamia, surrounded by rivers), served Laban for a cruel and greedy twenty-year period (Gen. XXXII). And it does not move anyone if we say that some, before the faith of Christ and the destruction of His temple, can receive the reward of their labor in part, since among unbelievers there is no fruit of good works. For he does not deposit twenty and find twenty, but when he has deposited twenty, he finds ten, that is, the reward for half of his labor. The Jews, and the Gentiles, and the philosophers of this age, and the others who boast of wisdom, in the present time of their conversation and labor, enjoy the fruit and glory of all their hope, and the reward of the future age is taken away. But this is done so that they do not completely despair and dismiss repentance; but that sometimes, when converted, they may set stone upon stone and build the temple of God. But if they remain in unbelief, they will lose the very thing that they seemed to have. For it follows: I struck you with a burning wind, and with mildew, and with hail, all the works of your hands. Whatever is struck by mildew and hail and a burning wind is reduced to dust and ashes, and nothing is found in it that pertains to usefulness and sustenance. All these things the Lord has done because no one has been found among them who would return to him. But if they return and build the temple of the Lord, from the day they start building, they will have what the prophecy foretold.
