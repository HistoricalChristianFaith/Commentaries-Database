(Verse 10 and following) This burden is upon the prince who is in Jerusalem, and upon all the house of Israel who are among them. Say: I am your omen: as I have done, so it shall be done to them. They shall go into exile and captivity. But the prince who is among them shall be carried on shoulders, he shall go out in darkness; they shall dig through the wall to bring him out; his face shall be covered, so that he may not see the land with his eyes. And I will spread my net over him, and he shall be taken in my snare, and I will bring him to Babylon, to the land of the Chaldeans; yet he shall not see it, though he shall die there. And all who are around him, his helpers and his troops, I will scatter to every wind, and I will unsheathe the sword after them. And they shall know that I am the Lord, when I scatter them among the nations and disperse them among the countries. But I will let a few of them escape from the sword, from famine and pestilence, so that they may declare all their abominations among the nations where they go, and may know that I am the Lord. First, let us explain the history. Say, he says, to them, O son of man, whether they ask or do not ask. What are you doing here? which is above the burden of that vision, which is in Jerusalem, signifying the leader Zedekiah. And say: I am your portent, or as the Septuagint translated, I am the one who makes portents; so that the future may be known from the present. As I have done, so it will be for them, the leader and all who are in the leader's entourage. Upon the transmigration to Babylon, the captives will be led, and the leader who is in their midst will be carried on their shoulders, either by beasts of burden or by those who fled with him. In darkness and in the shadows of the night, he will go forth: and his companions will dig through the wall to bring him out. His face will be covered, either by the fear of a fugitive or by the injury of blindness, so that the blind man may not see the land of Babylon. And I will spread my net over him, and he will be caught in my snare. Indeed, being seized by the Babylonians, he was captured as a result of God's permission. And he testifies that he himself caused these things to be done by the enemies. And being led into Babylon, he will not see the land of the Chaldeans, and there he will die as a captive. However, when he is captured, I will scatter all his allies, helpers, and companions in flight, here and there, and I will not allow them to depart in safety. But I will unsheathe my sword in the hands of the enemies, so that when they are dispersed among the nations, they may understand that I am the Lord, and all things are done according to my will. And I will leave behind, he says, a few from his companions who have fled with him, and those who have been able to escape the sword, famine, and plague, so that when they have come to various regions through either flight or captivity, they may recount all their crimes either through speech or example; because of which they have deserved such great evils, and understand that I myself am the Lord. But those who attempt to explain the allegory and the beginning of the explanation concerning the Savior, the leader who is in the midst of Jerusalem, interpret him, who has preceded as a sign and wonder, that he and his companions may be captives of this world, and as the victorious one ascending from the infernal regions, may be carried on the shoulders of angels: having gone forth in darkness, unknown to the unbelievers, having destroyed the middle wall, he has made both into one: his face being covered, so that he does not regard the land of the Jews (Ephesians 2). It is not surprising that the Lord hid His face; even today, the veil is placed before the unbelieving people when they look upon the face of Moses. And the Lord spread His net over him, as the bride speaks of him in the Song of Songs: Behold, he is behind our wall, looking through the windows, appearing through the lattice (Song of Songs 2:9). And also Jeremiah: The breath of our nostrils, the Lord's anointed, was captured in our sins (Lamentations 4:20). And: When he had not committed sin, he was made sin for us (II Cor. V, 21). And he shall be brought, he says, into Babylon, the confusion of this world, into the land of the Chaldeans who are interpreted as demons, so that he may draw back to salvation those who were enslaved to demons, and lead captive the ancient captivity. And he says that he will not see the land of the Chaldeans, and there he will die; so that he may give us life through his death. But he scattered all his helpers and partners, the apostles and apostolic men, throughout the whole world. And he unsheathed the sword after them, so that they might be crowned with various martyrdoms, and then they themselves or those who believed in them would understand that he is the Lord, and therefore he scattered them among the nations, and dispersed them in the lands, so they could bear much fruit. And he left a few men from among them, like the Apostle John, and others, freed from the sword, hunger, and pestilence, avoiding the onslaughts of persecution, to narrate the crimes of the Jews and the injustices of all the nations they entered, so that, through repentance, they may know that he is the Lord. We have said these things, leaving judgment to the discretion of the reader. However, there is no doubt that it is dangerous to compare the captivity and death of an impious king to the sacrament of the Lord.
