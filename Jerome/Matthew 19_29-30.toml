(Verse 29, 30.) And everyone who has left houses, or brothers, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or fields for my name's sake, shall receive a hundredfold, and shall possess eternal life. But many who are first shall be last, and the last first. This passage is in agreement with that saying in which the Savior speaks: 'I came not to send peace, but a sword. For I have come to set a man at variance against his father, and the daughter against her mother, and the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.' (Matthew 10:34) Therefore, those who for the sake of the faith of Christ and the preaching of the Gospel have despised all affections, as well as riches and worldly pleasures: they will receive a hundredfold and possess eternal life. In connection with this statement, some introduce the idea of a thousand years after the resurrection, saying that then a hundredfold of all the things we have given up will be restored to us, and eternal life will be given: not understanding that if in other matters there is a worthy promise, in the case of wives there appears a shameful thing; so that one who leaves one for the Lord will receive a hundred in the future. Therefore, this is the meaning: Whoever renounces earthly things for the sake of the Savior will receive heavenly things, which will be suitable and proportionate to the merit of the renunciation, as if a small number were compared to a hundred. Thus the Apostle says, he who has renounced only one house and the small fields of one province: As if having nothing, and possessing all things (2 Corinthians 6:10).
