(Verse 17, 18.) Be therefore wise as serpents, and innocent as doves. But beware of men: for they will deliver you up in councils, and they will scourge you in their synagogues. And you shall be brought before governors and kings for my sake, for a testimony to them and to the Gentiles. So that by prudence they may avoid snares, and by simplicity they may not do evil. The cleverness of the serpent is set as an example: because it hides its head with its whole body, and it protects the part where life is. And so, let us also, at the risk of our whole body, guard our head, who is Christ. The simplicity of doves is demonstrated by the appearance of the Holy Spirit. Hence, the Apostle also says: Be little children in malice (1 Corinthians 14:20).
