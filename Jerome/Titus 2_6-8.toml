Similarly, exhort the youth to be pure in all things, setting yourself as an example of good works in teaching, integrity and chastity, in sound and irreproachable speech, so that the outsider may respect us, having nothing bad to say about us. Just as what he had said previously, "Similarly, with elderly women dressed in a sacred manner," we said the similitude of elderly women should be referred to as the elderly; and so now with what he introduced: Similarly, exhort the youth to be pure, we think this similitude applies to the youth in relation to the elderly, and through the elderly to the elderly, so that they may have the sobriety of the elderly, and be honorable and pure, and sound in faith, and charity, and patience. But with regard to the elderly, he places them in the sanctity of their attire so that they may not be accusers, not slavishly devoted to much wine, teaching well, and so forth. But this has particular bearing on young men, that they should be pure in all things, namely in mind as well as body, as much in action as in thought, so that there might be no suspicion of indecency in the young man. And although some among the Latins think that it should be read thus: "Likewise exhort young men to be of honourable character, and afterwards to bring forth, in all things showing thyself a pattern of good works", nevertheless, let us know that, in all things, reference must be made to the higher, that is, to exhort them to be of honourable character in all things. It must also be known that continence is not only necessary in physical works and in the desire of the soul, but in all things, so that we do not seek undue honors, we are not inflamed by avarice, and we are not overcome by any passion. "Showing thyself," he says, "a pattern of good works." It is of no use for someone to be practised in speaking and to have learned the language for speaking, if he has more instructed by his example than by his word. Finally, whoever is shameless, although he be eloquent, if he exhorts those who hear him to chastity, his speech is feeble, and he does not have authority to exhort. And, vice versa, although he may be rustic and slow in speaking, if he is chaste, he can impel men to a likeness of life by his example. That which it says, "in incorruption," must be accepted as meaning that incorruption properly signifies virginity. Finally, those who are virgins are commonly called incorrupt; and those who have ceased to be virgins are called corrupt; and we say, she who was once a virgin, is corrupted. Wherefore I think that Titus, before he was occupied with the work of the flesh, received baptism as a believer of the Gospel, and remained a virgin, and is now reminded by the Apostle to show the form of incorruption; but we do not see this incorruption in Timothy. For when he said to him, Let no man despise thy youth; but be thou an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in faith, in chastity (1 Timothy 4:12), he was silent about incorruption and only mentioned chastity. However, purity even in celibacy can be understood without virginity. Unless we take purity in the mind and incorruption in the body as it is written elsewhere in the definition of a virgin: That she may be holy both in body and in spirit (1 Corinthians 7). He himself then added: in doctrine, in incorruption, in chastity. We might even interpret chastity and incorruption in the integrity of doctrine, but what particularly follows, "with wholesome speech that cannot be condemned," should have its own precept regarding the instruction of doctrine. However, when he says "speech cannot be condemned," he does not mean that anyone is so eloquent and wise that no one ever criticizes him (for both apostles and evangelists are criticized by heretics and pagans), but that he does not say or do anything worthy of criticism, though his opponents are ready to condemn him. And since there are many who are disobedient, vain talkers and deceivers of minds, who hate the one admonishing at the gates, and abominate holy discourse, therefore in all things let us set an example of doctrine, in integrity, in chastity, in sound and irreprehensible speech: that the adversaries of our life and doctrine, terrified by our soundness, may not dare to accuse, that is, to fabricate anything likely in accusation. And indeed we see some such today in churches (although this is a rare thing), of such gravity and continence that even from adversaries they have testimony, and it is said, that is a great man, and of holy conversation, and of good and proper behavior, if he were not a heretic. For there is no one of such unrestrained impudence that he can accuse the bright rays of the sun of darkness, and cast the clear light of night into obscurity. Hence also the Apostle, aware of this, says: To take away occasion from them that desire occasion (2 Cor. 11:12). Yet he can be understood to mean he who is an adversary, and that is the devil, who is the accuser of our brethren, as John the Evangelist preaches: who when he has nothing evil to accuse us of, is put to shame, and the accuser cannot accuse. But in the Latin language, devil signifies accuser.
