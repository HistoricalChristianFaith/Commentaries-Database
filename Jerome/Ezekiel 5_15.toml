(Verse 15) And you will be a reproach and a blasphemy, an example and a wonder among the nations around you. For in the Septuagint it is written: And it will be στενακτὴ, which means mournful. And in Theodotion it is added, καὶ δηλαἳστὴ; the meaning of this word is unknown to us. For this reason, three other interpreters have translated it as blasphemy, which is called Geddupha in Hebrew (). It follows:

When I pronounce judgment on you in my anger and wrath and in the fierce blows of my fury, in full view of your sinfulness, you groan and moan like the deserving city of Jerusalem, which experiences the wrath and indignation of God because it has offended him. This is also confirmed by the words of Paul, who says, 'We were by nature children of wrath, just like everyone else' (Ephesians 2:3). And again, 'While we are in this tent, we groan and are burdened' (2 Corinthians 5). We also say with Jerusalem, 'I will endure the wrath of the Lord, because I have sinned against him.' Some interpret 'Δηλαἳστὴν' or 'δηλαίαν' as unfortunate and miserable, while others believe it to mean clear and exposed to miseries.
