(Verse 22) But Jesus answered and said: You do not know what you ask. The mother asks, and the Lord speaks to the disciples, understanding her prayers to come from the will of the children.

Can you drink the cup that I am about to drink? They said to him: We can. In the Holy Scriptures, we understand the cup to represent suffering, as it is written: Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from me (Matt. XXVI, 39). And in the psalm: What shall I render to the Lord for all the things he has rendered to me? I will take the cup of salvation, and will call upon the name of the Lord (Ps. CXV, 3 et seqq.); and immediately it explains what this cup is: Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his saints.
