(Verse 10) And joy and gladness shall be taken away from Carmel. It is the language of the Scriptures that always compares Mount Carmel, which overlooks Ptolemais and contains abundant forests, where Elijah prayed, to fertility and abundance, and thus signifies that all joy and fertility shall be taken away from once prosperous cities.

And in the vineyards there will be no rejoicing or jubilation. It is understood that the previous grape harvester, that is, the colonist of the Moabite province, will not be there. Finally, he immediately added:

Wine will not be pressed in the winepress by the one who was accustomed to tread it: I have taken away the voice of the treaders. The joyful grape harvester will by no means sing a song of celebration in the vineyard, but everywhere there will be the devastation of the enemy, and the cry of the victorious will arise.
