"Then I
said to myself concerning men: God has chosen them out, but only to see that
they themselves are as beasts. For the
fate of men and the fate of beast - they have one and the same fate: as one
dies so the other dies, and they all have the same spirit. Man has no superiority over beast, for all is
futile. All go to the same place; all
originate from dust and return to dust. 
Who perceives that the spirit of man is the one that ascends on high
while the spirit of the beast is the one that descends down into the
earth?" It is not surprising that there is no distinction in
this life between righteous and wicked, nor that none values virtues, but all
things occur with uncertain outcome, where nothing seems to differ according to
the worthlessness of the body between sheep and men: there is the same birth,
common end in death; we proceed similarly towards the light and are equally
dissolved into the dust. But there seems
to be this difference, that the spirit of man ascends to the heavens, and the
spirit of animals goes down into the earth, but from where do we know this for
certain? Who can know whether what is
hoped is true or false? But he says
this, not because he thinks the spirit dies with the body, or that there's one
place set aside for beasts and for man, but because before the arrival of
Christ all were led equally to the nether regions. Jacob said that he was about to go down to
those regions. [cfr Gen. 37, 35 ; 42, 38 ; 44, 31.] And Job complains that the pious and impious
are held back in the lower world. [cfr Iob. 7, 9 ; 17, 13.16.] And the Gospel says that with an abyss
blocking the way even Abraham and Lazarus were rich in prayers in the underworld. [cfr Luc. 16, 26.] And in fact before Christ accompanied by a
robber opened the wheel of flames, and the fiery rumpias [A long missile weapon of barbarian nations.]
and the gates of paradise, the heavens were closed and the equal unworthiness
of the spirits of sheep and of men was abridged. One also seems to be dispersed and the other
saved; but there is not much of a difference between dying with the body or
being held in the darkness of the underworld. 
Let us look over these things one by one in paragraphs, and discuss them
briefly. I considered the eloquence of
the sons of man, whom God chose. Only
this eloquence, he says, God wanted to be between men and beasts, since we
speak, they are mute; we possess the will for conversation, they are stupefied
with silence. And though we only differ
from beasts in language, though it is shown to us, how we are like the beasts -
weak in body. Just as a beast dies, thus
man dies, and one breath is for all, and that is the air that we breathe. For he says this: "and one spirit is for
both, and there is nothing more for man than for beast." Since lest we think the text refers to the
soul he adds: "all are made from earth and return to the earth." But nothing else except the body is made from
earth, and quite relevant, regarding the body he continues: "you are earth
and to the earth you will return." [Gen. 3.19.] But this seems to be blasphemy: for who knows
if the spirit of the sons of man ascends upwards, or if the spirit of beasts
goes downwards into the earth? He does
not contend that there is no difference between animals and men in reference to
the dignity of the soul, but in adding "who?" he wants to show the
difficulty of the matter. For the
pronoun "who" is used in the Holy Scriptures not on account of impossibility,
but a difficulty. So here it is said in
that passage, "who will describe that man's generation?" [Is. 53, 8.],
and in the psalm: "Lord, who ascends in your tabernacle, and onto your
sacred mountain?" [Ps. 14, 1.],
and other examples that follow this pattern. 
And in Jeremiah it can be said differently in Hebrew: "And he is a
man, and who knows him?" [Ier. 17, 9.]. This then, is the only difference between
beast and men, that the spirit of man ascends to the heaven, and the spirit of
the beast descends into the earth and is dispersed with the flesh; but let any
man, who is of the Church and learned in the religious disciplines, be the real
champion of the matter, which is rather doubtful. Then he adds just how much it refers to a
spiritual understanding: "since the Lord will keep both men and beasts
safe" [Ps. 35, 17.],
and in another place he says, "beasts, I am among you" [Ps. 72, 23.],
and all the prophets say that both men and beasts will be saved in Jerusalem,
and that the promised land will be filled with sheep and cattle. Who knows whether the saintly man, who is
worthy of the name of man, will ascend to heaven, and whether the sinner, who
is called beast, will go down into the earth? 
For it is possible in light of the uncertain and dangerous condition of
his life, that the righteous man falls and the sinner rises, and it sometimes
happens that man, having more reason and learned in the Scriptures, does not
look about himself, and although worthy of his knowledge lives out his life and
is led down to the nether world; and the simpler and unlearned man, who is said
to be compared to the beasts of men, lives better and is crowned in martyrdom,
and he is then to live in paradise.
