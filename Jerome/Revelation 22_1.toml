We believe in the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, that is true, and that they are a Trinity; nevertheless the kingship is one. “I saw a single throne set up, and I saw a single Lamb standing in the presence of the throne.” This refers to the incarnation of the Savior. Scripture says, “Behold the lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world.” “And there was a fountain of water coming forth from beneath the middle of the throne.” Notice that it is from the midst of the throne that there issues forth a river of graces. That river does not issue forth from the throne unless the Lamb is standing before it, for unless we believe in the incarnation of Christ, we do not receive those graces.
