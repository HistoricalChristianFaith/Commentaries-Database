Older men should be sober, honorable, chaste, sound in faith, love, and patience. Titus, before directing him what he should say to everyone, in what he says, "But you speak what befits sound doctrine," he explains in detail what is appropriate for each age group. First what is appropriate for older men, then what is appropriate for older women, thirdly what is appropriate for young people, both men and women: although in the commandment of older women he included instructions regarding young women, so that he did not teach young children, but explained what they should be taught by older women. Finally, he fittingly established rules for servants, and for each age and condition, so that his speech becomes a guide to life and morals. Therefore, older men should be sober, or watchful, since "νηφάλιοι" means both in Greek: honorable, so that the gravity of age decorates the gravity of morals: chaste, lest they luxuriate in someone else's youth, lest they be an example for young people to ruin in their lusts after their own blood has already cooled. Healthy in faith, about which faith's health we have spoken above. However, not only healthy in faith, but also in charity and in patience, so that when they have obtained the first health of faith, they may hear from the Savior: Your faith has saved you (Mark 10:52). And elsewhere: For I have not found such great faith even in Israel (Matthew 8:10). And by means of the same health of faith, let them become the children of Abraham, concerning whom it is written: Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him for righteousness (Genesis 15:8). And Habakkuk, referring to this health of faith, says: The just lives by my faith (Habakkuk 2:3). Read the Epistle to the Hebrews of the Apostle Paul (or whichever other you think it to be, because it is already recognized among the ecclesiastical), enumerate that whole list of faith, in which it is written: By faith Abel offered to God a greater sacrifice than Cain's (Hebrews 11:4 ff.). And: Enoch was translated so that he would not see death; and Noah, believing in God, built an ark for the things he had not yet seen. And Abraham went out into a land he did not know. And so that Scripture might not seem to give no example of faith to women, it is written in the same Epistle that Sarah also received strength to conceive seed, even beyond the time of her life, because she considered Him faithful who had promised. There, the faith of Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, Moses, and Rahab, and others who the reader of the Epistle can better know, are praised. So, how is faith the health of the soul? In the same way, this health is also found in charity. And who possesses the health of charity except the one who loves God first with all his heart, with all his soul, and with all his strength? Then, hearing Christ's commandment to love one's neighbor as oneself (Matthew 5), he divides charity into two: because all the Law and the Prophets depend on these two commandments. Whoever possesses the health of charity does not envy, does not boast, does not act improperly, does not behave dishonorably, is not easily angered, does not think evil, does not rejoice in wrongdoing, but rejoices in the truth, endures all things, believes all things, hopes all things, and waits for all things (1 Corinthians 13). And because love never fails, whoever is in the health of love, he never fails. For neither tribulation, nor distress, nor hunger, nor persecution, nor nakedness, nor danger, nor sword can separate him from the health of love, which he has in Jesus Christ. What shall I say about the sword and other minor things that cannot divide him who possesses the love of health when neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature can separate him who has the love of health in Jesus Christ? If we understand the health of love, let us take an example from the Scriptures of those who are in the weakness of love. The Savior says about the end times: Because iniquity hath abounded, the love of many shall wax cold (Matthew 24). For love is warm in those who are fervent in spirit, but cooling, freezing, and cold in those who have received the hardest blasts of the North Wind. "For from the north shall an evil break forth upon all the inhabitants of the land" (Jer. 1:14). Ammon too became hot in carnal desire for his sister Thamar because of this coldness of charity (2 Kings 13). Let us, then, fear lest we too are ever overcome by this infirmity of charity. Indeed, it sometimes happens that our first holy love is for a virgin or any other woman, and when our mind has been softened by affection, the healthy state of charity gradually fades away and begins to grow weak, and carries the loving soul to its last breath. Hence the Apostle rightly and prudently charges Timothy to encourage younger women to preserve their chastity in all things (1 Tim. 5). But all chastity is in flesh and spirit and soul, lest our eye be offended, lest we become enchained by the beauty of a woman's face, lest listening to sweet words delight us, lest our heart be first softened by counterfeit conversation. Therefore let them be careful, as we have said, both young and old, both girls and elderly women, and let them guard their hearts with all diligence: lest through the health of their love, the sickness of charity enters, and through holy love, unholiness becomes love, which draws them towards hell. Let him who is sound in faith, who is sound in charity, also be sound in patience: and patience, which is especially tested in temptations: because it is of no benefit to have the wealth and merchandise enumerated above, unless all the goods and merchandise with which the ship is laden are preserved in the storm, and, being blown hither and thither by winds, the things which have been well acquired are saved without shipwreck. For he who shall have persevered even to the end, he shall be saved (Matthew 24:13).
