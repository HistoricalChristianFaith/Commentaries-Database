(Verse 11) I will overthrow you as God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah, and you will become like a bundle snatched from the fire, and yet you did not return to me, says the Lord. LXX: I will overthrow you as God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah, and you will become like a bundle plucked from the fire, but even so you did not turn back to me, says the Lord. This is the ultimate remedy for the ten tribes, the heretics, and all sinners. After sending death along the way of Egypt and striking down their young men with the sword, and consuming their horses, and bringing the stench of their camps into their nostrils, and yet they did not return to Him, may He overthrow them as He overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah. And when they are overthrown, for the likeness of the crimes of Sodom and Gomorrah, and the worst of their buildings is burned by divine fire, they themselves will be delivered like a bundle snatched from the fire. And how Lot, while Sodom was perishing, was saved, losing his possessions and part of his body, namely his wife, as we understand (Gen. XIX): so let all those who lose the riches of Sodom be found naked, according to what we read in the Apostle: If anyone's work which he has built endures, he will receive a reward: if anyone's work is burned, he will suffer loss: but he himself will be saved, yet so as through fire (I Cor. III, 14, 15). Therefore, whoever is saved by fire is snatched away like a torch from a fire. And concerning those people whom the Savior was rebuking in the Gospel, saying, 'If you were children of Abraham, you would do the works of Abraham' (John 8:39), John the Baptist says, 'Progeny of vipers, who warned you to flee from the coming wrath?' (Matthew 3:7, 8, 9) So produce worthy fruits of repentance, and do not say within yourselves, 'We have Abraham as our father.' For I tell you, that God is able of these stones to raise up children to Abraham. Therefore, both Israel and all heretics, because they had the works of Sodom and Gomorrah, are overthrown like Sodom and Gomorrah: that they may be delivered, as it were, a brand plucked out of the fire. And this is what we read in the prophet: Sodom shall be restored to her former state (Ezek. 16:55): so that whoever is a Sodomite by his own fault, after the works of Sodom have burned in him, may be restored to his former condition.
