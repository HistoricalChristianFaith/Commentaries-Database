For the purpose of proclaiming, he had sent his disciples before him and ordered them to announce his arrival. But he advised them lest they say publicly that he was Jesus Christ. It seems to me to be one thing to proclaim him to be Christ, another thing to proclaim him to be Jesus Christ. Christ is a common term for the messianic dignity, while Jesus is the proper name for the Savior. It is possible that for this reason he had been unwilling to be proclaimed Jesus Christ prior to his suffering and resurrection in order that he might afterwards, when the obligation of blood had been fulfilled, at an opportune time say to his apostles, “Go and teach all nations” and the rest. And lest anyone think that this is merely our opinion and not the perceptions of the Evangelist, then what follows explains further the reasons for the prohibited proclamation.

(Verse 20) Then he commanded his disciples not to tell anyone that he was Jesus Christ. Before sending the disciples to preach, he had ordered them to announce his coming: here he instructed them not to say that he was Jesus Christ. It seems to me that preaching Christ is one thing, and preaching Jesus Christ is another. Christ is a common name of dignity: Jesus is the proper name of the Savior. However, it may be that before his passion and resurrection, he did not want to be preached; but after the completion of the sacrament of his blood, he would more fittingly say to the apostles: Go, teach all nations (Matthew last chapter, verse 19), etc. So that no one thinks that our intelligence alone, and not the Gospel teachings that follow, explain the reasons for the prohibition of preaching at that time.
