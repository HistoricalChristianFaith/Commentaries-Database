Note that it was not the suffering victim but the demon who had to be directly rebuked. It may be that he indirectly rebuked the boy and the demon went out of him because it was owing to his sins that the demon had oppressed him.

(Verse 18) And they said, why could we not cast him out? Jesus said to them: Because of your unbelief. Amen I say to you. This is what he says in another place: Whatever you ask in my name, believing, you will receive (John 15:2). Therefore, whenever we do not receive, it is not due to the impossibility of the one granting, but the fault of those praying.
