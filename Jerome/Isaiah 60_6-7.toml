(Verse 6, 7) The flood of camels shall cover you, the dromedaries of Midian and Ephah. All those from Sheba shall come, bringing gold and frankincense, and proclaiming the praise of the Lord. All the flocks of Kedar shall be gathered to you, the rams of Nebaioth shall minister to you; they shall be offered on my acceptable altar, and I will glorify the house of my majesty. LXX: And the herds of camels shall come to you, the camels of Midian and Ephah shall cover you; all those from Sheba shall come, bringing gold and frankincense, and proclaiming the salvation of the Lord. All the flocks of Cedar shall be gathered unto thee, the rams of Nebaioth shall minister unto thee: they shall come up with acceptance on mine altar, and I will glorify the house of my glory. Who are these that fly as a cloud, and as the doves to their windows? Surely the isles shall wait for me, and the ships of Tarshish first, to bring thy sons from far, their silver and their gold with them, unto the name of the LORD thy God, and to the Holy One of Israel, because he hath glorified thee. And the sons of strangers shall build up thy walls, and their kings shall minister unto thee: for in my wrath I smote thee, but in my favour have I had mercy on thee. Therefore thy gates shall be open continually; they shall not be shut day nor night; that men may bring unto thee the forces of the Gentiles, and that their kings may be brought. For the nation and kingdom that will not serve thee shall perish; yea, those nations shall be utterly wasted. The regions of Midian and Ephah are across Arabia, fertile for camels, and the whole province is called Sheba, where the Queen of Sheba was, who came to hear the wisdom of Solomon: and she brought gold and frankincense, bringing many things to the peaceful king, and receiving even greater things from him (3 Kings 10). But the region of the Saracens is called Kedar, who are called Ishmaelites in Scripture. And Nebajoth is one of the sons of Ishmael, from whose names the desert is named, which is lacking in crops but full of cattle. Therefore, through the names of the barbarian peoples who are near Israel, the conversion of the whole world is preached. For Midian, indeed, is interpreted as wickedness in this place. Ephah, loosened, or pouring out. Sheba, conversion, or captivity. Kedar, darkness. Nebaioth, prophecies. Therefore, the flocks of camels, being freed from the bonds of wickedness and pouring out their souls to God, will cover Jerusalem with gifts, and all will come out of captivity, bringing the gold of faith with their conversion, and the incense of sacrifice. And not content with these gifts, they will progress, so that they may preach the salvation of God to others as well. That rich man, who carried the weight of riches like a camel in the Gospel, and a camel he was, did not want to hear the Lord's advice, nor be freed, so that, having thrown off the burden, he could fly to heaven on the wings of a dove; therefore, he went away sad. And about this kind of camel, the Savior speaks: It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven (Matthew 19:24). She proposed the difficulty of the thing, not the impossibility. Finally, your mother of sacred memory, Paula, and your brother Pammachius, through the eye of a needle, that is, through a narrow and tight path that leads to life, passed through the stars of heaven, leaving behind the wide road with burdens, which leads to Tartarus. Indeed, they carried whatever they had as gifts of the Lord, fulfilling what is written: The redemption of a man's soul is his own riches (Prov. XIII, 8). For what is impossible among humans is possible for God (Matthew 19). Having as principal gifts gold, in the sense of the best odor, and incense, and saying: Let my prayer be directed like incense in your sight. And: We are the good odor of Christ in every place (2 Corinthians 2, 15); by the example of his virtue, announcing the salvation of the Lord every day, so that all the sheep of Kedar may be gathered in the Church, and may pass from the darkness of error to the light. The rams of the Prophets, about whom it is sung in Psalm 28: Bring to the Lord, O sons of God, bring to the Lord the sons of rams, let them come and be offered, or according to Theodotion, let them offer themselves as a sacrifice to the Lord, and let them become propitiatory victims, so that the Church of Christ may be glorified. The Savior spoke to his disciples about these kinds of sheep: Go to the lost sheep of the house of Israel (Matthew 10:3). And again: My sheep hear my voice (John 10:3). And in Ezekiel more fully: Behold, I will seek my sheep, and I will visit them: as the shepherd visiteth his flock. Thus saith the Lord God: I will require that which is lost, and bring back that which was driven away, and will bind up that which was broken, and will strengthen that which was weak, and that which was strong I will preserve: and I will feed them in judgment (Ezech. XXXIV, 11, 12). And that we may know what those sheep are, He explains more clearly: And they shall know that I am the Lord their God: and you, O my flocks, the flocks of my pasture, are men: and I am the Lord your God (Ibid., 27, 28). If therefore anyone among the Gentiles is wealthy, let him be saved like a camel, not without gifts and offerings, so that he may preach the word of the Lord. If anyone is like the simplicity of sheep and the authority of rams, let him ascend or be offered on the altar of the Lord by those who are in power, so that his house may be glorified. But what we have noted in Hebrew script: The rams of Nabajoth shall minister to you, and they shall offer on my acceptable altar, is properly understood of those who, chosen from among the Gentiles, are ministers of the Savior. But if someone is contentious and disputes these things in a carnal way, let us respond to him: We do not have such a custom, nor does the Church of God (1 Corinthians 11:16). And let us say that even if these things were promised carnally to the Jews, they were still promised conditionally, so that if they had received their own light, which had been sent to them, then they would also have followed these things. Namely, that through desire for gold and the abundance of wealth and carnal things, by which this nation was always captivated, they would receive the sent Son of God to themselves. But because they did not receive him, everything was taken away and the inheritance was spiritually restored to those who receive it.
