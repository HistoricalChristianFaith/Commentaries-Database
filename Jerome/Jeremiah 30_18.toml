A type of these events previously occurred in Zerubbabel and Ezra, when the people returned and the city was begun to be built on its heights and religion observed in the temple, all of which are contained in Ezra’s own book. But this was more fully and more perfectly completed in the Lord and Savior and his apostles, when the city was built on its heights—about which it is written, “A city set on a hill cannot be hidden”—and the temple was founded in accordance with its order and ceremony, so that whatever was done carnally by the people in the past would be completed spiritually in the church. Then praise went forth—or thanksgiving, for this is what thoda means—so that all of the apostles would be able to say “grace and peace to you.” The “voice of celebration” was not the kind of celebration in which people eat, drink, sleep and then get up to do it again for its own sake, but the kind of celebration that David enjoyed before the ark of the Lord. They were also multiplied and not diminished so that the entire world would believe in God the Savior. And they were glorified so that what was written would be fulfilled: “Glorious things are said of you, O city of God!” They were his children, that is, the apostles, as were Abraham, Isaac and Jacob from the beginning, the rulers of the people of Israel. Then the Lord made a visit against all who opposed the people of God, clearly powerful adversaries. And “their leader came from them”—undoubtedly a reference to the Lord and Savior, who was from the Israelite race according to the flesh—and “their ruler was produced from their midst.” The Father united this ruler to himself and drew near to him, as the Son would say: “I in the Father and the Father in me,” for no one is able thus to unite his heart to the Lord or to be joined to the Father as the Son. That it also says, “You will be my people, and I will be your God,” we determine to have been completed partly in Israel and fully in the multitude of nations.
