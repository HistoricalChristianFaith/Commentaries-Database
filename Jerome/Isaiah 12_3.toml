The one whom he entitled “Emmanuel” above, then “take the spoils,” “hasten to plunder,” and with other names, he now calls “Savior,” lest there appear to be another beyond him whom Gabriel announced to the Virgin, saying, “And you will call his name Jesus, for he will save his people.” He also prophesies that waters are to be drawn from his fonts—not from the waters of the rivers of Egypt, which were stricken, nor from the waters of the rivers of Rezin, but from the fonts of Jesus, for this is what “Savior” expresses in the Hebrew language. Hence Jesus himself cried out in the Gospel, “Let anyone who thirsts come to me and drink. Whoever believes in me, as the Scripture says, ‘rivers of living water will flow from his heart.’ This,” adds the evangelist, “he said of the Holy Spirit, whom those who believed in him were about to receive.” Jesus also says elsewhere in the Gospel, “The one who drinks from the water that I shall give him will never thirst again, for the water that I will give him will become in him a font of water springing up to eternal life.” We understand the fonts of the Savior to be evangelical doctrine, about which we read in the sixty-seventh psalm, “Blessed be the Lord God in the congregations from the fonts of Israel.”

“More majestic than the voices of many waters or the mighty waves of the sea.” These are the waters of Shiloah which run in silence, about which Isaiah speaks: “You will draw water from the fountains of salvation”; and the psalmist: “Bless the Lord from the fountains of Israel.” Again, Isaiah says about the Lord our Savior: “He will live in a dwelling on high, made of the strongest rock; bread will be given him, and his water supply will be sure.”
