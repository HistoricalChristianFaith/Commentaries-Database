We read in the prophet the words of God: “It is I who cleanse you from all your iniquities.” Consequently the scribes, because they were judgmental in construing the words of God, accused him of blasphemy. But the Lord, reading their thoughts, shows himself to be God who knows the hidden things of the heart. He breaks his silence: “With the same majesty and power by which I perceive your thoughts, I am able to forgive their sins; see for yourselves what the paralytic has received.”

(Verses 3, 4.) And behold, some of the scribes said to themselves: He blasphemes. And when Jesus saw their thoughts, he said: Why do you think evil in your hearts? We read in the Prophet, saying God: I am the one who blots out your iniquities (Isaiah 43:25). Therefore, the scribes, because they thought he was a man and did not understand the words of God, accuse him of blasphemy. But the Lord, seeing their thoughts, shows himself to be God, who can know the hidden things of the heart, and speaks in a silent manner: With the same majesty and power with which I behold your thoughts, I can also forgive sins to men. Understand what the paralytic suffers from among you.
