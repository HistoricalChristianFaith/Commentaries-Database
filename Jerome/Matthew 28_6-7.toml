(Vers. 6, 7.) Come and see the place where the Lord was laid. And quickly going, say to his disciples. That if you do not believe my words, you may believe in the empty tomb, and go with quick steps and announce to his disciples.

Because he has risen, and behold, he goes before you to Galilee: there you will see him: behold, I have told you.
