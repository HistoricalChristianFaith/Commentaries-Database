"For
everything has its time and justice, for man's evil overwhelms him. Indeed he does not know what will happen, for
when it happens , who will tell him? "Many good and bad things can befall a man,
but even a righteous man is not able to know what will befall him, or know the
causes and reasons for each thing, (for no one can know what will happen), but
he does know that all things are done by God to the advantage of man, and
nothing is done without His will. For
this is a great sufferance for mankind, since as the poet says: "the mind
of man knows not his lot and coming fate" [Virg. Aen. 10, 501.]. If he hopes for one thing, then another
happens; he expects the enemy to come from one direction and is wounded by a
spear from the opposite direction. But
here Theodotion and the Septuagint have said, "since the knowledge of man
overwhelms him", the Hebrew has 'wickedness' not 'knowledge'. But because the Hebrew letters 'Resh' and
'Daleth' are similar without the serif, instead of "raath "they have read "daat, "that
is instead of 'wickedness', 'knowledge'. 
This is easier to understand if you have knowledge of the language. Note too, that which is written at the end of
the verse: 'since he doesn't know what has been, and what will be after him,
who will tell him?' I have translated
word for word here from the Hebrew text, so that we can see that there is a
different meaning, since we are clearly not able to know those things which
have already passed away, or those that will be, as they have yet to be done.
