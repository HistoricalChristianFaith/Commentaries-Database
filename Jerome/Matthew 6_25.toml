Some MSS. add here, nor what ye shall drinkb. That which belongs naturally to all animals alike, to brutes and beasts of burden as well as to man, from all thought of this we are not freed. But we are bid not to be anxious what we should eat, for in the sweat of our face we earn our bread; the toil is to be undergone, the anxiety put away. This Be not careful, is to be taken of bodily food and clothing; for the food and clothing of the spirit it becomes us to be always careful.

The command is therefore, not to be anxious what we shall eat. For it is also commanded, that in the sweat of our face we must eat bread. Toil therefore is enjoined, carking forbidden,

He who has given the greater, will He not also give the less?

(Verse 25.) Therefore I say to you: Do not be anxious about your souls, what you will eat, nor about your bodies, what you will wear. In some manuscripts it is added: nor what you will drink. Therefore, we are completely freed from the care of what nature gives to all, and is common to animals and humans. But it is commanded to us not to be anxious about what we will eat: because in the sweat of our face we prepare bread for ourselves. Labor must be exercised, worry must be removed. What is said here: Do not be anxious about what you will eat, or about what you will wear (Gen. III), let us take it as referring to physical food and clothing. However, we should always be concerned about spiritual food and clothing.
