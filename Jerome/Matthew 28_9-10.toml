Two different feelings occupied the minds of the women: fear and joy. Fear came from the magnitude of the miracle they had witnessed and joy from their desire for the resurrection. Nevertheless both feelings impelled their steps. They continued on to the apostles so that through them the seed of faith would be scattered.“And behold, Jesus met them, saying ‘Hail!’ ” They who sought him out and ran to him deserved to be the first to meet the risen Lord and to hear him say, “Hail.” Thus it happened that Eve’s curse was undone by these women.
