Noah was near to the world’s flood, because the whole earth had polluted the ways of the Lord, but he was not able to spread it abroad; but his children, who happen to be of the same virtue and from the seed of the human race, he had protected. Daniel also calmed the captivity of the people of Israel without even crying. But Job, not because of his sins but because of his trial, freed neither house nor children.
