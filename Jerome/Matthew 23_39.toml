By “Jerusalem” He means not the stones and buildings, but the dwellers there, over whom He laments with the feeling of a Father.
“I say unto you, Ye shall not see Me” That is to say, Unless ye shall do penitence, and shall confess that I am He of whom the Prophets have spoken, the Son of the Almighty Father, ye shall not see My face. Thus the Jews have atime allowed for their repentance. Let them confess Him blessed who cometh in the name of the Lord, and they shall then behold Christ’s face.
