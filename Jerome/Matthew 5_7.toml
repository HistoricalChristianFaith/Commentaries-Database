Mercy here is not said only of alms, but is in every sin of a brother, if we bear one another's burdens.

(Verse 7) Blessed are the merciful, for they will be shown mercy. Mercy is not only understood in acts of charity, but also in bearing each other's burdens in every sin, if we carry the burdens of one another (Galatians 6).
