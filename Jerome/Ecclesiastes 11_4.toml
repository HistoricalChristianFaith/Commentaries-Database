"He that observes the wind shall not sow; and
he that regards the clouds shall not reap. 
"He who considers
what is good for him and does not give out to all who ask him, often destroys
what he ought to receive. [Cfr. Luc 6, 30.] Differently: he who proclaims the word of God
at the time when the people listen freely and a second wind of rumour comes, he
is a negligent and lazy farmer. But
favourably or not in his career he must proclaim the word of God [Cfr II Tim. 4, 2.];
and he must not think of the storm of adverse clouds in his time of faith. This is written in Proverbs: "just as
the rains are heavy and unyielding, so are they who leave wisdom and praise
impiety" [Prov. 28, 3.4.]. Therefore you must sow your seeds in the
middle of a storm without thinking of the clouds and without fearing the
winds. And you must not say, 'that time
was convenient, this of no use', when we do not know which way and which will
is the one spirit of giving.
