(Verse 9) And I did it for the sake of my name, so that it would not be violated in the presence of the nations among whom they were, and among whom I appeared to them to bring them out of the land of Egypt. What I planned to do, I did it for the sake of justice, not because of the greatness of my mercy, so that my name would not be defiled and it would seem that I could not fulfill what I had promised to Israel. Therefore, I spared my name, so that the nations among whom I became known to them in the land of Egypt would not have an opportunity to blaspheme. The prophet describes what He had promised to them when they were settled in the land of Egypt, and how they immediately offended, and what the Lord had planned against them, and yet did not do. The following things, He spoke after their departure from Egypt.
