"Ephraim is struck: their root has dried up, they will bear no fruit. Even if they do, I will kill the beloved offspring of their womb. My God will reject them because they did not listen to him, and they will wander among the nations." LXX: "Ephraim grieves over his roots: they are withered, and bear no fruit, and even if they give birth, I will kill the cherished offspring of their wombs. God will reject them because they have not listened to him, and they will wander among the nations." It takes a metaphor from a tree, which if its roots are dried up, it will not be able to bear fruit, and if it does even a little, it will soon wither in its own flower. But he speaks of Ephraim, whose root is withered, because he destroyed the God in whom he was founded, or did not deserve to have his fathers Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, in whom he had sent his roots: and therefore he does not bear the fruit of righteousness; and if he does, "I will slay," he said, "the dearest of his womb," according to what he had said above: "If they bring up their children, I will make them childless among men:" hence God rejected them and made them go into captivity. "And they shall wander among the nations." We can say this about all the Jews whose leaders have departed from God, stirring up the people to demand his death; therefore, he cast them out of his house and will not love them anymore. He struck their root and dried it up, and they will never bear fruit again, even if they study the Holy Scripture and the Law, and produce something of knowledge and doctrine from their heart as if they were beloved children; the Lord will oppose them and they will be cut off. For God has rejected them, all the prophets, because they did not listen to Him; and they will wander among the nations, not having an altar, not having a seat, not having a proper city. Therefore, David also speaks in the psalm: "Do not kill them, lest my people forget: scatter them by your power" (Psalm 59:12). And in another place: "Expel them according to the multitude of their impieties, for they have provoked You, Lord" (Psalm 5:12). We read about this tree also in the Gospel: 'Now the ax is laid at the root of the trees, and every tree therefore that does not produce good fruit will be cut down and thrown into fire' (Matthew 3:10). Let no one doubt that heretics are incapable of producing the fruits of virtues, because they have lost the Lord, on whom, according to the Apostle, they ought to have been rooted and founded (Ephesians 3). And even if they should produce some fruit and generate some offspring by the fertility of their own womb, they will die with the Lord being against them. Whether because their fruits are all those things which they imagine and generate from their own heart, they will wither and perish: and it will be clear to all that a dry root cannot produce fruits. These will be cast away, indeed they are cast away by God, because they did not listen to him saying: "Do not move the boundaries which your fathers have established" (Deut. XIX, 14). And for this reason they will wander among nations, passing from these opinions to those, since it does not please them to keep what they have once found, but always changing old things for new, and imitating the errors of the pagans.
