He claims that this is how an Epicurus would speak, or an Aristippus5 and his Cyrenian flowers, or the other philosophers who preach carnal pleasures. But when I diligently reconsider the question, I find nothing to support such vile conclusions that everything happens by chance and that fortune has free rein in human affairs. Rather the truth is that everything is under God’s judgment. The fleet of foot ought not to think that the footrace is his, any more than the strong person should confide in his brute strength. Nor should the wise person reckon that wealth and opulence go with prudence, nor should the learned orator reckon that he can find favor with the crowd because of his learning and eloquence. Rather, everything happens by the disposition of God, and except he govern everything by his will and build the house, they labor in vain who build it. And unless he guard the city, they keep watch in vain who set a guard over it.

Atticus: Therefore, they are wrong in their thinking who rule out the help of God in every single action that we perform and who seek to twist the true meaning to other meanings by putting forth interpretations that are perverted, nay more, worthy of ridicule, on the following passage: “Except the Lord build the house, they labor in vain that build it. Except the Lord keep the city, he watches in vain who keeps it.”
