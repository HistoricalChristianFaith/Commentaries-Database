(Verse 3) And the spirit of Egypt shall be destroyed in its bowels, and I will overthrow its counsel: and they shall inquire of their idols and their diviners, and their pythons and soothsayers. When a rebellion arises in Egypt, whether those desiring to serve Babylon, or those unwilling to submit their necks to its yoke, or others believing in Christ while others resist, the spirit of Egypt shall be destroyed and divided, not the same for all who desire it, and all their counsel shall be reduced to nothing. Then they will go to their statues; and they will question the divine beings, the soothsayers, the prophets, and those skilled in magical arts, why these things have happened.
