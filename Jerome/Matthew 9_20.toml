The Gospel according to Luke says that the ruler’s daughter was twelve years old. Note also that the woman concerned, who was from the Gentiles, began to get sick at a place believed to be in a Jewish district. Except by way of contrast between physical conditions, the girl’s ailment is not indicated. As for the woman who had a hemorrhage, she approached the Lord not in her home or in the town (because according to the law she was excluded from towns) but while the Lord was walking by, so that in the course of going to one woman, another was cured. The apostles say in this regard, “It was necessary that the word of God should be spoken first to you. Since you judge yourselves unworthy of eternal life, behold, we turn to the Gentiles.”

(Ver. 20) And behold, a woman who had been suffering from a flow of blood for twelve years came up behind Him and touched the fringe of His cloak. In the Gospel according to Luke, it is written that the daughter of a ruler had reached the age of twelve (Luke 8). Note, therefore, that during that time this woman, that is, the people of the Gentiles, began to be sick, while the people of the Jews believed. For unless a comparison of virtues is made, vice is not revealed. But this woman, flowing with blood, does not approach the Lord in the house, nor in the city, for according to the Law she was excluded from the cities (Leviticus 15, Numbers 5); but on the way, as the Lord walks, so that while He goes to another, another may be healed. Hence the apostles say: 'It was necessary that the word of God should be preached to you, but since you judged yourselves unworthy of salvation, we turn to the Gentiles' (Acts 13:46).
