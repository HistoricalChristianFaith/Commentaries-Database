(Verse 13 onwards) Behold, your people, women in your midst: the gates of your land will be opened wide to your enemies: fire will devour your bars. Draw water for the siege: build your fortifications, go into the mud, and trample: force the brick. There the fire will consume you; you will perish by the sword, you will be devoured like the chigoe: gather therefore like the chigoe: multiply like the locust. You have made more deals than there are stars in the sky: the chigoe has spread out and flown away. Your guards are like locusts, and your little ones are like the grasshoppers of locusts, which settle in the hedges in the cold weather. The sun rises, and they have flown away, and the place where they were will not be known. LXX: Behold, your people are like women in you, opening the gates of your land to your enemies: fire devours your bars. Draw water for the siege, strengthen your fortifications: go into the mud and trample in the straw, strengthen it upon the brick. There the fire will devour you, the sword will scatter you; it will devour you like a locust. Multiply yourselves like the locust, multiply your trades like the stars of heaven. Yet even now, in Nineveh, it is said: 'Your strong men are like the ripe figs, which when shaken fall into the mouth of the eater. Your people have become effeminate and unable to resist.' Your gates will be opened wide, and the city will be exposed to the enemy. The strongest bars that secured the gates will be consumed by fire. So, gather water and make sure there is no shortage of drink for the besieged garrison: make bricks, so that you can build up the interrupted walls, for the siege is close at hand. And when you have done all these things, just as the earth is devoured by drought, so shall you be devoured by the sword. But even when you have multiplied like the drought and gathered together like locusts, and gathered together your riches like the stars of the sky, like locusts and drought, and the small offspring of locusts, which are called attelabi (Al. adtelebi), flying away when the sun grows hot, they are not found: thus you will disperse and flee. For it is the nature of locusts that they become sluggish in the cold and fly in the heat. Furthermore, the attelabus, which the eagle interprets as a more significant devourer, is a small locust between the locust and the cankerworm, crawling with small wings rather than flying, and always leaping up: and for this reason, wherever it arises, it consumes everything to dust, because until its wings grow, it cannot fly away. I have explained these things more clearly, following the Hebrew text, in order to make it easier for the reader to understand. But I will speak according to the beginning of the Translation, following the Septuagint, first briefly, that is, as in an epitome, and then more fully, discussing each point separately: Your people, O Nineveh, that is, the secular men who are properly called the people of the city of Assyria, are so weakened by passions and enfeebled by vices that they are compared to the weakness of women; for they possess nothing strong or manly in their souls. Therefore, their enemies, prevailing against them, have opened all their senses and entered through the gates of their bodies. And notably, the senses of the body are called the gates of the Assyrian land. Moreover, even those who have enslaved themselves to vices have the opportunity to know God, like very strong bolts, with which they block and seal the gates of the senses. But they will also be consumed by the fire, which is carried by burning arrows, which is why it is said to Nineveh: Draw water for yourself, and cleanse yourself with the word and reason, and use the opportunities to understand God and to exercise the virtues that are inherent in you, for the sake of battle. But you, with your loose hands, that is, with the works of pleasure, have lost whatever strength you had: therefore turn back and repent, and again obtain your defences. And because you have once entered into mud, and are shut up in a body (which is compacted together like earth and straw and water, so also with flesh, blood, veins, nerves, and bones), endure the injuries and necessities of the body: and suffer to be trodden down by enemies, and endure all things that are worthy of repentance in order to accomplish the flesh. For once, assuming clay and chaff, and involved in the empty matters of this world, you must willingly endure injury and yet not completely despair of salvation: be confident, and subject your body, that is, your clay, to the assumed word as if you were bringing water into servitude, and submit yourself to it, so that you may rule over your clay; otherwise, unless you do this, the living flame will consume you afterwards, either as punishment through Gehenna, or by the burning darts of the enemy raised up: and not only will you be laid waste by fire, but the sword will also devour you like a green locust on the earth. And if you were not to endure this, you would fall heavily upon the brick, and, weighed down by your own burden, losing all elevation, you would be dragged down to the ground, just as a beetle suddenly falls to the ground when it can no longer fly. Therefore, you should have virtues so countless, just like a beetle, so that you are not dragged down to the ground by your own weight, just like a beetle. All of these things which you have suffered, since you have multiplied riches for yourself and engaged in various doctrines, thinking that they shine more brightly than the stars and gleam more than the stars of the sky. These things, as I have said, have been briefly spoken by us to comprehend the meaning: now returning to the beginning of the chapter, let us explain each one as best we can. Who would not say that beautiful Nineveh, a soul naturally beautiful, delving into the delights and pleasures of this age, has come to feminine delicacies and, having lost its manhood, has languished into a woman? For if a righteous soul, coming into perfect manhood and preserving the strictness of its condition, adhering to God, becomes one spirit with Him: why should not, on the contrary, a soul that loves the world, become one with the world and, reduced to softness, lose the strength of manliness? I think for this reason in Exodus, Pharaoh commanded that every male who is born to the Hebrews be thrown into the river, and every female be kept alive. For the Egyptian king, who says elsewhere: The rivers are mine, and I made them, could not command anything other than this, that whatever is Hebrew, and their descendants who pass through this age, perhaps even their males, be thrown into the water and carried away through their currents into the sea. And, on the other hand, whatever appears feminine, soft, and beautiful in this world, is vivified, grows, and generates. At the same time, consider that the Egyptian emperor cannot kill the Hebrew men, nor those who have already left infancy, but those whose age is still tender, and whose body is soft, and whose progress is beginning: he knows that women cannot be nurtured unless the males have been killed. Therefore, he wants to suffocate in the depths of his river whatever is by chance strong and masculine among the Hebrews, so that those things which are feminine may grow more freely on their own. But what follows: Your enemies will open the gates of your land openly, you will be able to understand, taking testimony from Jeremiah, in which it is written: Death has come up through our windows (Jer. IX, 21). And what is asserted to be demonstrated by Jeremiah through windows, you will relate to these very gates. For knowing that divine speech has twofold meaning, to distinguish evil meanings, it says in Proverbs: You will find divine understanding. But here you should not take 'sense' to mean 'mind and intellect,' which in Greek is called νοῦς, but rather 'sensation,' from which the five senses are named: sight, smell, taste, touch, and hearing. Therefore, the gates of Nineveh are to be understood as bodily senses, while the gates of Jerusalem are heavenly, representing all divine and supernatural senses. The people of Nineveh open these gates through sight and hearing, as well as through all the other senses, by seeking to pursue bodily pleasures, which close the gates of God for humans, blocking their ears so they do not hear the judgment of blood, shutting their eyes so they do not see wickedness, closing their nostrils so they do not inhale the first scent of temptation into the softening of their souls, closing their mouths to gluttony and restraining their hands from soft touch, so that their belly, inflamed with desire, does not force their burning soul into embraces with women. But those who are the people of God open their senses, that is, the gates of the heavenly Jerusalem, so that the word of God may enter them. An example of evil gates is: You have exalted me from the gates of death. And an example of good gates is: That I may declare all your praises in the gates of the daughter of Zion (Ps. IX, 15). When you see someone who loves pleasures more than they love God, and is given to luxury, immediately say about them: He has opened the gates of his land to his enemies, for they do not open the gates to their soul's friends, but to their enemies they open the gates of the land of Nineveh. But if these who are considered the leaders of the people also do the same, you will not hesitate to say about them: The rulers of my people have been driven out of their luxurious houses. But if you see them indulging in pleasures and being hindered by excessive luxury, having no compassion for the poor, and not being concerned for the people of God, you will apply to them what follows: Those who sleep on ivory beds and revel in their pleasures, those who eat young goats from the flocks and calves from the herds, those who drink wine to excess and are anointed with the finest oils; but they do not care about the downfall of Joseph (Amos 6:4). Furthermore, what is said: Your stakes are devoured by fire, is as follows: If there was any natural good in your soul, which could protect and defend against enemies who were attempting to break through the gates of your senses, like stakes, it was consumed by the fire of Babylon. And also, draw for yourself the water of fortification, it is said from the speech of God, that it may surround itself with the strongest wall of the teachings and reasoning of Scriptures, so that the enemy may not be able to invade its innermost parts. Get, he says, your defenses. Whatever good you have by nature and the beginning of the best creator in you, oh unfortunate soul of Nineveh, hold on to for your defense, and do not allow the outflow from the ruling authority of the heart. But what is added after this: Walk (or cut) into the mud, and trample in the streets: perhaps someone else might think that it speaks of the soul, which, being fixed in the mud of the body and the husks of this world, of course empty and fleeting, is completely trampled by demons. But it seems to me that this is said to her: Endure temptations, injuries, to which you are subject: the punishments you suffer are deserved; for if you tread upon the empty and fragile affairs of this world, you know that you sustain them for your remedy, if indeed you attain the mark and subjugate the flesh to the rule of the soul. Finally, it follows: There the fire shall consume you. If you are not on the mark, and do not have dominion over the flesh, but remain on the side, and love chaff, and live alongside the flesh in the fashion of the flesh, not only will the burning arrows of the enemy consume you; but his sword will also kill you, and whatever appeared green in you like locusts, and what was naturally producing good, will be consumed by the greedy tooth: and like a eating moth without flight: and burdened by its own weight: so too you, burdened by the weight of sins, are drawn down to the earth. Therefore, in order to avoid such things and endure such great things, you should multiply like a weevil, and have as many virtues as it has numbers. For you have multiplied your businesses and gathered riches by fair means and foul means, as if you desired to possess heavenly things, which are destined to perish. You should equal the multitude of your sins with the multitude of virtues. I had come close to understanding it according to the Hebrew text, up to the point where it says: The sun rose and they flew away, and the place where they were is not known. And I said what seemed to me in the context of the very discourse. Now because the LXX seem to have their own meaning, having set aside their testimony, I will follow the order of the explanation that has been begun.

LXX: The Bruchus attacked and flew away; it leapt out like your mixed-breed Attelabus, like a locust that rises above the hedge on a frosty day; the sun rose and it leapt out, and did not recognize its place. Woe to them. It seems to me that the multitude of Nineveh is without a ruler, mixed together without order, and wherever the rushing impulse takes it, it is compared to a bruchus, a small and innumerable animal, which appears to lift itself a little bit from the ground. But also the attelabus, which in Greek is called συμμικτὸς, and in Latin is translated as 'commixticium', is known among us as the common people gathered from different nations, that is, not citizens, but foreigners. Hence, it is said that the people of Israel who came out of Egypt had a great mixture, that is, Egyptians, Ethiopians, and various other nations. And here, so to speak, the mixed population of Nineveh is compared to the attelabus and the locust, which, during the day of cold when it cannot fly, remains in a hedge, and then, when the sun rises and warms it up, it leaps out and flies to other regions, completely forgetting the hedge where it had sat during the cold. These things have been said in a paraphrastic manner so that the speech of the prophet himself can be understood more easily. Nevertheless, you cannot doubt that the multitude of men, who travel along the broad way, moves about in the world like a caterpillar when you see them completely devoted to the earth, running around with the levity of opinion, and unable to fly to higher things. Behold Rome and Constantinople, changing their former name for poverty. See Alexandria, the head of Egypt, and when there is either a shortage of grain or (which is a shame and embarrassment) a riot stirred up on account of charioteers and mimes and actors, the people rush about like a caterpillar, attached to all vices with their levity, and fly here and there with the change of opinion in a single moment: then you can truly say: The caterpillar has gone away with a sudden attack and has flown off. Furthermore, what follows, the attelabus jumped out, and your mixticius like a locust, I think the difference between mixticius and bruchus is that bruchus is compared to an ignorant and countless multitude, while mixticius is collected from various nations. And just as some are citizens in cities and others foreigners who like to live in a city that is not their own, I believe mixticius is someone who lives in Nineveh, who seems to follow certain doctrines of truth according to their own opinion, and in this regard they are better than bruchus because bruchus does nothing but always stays on the ground, without wings, serving only its food and belly. The attelabus, on the other hand, at least has small wings, and even though it cannot fly high, it still tries to jump out of the ground. And finally, when it reaches the locust, it does indeed fly, but its flight is not perpetual, for its feathers become weak, and it contracts from the cold, and the locust settles down, not on a fruitful tree with green leaves, but on a hedge, entwined with thorns and shrubs, or on a wall made up of random stones from here and there. Let us consider the wise men of Greece, and the Egyptians and Persians, and the Gymnosophists of India, and the Samaritans, and the various opinions among them: and the Jews, their Pharisees and Sadducees, and the many heresies of the Church, and we shall see a web being slightly raised from the ground, and a locust flying indeed, but not with full speed: and because it does not have the heat of the sun of justice, sitting in thorny bushes while charity towards God grows cold. For all their teachings, when they are cold and cannot fly, they find a seat and rest among the thorns of Aristotle and Chrysippus. From there Eunomius says: What is born did not exist before it was born. From there Manichaeus, in order to free God from the creation of evil, introduces another author of evil. From there Novatus withdraws forgiveness in order to remove repentance. And so, in conclusion, in a brief speech, they draw streams of all their arguments from those sources, in such a way that they even inscribe the places themselves from which the arguments are taken as titles. Therefore, this locust, which now sits in the bushes, when the time of judgment comes and the world heats up at the rising of the sun, will leave its seat and the places in which it clung during the time of cold; and, turned towards better things, it will not remember the previous seat. What we have said generally about the time of judgment can now be understood in part, so that through learned and wise men the light of justice may rise for such locusts; and leaving behind their thorns, they may fly into the pure and free air.
