(Verse 27) For the Son of Man is coming in the glory of His Father with His angels, and then He will repay each according to his deeds. Peter, scandalized by the preaching of the Lord's death, was rebuked by the Lord's sentence. The disciples were provoked to deny themselves, take up their cross, and follow their teacher with a willing heart. The great terror of the listeners, and the ability of the chief apostle to instill fear in others, led to sadness followed by joy, and he said: The Son of Man is coming in the glory of His Father with His angels. Fear death, listen to the glory of the triumphant. Fear the cross, listen to the ministries of the angels. And then, it is said, he will repay each according to his works (Rom. X, 12). There is no distinction between Jew and Gentile, man and woman, poor and rich, where not persons, but works are considered.
