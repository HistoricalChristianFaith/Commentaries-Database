(Chapter 37, Verse 3) And Israel loved Joseph more than all his sons, because he was the son of his old age: and he made him a coat of many colors. As for the coat of many colors, Aquila interprets it as a long-sleeved tunic, that is, a talar garment. Symmachus, a tunic with sleeves, or because it reached down to the ankles, and was distinguished by the wonderful variety of the craftsman's hands: or because it had sleeves: For the ancients used more often to wear woven garments.
