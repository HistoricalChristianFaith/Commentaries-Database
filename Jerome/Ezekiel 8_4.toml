(Verse 4) And he brought me to Jerusalem in a vision of God, near the inner gate that faces north, where the idol of jealousy was set up to provoke jealousy. And behold, there the glory of the God of Israel was, as the vision that I had seen in the field. LXX: And he brought me to Jerusalem in a vision of God to the entrance of the gate that faces north, where the statue of the possessor was. And behold, the glory of the Lord God of Israel was there, according to the vision that I saw in the field. However, what is found in some codices. And in the statue is added the image of Zel, from Theodotion. The rest is similar. When he says 'he brought me to Jerusalem in a vision of God,' he shows that he was not transported in the body, but in the spirit. According to this vision, we can see both the heavens and the depths of the sea and the underworld, while we grasp the reasoning of each through contemplation. First, however, he comes to the vestibule that faces the North, so that he may see the statue of the idol Zel and provoke emulation; so that from that place he can penetrate the inner areas and see the rest, which are described afterwards. But the story tells of a statue of the idol Baal placed in the temple of God. It is beautifully called the idol of Zeal because it provokes emulation and zeal for the Lord, according to what is said in Deuteronomy: 'They have provoked me to jealousy with that which is not God; they have provoked me to anger with their vanities: and I will provoke them to jealousy with those which are not a people' (Deut. 32). Moreover, because zeal and possession, which are called 'Cena' in Hebrew, are also called by the same name, the Seventy interpreters translated the statue of Zeal as the statue of the Possessor. Finally, when Cain was born, his parent said that he possessed a man through God (Gen. IV, 1), referring to the possession of a human being, giving Cain his name. And there was the glory of the God of Israel, not because he delighted in such proximity, but in order to destroy the idol of Zeal and its temple with his presence. Hence, the destruction of the city and temple followed shortly after. And in Isaiah it is written that a narrow bed cannot accommodate two, and a short cloak cannot cover both (Isa. XXVIII), with Scripture indicating what the Apostle said: What agreement is there between Christ and Belial? Temple of God and idol (2 Cor. 7:25)
