"And I
saw that all labour and skilful enterprise spring from man's rivalry with his
neighbour. This, too, is futility and a
vexation of the spirit! " I turned my attention once again to other
things and I saw the strength and honour of those men who were toiling, and I
discovered the good of one man to be the evil of another, while the envious one
is tortured by another's happiness, and the boastful lies open to
trickery. For what is more vain, what is
for nothing like the spirit in this way, than for man to weep for misfortunes
that are not his own, or to bemoan his own sins, or be envious of better
men.
