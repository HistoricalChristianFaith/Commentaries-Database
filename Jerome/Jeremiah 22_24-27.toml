(Verse 24 and following) I live, says the Lord: Even if Coniah the son of Joachim king of Judah were a signet on my right hand, I would still pluck him (or you) out. And I will give you into the hand of those seeking your life, and into the hand of those you fear their faces, and into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon (which is not found in the Septuagint), and into the hand of the Chaldeans. And I will send you (or cast you) and your mother who bore you into a foreign land where you were not born: and there you will die. And to the land (Al. to the land moreover), to which they lift up their soul in order to return, they shall not return there. Above, he had said, to the house of the king of Judah you speak these things: and then, go down to the house of the king of Judah: again: thus says the Lord concerning the house of the king of Judah, and in reverse order, after he spoke of Zedekiah, who was the last of the kings in Jerusalem, he returns to his brother Joachim, who reigned before him. With the fulfillment of this prophecy, now he speaks to the son of Joachim, the grandson of Josiah, king of Jerusalem, Jechoniah, who is also called by another name Joachin, who was captured by Nebuchadnezzar with his mother, princes and craftsmen, and many nobles, and was led into Chaldea, and there he died. Therefore, it is said that if a ring does not depart from the hand of the bearer, and it slips off the finger with difficulty: so it will be in my hand, Jechonias; however, I will uproot him and deliver him to the king of Babylon, and there he will die with his mother and all his allies, and he will not see the land of Judah, which he desires, anymore. Miserable Grunnius, who opened his mouth to slander holy men and taught his tongue to speak falsehood, he interpreted one book of Sextus Pythagoras, a very noble man, into Latin; and he divided it into two volumes and dared to publish it under the name of the holy Martyr Xystus, bishop of the city of Rome: in which book there is no mention of Christ, no mention of the Holy Spirit, no mention of God the Father, no mention of the Patriarchs, Prophets, and Apostles; and with his usual recklessness and madness, he named this book 'The Ring', which is read in many provinces, especially by those who preach atheism and immorality. Therefore, in the same way that the Lord threatens to throw Jeconiah like a ring from his hand and finger, I beg the reader to cast aside this nefarious book; and if he wishes, to read it not as a ecclesiastical volume, but like the other books of philosophers. In my commentaries and explanations, it is customary to present the various opinions of interpreters and mix such discourse: some say this, others think that, some feel this way. Both the wretched Grunnius himself, and after many years the disciples of Jovinian, have slandered me and continue to slander me, attributing their own opinions to other names, which I do out of goodwill so as not to appear to harm anyone specifically. Therefore, since benevolence has turned into slander, I now declare, both to those who are dead and to those who are alive and attempting to revive his heresy, that their teacher Origen refers this passage to Christ, whom, like a ring taken from the hand of God the Father, was sent into the land of captivity, into the valley of tears, and handed over to the cross. And he does not hesitate to mention this, as is evident from what follows: Earth, earth, earth, hear the word of the Lord. Thus says the Lord: Write about this detestable, or barren, man, and the rest, to understand about the Lord of majesty. He writes this so that his disciples may not dare to deny it, in the fifth book of Stromata.
