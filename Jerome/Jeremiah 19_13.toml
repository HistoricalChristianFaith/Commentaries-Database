(Ver. 13.) All the houses are unclean, in whose dwellings (or roofs) they sacrificed to the whole heavenly host, and poured out drink offerings to foreign gods. What he said above. This place will no longer be called Topheth or the Valley of the son ((or sons)) of Hinnom, but the Valley of Slaughter, now he explains more clearly that there will be such a great slaughter in that place, that the people will be buried there in heaps, and the once sacred grove ((or place)) will become a tumult of the dead. Also, let the city that is above this place become like Tophet, for which seventy were destroyed. Let the houses of Jerusalem and the palaces of the kings be turned into similar ruins. And the reason is given, because they were unclean and polluted by the crime of idolatry, because they sacrificed to the sun, moon, and stars of heaven in their houses and on their roofs, and burned incense. And they were not satisfied with this error, but they also sacrificed to demons and poured out libations to foreign gods (Zephaniah 1).
