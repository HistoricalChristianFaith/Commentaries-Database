(Verse 47.) But some of those standing there, when they heard it, said: This man is calling Elijah. Not all, but some whom I believe were Roman soldiers, not understanding the nature of the Hebrew language, but from what he said: Eli, Eli, thinking that he was calling Elijah. But if we want to understand the Jews who said this, they do this in their usual way, to dishonor the Lord of weakness, who invokes the aid of Elijah.
