(Verse 4.) Remember the law of Moses my servant, which I commanded him in Horeb for all Israel, with the statutes and judgments. Likewise in the Septuagint. The just retribution in the future will be righteous, when the flame will devour and burn the root and offspring of the proud, and the sun of righteousness will rise for those who fear the Lord, with healing in its wings. Therefore remember the law of Moses my servant, which I gave him on Mount Horeb, which is Sinai, for all Israel, with the statutes and judgments. But the Apostle says: We know that the law is spiritual (Rom. VII, 14); and blessed David: Open my eyes, and I will consider the wonders of your law (Ps. CXVIII, 18); and because all ate the heavenly manna in a spiritual manner, and the whole people of Israel drank from the same spiritual rock that followed them, and that rock was Christ. (I Cor. X, 3, 4); those who believe in Christ must spiritually observe the precepts of the law, which were given in Horeb (which means dryness), through which the moisture of all vices is dried up, and to the rays of the sun of justice, the rheum of lust is dried. But the Lord spoke to all of Israel, who understands with their heart God, and of whom it is said in the Gospel: Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God (Matt. 5:8).
