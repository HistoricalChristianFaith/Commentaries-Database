(Verse 15.) And it shall come to pass on that day, Tyre, you shall be forgotten for seventy years, like the days of one king. From this point until the end of this prophecy, favorable tidings are announced for Tyre, that it shall repent, that it shall be rebuilt again, but that its destruction shall remain for only seventy years, the same number of years that the temple of God was desolate. Tyre shall imitate the time of its ruins, just as it had mocked the ruins of others. However, many believe that the seventy years of one king refer to the reign of Nebuchadnezzar, during which the kingdom of the Assyrian people persisted in Jerusalem. Others generally claim that someone who has had a long reign cannot exceed seventy years.
