(Verse 5 onwards) My covenant with him was one of life and peace, and I gave him fear, and he feared me, and trembled at the presence of my name. The law of truth was in his mouth, and iniquity was not found on his lips. He walked with me in peace and equity, and turned many away from iniquity. For the lips of the priest preserve knowledge, and people seek instruction from his mouth, for he is the messenger of the Lord of hosts. LXX: My covenant with him was one of life and peace, and I gave him fear to fear me, and he was in awe of the presence of my name. The law of truth (also called truth itself) was on his lips, and iniquity was not found on his tongue. He walked with me in peace and turned many away from wickedness. For the lips of a priest should guard knowledge, and people should seek instruction from his mouth, because he is the messenger of the Almighty. It is described from the perspective of God, the perfect duty of a priest, what he should be like, and how God wanted him to be, whom he commanded to be. For He had said above, 'On account of the pact between Me and Levi,' says the Lord of Hosts, 'and it was through Levi the Patriarch that the pact reached his descendants, Aaron, Eleazar, Phinehas, and others who were generated from his lineage. But now in the end, He says, 'You have made void the pact with Levi,' says the Lord of Hosts. From this, it is clear that everything that is said about Levi pertains to the priests and specifically to the high priest. We read in Numbers about Phinehas, who killed Zimri and the Midianite woman with a sword. Phinehas, son of Eleazar, son of Aaron the priest, caused My fury to rest upon the Israelites because he was zealous for My honor and did not let Me destroy the Israelites in My anger. Therefore, I said, 'Behold, I will give him the covenant of peace, and it shall be for him and his descendants after him a covenant of eternal priesthood.' This is because he was zealous for his God and made atonement for the Israelites.' (Numbers 25:11) But let us not consider the testament or pact of life to be that which is common to us with animals and all living creatures, but that which says: I am the life (John 14:7). For indeed our life is hidden with Christ in God (Colossians 3:3): of whom we can say that he himself is our peace, as the Apostle affirms: For he himself is our peace (Ephesians 2:14). Therefore, the Lord gave to Levi and through him to his descendants, that they might fear him; for the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom (Psalm 111:10), and they should fear and withdraw themselves from his presence, showing the fear of the mind by the horror of the body, according to what is written: On whom shall I rest, except on the humble and quiet and trembling one who keeps my words? (Isaiah 66:2) The law of truth was on his lips, that is, the teaching of the peoples, which in the priest should not be defiled by any falsehood; but should proceed entirely from the fountain of truth. And injustice was not found on his lips, so that he might imitate his Lord, of whom it is said: 'He committed no sin, and no deceit was found in his mouth' (1 Peter 2:22). He walked with me in peace and equity, so that he himself may have peace within him and may bring peace to others, and may show no partiality in judgment, and therefore he walks with God as Enoch walked, who was taken up by God and was found no more (Genesis 5); and he turned many away from iniquity. Whoever is a priest and does not correct wrongdoers, passes over the duty of the priest. The lips of the priest shall keep knowledge: they shall not say, pronounce, but shall keep, so that they may speak at the proper time, and give food to the servants in due season, and seek the law from his mouth. The same is written in Haggai: 'Ask the priests about the law of the Lord' (Haggai 2:12). It is the duty of the priest to respond to the disciplined inquiry about the law. If someone is diligent in ignorance of other things, but negligent in the Holy Scriptures, they boast in vain of a dignity whose works they do not exhibit. This is what the apostle Paul writes to Titus: That he may be able to exhort in sound doctrine and to refute those who contradict (Titus 1:9). And to Timothy: Since from childhood you have known the sacred writings, which are able to instruct you for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus, so that the one who sins in the presence of all may be rebuked (2 Timothy 3:13). It follows: Because the angel of the Lord of hosts is. He explains his name as Ezra, the priest of God, that is, Malachi, which is interpreted as the angel of the Lord; however, an angel, that is, a messenger, is truly called a priest of God, because he is the mediator between God and men, and he announces God's will to the people: and therefore in the priest's breastplate it is the rational (Exodus 29), and in rational learning and truth is placed, so that we may learn that a priest must be learned and a proclaim of the Lord's truth. Some falsely think that what is said about Levi and through Levi to the priests should be understood about Christ, not considering the things that follow, which are contrary to the person of Christ.
