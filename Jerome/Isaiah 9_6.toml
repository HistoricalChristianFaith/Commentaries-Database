After two names, therefore [child and son], he will be called by another six names: wonderful, counselor, God, mighty, father of the coming age, prince of peace. For the names are not to be joined into couplets as many think, such that we would read “wonderful counselor” and “mighty God.” Instead “wonderful,” which is pele in Hebrew, is to be read separately, as is “counselor,” or what is called yôʿēṣ in their language. The title “God” also, whom the Hebrews call ēl stands on its own. Thus in subsequent passages where we read, “For you are God and we were unaware,” and again, “I am God and there is no other beyond me,” along with many similar statements, the Hebrew uses ēl where Latin uses Deus. And “mighty,” which comes next, is called gibbôr in Hebrew. Hence when the same prophet remembers “They will lay their trust upon God, the Holy One of Israel in truth, and the remnant of Jacob upon the mighty God,” the Hebrew text has ēl gibbôr for “mighty God.” But anyone who reads that the Savior is our peace, according to the apostle Paul, will have no doubt that the father of the coming age and of the resurrection, which is completed in our vocation, is also the prince of peace who said to the apostles, “My peace I give to you, my peace I bequeath to you.” The Septuagint in my opinion, terrified as it was by the majesty of these names, did not dare to say of a child that he must be called God and so forth but wrote in place of the six names, which it did not have in Hebrew, “angel of great counsel, and I will bring peace and his salvation upon the princes,” which seems to me to have the following meaning: He who announced to us that Israel would be thrown down for a while and that the nations would be healed is the angel of great counsel who also gave peace to its princes, apostles and apostolic men, and bequeathed dogmatic healing to their believers. - "Commentary on Isaiah 3.9.16–17"
