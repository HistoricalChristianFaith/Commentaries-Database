After two names, therefore [child and son], he will be called by another six names: wonderful, counselor, God, mighty, father of the coming age, prince of peace. For the names are not to be joined into couplets as many think, such that we would read “wonderful counselor” and “mighty God.” Instead “wonderful,” which is pele in Hebrew, is to be read separately, as is “counselor,” or what is called yôʿēṣ in their language. The title “God” also, whom the Hebrews call ēl stands on its own. Thus in subsequent passages where we read, “For you are God and we were unaware,” and again, “I am God and there is no other beyond me,” along with many similar statements, the Hebrew uses ēl where Latin uses Deus. And “mighty,” which comes next, is called gibbôr in Hebrew. Hence when the same prophet remembers “They will lay their trust upon God, the Holy One of Israel in truth, and the remnant of Jacob upon the mighty God,” the Hebrew text has ēl gibbôr for “mighty God.” But anyone who reads that the Savior is our peace, according to the apostle Paul, will have no doubt that the father of the coming age and of the resurrection, which is completed in our vocation, is also the prince of peace who said to the apostles, “My peace I give to you, my peace I bequeath to you.” The Septuagint in my opinion, terrified as it was by the majesty of these names, did not dare to say of a child that he must be called God and so forth but wrote in place of the six names, which it did not have in Hebrew, “angel of great counsel, and I will bring peace and his salvation upon the princes,” which seems to me to have the following meaning: He who announced to us that Israel would be thrown down for a while and that the nations would be healed is the angel of great counsel who also gave peace to its princes, apostles and apostolic men, and bequeathed dogmatic healing to their believers.

(Verse 6.) For a child is born to us, a son is given to us, and the government is upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, God the Mighty, the Father of the world to come, the Prince of Peace. His empire shall be multiplied, and there shall be no end of peace: he shall sit upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom; to establish it and strengthen it with judgment and with justice, from henceforth and forever. The zeal of the Lord of hosts will do this. For a child is born to us, a son is given to us, upon whose shoulder dominion is laid: and his name is called, Wonderful, Counselor, God the Mighty, the Father of the world to come, the Prince of Peace. His empire shall be multiplied, and there shall be no end of peace: he shall sit upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom; to establish it and strengthen it with judgment and with justice, from henceforth and forever. The zeal of the Lord of hosts will accomplish these things. Therefore the devil, and all his violent plundering, by which he oppressed the human race and mixed blood with blood, will be consumed by fire and the eternal fire will be their food. For a child is born to us, a son is given to us, of whom it has been said: Before the child knows how to reject evil and choose good (Isaiah 7:16); and later in the generation of the Prophetess: Before the child knows how to call his father and mother (Isaiah 8:4). Therefore this boy, who was born of a virgin, is called Emmanuel, which means 'God is with us'; and he is also called 'from the Prophetess', that is, conceived by the Holy Spirit. Hasten, strip off, hurry to plunder: he is now called by many names. And although he has shown that he is God by being called Emmanuel, which means 'God is with us', now he says that his government has been established upon his shoulder, or that he himself has carried his cross, or by showing the strength of his arm through his shoulder, as Isaiah also said: The Lord God has revealed his holy arm to all the nations (Isaiah 52:10). And again: Lord, who has believed our report? And to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed? (Isaiah 53:1) Therefore, He will be called by two names, and by six other names: Wonderful, Counselor, God, Mighty, Father of the future age, Prince of peace. For, as many think, the two names should not be joined together, as we read, Wonderful Counselor, and again, Mighty God; but Wonderful should be read separately, which in Hebrew is called Phele (), and Counselor separately, which is called Ides () in their language; and God separately, which is called El () in Hebrew. Finally, in the following passages where we read: You are indeed God, and we did not know: And again: I am God, and there is no other besides me (Isaiah XLV, 5), and many similar to these: because in Latin it is said Deus, in Hebrew it is written El. And what follows, Fortis, in Hebrew is called Gibbor (). Therefore, in the place where the same prophet mentions: They shall trust in the holy God of Israel in truth: and what remains of Jacob shall trust in the mighty God (Isaiah VIII), for mighty God in Hebrew it has El Gibbor. But the Father of the future age and of the resurrection, which is fulfilled in our calling; and the prince of peace, who spoke to the Apostles: My peace I give you, my peace I leave you (John 14:27): he who has read our peace according to Paul the Apostle will not doubt the Savior. With the majesty of the names, I think that the Seventy did not dare to say of the child what is clearly to be called God, etc.: but instead they used six names, which are not found in Hebrew, the Angel of great counsel, and I will bring peace upon the leaders, and his health. What seems to me to have this meaning: The Angel of Great Counsel, announced to us that Israel is to be cast aside for a time, and that the Gentiles are to be saved. And he bestowed peace upon his princes, the Apostles and apostolic men, and left the preservation of his teachings to those who believed. As for what follows: His empire shall be multiplied, and there shall be no end to peace; for this reason the Septuagint translated it as: His great principality. We must know that the Hebrew word Mesra, here and above, was interpreted as principality by the Septuagint. For this reason, we turn above the principate, this authority. However, the eagle, deceived by the ambiguity of the word μέτρον, that is, interpreted as measure, which is called the same name in both Hebrew and Latin. And he will not doubt about the multiple authority of the Savior and his peace, which has no end, whoever reads in the Psalms: Ask of me, and I shall give thee the nations for thine inheritance, and the very ends of the earth for thy possession (Ps. II, 8). And again: And the multitude of peace, until the moon be taken away (Ps. LXXI, 7), that is, until the end of the age. But his principality and empire will be over the throne and kingdom of David, which had been dispersed after the Babylonian captivity, in order to confirm and strengthen it, and to show that it will be perpetual (so that the promise of God would not seem in vain) from the time of the Incarnation to eternity. Therefore, the zeal, that is, the jealousy of the Lord of hosts, did this, because they themselves provoked him to jealousy with those who were not gods, and he provoked them to jealousy with a nation that was not a nation (Deut. 32). Let us now move on to the rest.
