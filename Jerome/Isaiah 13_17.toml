Hence he was ordered by the prophet to speak to the sons of Ammon and to reproach them, for they would have to be captured, and he directed a word also to the sword.… But even more is said through Isaiah in his vision against Babylon: “Behold, I will raise the Medes up against them;” and shortly later: “This Babylon, glorious among the kingdoms, the proud possession of the Chaldeans, will be destroyed by God like Sodom and Gomorrah. It will remain uninhabited forever.”

(Verse 17) Behold, I will raise up the Medes against them, who do not seek silver and do not desire gold. What was hidden is now revealed: that the mighty and giant ones are not angels or demons, but rather the people of the Medes, whose leader Darius, the first king of the Babylonians, destroyed the empire after killing Balthasar, the grandson of Nebuchadnezzar, who was the son of Evilmerodach. (Daniel 5) However, it is written about the cruelty of the Medes and Persians that they despise gold and silver in their burning desire to shed blood, considering wealth offered to them as worthless dirt.
