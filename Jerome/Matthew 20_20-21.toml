(Verse 20, 21.) Then the mother of the sons of Zebedee came to him with her sons, bowing down and asking something of him. He said to her, 'What do you want?' She replied to him, 'Command that these two sons of mine may sit, one at your right hand and one at your left, in your kingdom.' From this, we can infer that the mother of the sons of Zebedee has the expectation that when the Lord says, 'The Son of Man will be delivered to the chief priests and scribes, and they will condemn him to death, and deliver him to the Gentiles to be mocked and scourged and crucified,' and when he announces the shame of the passion to the disciples who fear it, she desires the glory of the triumphant one. This, as I understand it, was the reason why, after everything the Lord had said, the woman believed that he would immediately begin ruling after the resurrection. And she desired this to be fulfilled in the first coming, what is promised in the second coming, and with feminine eagerness she longs for his presence, forgetting about the future. But when the Lord asks and she requests, 'What do you want?', it is not out of ignorance but is said from her perspective, who was to be scourged and crucified, just as with the woman with the issue of blood, 'Who touched me?' (Luke 8:15). And about Lazarus: Where have you laid him (John 11:34)? In the Old Testament as well: Adam, where are you (Genesis 3:9)? And: I will go down and see if they have indeed done all according to the outcry that has come to me; if not, I will know (Genesis 18:21). However, the mother of the sons of Zebedee, driven by feminine error and a sense of piety, requested without knowing what she was asking for. And it is not surprising if this is attributed to ignorance; as it is said about Peter, when he wanted to make three tabernacles, not knowing what he was saying (Mark 9).
