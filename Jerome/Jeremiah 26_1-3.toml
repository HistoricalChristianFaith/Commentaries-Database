(Chapter 26, Verse 1 and following) In the beginning of the reign of Joahim, son of Josiah, king of Judah, this word came from the Lord, saying: Thus says the Lord: Stand in the court of the house of the Lord, and speak to all the cities of Judah, from which they come to worship in the house of the Lord, all the words that I have commanded you to speak to them. Do not withhold a word, lest they listen and each one turn away from their evil way. And I may repent of the evil (or remain silent about the evil) that I intend to do to them because of the wickedness of their deeds. This prophecy is superior to the previous one: although it was made under the same king. For that one was made in the fourth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah, but this one at the beginning of the same king, as the Scripture says: In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah, this word came from the Lord. Therefore, as we have often said, the order of history should not be woven in the prophets, since at present, the earlier things are spoken afterwards, and the later things, before. But whoever is going to speak the word of the Lord, must stand with Moses (Deut. V), and listen with the Psalmist: Those who stand in the house of the Lord, in the courts of the house of our God (Psalm CXXXIV, 2). And it is commanded that he speaks to all the cities of Judah: although the seventy cities did not translate, lest it should appear unseemly to speak in the court of the house of the Lord to cities that were not present: but when he speaks to the people and to the citizens, he speaks to those cities. But it stands beautifully in the atrium and vestibule of the Temple of the Lord, so that by the opportunity of the Lord's prayer and adoration, they are compelled to hear the words of the Prophet. Do not, he says, withhold the word: though it may be sad, though the rage of the listeners may be stirred up against you, nevertheless say what has been commanded to you: not fearing the persecutions of those who are stirred up against you, but the command of the Lord who orders it. Perhaps, he says, they may hear and be converted. An ambiguous word, perhaps, cannot befit the majesty of the Lord, but it speaks to our affection: that man's free will be preserved, so that he is not compelled to do or not to do anything by its foreknowledge, as if by necessity. For it is not because God knows something will happen that it will therefore happen, but because it will happen, God knows it, as if he were prescient of future events. And yet it is to be understood, according to this same Jeremiah: if the Lord predicts evil and the people repent, he will also repent of the punishment he threatened to carry out. And if he has promised prosperity and the people act negligently, God may change his judgement and bring misfortunes instead of blessings. Such a thing is also mentioned in the Gospel: 'I will send my son, perhaps they will respect him' (Luke 20:13). This is indeed spoken from the perspective of almighty God. In fact, he also says this in the present: 'Perhaps they will listen and turn from their evil ways, so that when they have repented and I have relented of the disaster I had planned to bring on them, I will not carry out my plan.' But I think to do [it] because of the wickedness of their studies, which if they are changed, my opinion will be changed. Let us read the story of Jonah and Nineveh.
