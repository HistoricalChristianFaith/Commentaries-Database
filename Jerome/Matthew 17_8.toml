(Verse 8.) But lifting up their eyes, they saw no one except Jesus alone. Reasonably, after they had risen, they saw no one except Jesus alone: lest if Moses and Elijah had continued with the Lord, the uncertain voice of the Father would be seen, to whom he would give the testimony. Therefore, they see Jesus standing, the cloud having been taken away, and Moses and Elijah had vanished: because after the shadow of the Law and the Prophets had departed, which had covered the apostles with its veil, both lights are found in the Gospel.
