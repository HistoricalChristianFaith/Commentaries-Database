Faithful is the saying, and I wish to confirm (or affirm) you about these things, that those who believe in the Lord should have care to preside over good works. These things are good and useful for men. This saying, faithful is, must be joined to the preceding part, in which he said that, having been justified by his grace, we may become heirs in the hope of eternal life. For the saying about the inheritance of God is worthy of faith, and about the hope of eternal life. Therefore, it is necessary concerning these matters, not only to believe and to confirm others who believe, without any doubt or fear, but also to confirm him who wants to believe in these things along with others. Therefore, it is said: "And I want to confirm you concerning these things." But those who truly believe in these things must take care of good works, through which the inheritance of God and the hope of eternal life are prepared. And to more firmly establish their faith, he did not say "those who believe in men," but "those who believe in God." For it is necessary that they take care of good works which, when fulfilled and carried out with every effort, are good and useful to believers.
