(Verse 27) He also said to them: Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things. They answered and said to him: We don't know. Then Jesus also replied to them: Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things. But the Truth cannot lie, and he said: Neither do I tell you. From this, he shows that they know but refuse to answer, and he knows but refuses to say, because they keep silent about what they know. And immediately he tells a parable that not only condemns their impiety, but also teaches that the kingdom of God will be given to the Gentiles.
