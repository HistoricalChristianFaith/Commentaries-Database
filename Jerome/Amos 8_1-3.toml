(Chapter 8, verses 1 and following) This is what the Lord God showed me: Behold, a basket of summer fruit. And he said, 'Amos, what do you see?' And I said, 'A basket of summer fruit.' Then the Lord said to me, 'The end has come upon my people Israel; I will not pass by them anymore. The songs of the temple shall become wailings in that day,' declares the Lord God. 'Many shall be the dead bodies, cast out in every place. Silence!' LXX: This is what the Lord God showed me: Behold, a basket of summer fruit. And he said, What do you see, Amos? And I said, A bird trap. And the Lord said to me: The end is coming upon my people Israel; I will no longer pass by them. The ceilings of the temple will wail on that day, says the Lord God. Many will fall; I will bring silence to every place. Just as Jeremiah sees with the staff of the watchmen, or the nut, because he watched over the sins of his people, so now Amos looks upon Judah and Israel together under the guise of a hook, which in Hebrew is called Chelub and is translated as a bird trap by the Septuagint; since the bird catcher is properly called Moces, as we read earlier in this same prophet: If a bird falls to the ground without a bird catcher. And the sense is this: Just as the branches of trees are drawn towards the apples to be picked, so I have drawn near the time of captivity. And so that we may know that this is what we say, God himself interprets what the vision, which the prophets had shown, signifies. The end has come upon my people Israel. And what follows: I will not pass through him anymore, signifies that he will no longer pass through the iniquities of his people, nor neglect them, nor allow their crimes to go unpunished. And not only does it seem to be said about the ten tribes, it also says: The hinges of the temple will creak, or the rafters on that day, says the Lord. But this must be understood with great excess, because such a heavy burden of evils is looming: that even the hinges of the doors themselves and the lofty rafters will howl, and they will feel an incredible devastation: when many will die, and with the inhabitants captured or killed, silence will be thrown everywhere. But if we want to read the vase of the bird-catcher instead of the hook of the apples, it must be said that just as bird-catchers attract flying birds through the air with birdlime or nets, and when they are soaring higher they pull them down to the ground, so God through Sennacherib or Nebuchadnezzar, whom we now understand as bird-catchers, first captured, bound, transferred, and killed his own free people, whom he had previously elevated through obedience to the Law. For nets are not unjustly stretched out for birds. And this is not only to be referred to the time of the captivity of Babylon, but also to the coming of the Lord Savior, when they said: Take away such a one from the earth: crucify him, crucify him (John 19:15), and they destroyed the wings of the dove. And the end came upon them, and the final captivity, and the Lord did not spare them. And the hinges of the temple wailed, or the ceilings of the temple, falling upon the slain people. And in every place there was silence, with the Jews having Moses and the Prophets, and those without the Word of God: reading the letter, and losing the spirit, when their table became a snare, and a retribution, and a ruin, and their eyes were blinded so that they could not see, and their ears were stopped so that they could not hear; and their backs were bent so that they could not look up to heaven, but rather always lay on the ground like that woman in the Gospel who had a spirit of infirmity (Mark 7), and their ears were stopped so that they could not hear; and their backs were bent so that they could not look up to heaven, but rather always lay on the ground like that woman in the Gospel who had a spirit of infirmity. And the anger of God was poured out upon them, and the fury of his wrath caught hold of them, so that their habitation became deserted, and in their tents there was no inhabitant: for when the time was fulfilled, Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, and I will send a famine upon the land: not a famine of bread, nor a thirst of water, but of hearing the word of the Lord (Hosea, ch. 4, v. 11) : of which, if we shall have arrived at the end, more fully is to be explained. Therefore, seeing this, that God spared not the natural branches, let us fear that the same may happen to us, and let us avoid the snares of the fowler; and let us say to the Lord: Be not silent, neither be thou still, O God, and depart not from me; lest being like unto them that go down into the pit (Psalm 27:1). In the whole world there has fallen a stupor of the Jewish people: wherever they are, they are the mute and dumb images of what they used to be. Blaspheming against Christ, they invoke a malediction in their synagogues and in their prayers. That their interpretation of the Scriptures may find no entrance anywhere, what new thing is said by them that have no faith? For they bore witness to what they understood not; and like human beings, they rendered judgment as diviners.
