A pearl will shine in the midst of squalor, and a gem … will sparkle in the mire. This is what the Lord promised when he said, “Those who honor me I will honor.” Others may understand this of the future when sorrow shall be turned into joy and when, although the world shall pass away, the saints shall receive a crown which shall never pass. But I for my part see that the promises made to the saints are fulfilled even in this present life.
