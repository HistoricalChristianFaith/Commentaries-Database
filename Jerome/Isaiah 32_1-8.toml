(Chapter 32, Verses 1 onwards) Behold, the king shall reign with justice, and princes shall rule with judgment. And a man shall be like one who hides from the wind, and conceals himself from the storm: like streams of water in a dry place, and the shadow of a towering rock in a barren land. The eyes of those who see shall not be dim, and the ears of those who hear shall listen carefully. And the heart of fools shall understand knowledge, and the tongue of stammerers shall speak quickly and clearly. He who is foolish shall no longer be called a ruler, nor shall the deceitful be called great. For the foolish shall speak foolishness, and his heart shall work iniquity, to accomplish deceit and speak deceitfully to the Lord, to empty the soul of the hungry and take away the drink of the thirsty. The vessels of the deceitful are the worst, for he has devised plans to destroy the meek with lies when he speaks in judgment of the poor. The prince will consider those things that are worthy of a prince, and he himself will stand above the leaders. LXX: Behold, a righteous king will reign, and princes will rule with justice. And there will be a man who conceals his words, and he will be hidden like water that is carried away: and he will appear in Zion, like a flowing river, illustrious in a thirsty land, and they will not place their confidence in men: but they will open their ears to hear, and the heart of the weak will attend to their hearing: and the tongues of the stammerers will quickly learn to speak peace: and they will no longer say to the fool, 'Be a prince,' nor will your ministers say, 'Be silent.' For a fool will speak foolishly, and his heart will understand in vain to accomplish wickedness, and to speak error towards the Lord, so as to scatter the souls of the hungry and to make the souls of the thirsty empty. For the counsel of the wicked will think iniquity: to kill the humble with wicked words, and to dissipate the words of the lowly in judgment. But the pious have thought wisdom, and this counsel remains. According to the Septuagint interpreters who said: Behold, for a just king will reign, and princes will preside with judgment, what follows must be joined with the previous, namely, the chapter that has ended: Blessed is the one who has offspring in Zion, and domestics in Jerusalem. According to the completion of the prior prophecy in Hebrew, concerning those who descended into Egypt, now begins the beginning of another prophecy, namely, concerning the coming of Christ and His Apostles. For this king shall reign justly, showing no partiality in judgment, and his princes shall govern with truth, considering causes, not individuals. And whoever is under his protection shall be safe in tribulations and hardships, and in the storms of this world, just as one who, fleeing the wind and whirlwind, safely hides in a place; and one who finds the purest springs in the desert; and one who, in the scorching heat of the sun, finds rest under a projecting rock while everything flows around him. Whereas we have said: as streams of water in a dry place, they have translated: and there shall be seen in Zion as a flowing river. For the Hebrew word, about which we have previously debated, Basaion, which means in thirst, or in dryness, and in barrenness, the Septuagint and Theodotion have translated into Zion: instead of Saion, meaning thirst, they read Zion, which is written with the same letters. Therefore, when Christ reigns, and his princes preside in judgement, the eyes of the believers will not be dimmed, and the ears of the attentive will listen carefully to what was previously deaf, and the heart of the fools will understand knowledge, and the tongue of the stammerers and the mute, which could not pronounce the name of Christ, will confess the Lord in full and clear speech. He who is foolish will no longer be called a prince. For God has made the wisdom of this world foolish. Nor will a deceitful and perverse teacher be called great among the people, namely the scribes and Pharisees, to whom the Lord spoke: Fools and blind ones, what is greater, gold or the temple that sanctifies the gold? For a fool will speak foolishly, as it is written in Hebrew: Nabal Nabala Idabber. This we say, in order to explain the words of Abigail speaking about Nabal in Carmel: 'According to his name, he is foolish.' (1 Samuel 25:25) For truly a fool will speak foolishly, and his heart will devise wickedness; he feared where there was no fear, and he used foolishness as wisdom, saying: 'If this man were from God, he would not break the Sabbath.' (John 9:16) This is what the rulers of the synagogue still do today, in order to perfect their hypocrisy, about which it is written in Hebrew: Oneph, which means 'hypocrisy.' Where it is often said to the Pharisees: Woe to you, scribes and hypocritical Pharisees (Matthew 23:14). And let him speak deceitfully to the Lord: Teacher, we know that you are from God, and it is not your concern about people, although it is lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, isn't it (Ibid., 22:16-17). They empty the souls of the hungry people and take away the drink of the thirsty crowds, neither allowing themselves to enter nor allowing others to enter. For the vessels and weapons of a deceitful teacher and prince are all the worst; who contrives deceit to deceive the simple in the speech of falsehood, saying to the deceived people: Search and see, because the Prophet from Galilee will not rise again (John 7:52). When he spoke to them about the poor judgment, who, though rich, became poor for us (2 Corinthians 8). Truly, Christ is their judgment, and he spoke of righteousness, saying: If I do not do the works of my Father, do not believe me; but if I do, and if you do not want to believe me, believe in the works (John 10:37). This poor man who speaks judgment, the prince and Lord, will think about things that are worthy of a prince, saying: I have come only for the lost sheep of the house of Israel (Matth. XV, 14). And he will be anxious to save the unbelievers, wanting to save those who do not believe; and he will stand above his leaders, the Apostles, to whom he speaks to one: But you, my unanimous man, my leader and my friend (Psal. LIV, 14). These things are according to the Hebrew, from which the Septuagint not only differ in words, but also in meanings in many things. For when a just king reigns and his leaders govern with judgment, the man who is God by nature will conceal his teachings, speaking to them in parables (Matthew 20:21, 23, 24, and 25). He will conceal them like a flowing river hides beneath the surface, away from the people of Judah who are carried back and forth by the will of their leaders. But this man who hides his teachings among the unbelievers will appear in Zion, which is the Church, like a renowned river flowing through a thirsty land. For the people of the Gentiles, who previously suffered from a thirst for truth, will appear; and the river of God will water the thirsty fields as it is written: The rushing waters of a river make the city of God glad (Psalm 46:4). And in another place: The river of God is full of water (Psalm 65:10). For He Himself speaks in the Gospel: Let anyone who is thirsty come to Me, and let them drink. Whoever believes in Me, as Scripture says, rivers of living water will flow from within them (John 7:38). Then they will have no trust in teachers; but they will offer their ears to hear the Lord; and with both heart and tongue they will confess the peace of the Lord, forsaking foolish princes and their ministers, who commanded silence to those who believed in Jesus. The following words contain the same meaning, both in Hebrew and Latin, and can be adapted to heretics. For they speak lies against the Lord, and they pervert the souls of those who hunger and thirst, and they make them empty; so that even if they have anything good by nature, they lose it because of the fault of the teachers, whose every plan is to destroy the humble with unjust words, and to scatter the words of the humble in judgment. Similarly, it should be noted that those who can be deceived by them should be humble and grounded.
