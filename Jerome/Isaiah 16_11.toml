(Verse 11) On this account, my belly will sound like a lyre for Moab, and my inward parts like a wall of cooked bricks. It is not to be understood as a chant of joy for the prophet, through which he rejoices that the enemies of the people of Israel have been made captive, but rather, he says, with affection and deep sorrow of heart, that he mourns the formerly mighty city that has been destroyed.
