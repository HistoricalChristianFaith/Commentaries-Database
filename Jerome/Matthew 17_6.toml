(Verse 6.) And when the disciples heard this, they fell on their faces and were exceedingly afraid. They were terrified for three reasons: either because they realized they had made a mistake, or because a shining cloud had covered them, or because they had heard the voice of God the Father speaking. For human frailty cannot bear the sight of greater glory and, trembling in mind and body, falls to the ground. The more one seeks greater things, the more one will collapse into lower things if one does not know one's own measure.
