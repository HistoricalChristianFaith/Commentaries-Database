I am writing to you because of the confidence I have in Christ Jesus, commanding you to do what is proper for the sake of love. I urge you even more, as one such as Paul, an old man and now also a prisoner of Christ Jesus. With many praises given to Philemon before him, considering the matter at hand, which would be both excellent and helpful to the requester, Paul was able to command rather than request. And this confidence came from the fact that whoever had done such great works for Christ could not be unequal to himself in other aspects. But he wishes to ask more than to command, with the authority of one asking for something great being proposed, through which both the Apostle begs, and the old man and prisoner of Jesus Christ. But that for which he is asking the whole time is: Onesimus, the servant of Philemon, he had fled and compounded some domestic item by theft: hence he had gone to Italy, so that he would not be easily apprehended in the near future, he had squandered his master's money through luxury. Lest anyone think this rashly, and that it is made up as we please, let him learn in the following. For Paul would never say: "If he has harmed you or owes anything, put it to my account: I, Paul, have written with my own hand; I will repay it." Nor would he become the surety of a lost thing, and if that which was lost had not been squandered. Therefore, when Paul was in prison in Rome because of the confession of Christ, he believed in Christ; and after being baptized by him, he wiped away the stains of his former life with worthy penance, to such an extent that the apostle himself became a witness of his conversion, who had once rebuked Peter for not walking rightly in the truth of the Gospel (Galatians 2). Therefore regarding sin and wrongdoing, in which he had injured the lord, he doesn't deserve forgiveness; however, regarding the testimony of the Apostle, who knows that he has been fully converted, he is burdened with great weight, since he is being asked who was once a fugitive slave and a robber, yet had become a minister of the Apostle. (And what other ministry does the Apostle have except the Gospel of Christ Jesus?) Now he is no longer to be forgiven as if by his master, but rather as if by a fellow servant and co-evangelist, as he too is a servant of Christ and a minister.
