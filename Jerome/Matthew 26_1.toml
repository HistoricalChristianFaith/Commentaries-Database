Let them blush with shame who think the Savior dreaded death and said out of fear of suffering, “Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me.” After two days, about to celebrate the Passover, he knew that he was to be betrayed and crucified. However, he did not turn away from the snares or take flight in fear. While the rest were unwilling to proceed, he remained unruffled when Thomas said, “Let us go that we may die with him.” Wishing to put an end to the earthly festivity and to declare the truth in the passing shadow of Passover, he said, “I have earnestly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer.” Indeed, “Christ, our paschal lamb, has been sacrificed” if we eat it with “the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.” Furthermore, because he says, “After two days the Passover will be here” and omits a simple explanation, we should seek what is holy. After two days of the brilliant light of the Old and New Testaments, the Passover is celebrated for the world. This Passover, called pesa&#; in Hebrew, is not named after Christ’s suffering as many believe. It refers to the “passing over,” when the destroying angel saw the blood on the doors of the Israelites, passed by and did not strike them down. In other words, the Lord, giving help to his people, came down from above. Our passing over—that is to say, pesa&#;—will be celebrated if we put behind us both earthly things and Egypt and move on to heavenly things. .
