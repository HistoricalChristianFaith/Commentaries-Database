(Verse 21 onwards) And the word of the Lord came a second time to Haggai on the twenty-fourth day of the month, saying: Speak to Zerubbabel, governor of Judah, saying: I will shake the heavens and the earth. I will overthrow the thrones of kingdoms and destroy the power of the kingdoms of the nations. I will overthrow chariots and their riders. Horses and their riders shall also fall, each by the sword of his brother. On that day, declares the Lord of hosts, I will take you, Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, my servant, declares the Lord, and make you like a signet ring, for I have chosen you, declares the Lord of hosts. In the LXX version, (the following words) were added: 'sea and dry land,' and it has 'less' (text): 'I will overthrow the strength of the kingdoms of the nations,' which is understood in a more complete sense from the reading of the LXX. Furthermore, it should be noted that on the same day, that is, on the twenty-fourth of the ninth month, without the month number being mentioned, because they were prophesying about the coming of Christ and his kingdom, the second discourse of our Lord is addressed not to Haggai as before, and not even to the prophet Haggai as in the fourth vision, but only to Haggai, that is, to the one celebrating the feasts of the Lord, because (Christ) is not said to be coming, but to be about to come and to be seen. And how did Abraham see the day of Christ, and rejoice (John 8); and John pointed out the Lamb of God with his finger (John 1): so also, seeing the kingdom of the Son of God, he would have in himself all the solemnities. In this place, there are different opinions among many: For some suspect that the first coming is spoken of; others, the second, when He is to come in His majesty. We accept both, because He reigned when He came, and will reign afterwards. However, if we want to learn about the end of the world, we will say what the apostle speaks of to the Corinthians: 'To destroy all principality, and power, and virtue, that God may be all in all' (I Cor. XV). And because it is mystical and pertains to the end of things, the prophet is commanded to speak only to Zorobabel, whom we have shown to have come in the type of Christ because of the assumption of the body from the seed of David. Therefore, these things are said to happen in the end, that the figure of this world passes away, and a new heaven and a new earth are created, and the Lord shakes the heaven and the earth, and destroys every principality, power, and virtue, and scatters the kings of the kingdoms, as it is written in Hebrew, and annihilates every opposing strength, so that even those who reigned before and the nations under their rule will benefit from the destruction of their kingdom, and with every eagerness for battle abolished, peace will follow; for this is what is said: And I will overthrow the chariots, or chariots, and their riders, and the horses will go up and their riders will go down. And so that you may know concerning the overthrow of the chariots and the falling horsemen, this is what we mean: See how it is said about Christ in Zechariah that He comes as a gentle king, riding upon a foal of a donkey, and He will destroy the chariots from Ephraim (Zechariah 9), and the horse from Jerusalem, so that there may be one flock and one shepherd, and both the Gentiles and the Jews may be held under the peaceful shepherd. But in order for these things that are perverse to be destroyed, each person will rise up against his brother with a sword (which I believe to be the sharpest expression of doctrine, cutting off every perverse thing), cutting off everything that is contrary. But the end of all these things is the best. For after the destruction of the suns, and the strengths of the rulers, and the chariots, and the horses, and the horsemen, on that day, says the Lord Almighty: I will take you, Zerubbabel, the son of Salathiel, my servant. However, servant is called because of the human body, for then the Son himself will be subject to him who subjected all things to himself, and in all things subject, he himself will be seen. But when this is fulfilled, God will place him as a seal in his hand: For God the Father has sealed him (John VI, 27): and this is the image of the invisible God, and the form of his substance: so that whoever believes in God, will be sealed as it were with a ring.


I beg you, reader, to forgive the speaker's rapid discourse, and not to demand the elegance of speech which I have lost through many years of studying the Hebrew language: although Alecto always considers me to have been an infant and mute. To whom shall I say: The Lord will give the word to the one who evangelizes, with much power (Ps. LXVII, 12).
