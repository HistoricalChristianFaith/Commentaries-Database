(Verse 10) And I entered and saw: and behold, every likeness of creeping things and abomination of animals: and all the idols of the house of Israel were depicted on the wall all around. Not only did the idol of Zele stand at the entrance of the northern gate, but also all the walls of the Temple were painted with various images of idols: so that there was no animal that the painting on the wall did not show. This we see so far in the temples of idols and the shrines of the Gentiles, because foolish religion worships all kinds of beasts. And Virgil says:

Omnigenumque deum monstra, et latrator Anubis, Quasi non et illa sint monstra quae laudat

Against Neptune and Venus, and against Minerva. We are able to show idols depicted on the walls of our temples, when we are subject to all vices, and we depict in our hearts the conscience of sins, and various images. Concerning which it is said in the Psalm: Lord, in your city you will scatter their image (Psalm 72:20). And in another place: Nevertheless, in image man walks around (Psalm 38:7). That is to say, there is no man who does not have some image, either of sanctity or of sin. Therefore, it is said to the furious and the irascible: Fury is to them according to the likeness of a serpent: as of the deaf adder that stoppeth her ears, which will not hear the voice of the charmers (Psalm 57:5). And concerning wicked men: Generation of vipers, who hath shewed you to flee from the wrath to come (Matthew 3:7)? And concerning the sly and deceitful: Go and say to that fox (Luke 13:32). And concerning lovers of women: The horses went insane for the women: each one neighed at his neighbor's wife (Jer. 5:8). Even about beasts and the foolish: Do not be like horses and mules, which have no understanding. And again: Put a bit and bridle on their mouths, those who do not come near you (Ps. 32:9). And many such things. However, what we have set down: And behold, every likeness of creeping things and animals is not found in the Septuagint.
