(Verse 27-29) And men marveled, saying: What manner of man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey him? And when Jesus had come across the sea into the region of the Gerasenes, two men with demons met him as they came out of the tombs, exceedingly fierce, so that no one could pass by that way. And behold, they cried out, saying: Not the disciples, but the sailors and others who were in the boat, marveled. But if anyone wants to argue that those who marveled were disciples, we will answer that they were rightly called men who had not yet known the power of the Savior.
