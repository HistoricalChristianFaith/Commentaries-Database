(Verses 17 onwards) And when they enter the gates of the inner court, they shall be clothed with linen garments (or robes); they shall not wear anything made of wool (or they shall not wear garments made of wool) when they minister at the gates of the inner court and inside. Linen turbans shall be on their heads (or they shall have linen turbans on their heads) and linen undergarments shall be around their waists, and they shall not be bound in sweat (or forced). And when they go out to the outer courtyard to the people, they shall take off their garments (or stoles) in which they ministered, and they shall put them in the treasury (or colonnades) of the sanctuary (or the holy place), and they shall put on other garments (or stoles), and they shall not sanctify the people with their garments (or stoles). But they shall not shave their heads, nor let their hair grow long, but they shall trim their hair (or shave their heads) without shaving the hair too close: they shall cover their heads. And not every priest shall drink wine when he is about to enter the inner court. First, the words of the story must be interpreted. Among other things that the sermon of the Lord commands to the priests, he also orders that they should be clothed in linen garments at the very gates of the inner court, that is, with linen stoles: and they should not use garments woven with gold either at the gates of the inner court or inside, that is, in the holy of holies; and linen turbans or headbands should be on their heads, and linen undergarments around their loins. And what follows according to the Septuagint: 'And they shall not gird themselves violently,' which Aquila and Symmachus translated as 'in sweat.' Theodotion, expressing the Hebrew word itself, rendered it as, 'in Jeze,' meaning that they should not be girded violently, tightly, like prisoners, so as not to become unfit for the priestly and Levitical duties, and be unable to hold and slaughter the victims, nor to draw and run around. And because he had previously commanded the priests what garments they should wear when they were inside the sanctuary, he now orders that when they go out into the treasuries or the holy places, they should take off their former garments and put on others. For if they had the holy garments, they would sanctify the people who were standing outside and had not yet been sanctified, nor had prepared themselves for the sanctification of the temple, so that they may be of Nazarene for the Lord. From this we learn that we should not enter into the holy of holies with everyday and any garments that are polluted for common use, but with a clean conscience and clean garments, keep the sacraments of the Lord. And what follows: 'But they shall not shave their heads, nor let their hair grow long, but they shall trim their heads,' clearly demonstrates that we should not be priests and worshippers of Isis and Serapis with shaved heads, but neither should we let our hair grow long, which is properly luxurious and belongs to barbarians and warriors; but that the honorable appearance of the priests be shown on their faces. For this reason, the LXX said, 'They shall not shave their heads, nor let their hair grow long, but they shall cover their heads,' from which we learn that we should not make baldness with a razor or cut our hair so close that we appear like shaven ones, but that our hair should be left long enough to cover the skin. Or certainly, the priests should always cover their heads, according to what Virgil said (Aeneid, Book III):

To veil his hair with a purple covering. But this is a violent interpretation. However, not only will priests and Levites not drink wine in their ministry, but they will not even enter the Holy of Holies, so that their mind may not be overwhelmed, and their senses may not become duller. Hence the Apostle says: It is good, he says, not to drink wine and not to eat meat (Rom. XIV, 21). And in another place: And do not get drunk with wine, in which there is debauchery (Ephes. V, 18). For the people ate and drank, and then got up to play. And he clearly showed (as Alexander shows) why he granted Timothy to drink a little wine: for his stomach, he says, and frequent illnesses (1 Timothy 5). The Egyptian priests use linen garments not only internally but also externally. Furthermore, the divine religion has one dress for the ministry and another for common use in life. The undergarments are properly worn to preserve modesty and decorum: so that, when ascending the steps of the altar and moving about in the ministry, they do not reveal indecency. The superstition of the pagans has many heads. But as far as my knowledge is concerned, I do not believe that any of the pagans abstain from wine. These words will show what all things in accordance with sense indicate as spiritual. The Apostle also teaches that there are sacred and spiritual garments, saying: Put on the Lord Jesus Christ (Rom. XIII, 14). And in another place: Put on the bowels of mercy, kindness, humility, meekness, and patience (Coloss. III, 12). And again: Stripped off the old man with his works, and put on the new man who is renewed in knowledge, according to the image of the Creator (1 Cor. 15:54); which I think also signifies this: For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality. But when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, and so on. About the priestly garments in Exodus, it is written more fully (Exodus 28); and we have previously published a book (Epistle 64, to Fabiola), to the interpretation of which a diligent reader must be sent. For we cannot comprehend a broad subject in a concise discourse. These clothes we make with our own labor, which are woven from above, such as the Lord had a tunic that could not be torn (John 18); in which we are clothed when we know the secret and hidden things of the Lord, and we have the spirit that searches even the high and deep things of God, which are not to be shown to the common people, nor to be spoken to the un-sanctified, nor to those not prepared for the sanctity of the Lord: so that if they hear greater things, they may not be able to bear the majesty of knowledge, and be choked like solid food, who are still nourished by the milk of infancy. But on the contrary, Scripture teaches that the worst clothing, as is sung in the Psalms about the traitor Judas, is to be clothed with curses (Ps. CVIII, 29). And a little later: Let it become for him like the clothing with which he is surrounded, and like the belt with which he is always girded. Therefore, the Lord, who suffered for us and carried our sins, is said to have dirty clothes in Zechariah, of which it is written: And Jesus was clothed in dirty clothes (Zach. III, 4): which he later takes off, as the Scripture says: Take away the dirty clothes from him and dress him in clean clothes, and so on. But what follows: "Vittae, sive cidares lineae erunt in capitibus eorum, puto coronam ostendere gratiarum, de qua scriptum est: Coronam enim gratiarum suscipiet tuus vertex (Prov. IV, 9). Nec illud nobis de operto et nudo capite faciet quaestionem, quod Apostolusloquitur: Mulier debet velamen habere super caput, propter angelos. Si enim non velatur mulier, attondeatur. Sin autem, turpe est mulieri tonderi aut radi, operiatur. For a man ought not to cover his head, since he is the image and glory of God; but woman is the glory of man (2 Cor. XI, 10). For if it is the custom for men not to cover the head, it seems to be the opposite, so why do priests now command them to cover their heads or cut their hair? But if we read diligently, the present matters will be resolved from the previous ones. For it is said above: When they serve at the doors of the inner court and within. For if we enter into the holy and stand in the presence of the Lord, we ought to cover our heads: Because not every living thing will be justified in the sight of the Lord (Ps. CXLII, 2). And: From infancy the heart of man is inclined to evil. Finally, we also use our female bodies inwardly so that no defilement of conscience and impurity of matrimonial work appears in the sight of God. The Savior wants his apostles to be girded with these female items, saying: Let your loins be girded, and your lamps burning in your hands (Luke 12:35). And the Apostle speaks to believers: Therefore, gird up your loins in truth (Ephesians 6:14). And the imitators of Christ hear that which is written about him: He shall be girded with justice and clothed with truth (Isaiah 11:5). And this very belt, which is holy and has ascended to the pinnacle of virtues, is not bound forcibly: lest he appear unwilling to observe the good of continence and to eat the bread of his face in sweat, but to do the commandment of the Lord willingly. Finally, when he goes out and mingles with the people, he puts off his priestly garments in the treasury, where the riches of the Lord are preserved; and the priests use other garments and another teaching for the common people, so that the people may not be sanctified in their garments. It is a burden for the multitude to undertake beyond their strength, as Solomon says: 'The snare of a man is to consecrate quickly what is his own; for when he has made a vow, repentance steals upon him.' (Prov. XX, 25, LXX) . Finally, the Nazarenes offer themselves willingly, and whoever vows something and does not fulfill it is guilty of the vow. Hence it is said about widows: 'When they have given themselves to wantonness, they want to marry in Christ, having condemnation because they have cast off the first faith.' (I Tim. V, 11, 12) . For it is better not to promise than to promise and not do. Anna offered Samuel, who remained in eternal sanctity (1 Samuel 1). And Manoah offered Samson his son, but the lust of Delilah defiled the sanctification of his hair (Judges 13). Finally, the Lord withdrew from him and he was condemned to blindness, except that later, as his hair grew, he regained his former strength and in the image of Christ, he killed many more of the enemies of Israel in death than he did in life. But the Lord wants his priests to have perpetual holy hair and to cover their heads, not with any external veil, but with their own natural hair, not for adornment and luxury, but for decency. Therefore, the apostles' hair is counted, as the Savior says: But the very hairs of your head are all numbered (Matt. 10:30). That head, about which it is written in Ecclesiastes: The wise man's eyes are in his head (Eccl. 2:14). But the head of the man is Christ, whom the sinner tramples upon and despises, and, so to speak, shaves with a razor, and takes away his beauty. Which the sons of Ammon also did to those whom David had sent as ambassadors (2 Samuel 10). But, on the other hand, transgressing the law dishonors God, and therefore, whoever keeps the precepts of the law, honors him, so that what is written may be fulfilled: That all may honor the Son as they honor the Father (John 5:23). Furthermore, what follows is clear: That every priest, when about to enter the inner courtyard, should not drink wine, it is evident that the state of mind is overturned in drunkenness and debauchery, and we do not fully understand when the mind is occupied with the satisfaction of wine. But drunkenness is not only shown in the drinking of wine, but in all things, in which the mind is intoxicated and fluctuates with love and hatred, in contracts and business of the world, and cannot maintain its state. And because we are surrounded by fragile flesh, and we are compelled to do certain things that pertain to the body, such as providing for food and clothing and necessities, which we should not do, at least it is required of us that when we return to ourselves and understand why we were born, and enter the innermost sanctuary of the temple, we withdraw from the vices of the world and do not even commit the slightest sins. Through this, it is shown that we commit minor sins out of necessity of the flesh, and again, there is a time when, entering the inner courtyard, we must be free from all worldliness and external distractions.
