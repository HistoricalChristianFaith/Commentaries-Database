“And Chus [Cush] begat Nimrod. This man began to be powerful in the earth.” And after a little while, it says, “And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel and Arach and Achad and Chalanne in the land of Senaar [Shinar].” Nimrod, son of Chus, was the first to seize despotic rule over the people, which men were not yet accustomed to; and he reigned in Babylon, which was called Babel, because the languages of those building the tower were thrown into confusion there. For Babel signifies confusion. Then he also reigned in Arach, that is, in Edissa; and in Achad, which is now called Nisibis; and in Chalanne, which was later called Seleucia after king Seleucus when its name had been changed and which is now in actual fact called Ctesiphon.
