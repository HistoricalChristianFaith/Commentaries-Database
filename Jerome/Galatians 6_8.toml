All that we say, do or think is sown in two fields, the fallen nature and the Spirit. If what comes from our hand, mouth and heart is good, it is sown in the Spirit and will produce fruits of eternal life. If it is bad, when harvested from the field of the sin nature it will produce an unsavory crop of corruption for us.… It should be observed that to the one who sows in the flesh is given an additional term, “in his flesh.” But the one who sows in the Spirit is said not to sow in his spirit but simply “in the Spirit.” For the one who sows good things sows not in his own spirit but in God’s, from whom he will also reap eternal life.
