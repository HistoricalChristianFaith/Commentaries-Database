Chapter IX - (Verses 8 onwards) The Lord sent a word into Jacob, and it hath lighted upon Israel. And all the people shall know, even Ephraim and the inhabitant of Samaria, that say in the pride and stoutness of heart, The bricks are fallen down, but we will build with hewn stones: the sycomores are cut down, but we will change them into cedars. Therefore the LORD shall set up the adversaries of Rezin against him, and join his enemies together; The Syrians before, and the Philistines behind; and they shall devour Israel with open mouth. In all these things his anger is not turned away, but his hand is still stretched out, and the people have not turned back to the one who struck them, and they have not sought the Lord of hosts. We read above (2 Kings 16) that in the days of Ahaz son of Jotham, son of Uzziah, king of Judah, Rezin king of Syria went up, and Pekah son of Remaliah, king of Israel, came to Jerusalem to attack it. And (Isaiah 7) it is said that Isaiah the prophet was sent to meet Ahaz with his son Shear-Jashub, to tell him not to fear, and not to let his heart be faint because of the two smoldering stumps of firebrands, for the rule of Syria and Israel would soon come to an end. When he did not believe because of the magnitude of the matter and the immediate danger, he is ordered to ask for a sign for himself. And because he was an idolater, he did not want to do this either: therefore the Lord did not give a sign to the king himself, but to the house of David he gives a sign of his son who will be born of a Virgin, through whose invocation they will be delivered from imminent danger, and other things that we have interpreted up to this point. Therefore, with many mysteries being placed in the midst, now he returns to what he had begun, and prophesies the overthrow of Rezin and Ephraim, that is, of Syria and Samaria: The Lord sent a word into Jacob, and it has fallen upon Israel. Among the Hebrews, Dabar (), which is written with three consonant letters Daleth, Beth, and Res, depending on the quality of the places, if read as Dabar, it signifies 'word,' if Deber, 'death' and 'pestilence.' For this reason, many, being deceived by the ambiguity of the language, do not say that the word was sent, but death. Therefore, the Lord sent his word to Jacob, and it fell upon Israel. He wanted Judah to reign, as prophesied by Jacob in Genesis (Ch. XLIX): and Israel, that is, the ten tribes, claimed authority for themselves, of whom it was said: 'They have reigned, but not by me' (Hosea VIII, 4). Therefore, the dignity of the kingdom, which had passed from the rejected Saul to David through the anointing of Samuel, was transferred to Jacob, that is, to the twelve tribes, which were formerly called Jacob, in Israel: not as the LXX translated, 'came,' but fell among the wicked: which had been established for the righteous. Therefore, let the people of Ephraim and the inhabitants of Samaria, who are lifted up in pride because of their multitude, know that the kingdom of Judah is small and most insignificant compared to ours. Therefore, as their walls collapse, let us build ourselves a house with square stones. While their sycamore trees, which are cheap wood, are cut down in enemy attacks, let us construct our empire with cedars, which are indestructible, to signify an everlasting kingdom. Therefore, let all the people of Ephraim and the inhabitants of Samaria know that the Syrian who is now their ally will become their enemy. Or indeed, let sudden wars rise up against the Syrian himself, and let all things be turned into chaos, so that Syria may be moved against Israel from the east, and the Philistines, that is, the Palestinians, may be moved against them from the west, and together devour Israel. And when they have done these things, my hand is still stretched out, whether it is high above Israel, and it does not cease to strike them. And those who are cut off from God will not return to the one who strikes them, nor will they seek the Lord of hosts, worshipping golden calves instead of God. According to the anagoge, our scholars have explained this passage as follows: God sent his Son to Jacob, that is, to the Jews, and he came to Israel, that is, to the people of the nations, whom the Apostle also refers to as Israel (Rom. 9). But others say this: The Lord sent His word to the Church, which supplanted the former people, and fell in Israel, that is, in the heretics who boast of seeing God. Therefore, let their leaders and all who dwell in Samaria, that is, those who claim to keep God's law and to have an abundance of virtues and bring forth the fruits of righteousness (for this is what Ephraim signifies), know that they despise the Church in the pride of their hearts and consider its simplicity as ignorance. They say, 'Instead of its stones, we will build our own churches with square stones and the strongest ones, and instead of fruitless trees that quickly perish, we will construct the tallest cedars, which the Lord will destroy, and the righteous, speaking in the person of the wicked, will say, 'I have seen them but they have no place' (Psalm 36).' Therefore, the Lord says that Rasin, which is interpreted as secular wisdom, whom Ephraim relied on for help, will turn against him and all his enemies will fight against him, and he will be conquered from the East and the West, and they will devour Israel with their whole mouth. For these things, the LXX interpreted: Let us build a tower for ourselves, and God will crush those who rise against Mount Zion, and He will scatter its enemies. For they desire to build themselves a temple in Samaria, in imitation of the Temple of God; but although they have moved their feet from the East and have said, 'Come, let us build a tower and make a name for ourselves before we are scattered' (Gen. XI, 4): The Lord opposing them, their unity will be dissolved and their agreement will be scattered, and their tongues will be divided against each other, so that they do not become more evil by agreeing with each other, but rather destroy each other. And when they are thus struck and devoured by their enemies, they will not return to the Lord; but his hand is still ready to strike, according to what we read in Jeremiah: 'I struck your children in vain; you did not receive discipline' (Jerem. II, 30).
