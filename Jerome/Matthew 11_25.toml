(Verse 25) At that time, Jesus answered and said: I confess to you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth. Confession, not always repentance, but also signifies thanksgiving, as we often read in the psalms. Let those who calumniate the Savior for calling his Father the Lord of heaven and earth, not as one who is born, but as one who is created, hear. For if he is also a creature, and a creature can call its creator father, it would be foolish not to call both himself and the Lord of heaven and earth, or Father, in the same way.



74 Because you have hidden these things from the wise and prudent and have revealed them to little ones. He gives thanks and rejoices in the Father, because the sacraments of his coming have been revealed to the apostles, which the scribes and Pharisees, who consider themselves wise, have ignored, and in their own sight, prudent. Wisdom has been justified by her children.
