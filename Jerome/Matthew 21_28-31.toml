(Verse 28 and following) What do you think? A certain man had two sons; and going to the first, he said: Son, go today to work in my vineyard. But he, answering, said: I do not want to. Afterwards, however, moved by repentance, he went. Going to the second, he said similarly. But he, answering, said: Yes, sir, and he did not go. Which of the two did the will of the father? And they said to him: The first. Jesus said to them (Luke XV). Hi sunt duo filii, qui et in Lucae parabola describuntur, frugi et luxuriosus, et de quibus Zacharias propheta loquitur: Assumpsi mihi duas virgas: unam vocavi decorem, et alteram vocavi funiculum, et pavi gregem  (Zach. XI, 7) . Primo dicitur Gentilium populo per naturalis legis notitiam: Vade, et operare in vinea  mea: hoc est, quod tibi non vis fieri, alteri ne feceris  (Tob. IV) . Qui superbe respondit: Nolo. But afterwards, upon the arrival of the Savior, the works of repentance were done in the vineyard of God, and the insolence of speech was corrected by labor. However, the second son, who is the people of the Jews, replied to Moses: 'We will do everything that the Lord has spoken' (Exod. XXIV), but he did not go into the vineyard because, thinking himself the heir after the son of the household had been killed. But others do not consider it as a parable of the Gentiles and Jews, but rather of sinners and the righteous, as the Lord Himself later expounded on the matter.



Truly I tell you, the tax collectors and the prostitutes are entering the kingdom of God ahead of you. For John came to you to show you the way of righteousness, and you did not believe him, but the tax collectors and the prostitutes did. And even after you saw this, you did not repent and believe him.
