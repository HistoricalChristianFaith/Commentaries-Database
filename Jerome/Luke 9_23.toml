In truth, Christ came and made firm the human race that had been disturbed, so that it may not be moved for all eternity. His cross is the pillar of humankind; on this pillar he has built his house. When I say the cross, I am not thinking of the wood but of the passion.… Furthermore, what is the warning in the Gospel? “Unless you take up my cross, and daily follow me.” Mark what it says: Unless your soul has been made as ready for the cross as mine was for you, you cannot be my disciples.
