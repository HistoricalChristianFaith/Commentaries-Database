“I said: You are gods, all of you sons of the Most High.” Let Eunomius hear this, let Arius, who says that the Son of God is son in the same way that we are. That we are gods is not so by nature but by grace. “But to as many as received him he gave the power of becoming sons of God.” I made man for that purpose, that from men they may become gods. “I said: You are gods, all of you sons of the Most High.” Imagine the grandeur of our dignity; we are called gods and sons! I have made you gods just as I made Moses a god to Pharaoh, so that after you are gods, you may be made worthy to be sons of God. Reflect upon the divine words: “With God there is no respect of persons.” God did not say, “I said, you are gods, you kings and princes”; but “all” to whom I have given equally a body, a soul and a spirit, I have given equally divinity and adoption. We are all born equal, emperors and paupers; and we die as equals. Our humanity is of one quality.
