This shows the secret of each Testament, because, in those four animals, the law and the gospel hasten toward the future and never make any motion back.

(Verse 12) And each thing moved forward before its own face. Wherever the impulse of the spirit was, there they moved forward and did not turn back while they traveled. The one who holds the plowshare should not look back (Luke 9:62), nor should one imitate Lot's wife (Genesis 19), lest they fall into the punishment of Deuteronomy (Chapter 19) and perish like the incurable paralytic, whom Eli also fell because he had offended God with the fault of his sons (2 Kings 4). How much more should the four animals that were full of light and wings, which follow the preceding Holy Spirit, fly around the world and elevate themselves to the heights in order to protect their bodies with the feathers of history and not grant us a fuller vision? But what is also said secondly: They did not turn back when they went forward, signifies the sacrament of each of these four living creatures, and the Law and the Gospel hasten toward the future; and they never receive a backward movement.
