(Verse 14.) For if you forgive men their offenses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you your offenses. This is what is written: 'I said, you are gods, and all of you are sons of the Most High; nevertheless, you shall die like men, and fall like one of the rulers.' (Psalm 82:6-7) This is said to those who have deserved to be called gods because of their offenses. Therefore, rightly are they called men to whom offenses are forgiven.
