It would not have sufficed for the chief priests, scribes and Pharisees to have crucified the Lord our Savior if they had not also guarded the tomb, called in the military, sealed the entrance and, as far as they were able, resisted the resurrection. Their concern for these details serves only to advance our faith; the greater their precautionary care, the more fully is revealed the power of the resurrection. Thus he was buried in a new tomb cut from rock. If the tomb had been constructed from a mound of stones, it could have been said that his body was excavated from underneath the stones and secretly removed. That he had to be buried in a sepulcher is also shown by the prophecy which says, “He will dwell in a deep cave cut from the strongest rock,” and again, two verses further: “You will see the king in his glory.”

(Verse 64 and following) Therefore, command that the tomb be guarded until the third day, lest his disciples come and steal him away and tell the people, 'He has risen from the dead,' and the last deception will be worse than the first." Pilate said to them, "You have a guard of soldiers. Go, make it as secure as you can." So they went and made the tomb secure by sealing the stone and setting a guard. It was not enough for the chief priests, scribes, and Pharisees to have crucified the Lord and Savior, unless they also guarded the tomb, took a cohort, sealed the stone, and opposed their hands to the one rising, so that their diligence would benefit our faith: For the more it is kept hidden, the more the power of the resurrection is revealed. And in the new monument, which had been cut out of the rock, He was buried, so that if it had been built with many stones, the foundation of the tomb being dug up, it could be easily taken away by thieves. But as for where He was to be placed in the tomb, there is the testimony of the prophet, saying: He shall dwell in the rocky cave which is the strongest rock (Isaiah 33:16). And immediately after two verses, it follows: You shall see the King with glory (Ibid., 17).
