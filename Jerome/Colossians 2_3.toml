Can the workman be ignorant of his work? We read of Christ in St. Paul: “In whom are hidden all treasures of wisdom and knowledge.” Note: “all treasures of wisdom and knowledge.” Not that some are and some are not in him but that they are hidden. That which is in him, therefore, is not lacking to him, even though it be hidden to us. If, moreover, the treasures of wisdom and knowledge are hidden in Christ, we must find out why they are hidden. If we men were to know the day of judgment, that, for example, it would not be for two thousand years, and if we knew it so long ahead of time, we would be more careless on that account. We would say, for instance, What is it to me if the day of judgment will not be here for two thousand years? Scripture says, therefore, for our benefit, that “the Son does not know the day of judgment,” because we do not know when the day of judgment will be upon us; and further: “Take heed, watch and pray, for you do not know when the time is.” Not “we do not know” but “you do not know.” Homilies on Mark (x).
