"A feast
is made for laughter, and wine gladdens life, but money answers
everything. "I think that what follows relates to the
preceding verses. For with regard to the
sloth and the indolence of teachers the Church is lowered, and its roof is made
to fall, and its timbers leak, as we have shown above. Therefore here he is speaking of the
self-same teachers. And he has been seen
to accuse them, asking why they remain silent and do not make use of their duty
as teacher, (that is both for bishops and elders in the Church), saying that
they neither work on their speaking nor doctrine, the same that even Titus
admonishes [Cfr Tit. 1, 5.],
and is taught by Timothy [Cfr. I Tim. 4, 14.],
so that one does not forget the grace of God, which is bestowed upon a great
man. But in this respect they see
themselves as elders and bishops, so that they receive an allowance, and many
teachers ask for a two-fold glory, which is owed in fact to those who work on
their speaking and doctrines. But now he
takes the other side and accuses those who even speak in the Church and teach
the congregation, but they teach the people that which they like to hear,
because he flatters the sinner in his crime and incites the listeners to
applaud. For surely when such a teacher
is giving a lascivious speech in the Church, does he not promise the blessing
and realm of heaven to the crowd, as it will seem to you that his laughter
makes bread, and he mixes wine with the happiness of those who drink? Or as those who teach and seek riches, food,
and wealth through the promised delights. 
Or the bread of the Church, which is the bread of mourners, and not of
those who laugh, because those who weep are blessed, for they will laugh, and
will have joy in their happiness. He
also goes on to say: money or silver answers everything, and this must be taken
as two-fold: either that those learned men become rich after their praise, and
take their place at the head of the people, or indeed, since money is always
taken in return for a speech: for "the words of the LORD are pure words:
as silver extracted in a furnace of earth, purified seven times." [Ps. 12, 6.] He asserts this because the ignoble crowd is
always moved easily by eloquence and speeches, which are composed of a great
foliage of words. Differently: those
who have free-will and are forbidden to mourn and fast, make bread in their
laughter. Isaac gets his name from this
bread as well, and in the happiness of drinking they prepare wine. And so every holy man, who is teacher of the
Church, as Christ commanded, makes bread in his laughter and happiness, and hands
out cups of wine in his joy. Money also,
which answers everything, is given out as five, and two and one talent for the
head of the family in the Gospel [Cfr. Matth. 25, 15-30.]. And ten coins which are thought to be for
slaves in business.
