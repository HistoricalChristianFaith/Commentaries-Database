(Verse 7 and following) Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you. For everyone who asks receives, and he who seeks finds, and to him who knocks it will be opened. Or what man is there among you, if his son asks him for bread, will give him a stone? Or if he asks for a fish, will give him a serpent? He shows what we should seek, who had forbidden earthly things to be asked for. If it is given to the one who asks, and the one who seeks finds, and to the one who knocks it is opened, then it is clear that the one who has not been given, and the one who has not found, and the one to whom it has not been opened, has not asked, sought, and knocked properly. Let us therefore knock at the door of Christ, of which it is said: This is the gate of the Lord, the just shall enter into it (Ps. CXVII, 20); so that when we have entered, the hidden and dark treasures may be revealed to us in Christ Jesus, in whom is all knowledge (Coloss. II).
