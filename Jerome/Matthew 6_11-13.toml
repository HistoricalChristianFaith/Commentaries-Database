(Vers. 11-13.) Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. The word 'supersubstantial,' which we have expressed, is rendered in Greek as 'ἐπιούσιον,' a term that the Septuagint translators frequently translate as 'περιούσιον.' Therefore, we examined the Hebrew, and wherever they translated 'περιούσιον,' we found 'Sgolla,' which Symmachus translated as 'ἐξαίρετον,' meaning exceptional or outstanding, although he did interpret it differently in one particular instance. Therefore, when we ask that God give us extraordinary or exceptional bread, we ask for Him who says: 'I am the living bread that came down from heaven' (John 6:51). In the Gospel called according to the Hebrews, instead of 'supersubstantial bread,' I found the word 'mahar,' which means 'for tomorrow'; so the meaning is: 'Give us our bread for tomorrow,' that is, for the future, today. We can also understand the 'supersubstantial bread' in another way, referring to the bread that is above all substances and exceeds all creatures. Others simply think, according to the words of the Apostle (I Tim. VI, 8): Having food and clothing, with these we are content, that we should only be concerned with providing for the holy present food. Hence, in the following it is commanded: Do not worry about tomorrow.

Amen. The sign of the Lord's Prayer is: which the Eagle interprets faithfully: we, truly, can say.
