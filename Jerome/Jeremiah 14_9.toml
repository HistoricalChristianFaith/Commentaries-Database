(Verse 9) Why are you going to be like a tenant on the land, and like a traveler turning to stay? Why are you going to be like a wanderer, or like a strong man who cannot save? Septuagint: Why have you become like a stranger in the land, and like a foreigner turning to stay? Are you going to be like a sleeping man, and like a man who cannot save? The Jews understand this place thus: Why do you separate yourself from your people? And like a traveler seeking shelter for only one hour, you do not care about the quality of the lodging you use, but going on to other things, you do not save your people, and you abandon the once illustrious temple? But they believe that of the future dispensation of Christ it is said that he will be a stranger on earth, and, for a short time, will inhabit the earth as a guest, and, like a passing and robust man, having left Israel, will turn towards the multitude of nations; so that he may pass from place to place, from people to people, from Temple to Church. And what is said according to the Septuagint: Will you be like a sleeping man, and like a man who cannot save? He sets forth a likeness, not the truth of the thing, according to what is written: Arise, why do you sleep, O Lord (Psalm 43:23)? not that the Lord sleeps, of whom it is said: Neither will He sleep, nor slumber who keeps Israel (Psalm 121:4); but because it appears that He sleeps to those whom He forsakes. Moreover, it is not written in the following, a man sleeping who cannot save; but it is written as if it were a man, in both cases subject to human passions.


But you are in us, Lord, and your name is invoked upon us, do not forsake us (or do not forget us). You, who are about to become like a stranger and traveler among the Jews, and a wandering man, and who abandon the old dwelling, dwell in us; and your name is invoked upon us (Prov. 31), so that we may be called Christians, therefore do not forsake us, and do not forget us, to whom the mouths of all the Prophets have sung about your future coming.
