He had often told His disciples of His passion, but because it might have slipped out of their recollection by reason of the many things they had heard in the mean while, now when He is going to Jerusalem, and going to take His disciples with Him, He fortifies them against the trial, that they should not be scandalized when the persecution and shame of the Cross should come.

(Ver. 17 seqq.) And Jesus, going up to Jerusalem, took his twelve disciples aside privately, and said to them: Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be delivered to the chief priests and scribes, and they will condemn him to death, and deliver him to the Gentiles to be mocked, and scourged, and crucified, and on the third day he will rise again. He had often told this to his disciples, but because they were engaged in many disputes among themselves, they could easily forget what they had heard. So, as he was about to go to Jerusalem and take the apostles with him, he prepared them for the trial, so that they would not be scandalized when persecution and the ignominy of the cross come.
