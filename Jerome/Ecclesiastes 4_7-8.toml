"Then I
returned and contemplated futility beneath the sun: a lone and solitary man who
has neither son nor brother, yet there is no end to his toil, nor is his eye
ever sated with riches, nor does he ask himself, 'For whom am I toiling and
depriving myself of goodness.' This too
is futility, indeed, it is a sorry task." I turned to
other people and I saw that they work more than is necessary and amass wealth
by good and bad means and do not use it once accumulated; they have all things,
brood over their riches, keep it for another, and do not enjoy their work. Then at the end of their life they have
neither son nor brother, nor close friend so that the pious work seems reserved
for necessities only. And so I
discovered nothing more vain than that man, who collects riches, or to whom an
ignorant man bequeaths them. We are even
able to understand this in a religious interpretation, and understand it as
those, who write books and leave them to fastidious readers. Some say that this passage from where it says
"there is one, but there is not a second" is about the Saviour,
because he came down to save the world alone and without any companion. And although there are many sons of God, they
are called his brothers by adoption, though not one remains worthy, who should
be joined to him in this work. There is
no end to this work, for those carrying our faults and sins and suffering for
us; and his eye will not be filled by riches, but always with those desiring
our safety, and the more you see his sins, the more he encourages him to
repent.
