(Vers. 3.) Those crossing the sea fill you, in many waters, with the seed of the Nile, and the harvest of its river. Tyre rejoices in trade, and is the market of the whole world, and the present times prove it, as described by Ezekiel in his lengthy discourse. That merchants cross the seas in transporting goods is not doubted by anyone; nor does the city itself have such great wealth from the land of its region, which is very narrow, and is pressed by the borders of Galilee and Damascus, as it has from the transportation of ships. The entire Nile and the fertility of Egypt are poured out nearby Tyre. Regarding the Nile, which we read as Sior among the Hebrews, it was interpreted by the Septuagint and Theodotion as meaning turbid, and therefore signifies the waters of the Nile. As Jeremiah testifies, what do you have to do with the waters of Geon, and Egypt, that you drink from turbid waters (Jeremiah II, 18): for which in Hebrew it is called Sior, that is, turbid.
