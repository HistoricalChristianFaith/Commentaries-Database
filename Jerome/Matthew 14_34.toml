(Verse 34.) And when he had crossed over, they came to the land of Genesaret. If we knew what Genesaret would resonate in our language, we would understand how Jesus, through the symbol of the apostles and the boat, leads the Church freed from the shipwreck of persecution to the shore, and makes it rest in a very peaceful harbor.
