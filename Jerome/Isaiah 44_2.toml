For “Jeshurun,” a Hebrew word, the other translators translate euthytaton or euthē, that is, “most right” and “right,” and only the Septuagint had “most loved” and connected it to “Israel.” For according to the Hebrew and the faith of the Scriptures, “Israel” means “the sight of God,” that is, a person who sees God, not in the natural things but in the sound of his voice.… Isaiah also compares those being reborn in baptism with flourishing plants and with the willow, which rises up near flowing water. Against the nature of things the willow bears fruit, although it was previously barren or became barren because its seed was taken for food.
