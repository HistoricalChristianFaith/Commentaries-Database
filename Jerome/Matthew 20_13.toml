(Verse 13.) Friend, I do not harm you. I read in a certain book that this friend who is rebuked by the head of the household is understood as the first hour worker, the prototype, and those who believed at that time.

Did you not come with me from a denarius? A denarius has the figure of a king. Therefore, you have received the reward that I promised to you, that is, my image and likeness: what more do you seek? And it is not so much that you want to receive more yourself, but rather that you desire that no one else receive anything, as if the merit of the reward would be diminished by sharing it with another.
