(Verse 45 onwards) And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: Son of man, set your face toward the south, and drop your word toward the south, and prophesy against the forest of the south field. And say to the forest of the south: Hear the word of the Lord: thus says the Lord God, Behold, I will kindle a fire in you, and it shall devour every green tree in you, and every dry tree: the flaming flame shall not be quenched, and all faces from the south to the north shall be burned therein. And all flesh shall see that I the LORD have kindled it: it shall not be quenched. And I said, 'Ah, Lord GOD! They say of me, 'Does he not speak in parables?' LXX: And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 'Son of man, set thy face towards Teman, and prophesy against the forest of the south field; and say to the forest of the south field: 'Hear the word of the LORD, thus saith the Lord GOD: Behold, I will kindle a fire in thee, and it shall devour every green tree in thee, and every dry tree.' The kindled flame will not be extinguished, and it will burn in it all faces from the south to the north: and all flesh will know that I, the Lord, have kindled it: it will not be extinguished. And I said: By no means, O Lord, O Lord: they say to me: Is not this a parable? What does it mean to put or harden your face, we have explained more fully above. For the hardening of the face is necessary, and the hardness of the forehead, so that the Prophets may speak fearlessly what is commanded, especially when sad things are announced to the whole multitude of the people. But our translation expresses what they have said, that Nageb should be understood in Hebrew as the leader of the southern land or region, not Sare, as the LXX thought, which signifies the word leader and prince, but it is written Sade, which properly signifies land and region, and because of the similarity of the letters Daleth and Res, the error prevailed. But divine speech speaks in the metaphor of a leap against Jerusalem, which is the dwelling place of beasts and fierce men: that is, it sets it on fire, and all its trees are burned up. It does not call these trees, which were in need of fruit, but rather prepares them as if for a fire. And first it burns the green wood in it, secondly, that which we read in this same Prophet: 'And begin with my holy ones'; and afterwards the dry wood, which could not have any life in itself: namely, the holy ones and sinners together, so that some escape the evils of captivity through death, and others be handed over to eternal torments. And it also signifies this: from the South to the North, from Jerusalem to Babylon, so that every journey of those proceeding into captivity, falling by sword, famine, and pestilence, is completed. For those who are in Babylon, Jerusalem is situated to the South; just as, on the contrary, the pot in Jeremiah which signifies Jerusalem is set on fire from the face of the North, that is, Babylon. And beautifully in the beginning: a drop, he says, to the South; so that not the whole wrath of God appears to be poured out, but a certain drop and part. But if a drop of such cruelty exists, what is to be valued in all the rains? So that all flesh, which is to see the salvation of God, may know through the burning and flame of the forests, which is extinguished by no one's help, that He Himself is the Lord. Understanding this, the Prophet responded, ah, ah, ah, O Lord God, or as the Seventy translated, by no means, O Lord, O Lord. And he adds: And they say to me: Does this man not speak in parables? And what is this parable called? And the meaning is: Speak more plainly, we do not understand what you are saying in the parable: reveal to us the meaning in clear language. The names Theman, Nageb, and Darom can be understood tropologically as Egypt: for we often read in Daniel that the South stands for Egypt (Dan. 11), and Egypt refers to the limitations of this world. Therefore, Ezekiel prophesies the future evils that will come to the world, which he calls a desert without fruit-bearing trees, but a dwelling place for wild animals. Of which it is said in the 28th psalm: The voice of the Lord perfecting the deer, and he will reveal the hidden places of the forests (Verse 9). These are the forests and woodlands that devoured more from the army of Absalom in battle than the sword killed (2 Samuel 18). And the first green tree is set on fire in the woods, and then it becomes dry, those who live in evil and those who are dead to righteousness. And what is said: And every face will be burned from the South to the North, this means: From those who seemed to be fervent in spirit to those who, with the increase of iniquity and the cooling of charity of many, have lost their former zeal; so that all flesh may see the flame of the Lord not extinguished. And the prophet prays that what the Lord has threatened may not come to pass, that is, that the forest may not be set on fire and all the trees may not be destroyed, so that either they may still have a place for repentance or the necessity of announcing sad news may not be imposed on them, especially since the people do not understand those things and, because of the obscurity of the words, are more likely to be driven to madness.
