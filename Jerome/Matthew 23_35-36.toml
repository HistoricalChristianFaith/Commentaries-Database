(Verses 35, 36.) So that upon you may come all the righteous blood shed on earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah son of Barachiah, whom you murdered between the temple and the altar. Truly I tell you, all these things will come upon this generation. Regarding Abel, there is no doubt that he is the one whom his brother Cain killed. But the righteousness of Zechariah is not only confirmed now by the judgment of the Lord, but also by the testimony of Genesis (Gen. IV), where the offerings accepted by God are narrated. We inquire who this Zacharias son of Barachiah is, because we have read of many Zachariases. And so that no opportunity for error might be given, it has been added: whom you have killed between the temple and the altar. Different things are read in different places, and I ought to present the opinions of different authors. Some say that it is Zacharias son of Barachiah, who is the eleventh among the twelve prophets, and that the name of the father agrees with him; but where he was killed between the temple and the altar, Scripture does not speak: especially since during his time there were hardly any ruins of the temple. Some suggest that Zacharias is the father of John, approving this based on certain apocryphal dreams, stating that he was killed because he preached the coming of the Savior. However, since this does not have authority from the Scriptures, it is dismissed with the same ease with which it is proven. Others believe this Zacharias to be the one who was killed by King Joash of Judah between the temple and the altar, as the history of the Kings narrates. But it should be noted that this Zacharias is not the son of Barachiah, but the son of Jehoiada the priest. And Scripture also reports: He did not remember the kindness Joash, his father, had shown him (2 Chronicles 24:22). Therefore, if we consider Zachariah and the place where he was killed, we wonder why he is called the son of Barachiah and not Joiada. Barachiah in our language means blessed by the Lord, and the righteousness of the priest Joiada is demonstrated in the Hebrew language. In the Gospel used by the Nazarenes, we find written that he is the son of Joiada instead of Barachiah. The simpler brethren among the ruins of the temple and the altar, or at the exits of the gates that lead to Siloam, pointing to the red stones, consider them to be polluted with the blood of Zechariah. We do not condemn the error that stems from hatred of the Jews and devotion to the faith. Let us briefly explain why the blood of the righteous Abel to the son of Barachiah is sought from that generation, even though neither of them killed him. The rule of the Scriptures is to present two generations, of the good or the evil, that is, one for each individual. Let us take examples of good things: Who shall ascend into the mountain of the Lord? or who shall rest in his holy mountain? (Ps. 23:3) And when he has described those who are going to ascend into the mountain of the Lord, who were of different ages, afterward he adds: This is the generation of them that seek the Lord, that seek the face of the God of Jacob. And in another place concerning all the saints: The generation of the righteous shall be blessed. (Ps. 112:2) But concerning the wicked, as in the present place: The generation of vipers. And all things will be required from this generation. And in Ezekiel, when he described the sins of the land, the prophetic word added: If Noah, and Job, and Daniel were found there, I will not forgive the sins of that land (Ezek. 14:14): All the righteous who would be like them in virtues, by Noah and Job and Daniel, wanting to be understood. Therefore, those who have done similar things to Cain and Joash against the apostles are referred to as being from the same generation.
