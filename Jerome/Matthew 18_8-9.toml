(Verse 8, 9) But if your hand or your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life maimed or crippled than to have two hands or two feet and be thrown into the eternal fire. And if your eye causes you to stumble, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into the fire of hell. Indeed, it is necessary for scandals to come, but woe to the person through whom the scandal comes! Therefore, every affection is cut off and every proximity is amputated, so that no one of the believers may be exposed to scandals through the opportunity of piety. If, he says, someone is so connected to you like a hand, foot, eye, and is useful and caring, and sharp in discerning: but he causes scandal to you, and he drags you into hell because of the disparity of his behavior: it is better that you both avoid his proximity and carnal benefits, so that while you want to profit your relatives and necessary ones, you don't end up causing ruins. Therefore, neither brother, nor wife, nor children, nor friends, nor any affection that can exclude us from the kingdom of heaven, should be preferred to the love of the Lord. Each believer knows what harms themselves, what troubles their soul, and is often tested. It is better to lead a solitary life than to lose eternal life for the needs of this present life.
