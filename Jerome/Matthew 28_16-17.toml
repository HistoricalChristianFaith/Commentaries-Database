(Verse 16, 17.) However, the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had told them to go. When they saw him, they worshipped him; but some doubted. After the resurrection, Jesus is seen on a mountain in Galilee and is worshipped there; although some doubt, their doubt strengthens our faith. Then he shows himself more clearly to Thomas and shows him the wound in his side from the spear and the nails in his hands.
