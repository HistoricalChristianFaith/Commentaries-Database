The Lord went to the banquet of sinners that he might have an opportunity to teach and to offer spiritual food to his hosts. In effect, when he is mentioned as frequently going out to attend feasts, nothing is said other than what he did there and taught there. Thus, we see both the Lord’s humility in reaching out to sinners and the force of his teaching in converting penitents. What follows: “I desire mercy, and not sacrifice” and “I came not to call the righteous but sinners” (as he cites testimony from the prophet) challenged the scribes and Pharisees, who considered themselves righteous and shunned both publicans and sinners.
