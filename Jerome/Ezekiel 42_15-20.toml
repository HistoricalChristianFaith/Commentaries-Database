(Verse 15 onwards) When he had finished measuring the interior dimensions of the house, he led me along the way of the gate that faced east, and he measured it all around. (He measured the likeness of the house all around in order.) He measured the east side with the measuring rod; it was 500 rods long by the measuring rod all around. (He also measured the north side, south side, and west side.) And he measured against the north wind, five hundred cubits, measuring with a cubit in circumference. And he measured against the south wind, five hundred cubits, measuring with a cubit in circumference. And he measured against the west wind, five hundred cubits, measuring with a cubit. He measured on all four sides, the wall surrounding it, with a length of five hundred cubits and a width of five hundred cubits, dividing between the sanctuary and the common area. It should be known that after the East and North wind, the South and West wind has a reversed order among the Seventy. For they first set the West, that is the sea; and then the South, whereas among the Hebrews the South wind is first, and then the West. And what the Scripture now says: 'And when he had finished measuring the interior of the house, he led me through the gate that faces toward the East, and showed me all that has been mentioned, both inside and out, and the inner parts of the temple, that is, the Most Holy Place, properly belong to the building of the temple and the inner temple.' Now it follows: He led me through the gate, which looked towards the Eastern road, and measured it all around, like the likeness of a house. By this it is shown that it is not the house itself, but the likeness of the house that is seen: for now we see through a glass darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then I shall know even as I am known (I Cor. XIII). Therefore, even Moses in the tabernacle, and Solomon in the building, made not the true tent of the temple, but the likeness and figure of it: that by these things which are lesser and earthly, we may understand those things which are heavenly, and in the spiritual building. But the man who had brought the prophet, went not into the outer courtyard, but through the gate which looked towards the eastern way, first measuring against the eastern wind, that is, the eastern quarter, five hundred reeds round about; second, towards the north; thirdly, towards the south; fourthly, towards the sea, that is, towards the west, on the four sides, a wall all around, as much in length as in breadth, that is, square, which wall had together with it two thousand reeds. But if the reed was six cubits long, and the wrestler one-sixth of a cubit, it is clear that the outer wall had a circumference of 2,000 reeds, which makes 12,333 cubits and a third of two thousand. Let the wise and diligent reader read the book of Joshua and he will find how this measure is preserved in the suburbs. Therefore, even the legion of demons chose this number in the suffocation of the pigs (Luke 8), so that he who was separated from the servants of God by the command of the Lord may be led to his own destruction, to the ruin of those who lead a life worthy of filth and squalor. But every exterior wall, which has a very spacious length and width in the form of a square, contains the number of the apostles, that is, twelve thousand: so that a thousand number is assigned to each apostle, and yet it does not reach the measure of the fullness of Christ and the perfect man, unless it is joined by the παλαιστὴ, which is three hundred and thirty-three cubits, and a third part of a cubit: through which the mystery of the holy and venerable Trinity is demonstrated, which encircles and protects everything, and provides the safest dwelling for the inhabitants of its temple. Where the ark of Noah has a length of three hundred cubits, and a height of thirty cubits, which is completed in one cubit (Gen. 5). But the fifty cubits that are added there in width signify the sacrament of remission (as we have often said). Hence the Lord came to baptism at the age of thirty, and this very prophet puts the thirtieth year at the beginning of his book: which is completed by adding three hundred and thirtieth, and the thirtieth number and a third part. However, in regard to the simplicity of the interpretation, while we pay little attention to the speed of dictation, both the Septuagint and our translation have its wall on all sides, with a length of five hundred cubits and a width of five hundred cubits. The Hebrew text, however, does not include the word 'wall', but simply the length of five hundred and the width of five hundred, with the understanding of 'reeds'. As mentioned earlier, towards the east wind, and towards the north, and towards the south, and towards the sea, the wall of each section was measured by the person holding the reed. But the number five hundred, which is close to fifty, concerning the remission of all sins, is indicated not only in the old Scripture (Lev. XXV), but also in the words of the Savior in the Gospel, saying: There were two debtors to a certain creditor: one owed five hundred denarii, and the other fifty (Luke VII, 41). And the wall divides between the sanctuary and the place of the common people. From this we understand that all the description above the temple, the priests, who are the sons of Zadok, were delegated to ministries. But this wall, which stretches over such a large space and surrounds everything, separates the sanctuary from the common area.
