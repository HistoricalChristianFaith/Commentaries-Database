They died, for they could not enter the promised land. They merely looked over toward the land of promise, but they could not enter it. The Jews beheld the promised land but could not enter it. They died in the desert.â€¦ We, their children, under the leadership of Jesus, have come to the Jordan and entered the promised land.
