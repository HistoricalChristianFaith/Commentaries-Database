(Verse 32) But Jesus, calling together his disciples, said: I have compassion for the crowd, because they have persevered with me for three days already and have nothing to eat. And I do not want to send them away hungry, lest they faint on the way. He wants to feed those whom he has healed; first, he removes their weakness so that later he can offer food to the healthy. He also calls his disciples and speaks to them about what he is going to do, either to provide an example to the teachers, that they should share their plans with their subordinates and disciples, or so that they understand the magnitude of the miracle from their conversation, responding that they do not have loaves of bread in the desert. He said, 'I have compassion for the crowd, because they have been staying with me now for three days and have nothing to eat. If I send them away hungry to their homes, they will faint on the way; and some of them have come from a great distance.' Therefore, he who hurries to reach the desired dwelling without heavenly bread is in danger. Thus the angel speaks to Elijah: Arise and eat, for you will walk a long way.
