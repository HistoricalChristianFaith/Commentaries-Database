(Verse 15.) Without measure. He spoke beautifully, without measure, to show Christ in water, John to be baptized by Christ in spirit. Or differently, without measure: so that I, who assumed the form of a servant, may fulfill his humility. Otherwise, know that you shall be baptized by me in the day of my judgment. Without measure, says the Lord Jesus, I have another baptism by which I must be baptized. You baptize me in water, so that I may baptize you for me in your blood.
