Chapter 25: And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: Son of man, set your face against the sons of Ammon, and prophesy against them. And you shall say to the sons of Ammon: Hear the word of the Lord God! Thus says the Lord God: Because you said, 'Aha!' over my sanctuary when it was profaned, and over the land of Israel when it was laid waste, and over the house of Judah when they went into exile, therefore behold, I am giving you to the people of the East for a possession, and they shall set their encampments in you and make their dwellings in you. They shall eat your fruit, and they shall drink your milk. I will make Rabbah a pasture for camels and the land of the Ammonites a fold for flocks. Then you will know that I am the Lord. Because the Lord God says these things: Because you clapped your hands, and stomped your feet, and rejoiced with all your heart (or insulted with all your soul) over the land of Israel; therefore (Vulgate adds behold) I will stretch out my hand against you, and deliver you to be plundered by the nations, and I will kill you from the peoples, and I will destroy you from the lands, and I will crush you, and you will know that I am the Lord. When Jerusalem was captured or besieged, after it came to Babylon, whoever could (or had the power to) escape, and he reported that the city was about to be captured very soon, or that the temple had been destroyed, according to the custom of all the prophets against the other surrounding nations, who insulted the ruins of Jerusalem, and the burning of the temple, the prophetic message turns, firstly against the sons of Ammon, who had a metropolis called Rabbath, which today is named Philadelphia by King Ptolemy of Egypt, also known as Philadelphus, who held both Arabia and Judah. Son, he says, of man, set your face against the sons of Ammon, who are descended from Lot, and say to them: Thus says the Lord God (for these are not the words of a prophet, but of the Lord. Concerning the hardening of the face, we have argued more fully in this same prophecy): Because you have said, 'Aha, Aha,' or have insulted and rejoiced because my temple and sanctuary have been defiled by the invasion of enemies, and over the land of Israel, which has been devastated, and especially over the house of Judah, that is, the two tribes that are now in captivity: therefore I will give you over to the sons of Edom, whom we interpret as the Easterners. There is no doubt, Madianites, that they border the entire wilderness of the land of Arabia, who have herds of camels, and multitudes of sheep and goats, and they sustain themselves with these resources. This is also narrated in the book of Judges (Judg. VI) about what happened to the land of Israel when the Midianites came and devoured all their regions up to Gaza. Metaphorically, therefore, by the term Midianites, it signifies the Ishmaelites and Hagarites, who are now called Saracens, taking for themselves the false name of Sarah so that they may appear to be born of a noble and mistress lineage. Scripture also says about king Nebuchadnezzar and his entire army that they come and capture the city of Rabbath, which either has this name specifically or because of its greatness. For Rabbath is said to be the greatest. And so that we do not doubt that Nebuchadnezzar overthrew Arabia after Jerusalem was captured, Scripture testifies above: And thou, son of man, set thee two ways, Ammon and Jerusalem, and there shall come the sword of the king of Babylon. And again: At the head of the city's way he shall cast it, and thou shalt set up a way, that the sword may come to Rabbath of the children of Ammon, and to the fortified Jerusalem (Above, XXI, 19, 20). And again, thus says the Lord God to the sons of Ammon, and to their reproach (verse 28). Therefore, the sons of Kedem will come and set up their tents like shepherds, and they will pitch their tents. They will destroy your crops and drink the milk and abundance of the land, with herds of camels and all the peoples, so that the sons of Ammon will be in the dwelling place of cattle and understand the necessity of evil, that it is the Lord himself who foretold the future and commanded it to be. And this was not enough for the Ammonites, that they insulted and said, 'Hurrah, hurrah for the temple and sanctuary of the Lord, which was defiled by the entrance of various nations'; but such was the wickedness of their insults that the whole people clapped their hands and stamped their feet, and with all their heart cried out: because the land of Israel was desolate. Therefore, not by angels, nor by other ministries, but by the Lord himself, extending his hand to strike, will he hand it over to plunder, not to camels and sheep herds, but more clearly to the nations, so that it may be completely eradicated from the number of peoples, and perish, and be reduced to nothingness: and after it has been crushed, then it will understand that he himself is the Lord who judges all things, and has power over all lands. We can understand the sons of Ammon according to the tropology, who were born from Lot in the cave, both born in drunkenness and incest, all heretics, of whom the Scripture and the Apostle John say: They went out from us, but they were not of us. For if they had been of us, they would have remained with us (John 2:19). For they arose from inclination, for this is how Lot is translated into our language: For all have turned aside, together they have become worthless; there is no one who does good, not even one (Psalm 14:3). Opposite to these, the prophetic face is set or hardened, in order to crush them with its severity, and it says to them: Because you have insulted my Church in the time of persecution, because my sanctuary was defiled by the fault of various people, either by those who served me, or by the cruelty of the enemies who persecuted me: and also the land of Israel, which saw the sense of God, is desolate of the choir of virtues; and how the children of the house of Judah, that is, those who confess God, in which true faith and right confession exist, were led into captivity and ceased serving the Lord: therefore, O all who insult, you will be handed over to the children of the East who have come from the true light, and you will be handed over as an inheritance, so that you too may learn to confess the Lord. And by way of translation it is said that the sons of the East will place their dwellings upon them, and pitch their tents, and drink milk, and eat fruit, and the city which was once full of pride will become a dwelling place for camels, so that they, having set aside the burden of sins, may enter through the eye of a needle (Matthew 19), and into the fold of the animals, which are guided by a good shepherd (John 10), so that when they have done this, mixed and handed over to the shepherds of the East, they may understand that he himself is the Lord. And again he reproached them, for insulting with excessive affection of the heart the ruins of the people of God, and for thinking that the land of Israel was completely deserted. For this they deserve the hand of God's avenger, as they had exceeded the limit of rejoicing and joy over the destruction of the house of Judah. They should by no means be delivered to the sons of the East, but be for plundering by all nations, and be killed and perish, and be crushed, and by no means be considered descendants of Abraham, but be believed to be for all nations. And then they shall know the magnitude of their evils, and their own contrition, and the killing of the people, that He Himself is the Lord. What we have understood in general about the Church can be understood about each of the saints, whose ruin the people of the world and the powers of the enemy rejoice in if they have lost their chastity for a long time: while the wicked think that they find comfort in their sins if they have more partners in crime and punishment: and no one does this, unless they are a son of Ammon, that is, a son of the people, who is born in a decline.
