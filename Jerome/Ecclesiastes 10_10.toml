"If a
blade is blunt and one has not sharpened the edge, nevertheless it strengthens
the warriors. Wisdom is a more powerful
skill. "If someone, he says, has seen himself lose knowledge of
the Scriptures through negligence, and the shrewdness of his intelligence has
been blunted, nonetheless he remains disturbed, and he would be just as he had
been when he started. But it happens,
meanwhile, that he that has a little knowledge is led into pride and stops
learning and reading, and little by little takes away from that which now adds
nothing to him. Thus the heart of the
pupil remains empty, and a blade that has been sharpened is made blunt. For rest and laziness are like a kind of rust
of wisdom. So then if anyone has
suffered this, let him not despair the remedy for his health, but let him go to
his teacher and be instructed again by him, and then after much toil and hard
work, and a great deal of much sweat, he will be able to regain that wisdom
that he had lost. And this is what is
said in the Hebrew more to the point: he will be strengthened by might, that
is, by toil, by sweat, by hard work, and daily reading, then wisdom will follow
suit, and his toil will come to an end, so that he might be able to receive
wisdom once more.
