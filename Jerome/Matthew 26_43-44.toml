(Verse 43, 44.) And he came again and found them sleeping. For their eyes were heavy. And leaving them, he went away again and prayed for the third time, saying the same thing. He alone prays for all, just as he alone suffers for everyone. But the apostles' eyes grew weak and burdened by imminent denial.
