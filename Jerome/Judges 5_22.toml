quote='''
(Judges 5:22) Then the hooves of the horses fell off, with a powerful force to those fleeing, and headlong to the bravest of the enemies who were rushing. 'Their hooves,' it is read in Hebrew; for it is reported that the hooves of their horses fell off from hailstones from the heavens, that is, from their angels. So the meaning is: If the hooves of the horses fell off from touching the stones, what do you think happened to the riders?
