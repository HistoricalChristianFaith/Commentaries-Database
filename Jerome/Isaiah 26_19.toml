In the same way that the Lord becomes the light, the way, the truth, the bread, the vine, the fire, the shepherd, the lamb, the door, and many other things to believers, so also does he become the dew to us who are in need of his mercy and know ourselves to be feverish with sin, about whom Isaiah said, “The dew which is from you is their health.” - "Commentary on Hosea 3.14.5–9"

We should love the dew about which Moses said, “May my words descend as the dew,” and about which Isaiah also said, “The dead shall rise again, and all who were in the graves shall rise again, for the dew which is from you is their health.” - "Commentary on Hosea 2.6.5"
