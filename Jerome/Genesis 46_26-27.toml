(Chapter XLVI, Verse 26 and following) Therefore all the souls that entered Egypt with Jacob, and those that came out of his thighs, apart from the wives of Jacob's sons, were sixty-six souls; and the sons of Joseph, who were born to him in Egypt, were nine souls. Therefore all the souls that entered Egypt with Jacob were seventy-five. It is without doubt that except for Joseph and his sons, sixty-six souls that came out of Jacob's thighs entered Egypt. For thus also, gradually through each calculated number, it is proven, and it is found in the Hebrew volumes. But what we read in the Septuagint: And the sons of Joseph, who were born to him in Egypt, were nine souls: let us know that in Hebrew, instead of nine, there are two. For Ephraim and Manasseh were born to him before Jacob entered Egypt, and before the time of famine. They were born of Aseneth, the daughter of Potiphera, in Egypt. But also that which we read above: And the sons of Manasseh became, whom the Syrian concubine gave birth to him, Machir, and Machir gave birth to Gilead; and the sons of Ephraim, the brother of Manasseh, Suthalaam, and Thaam; and the sons of Suthalaam, Edem, it is added: indeed, what we read afterwards is described as if it had happened by anticipation. For at that time when Jacob entered Egypt, Ephraim and Manasseh were not old enough to be able to have children. From this it is evident that all the souls who entered Egypt from the loins of Jacob were seventy, but afterwards sixty-six entered, and they found (Al. gave birth to) three souls in Egypt, namely Joseph with his two sons, and the seventieth was Jacob himself. In order that we do not seem to speak against the authority of Scripture, even the Seventy Interpreters translated in Deuteronomy (X, 22) that Jacob (also called Israel) entered Egypt with seventy souls. Therefore, if anyone opposes our opinion, they will make Scripture contradict itself. For the Seventy Interpreters themselves, who said that seventy-five souls, including Joseph and his descendants, entered Egypt through πρόληψις, only mentioned in Deuteronomy that seventy entered (some say 'entered'). But if the opposite is opposed to us, how is it said in the Acts of the Apostles (VII) , in the sermon of Stephen to the people, that seventy-five souls entered Egypt; the explanation is easy. For Saint Luke, who is the author of the history itself, should not have written anything contrary to that Scripture, which had already been made known to the Gentiles, when he published the volume of the Acts of the Apostles. And certainly, at that time, the authority of the Seventy Interpreters was considered greater than that of Luke, who was unknown, and despised, and not held in high esteem by the nations. However, it is generally observed that wherever the holy Apostles or Apostolic men speak to the peoples, they often make use of testimonies that had already been spread among the nations: although many report that Luke the Evangelist, as a proselyte, was ignorant of the Hebrew letters.
