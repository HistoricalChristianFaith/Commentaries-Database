Verse 29. "'I have therefore determined upon this decree (the Vulgate says: "have appointed this decree"): that any people, tribe or tongue which utters blasphemy against the God of Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego shall utterly perish and his house shall be laid waste. For there is no other God who can save after such a fashion.'" Some authorities very wrongly apply this to the devil himself, asserting that in the consummation at the end of the world even the devil himself will receive a knowledge of God and will exhort all men to repent. These persons would have it that this is the king of Nineveh who finally descends from his proud throne and attains to the rewards of humility.

The three young people surely did not sin, nor were they old enough at the time they were deported to Babylon to justify being punished for their personal faults. Thus, it must mean that they were, therefore, speaking as representatives of the people in the same way as the apostle when he said, “What I do is not what I want, the actions that I do are those which I do not want to do,” and so it goes throughout the rest of that passage in a similar context. - "Commentary on Daniel 3.29"

Now of course the three youths had not sinned, nor were they old enough when brought to Babylon to warrant being punished for their own faults. Consequently they were speaking as representatives of their people, in the same manner as the Apostle had to state: "For what I wish to do, that I do not; but what I do not want, that I carry into effect" (Rom 7:19), and so on with the rest of that same passage.
