(Verse 4, 5.) The voice of the multitude on the mountains, like the voice of many people: the sound of the gathered kings of nations. The Lord of hosts has commanded the forces of war to come from afar, from the top of the heavens. The Lord and His vessels of fury, to destroy all the earth. The attack of the Medes and Persians is described: with many auxiliary forces gathered, their army led by their Lord, they come to lay waste to Babylon, to destroy all the earth: not that they have devastated the whole world, but all the land of Babylon and the Chaldeans. For language is indeed the Scripture's, so as to signify all the provinces of that land, concerning which the discourse is had: which some not understanding, draw down to the subversion of all lands.
