Because now they will say, 'There is no king for us, for we did not fear the Lord, and what will the king do to us?' Speaking words of useless vision, and you will strike a covenant, and judgment will germinate like bitterness over the furrows of the field. "LXX: "Therefore now they will say, there is no king for us, because we did not fear the Lord, but what will the king do to us? Speaking words, false excuses: he will arrange a testament, and judgment will arise like grass over the desert of the field. "After God breaks the idols of Israel, and depopulates their altars, or statues, and their extreme captivity comes, they will say, "There is no king for us." And lest they think that the sentence is prolonged for a long time, he added: "Now they will say," when they are devastated, when they will feel that Hosea is the last king taken from them: now the king is taken away from us, because we did not fear the Lord the true king: for what could a man do as king to benefit us?  Say what you wish, lament old mistakes, promise yourselves success, which will turn into the opposite, you will strike a treaty, not with God by any means, but with deception. And after the "treaty," which the Seventy have interpreted as "testament," bitterness will sprout for you, not a productive harvest of wheat, nor even food for livestock, barley, nor various legumes, nor vines which sweat forth their fruit in must, nor will trees bear fruit which changes the moisture of the earth into various flavors; but bitterness will arise for you, indeed a judgment of bitterness, or wild oats, which in Latin we translate as "grass." For there is a kind of herb like a reed, which sends its stem upwards and its root downwards through each joint, and again the very shoots and shrubs of another herb are nursery plants of it, and so in a short time, if it is not dug up by its lowest roots, it makes whole fields like brambles. Moreover, even if any dry part of it, provided it has a joint, falls on tilled ground, it fills it all with grass. We have said this according to the translators of the LXX, but in the Hebrew it is written as "Ros", which is turned into bitterness, that is, a judgment of bitterness, concerning which the Lord also speaks in the Gospel: "For judgment I am come into this world" (John IX, 39) : and of others it is written, "they shall receive greater damnation" (Mark XII). The students of opposing doctrines, when their lies are exposed and their altars and temples are destroyed, will say late: "We have no kings who had previously commanded us, under whose deceit we did not fear the Lord; for what gain is it for us to follow those, from whom we did not feel any help in necessity?" They will speak such words seeking some excuse, so that they may not seem to have erred through their own fault but through the worst teachings. Wherefore their seventy words they translated false excuses, which the prophet avoids by saying: "Let not my heart decline to words of malice," to excuse "excuses in sins" (Ps. 140: 4). We willingly applaud our faults, and having overcome pleasures, we shield ourselves behind the frailty of the flesh or the harsh demands of our ancestors: from whence the words and useless visions of heretics will be in vain. And they will strike a pact, not with God, but with bitterness, which when the day of judgment comes, will sprout over the furrows of their field, so that those who have sown in joy, will reap in tears: those who have laughed, will weep: those who had consolation, will mourn.
