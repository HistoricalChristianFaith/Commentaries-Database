Verse 20. "And approaching the pit, he called out to Daniel with a tear-choked voice and addressed him." By his tears he showed his inner emotion, and forgetting his royal dignity, the conqueror ran to his captive, the master to his servant.

"'O Daniel, servant of the living God...'" He calls Him the living God in order to distinguish Him from the gods of the Gentiles, who are but effigies of the dead.

"'Dost thou deem that thy God, whom thou ever servest, has been able to deliver thee from the lions?'" It was not that he had any doubts about the power of the God of whom he had previously affirmed, "Thy God, whom thou ever servest, will Himself deliver thee." But he phrased the sentence doubtfully in order that when Daniel made his appearance unharmed, the king's anger at the princes might seem the more justified, in proportion to the incredibility of the event.
