(Verse 7 onwards) I have also withheld rain from you, when there were still three months until the harvest. I caused it to rain on one city and not on another. One part was rained upon, while the part on which it did not rain became dry. So two or three cities went to another city to drink water, but were not satisfied. Yet you did not return to me, says the Lord. LXX: And I have withheld rain from you three months before the harvest. I have caused it to rain on one city and not on another city. Part of it will be irrigated, and part of it, upon which it does not rain, will dry up. And two or three cities will gather in one city, so that they may drink water and not be satisfied; and you have not returned to me, says the Lord. Not only have I caused astonishment of teeth in all your cities, and a scarcity of bread in all your places, but I have also prevented rain from you when there were still three months remaining until the harvest, which is called the late rain, and is especially necessary for the thirsty fields and Palestinian lands, so that when the grass swells in the harvest and the wheat bears fruit, it will wither due to excessive dryness. However, the significant time of spring at the end of the month of April, from which there are three months remaining until the harvest of wheat. May, June, July. For the harvest, seventy days, in their own way, were transferred to the vintage, which, if we accept it, is completely unusual and impossible next to all the regions of the East. For we have never seen rain at the end of June or in the month of July in these provinces, especially in Judea. Finally, in the Books of Kings, as a great sign and wonder, rain was brought about on the days of summer and harvest, when Samuel prayed (1 Samuel 12). And it was excessive to threaten now the dryness of the month of July, in which it had never given rain. It prevented rain, so that they would endure not only a shortage of bread, but also the heat of thirst and a scarcity of drinking. For in these places where we now live, besides small springs, all the water is in cisterns, and if divine wrath withholds rain, the danger of thirst is greater than that of hunger: which Scripture also mentions to have happened in the days of the prophet Elijah for three years and six months (3 Kings 17). And perhaps they might not think that this happened by the law of nature, and the course of the stars, and the variety of seasons, to rain on one city and its fields, and to suspend rain from another: so that two or three cities may go to another city and yet be not satisfied with the drinks of water. And when He has done these things, not for punishment but for healing, He rebukes those who persist in wickedness: and even so you have not returned to me, says the Lord. The Lord also forbids or restrains spiritual rains and all the riches of divine wisdom from the heretics; and He commands His clouds not to rain the showers of rain upon them before three months of harvest or vintage, so that they cannot come to the fruits of the mystery of the Trinity. And as this sun, which we see, completes its annual course until it returns to its original point, in twelve months, which consist of thirty days each; and the moon, which in Hebrew is called 'Jare', and in Greek 'μήνη', gave the name of months in both languages from its own name, and is illuminated by the sun's rays from that part which is near it, receiving more or less light according to the changing seasons: so also the Church, adorned by the splendor of the true Sun, completes the number of the twelve apostles. And so, the twelve tribes are called in Israel, and as a testimony of eternal memory, twelve stones are taken from the bed of the Jordan, to be placed in the location of the second circumcision (Joshua 4). But the Lord rains upon one city, the true Church of confession, and does not rain upon the other, which is in the assemblies of heretics. And while the former receives eternal rain, the latter is dried out by constant aridity: so that those who thirst, compelled by scarcity, may come to the city of the Lord, from which a most abundant fountain flows, irrigating the torrent of thorns. But this is the fountain which speaks through Jeremiah: They have abandoned me, the fountain of living water, and have dug for themselves broken cisterns that cannot hold water (Jeremiah 2:13). This fountain, flowing from one source, runs in threefold union: the fountains of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, which the psalmist yearns for in the manner of a thirsty deer, saying: As the deer longs for the streams of water, so my soul longs for you, O God (Psalm 42:1). And when two or three cities have journeyed to one city, in which there is an abundance of water, they will not be satisfied with hope, faith, and charity, because they have come not by choice, but by necessity, to seek divine grace.
