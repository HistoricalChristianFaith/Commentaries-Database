Our house, which was built to human stature, along with the habitation we shall have in heaven, will collapse if we are lazy and hesitant to do good works. And every floor that depends upon a rafter for support will crush its inhabitant when it falls to the ground. It is when the assistance of our hands and our strength is lacking that all the storm clouds and violent winds from above burst forth upon us. Moreover, because we translated this verse in the singular, it is better to understand it as pertaining to the church, all of whose sublimity will be ruined through the negligence of its leaders. And where the roof is thought to be strong, there will be found the enticements of wickedness.

"Through
slothfulness the ceiling sags, and through idleness of the hands the house leaks." Our
house, which is held up by the condition of mankind, even that abode that we
have in heaven, sags if we are lazy and slow to do good work. And every ceiling, which is supposed to hold
the roof up high, falls to the ground and crushes its inhabitants. And when the help of hands and virtues has
eventually gone numb a great storm of all tempests and rain clouds will fall
down upon us from above. More precisely,
although we have interpreted this with regard to one man, it can be better
understood with bearing to the Church, because its stature is brought down by
the neglect of its principate. There in
the Church we find the attractions of sins, where the roof is said to be
virtue.
