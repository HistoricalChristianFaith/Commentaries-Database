About to suffer for the whole world and to redeem all nations by his blood, Jesus tarries in Bethany at the home of obedience. It was once the house of Simon the leper—but he was no longer a leper. After he had been cured by the Savior he was still known by his original name, that the power of the healer might appear. In fact, one of the apostles listed with his original occupation and vice is Matthew the publican, though he certainly ceased to be a publican. There are those who want the house of Simon the leper to be known as that part of the people who believed in the Lord and were cured by him. Simon himself, moreover, is termed the obedient one. His name can be interpreted also as “the clean one” in whose house the church was healed.
