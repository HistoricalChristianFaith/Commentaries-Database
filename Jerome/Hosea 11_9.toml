In the same book, it is written, “I am God and not man, the holy one in the midst of thee, and I will not enter into the city,” into the den, to be sure, of vices. He himself is the only one who does not enter into the city that Cain built in the name of his son, Enoch. All of this is chanted daily by the lips of the priests: ho monos anamartētos, which in our language is translated as qui solus est sine peccato.
