(Vers. 8, 9.) And they had four wings, and their wings were joined one to another. They did not turn back when they walked, but each one moved forward before its face. The Gospels are joined to each other and cling together, and they fly to and fro throughout the whole world, running here and there, without end to their flight, never surpassing or receding, but always proceeding to further things. And both Paul and Virgil say: Forgetting the things that are past, and reaching forth towards those things that are still to come. We can say the same about the virtues of the soul, about the passage of time, and about the mingling of the elements, that, leaving behind the past, they always hurry back to the former things. And the fact that times slip away and flee is demonstrated in a short verse.

But meanwhile it flees, time flees irreparably. And in a lyric poem (Horace, Odes, 14).

Alas, alas, fleeting years slip away, Posthumus, Posthumus!
