(Verse 6) The sons of Ham: Cush, Egypt, Put, and Canaan. Cush, even to this day, is called Ethiopia by the Hebrews; Egypt is called Mizraim, and Put is called Libya. From Put, the river of Mauritania is called as such, and the entire region surrounding it is known as the Putian region. Many Greek and Latin writers attest to this. However, it is not the place or time to discuss why the ancient name of Libya has remained only in a certain part of the region, and the rest of the land is called Africa. Furthermore, Canaan obtained the land, which the Jews subsequently possessed, after driving out the Canaanites.
