The Lord said to my Lord:
The Savior has revealed the meaning of these words in the Gospel when He asked: 'If the Christ is the Son of David, how then does David in the Spirit call him Lord? (Mt. 22:43)' The Lord was interrogating the Pharisees because they were acknowledging Christ simply as the son of David. CHRYS Now if He be David's Lord, much more shall they not disdain Him.
