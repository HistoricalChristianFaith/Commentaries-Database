(Verse 20) The merchants of Dedan, dedicated to sitting on carpets. LXX: The merchants of Dadan, with chosen animals for chariots. The Hebrew and the Septuagint differ greatly in this place, except for the name of the region which is near Dedan and Dadan. There is indeed a great difference between sitting on carpets and riding in chariots with chosen animals, and there is no doubt that chariots and horses would be viewed negatively if they were earthly. Furthermore, both Elijah and Elisha are taken up to heaven in a chariot, and Elisha calls Elijah father, charioteer, and chariot of Israel (2 Kings 2:12). And Gehazi's eyes are opened to see the chariots on the mountain and the horses prepared for the Lord's session, without any riders (Ibid. 6). In the tapestries, the beauty of words is shown; in them, the merchants of Dedan ride and rest, having assembled for the market of Tyre.
