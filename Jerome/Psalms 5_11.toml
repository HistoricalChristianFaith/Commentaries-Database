Our beatitude is of the future, to which alone the promise refers. Let some rule with power; others possess wealth; still others receive honors and recognition. We, however, are miserable in this life in order to be happy in the next. Let us follow Christ our Lord. He who says he believes in Christ “ought himself also to walk, just as he walked.” Christ, the Son of God, “has not come to be served but to serve”;46 he did not come to command but to obey; he did not come to have his own feet washed but to wash the feet of his disciples; he did not come to strike others but to be struck; he did not give blows, but he received them; he did not crucify but was crucified; he did not destroy but himself suffered destruction; he was poor to make us rich; he was scourged for our sake, let us offer our cheek to the blows; let us lay bare our back to receive the stripes; let us imitate Christ. He who is struck with blows imitates Christ; he who strikes imitates the Antichrist.
