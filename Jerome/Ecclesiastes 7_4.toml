"Anger is better than laughter, for through a sad face the heart is
improved. "Laughter weakens the mind, anger reproves
and corrects it. Both let us become
angry with ourselves when we sin, and let us get angry with others. Through the sadness of the face, even the
spirit becomes better, as Symmachus saw it. 
And therefore "woe now to those who laugh, since they will
mourn." [Luc. 6, 25.]
