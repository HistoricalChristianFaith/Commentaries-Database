To-morrow in Scripture signifies time future, as Jacob in Genesis says, To-morrow shall my righteousness hear me. (Gen. 30:33.) And in the phantasm of Samuel the Pythoness says to Saul, To-morrow shalt thou be with me. (1 Sam. 28:19.) He yields therefore unto them that they should care for things present, though He forbids them to take thought for things to come. For sufficient for us is the thought of time present; let us leave to God the future which is uncertain. And this is that He says, The morrow shall he anxious for itself; that is, it shall bring its own anxiety with it. For sufficient for the day is the evil thereof. By evil He means here not that which is contrary to virtue, but toil, and affliction, and the hardships of life.

(Verse 34.) The malice of the day is enough for itself. Here, malice is not set against virtue, but rather labor, affliction, and the hardships of the world: just as Sara afflicted her servant Agar (Gen. 16), which is significantly expressed in Greek as ἐκάκωσεν αὐτὴν. Therefore, let us be content with the thoughts of the present time; let us leave the care of the future, which is uncertain.
