It follows, “Some of them that stood by,”; “some,” not all; whom I suppose to have been Roman soldiers, ignorant of Hebrew, but from the words "Eli, Eli,” thought that He called upon Elias. But if we prefer to suppose them Jews, they do it after their usual manner, that they may accuse the Lord of weakness in thus invoking Elias.
It was a mark of Divine power in Him thus to dismiss the Spirit as Himself had said, “No man can take my life from me, but I lay it down and take it again.”
