Whence also we say that the holy men are just and that they are made pleasing to God after their sins not only through their merits but through the mercy of him to whom every creature is subject and stands in need of his mercy. Let heretics hear, who are lifted up by pride and say, “We have taken unto us horns by our own strength.” Let them listen to what Moab heard said to him: “We have heard the pride of Moab, he is exceedingly proud. ‘His haughtiness and his arrogance and his pride and the loftiness of his heart I know,’ says the Lord, ‘because his strength is not according to the loftiness thereof.’ ”
