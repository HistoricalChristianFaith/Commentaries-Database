First it must be noted that Matthew’s Gospel uses the text of the Septuagint, not the Hebrew: “Jesus, hearing that John had been handed over, departed to Galilee. Leaving Nazareth, he came and lived in Capernaum, which is near the sea at the end of Zebulun and Naphtali. This was to fulfill what was said through the prophet Isaiah: ‘In the land of Zebulun and Naphtali, by the way of the sea across the Jordan in Galilee of the Gentiles, the people who sat in darkness have seen a great light; upon those who sat in the region of the shadow of death a light has dawned.’ From that moment, Jesus began to preach and to say, ‘The kingdom of heaven approaches.’ ” And the evangelist John reports that Jesus performed his first sign, changing water into wine, when he was invited to attend a wedding in Cana with his disciples: “Jesus performed the first of his signs in Cana of Galilee and revealed his glory, and his disciples believed in him.” Hence, the Septuagint reads, “Drink this first and do it quickly.” For the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali were the first to see the miracles of Christ, that they who first saw the Lord perform a sign would be the first to drink the potion of faith. According to the Hebrew, it is also said to be the first time that the [lifting of the] burden of sins was revealed, because the Savior first preached the gospel in the region of these two tribes.…But it calls this sea the lake of Gennesaret, which is formed from the influx of the Jordan. On its shore are situated Capernaum, Tiberias, Bethsaida and Chorazin, in whose regions the Lord spent a great deal of time. He did so to enable the people who sat or walked in darkness to see the light—not a little light as from other prophets but a great light, as from him who said in the Gospel, “I am the light of the world.” And upon those who lived in the region of the shadow of death, a light has dawned. This region lies between death and the shadow of death, I believe, because death belongs to those who directed themselves straight to the underworld with their dead works: “For the soul that sins will die.” But the shadow of death pertains to those who do not depart from life when they sin, for they are still able to do penance if they wish.

(Verse 18.) Behold, I and my children, whom the Lord has given me, are for signs and wonders in Israel, from the Lord of hosts, who dwells in Mount Zion. The Lord commanded me, saying, 'Bind up the testimony, seal the law among my disciples.'  For He has hidden His face from the house of Jacob; therefore, I will wait for Him, and I will hope in my Lord, and not only I, but also the children whom the Lord has given me, namely, other prophets and the sons of prophets, who are not born of the will of the flesh and blood, but of God (John 1:13). About whom the Apostle also spoke: My little children, for whom I am again in the pain of childbirth until Christ is formed in you (Gal. IV, 19). But these children, that is, the prophets, were given as signs and wonders to the people of Israel, according to what we read in Ezekiel: And Ezekiel will be a sign to you (Ezek. XXIV, 24). Also, in Zechariah, the holy men and disciples of the prophets are called observers of wonders, that is, of signs and wonders, because the prophets always preceded the signs of future events (Zech. III, 16). Meanwhile, according to the letter. However, the blessed Apostle in the Epistle, which is written to the Hebrews, teaches (although the Latin custom does not include it among the Canonical Scriptures) that this testimony should be understood as coming from the person of the Lord Savior. Therefore, he does not hesitate to call them brothers, saying: 'I will declare your name to my brothers, in the midst of the church I will praise you' (Hebrews 2:12); And again: 'I will put my trust in him' (Ibid., 13); and again: 'Here am I and the children God has given me.' Therefore, because the boys have shared in flesh and blood, and he himself has likewise become a partaker in the same sufferings (Isaiah 8:18). But how these boys have become a sign and wonder of the wisdom of the world and the pride of the Jews, the same Apostle teaches: who says that the Lord Savior has chosen foolish things and weak things of the world to confound the wise and the strong (1 Corinthians 1). Therefore, the Savior said to the Apostles: Unless you are converted and become like one of these boys, you will not enter the kingdom of heaven (Matthew 18:3). But the boy becomes a preacher of the new Gospel, he puts aside the old man, who is corrupted in the desires of seduction, and he puts on the new man, who is renewed in knowledge according to the image of the Creator. However, the Apostle writes that the Lord of hosts dwells on Mount Zion: 'You have come to Mount Zion and the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem' (Hebrews XII, 22). So I wonder that some of our people understand these two boys of Isaiah, whom he generated from the conception of the prophetess woman, namely Jasub and Emmanuel: the former of whom, in the abjection of the former people, the latter, in the assumption of the nations, has preceded. Whoever receives this, will consequently confirm that the prophet Hosea truly had a prostitute as his wife.
