(Verse 44.) Behold, everyone who speaks a commonly-known proverb, will apply it to you, saying: Like mother, like daughter. You are the daughter of your mother, who has cast away her husband and her sons, and the sister of your sisters, who have cast away their husbands and their sons. Seventy: These are all the things that they have spoken against you in a parable, saying: Like mother and daughter. You are the daughter of your mother, who has rejected her husband and her sons; and the sisters of your sisters, who have rejected their husbands and their sons. In the catalog of vices and corrections ((otherwise known as repentance)) in Jerusalem, by which one is drawn back to salvation, a well-known proverb in the common speech of the people is adapted, or as the Seventy translated it, a parable: Like mother, like daughter. The mother, however, is called Jerusalem, as is written above and in the following passages, and she is called Chethaea, which means raging or turning to madness: through her, the provocations of this world are shown, which lead the captive soul to destruction and separate her from her husband (no doubt, this is said by the word of God and his teaching). And the sister of their sisters, as we have read a little later, is called Sodom, and Samaria: one of which signifies the Gentile life and luxury, the other the deceitful followers of heretics. Moreover, what is read in the Septuagint, 'the sisters of your sisters, who rejected their husbands and their sons,' has no meaning. For what other sisters did Sodom and Samaria have, who are sisters to Jerusalem? And it must be asked, which husbands did Sodom and Samaria send away, and which sons did they reject? Unless, perchance, we are able to say this: that the feet of those who always wander are tossed about and there are no solid footsteps which are contrary to the truth; but they run hither and thither, and are carried about by every wind of doctrine, until they pass from falsehood to another falsehood (Ephesians IV). And when they realize that they have labored in vain at first, they proceed to second and third things.
