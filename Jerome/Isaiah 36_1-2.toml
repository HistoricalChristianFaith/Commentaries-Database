I read in the commentary of a certain man that it was the same Sennacherib who also captured Samaria, which is altogether false. For sacred history reports that Pul, under Menahem the king of Israel, was the first king of the Assyrians to have plundered the ten tribes. Second, Tiglath-pileser came to Samaria under Pekah the son of Remaliah. Shalmaneser was then the third to have taken all of Samaria. Fourth came Sargon, who fought against Ashdod, and the fifth was Essarhadon, who held the Samaritans captive in the land of Judea. Sennacherib was the sixth who, under Hezekiah king of Israel, laid siege to Jerusalem after he had captured Lachish and other cities of Judea. But others think that these many names apply to one and the same person.

But the Jews claim that the Rabshakeh, who spoke the Hebrew language, was the son of the prophet Isaiah and was himself a betrayer, and that another remaining son of Isaiah was called Jashub, who also spoke our tongue. Others, moreover, believe that he was a Samaritan and that this is why he knew the Hebrew language and why he blasphemed the Lord with such audacity and impiety. We should therefore regard the words of the Rabshakeh to be false, first of all this: “You trust in that broken staff of a reed, in Egypt.” For there is no history that sends Hezekiah to Egypt and makes Pharoah his assistant. But what he infers, “If you respond to me, ‘We trust in the Lord our God,’ ” is true. Yet again he joins this truth to a lie, saying that Hezekiah removed God’s high places and altars. For he did not do this against God but on behalf of God, so that with idolatry and the old error destroyed, he could command God to be worshiped in Jerusalem where his temple was located, although we observe the terrible custom of appointing people to sacrifice victims to God in the mountains and hills, where altars are already built. And wishing to demonstrate the paucity of hostages, the Rabshakeh promises two thousand horses, riders for whom Hezekiah is unable to produce. Thus it was not out of stupidity that he approached the Jewish people, who lacked a knowledge of horsemanship, but due to his observation of the commandments of God, who had enjoined through Moses on the king of Israel, “He will not multiply horses for himself, and he will not have many wives.” But, the Rabshakeh said, if you are unable to withstand me, a servant of Sennacherib—even the least of his servants—how will you withstand such great power of the king? But to the possibility of Hezekiah responding “We trust in the Lord our God” the Rabshakeh replies cleverly and with prudence that he had not come on his own initiative, but at the request of the Lord. “The Lord said to me, ‘Go up to that land and destroy it.’ ” This in short is his argument: Surely I would not have been able to come if it were not the will of the Lord. But since I came and captured many cities, with Jerusalem remaining intact, it is manifestly his will that I came.
