"There
is a futility that takes place on earth: sometimes there are righteous men who
are treated as if they had done according to the deeds of the wicked; and there
are wicked men who are treated as if they had done the deeds of the
righteous. I declared, this, too, is
vanity. "Amongst other vanities, which are borne in the world by
good and bad events, even this I have found to be vain, since those things
often happen to the righteous which ought to happen to the wicked, and the
wicked live happily in the world that you would think that they were the more
righteous! He gives the example in the
Gospel of the rich courtier and poor Lazarus. [Cfr. Luc. 16, 19-31.] The seventy-second Psalm also talks about the
matter of why bad things happen to good men and vice-versa. But where we read, 'there is a futility that
takes place on earth', Symmachus translates this fully, saying, "it is
difficult to understand what is done on earth". The Hebrews interpret the righteous who
suffer wickedness as the sons of Aaron, and Manasseh, because the former died
while sacrificing, and the latter was restored to power after much wickedness
and captivity.
