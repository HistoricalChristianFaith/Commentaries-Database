(Verse 27.) What I tell you in the dark, speak in the light; and what you hear whispered, proclaim on the housetops. What you have heard in secret, declare openly; what you have learned in private, speak publicly: what I have taught you in the small place of Judea, proclaim boldly in all cities and throughout the world.
