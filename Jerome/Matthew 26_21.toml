(Verse 21.) And while they were eating, he said: Amen I say to you: that one of you will betray me. He who had foretold of his passion also predicts the traitor, giving him an opportunity for repentance, so that when he understands his own thoughts and hidden plans, he may repent of his actions, and yet he does not specifically identify him, so that he may not be openly accused and become more shameless. He attributes the crime to a number, so that the guilty party may repent.
