(Verse 28 and following) And it shall come to pass afterward,    that I will pour out my Spirit on all flesh;your sons and your daughters shall prophesy,    your old men shall dream dreams,    and your young men shall see visions.Even on the male and female servants    in those days I will pour out my Spirit.And I will show wonders in the heavens and on the earth,    blood and fire and columns of smoke.The sun shall be turned to darkness,    and the moon to blood,    before the great and awesome day of the Lord comes. And it shall come to pass that everyone who calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved. Acts 2:17-19: 'And it shall come to pass in the last days, says God, that I will pour out my Spirit on all flesh; your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions; and also on My menservants and on My maidservants I will pour out My Spirit in those days; and I will show wonders in heaven above and signs in the earth beneath: blood and fire and vapor of smoke.' The sun will be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and illustrious day of the Lord comes. And it will be, that everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved. The blessed apostle Peter explained this passage fulfilled at the time of the Lord's passion, when the Holy Spirit descended on the believers on the day of Pentecost, and they spoke in tongues as the Spirit gave them utterance, so that those present marveled and said, 'Are not all these who are speaking Galileans? And how is it that we hear, each in our own native language?' Parthians, Medes, and Elamites, and others; some were saying, 'What does this mean?' But others were mocking and saying, 'They are filled with new wine.' Then Peter stood up with the eleven, raised his voice, and declared to them: 'Men of Judea and all who live in Jerusalem, let this be known to you, and listen carefully to my words. These people are not drunk, as you suppose, for it is only nine o'clock in the morning. No, this is what was spoken through the prophet Joel: ' And it shall come to pass afterward, says the Lord: I will pour out my Spirit on all flesh; your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your old men shall dream dreams, and your young men shall see visions. And also on the male and female servants in those days I will pour out my Spirit. And I will show wonders in the heavens and on the earth, blood and fire and columns of smoke. The sun shall be turned to darkness, and the moon to blood, before the great and awesome day of the Lord comes. And it shall come to pass that everyone who calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved. For in Mount Zion and in Jerusalem there shall be those who escape, as the Lord has said, and among the survivors shall be those whom the Lord calls. From the beginning, therefore, until the place where it is written: 'Great is the day of the Lord and very terrible, and who can endure it?' it is a threat and description of what the Lord will inflict upon the sinful people. But from the place where we read: 'Return to me with all your heart, with fasting, weeping, and mourning,' until the place where it says: 'Why do they say among the peoples, "Where is their God?"' it is the exhortation of the Lord, calling for repentance after punishment and affliction. Again, from that place which follows: The Lord was zealous for his land and spared his people, and the Lord answered and said, even to the place where it is written: And my people shall not be put to shame forever, the promise of things to come is that they should await the good after they have repented. And after many things which it is now tedious to recount, these things also are said in the promise, which we now endeavor to explain: I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh, and your sons and daughters shall prophesy, and the rest. I seem to myself to have saved the text of the conversation from the beginning up to this point. It is a great labor how what follows should be connected to what we are now discussing. Another [person] says what was generally promised in the last times is now partly completed. And because the apostles felt the reward of future [events] at the first coming of the Lord, they mentioned certain offerings and first fruits of miracles that had been fulfilled, so that until what is perfect comes, we would feel what had previously come in part. But another asserts that it is an apostolic tradition, according to what is written about a holy man: 'He will dispense his words in judgment' (Ps. CXI, 5): so that whatever useful things they saw to be for the listeners and not contradicting what is present, they would strengthen them with testimonies from another time, not that they would exploit the simplicity and ignorance of the listeners, as the impious Porphyrius calumniates, but according to the apostle Paul, they would preach at the right time, and at the wrong time (II Tim. IV). And the following is the rule of the prophets: whatever the Jews in the last times promise themselves carnally, they would say was fulfilled spiritually in the first coming of the Lord and Savior: especially since both they and we say that the promises were to be fulfilled in Christ, only differing in this, that they contend for future things, while we maintain that they have already happened: about which more should be discussed in what follows. But every flesh on which the Lord promises to pour out His Spirit, that is the flesh about which Isaiah speaks: And all flesh shall see the salvation of God (Isaiah 40:5). Therefore, the salvation of God cannot be seen unless the Holy Spirit is poured out. And whoever claims to believe in Christ, without believing in the Holy Spirit, will not have the eyes of perfect faith. Hence, in the Acts of the Apostles, those who had been baptized with the baptism of John, in the one who was to come, that is, in the name of the Lord Jesus, are re-baptized when they respond to Paul's question: 'But did you receive the Holy Spirit?' (Acts 19). Indeed, they receive true baptism, because without the Holy Spirit and the mystery of the Trinity, whatever is received into one or the other person is imperfect. But indeed, not everyone who receives the Holy Spirit will immediately have spiritual grace; but through the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, they will obtain different graces (I Cor. XII). Some will receive prophecy, like sons and daughters who are of greater merit; others will have dreams, like the elderly of advanced age; others will have visions, like the young who have conquered evil. However, servants and handmaids who still have the spirit of fear, and not of love, because perfect love casts out fear, will not have prophecy, dreams, or visions; but, content with the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, they will possess only the grace of faith and salvation. Then the Lord will give signs in the sky and on earth: in the sky, because the sun will turn into darkness, and the moon into blood; on earth, because the earth will shake so violently and unusually that tombs will be opened and rocks will be split. And what he says, blood and vapors, or the vapor of smoke, that blood is the one of which we read in the Psalms: That your foot may be dipped in blood (Psalm 47:24). And in Isaiah: How red are your garments (Isaiah 63:2)! And when, after striking the side of the Savior, the Roman soldier poured out mixed water (John 19). And the fire of the Holy Spirit, which descended from heaven, as we read in the Acts of the Apostles: Tongues as of fire appeared to them, and it sat on each one of them, and they were filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in different tongues, as the Holy Spirit gave them utterance (Acts 2:3-4). This is the fire that the Lord came to send upon the earth, and before he suffered, he desired it to burn in his disciples (Luke 12). Fire is of a double nature: it has light for those who believe; it has darkness and punishment for unbelievers, who are called the fumes of smoke. This smoke is very bitter, which blinded the eyes of the Jews, as we read in the proverbs: 'As smoke is harmful to the eyes, and an unripe grape to the teeth, so is wickedness to those who use it' (Prov. X, 26). Isaiah also speaks about this smoke in a great vision, in which the blindness of the Jews was foretold: 'And the threshold has moved, and the house is filled with smoke.' Then it follows: Go, and tell this people: You shall indeed hear, but not understand; and you shall indeed see, but not perceive. For the heart of this people has grown dull, and their ears are hard of hearing (Isaiah VI, 9, 10). The sun also turns into darkness when it does not dare to see its hanging Lord, and the moon into blood, which we may believe happened according to history and was passed over in silence by the evangelists. For not everything that Jesus did is recorded, and if every single thing were written, I do not think that even the world itself could contain the books that would be written (John XXI). Certainly, when the sun was obscured in darkness, it was not because it had turned to darkness itself, but because it had brought darkness upon the world: thus, the moon was not turned to blood, but it condemned the Jews covered in horror of blasphemies and denial of Christ with the eternal testimony of its blood, saying: 'His blood be upon us, and upon our children' (Matthew 27:25). These are all things that are described as future before the great and terrible day of the Lord comes. But this day of the Lord is to be believed as either great and terrible of the resurrection, or certainly, after a long time, a day of judgment, which is truly great and terrible. But since it follows: And it shall be, everyone who shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved, and the apostle Paul refers this to the time of the Lord's passion, it is more to be understood of the day of resurrection. For he says in writing to the Romans: There is no distinction between Jew and Greek. For the same Lord is rich unto all that call upon him. For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved. But how shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? Or how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? And how shall they hear without a preacher? And how shall they preach, except they be sent? (Rom. 10:12-15) And when it is said, Whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved, let us not lightly esteem it, for although the same apostle writes: No man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost. (1 Cor. 12:3) Yet we must understand that to say this is not a matter of mere words, but of heartfelt faith. For everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved. So Paul and Sosthenes write to the Church of God which is in Corinth: Sanctified in Christ Jesus, called saints, together with all those who call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ (I Cor. 1): according to what we read in the Psalms: Moses and Aaron among his priests, and Samuel among those who call upon his name. They called upon the Lord, and he answered them; he spoke to them in the pillar of cloud (Ps. 99:9). So if it is written about the believing Corinthians, and about Moses and Aaron and Samuel, that they invoked the name of the Lord, let us believe that this grace is not for beginners but for those who have reached perfection. The word 'effusion', which is said in Hebrew Esphoch (), and which all have translated similarly, shows the abundance of the gift, that it has not descended upon a few Prophets (as it once did in the Old Testament), but upon all who believe in the name of the Savior, the gifts of the Holy Spirit: not just on this one or that one, but on all flesh. For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek, slave and free, male and female; for we are all one in Christ. (Romans 10). Therefore, Agabus prophesied in Caesarea (Acts 21), and there were many prophets in Antioch. The Apostle commands that if one person is prophesying and another has a revelation, the first should keep silent. (1 Corinthians 14). We also read that the four daughters of Philip the evangelist prophesied. (Acts 21). Even the old men saw visions, as when Paul, an old man, heard a man from Macedonia saying to him: 'Come over to Macedonia and help us.' (Acts 16:9). And all the young men who stood forth strong in Christ, and fought the Lord's battles, saw visions, with the Lord fulfilling his promises: I multiply visions, and I am likened to the hands of the prophets (Hosea 10:12).
