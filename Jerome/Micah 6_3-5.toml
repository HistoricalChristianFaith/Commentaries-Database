(Verse 3 onwards) O my people, what have I done to you, and how have I wearied you? Answer me! For I brought you up from the land of Egypt, and redeemed you from the house of slavery; and I sent before you Moses, Aaron, and Miriam. O my people, remember, I pray, what Balak king of Moab devised, and what Balaam the son of Beor answered him, from Shittim to Gilgal, that you may know the saving acts of the Lord. LXX: My people, what have I done to you, or how have I troubled you? Answer me: for I brought you out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed you from the house of bondage, and sent before you Moses, and Aaron, and Miriam. My people, remember what Balak, king of Moab, devised against you, and what Balaam, the son of Beor, answered him from Seir unto Gilgal; that the righteousness of the Lord might be known. Symmachus interpreted 'justitiis' or 'justitia' as 'misericordias', and where LXX Shanis; all translated it as Settim. It is the place where Balak, the king of the Moabites, gathered an army against Israel, like the trees that still grow through the desert of Mount Sinai. For in the LXX, whether it be the Ark of the Covenant, or the altar and tabernacle, and other things made of imperishable wood, they are called Settim in Hebrew, which resemble a tree that we commonly call the White Thorn. Therefore, I believe that both LXX σχίνον and σχοῖνοι have been interpreted as lentisk; but gradually, due to a mistake made by copyists, σχοῖνοι, meaning ropes, were read instead of σχίνοις, meaning lentisks. Therefore, God speaks to the people of Israel and challenges them to a judgment, granting them permission to argue against Him. My people, what have I done to you that I should not have done? Or how have I wearied you? Although this is not found in Hebrew. But the father is saddened by his son being flogged, and he visits the sins of the sheep with the shepherd's rod. How have I been troublesome to you? Or, as it is more significantly written in Hebrew, how have I burdened you with my labor? Will you interpret my favors as an insult, and while desiring Egyptian melons and meats, will you grieve being brought out of the land of Egypt, and being freed from the house of slavery with my help, because I have given you Moses as your leader, my friend, and Aaron as your priest, and Miriam as your prophetess? But if this seems insignificant to you, remember that at that time, when Balak, the king of Moab, hired Balaam, a diviner, to curse you and how, against his own will, Balaam, desiring to curse you, blessed you instead (Numbers 22): from Shittim to Gilgal, surveying the entire army of Israel with his eyes and changing places, as if I could not continue going with you and passing over with you. And I did this so that my mercy and justice would be known to you, who love you so much, that even though I curse the blasphemers every day with my mouth, I have not allowed myself to curse you as an enemy. The Hebrews interpret this passage, where it is said, 'from Sethim to Galgal, that you may know the justices of the Lord' (Numbers 25), in this way: from the time you committed fornication in Madian, until the time when Saul was anointed king in Galgal (1 Samuel 10), recall the memory of the evils you have done, and how much good I have done for you, and you will know my mercy towards you. This is how God spoke to carnal Israel according to history. But we, who desire to contemplate the glory of the Lord with an unveiled face, truly have the father Abraham, let us hear when we have sinned against disputing God, and let us be accused by the magnitude of his benefits. For we have served Pharaoh and the Egyptian people, and we have made mud and bricks. And he redeemed us who gave himself as redemption for all, so that we may declare those who were redeemed by the Lord, whom he redeemed from the hand of enemies, and whom he gathered from the regions, for his mercy endures forever. He also sent before our face Moses, the spiritual law, and Aaron, the great high priest, not having a typological Ephod, but carrying the truth, and having on his forehead the seal of holiness that God the Father has signed. And he sent Mary, the prophetess, and she not only accomplished this for us, but also delivered us from the hands of our enemies. For let us remember what he had intended against us, who wanted to devour and to ridicule our congregation, the true devil Balak. For Balak signifies 'the emptying out,' that is, 'depriver,' the king of the paternal water: indeed, according to another etymology, Moab is said to mean paternal water. Therefore, when Balak plotted against us, and he plotted against us through his empty people, which is interpreted as Balaam, God did not allow us to fall under his curses; but on the contrary, He blessed us, compelled by the truth of the matter, the empty people of the nations, born of the one who is in the skin: for Beor signifies 'in the skin,' always devoted to flesh and works of death. And the empty people responded for us, sprung from the one who is entirely in the skin, always changing places, or standing upon thorns, or upon ropes, so that we may also follow the error of the Vulgate edition. But according to the saying of the Savior, the cares of this world, and riches, and pleasures are in which the people are vain. (Matthew 13, Mark 5). But what stands in the ropes, namely in the chains of sins (for each one is bound by the ropes of their own sins (Proverbs 5)), and Isaiah is a witness, saying: Woe to those who draw out their sins like a long rope, and like the strap of a young heifer, their iniquities (Isaiah 5, 18). Therefore, if it stands, it only stands among thorns and ropes; if, however, it wishes to walk around, it does not have a stable step, but is always wavering and unstable, and it reaches even to Gilgal, which means rolling, that is, volatility or instability. If ever we see some rise up against us, and they thirst for our blood with eager jaws, and by the unexpected providence of God, they become for us, who they came against, let us say, 'Balaam came from ropes to Gilgal,' so that the justice of God may be known.
