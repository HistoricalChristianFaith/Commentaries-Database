(Verse 20) Why do you bring me frankincense from Sheba, and the sweet cane from a distant land? Your burnt offerings are not accepted, and your sacrifices do not please me. That frankincense from Sheba should come is beyond doubt, as Virgil also says: And a hundred altars glow with Sabean incense (Aeneid, Book I). The cane, which is called "Cane" in Hebrew, is translated as "cinnamon" by the Septuagint and Theodotion and the prophetic speech testifies that it comes from a distant land, so that we understand it to be India, from which many spices come by way of the Red Sea. This type of medicinal pigment is called κασία. And the meaning is this: In vain do you mix sweet-smelling pigments in making ointments, as the Law commands, and burn sacrifices, who do not do my will in the Law, as it is written: They have not heard my words, and have cast away my law. But this properly applies to those who offer sacrifices from the spoils and plundering of the poor, and think they can redeem their sins with unjust alms, as the Scripture says: The ransom of a man's soul are his own riches (Prov. 13:8), which are gathered not from injustice, but from labor and righteousness.
