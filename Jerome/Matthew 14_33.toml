(Verse 33.) But those who were in the boat came and worshiped Him, saying, "Truly You are the Son of God." At the one sign of calm being restored to the sea, which sometimes happens after great storms by chance, sailors and passengers truly confess the Son of God, and Arius preaches a created being in the Church.
