"Because
a sinner does what is wrong an hundred times and He is patient with him, yet
nevertheless I am aware that it will be well with those who fear God that they
may fear Him. "Because a sinner has done many wicked deeds,
this is what is meant by, 'an hundred times': God gives a time for repentance,
and does not punish him immediately for his crime, but he waits so that he is
converted by his wickedness. I
understand how good-willing and forgiving God will be to those who fear Him and
tremble at His word. Symmachus
translated this passage as, "For a sinner dies wicked, long-life is
granted him". More precisely I know
that it will be well for those who fear God, who fear His face, but it will not
be well for the wicked, and he will not live long, for he does not fear
God. And because what Symmachus
translated is clear, we can say that the Hebrew word "maath "is what the Septuagint has translated as 'from then on',
which we have here as 'an hundred times'. 
Aquila, Symmachus, and Theodotion have interpreted 'he has died' as
"he has sinned and done evil, and is dead", because for that which he
sinned, he immediately dies. But
according to the interpretation of the Septuagint, instead of 'he is dead' we
read 'from then on', and according to that interpretation, the meaning is, 'a
sinner does not sin at first when he seems to sin, but already even before he
has sinned': "Sinners are estranged from the womb, they have erred since
they were in the stomach" [Ps. 57, 4.]. And they ask this that follows- "they
have spoken falsity", just as he explains for a simple understanding,
there seems to be no reason that child sinners speak lies as soon as they come
out of the womb.
