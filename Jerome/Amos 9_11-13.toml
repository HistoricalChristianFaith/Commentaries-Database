(Vers. 11 seqq.) In that day I will raise up the fallen tent of David, and rebuild its broken walls, and restore what has collapsed, and rebuild it as it was in ancient times, that they may possess the remnant of Edom and all the nations who are called by my name, declares the Lord who is doing these things. LXX: In that day I will raise up the fallen tent of David, and rebuild its broken parts, and raise up what has been buried, and restore it as in the ancient days, that they may seek me, the remnant of humanity, and all the nations over whom my name has been called, declares the Lord who is doing all these things. Where the authority of the apostles prevails, especially that of Peter and James, whom the vessel of election calls the pillars of the Church (Galatians 2), there all suspicion of various explanations is to be removed, and what is expounded by such great men is to be followed. In the book of Acts, a question arose among the apostles as to why Paul and Barnabas had received men from the Gentiles without circumcision and observance of the Sabbath. Peter answered, as he should: and James, approving his opinion, spoke these words: Men, brothers, listen to me: Simon has related how God first visited the Gentiles to take from them a people for his name, and the words of the prophets agree with this, as it is written: After this, I will return and rebuild the fallen tent of David. I will rebuild its ruins and set it up again, so that the rest of mankind may seek the Lord, even all the Gentiles who are called by my name, says the Lord, who does these things, known from of old (Acts 15:13 and following). Therefore this tabernacle of David, which had fallen (had fallen, however, among those who say, it will not come near, and no evil will come upon us: those whom the Lord had shaken and tested with His sieve, and whose threshing floor of His majesty He had purged with His winnowing fan, and all sinners He had killed with the sword), now according to the custom of the Scriptures, after tortures, after punishments, promising prosperity and joy, declares that He will raise it up, and in the resurrection of the Lord restore all things, so that what had fallen in the synagogues may rise in the Churches, and believers may possess the remnants of Edom, and all nations, so that whatever remains of the bloody and earthly kingdom may be transformed into heavenly kingdoms, and all peoples who have forgotten the Lord may be converted and return to Him. But if we want to read according to the LXX, those who are left of mankind, and all the nations upon whom my name has been invoked, we should accept as those who have believed from the Jewish people, and as those who have not fallen like a small stone from the sieve, nor have been thrown out with the dust and chaff. For the remnants will be saved at the beginning of faith, and at the end of the world, so that when the fullness of the Gentiles comes in, then all Israel will be saved (Romans 11). But the name of the Lord which is invoked above the rest and above all nations, that is what the Savior says: Father, I have revealed your name to men (John 17:6). And so that I do not delay the rule of covenants with a long discourse, and in this prophet, and in the other things whatsoever are preached about the building of Jerusalem (the walls of Jerusalem) and the temple, and the blessedness of all things, the Jews in the last time promise themselves in vain expectation, and they mention things to be fulfilled carnally. But we who do not follow the letter that kills, but the life-giving Spirit, now in the Church we are convinced of fulfillment, and every day it is fulfilled in individuals who, falling through sin, are rebuilt through repentance.
