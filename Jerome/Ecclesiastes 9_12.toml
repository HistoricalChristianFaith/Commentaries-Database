" For man does not even know his
time, like fish caught in a fatal net, like birds seized in a snare, so are men
caught in the moment of disaster when it falls upon them suddenly. "I have already said above, that while men are yet
unknowing, either disaster or death befalls them. More precisely we should look at this as
allegory, that the realm of the sky is similar to a net cast into the sea; and
on the other hand heretics have nets, in which they capture fish, leading to
their death. Their net though is affable
language, flattering speeches, feigned or forced fasting, poor clothes, and an
imitation of virtues. And if they begin
to argue about the divine and raise their face to the heavens to seek the
heights of God, then they cast a noose into the heavenly abodes. So just as fish and birds are seized of a
sudden by such a net, and by such a noose, so wickedness is increased many
times and the kindness of many fails; and the signs and portents are seen in
such a way as to entice even the chosen of God if possible. See too those men of the Church, who are
called the children of men, and are of modest faith, and who can be overcome
quickly. Note too, that the term "sons of men" is used throughout the whole
book, and the Hebrew has "sons of man",
this is 'the sons of Adam'. And almost
all scripture is filled with this idiom that sees the sons of Adam as the sons
of all men.
