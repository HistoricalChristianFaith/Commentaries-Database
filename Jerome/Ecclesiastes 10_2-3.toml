"A wise
man's mind tends to his right; while a fool's mind tends to his left. Even on the road as the fool walks, he lacks
sense, and proclaims to all that he is a fool. 
"And in the
Gospel it is taught that a wise man's left does not know what his right is
doing. And when we are hit on the right
side of the face, we do not show the left cheek to he who hit us, but the other
one. For a wise man does not have a left
side in him, but is in fact completely the right side. And when the Saviour comes to judge us, the
lambs will stand on the right, and the goats on the left. It is written in the prophets that "the
Lord knows the ways to the right, which are wrong, and actually lead to the
left." [Prov. 4, 27.]. Therefore he who is wise always thinks about
the future, because it leads him to the right. 
But he who is foolish always thinks of the present, because it is set in
the left. What follows has also been
said by the philosopher poet, who says, "the right leads to the walls of
the lower world, this is our path to Elysium, but the left is for the
wicked. That gives out punishments and
sends people down to the nether regions" [Virg. Aen. 6, 541/543.]. Firmianus of our time in the famous work of
his Institute recalls the passage about left and right, and argues that this is
about virtues and about vices. [Lactant. Divin. Instit. VI, 3,6-CSEL 19, p.486, 166sqq.] And we shouldn't think that this is contrary
to that passage, which says, "do not go to the right, nor to the
left" [Prov. 4, 27.]. In the first passage the right is taken to
mean good; but in the second it is not just right but also the decline to the
right. We should not know more than we
need to know, since virtues are in the middle and all excess in a vice. In the following verse though he says,
"but on the path that the fool walks, his heart is in need", and he
says: "all is foolishness" or "all are fools". This is the meaning: A fool hopes that all
others sin as he himself sins, and judges all others by his own standards. Then Symmachus has interpreted it in this
way: but when the fool walks along the road, he supposes that all are stupid as
he is. But the Septuagint has another
meaning, which says, 'all things which he thinks are foolish, are the most
vain'.
