Let him be understood now not as the Word of God and wisdom but as servant and boy.… And here there will be the greater miracle that his appearance will be inglorious among people, not in that it means a foulness of form but that he came in lowliness and poverty.… “He will wash many nations,” cleansing them with his blood and consecrating for service in the baptism of God.…He did not have beauty or glory. His form was base and lacking before [humanity], or as the Hebrew has it, despised and least among people.… How then can it be said in the psalms, “Gird your side with your sword, O most powerful, with your beauty and fairness”? This puzzle can be easily solved. He was despised and base when he hung on the cross and was made for us a curse and carried out sins and said to the Father, “God, my God, why have you forsaken me?” But he was glorious and fair in appearance when, at his passion, the earth trembled, rocks were split and the elements were terrified at the sun’s fleeing and the eternal night.
