(Verse 36.) Now the Midianites sold Joseph in Egypt to Potiphar, an eunuch of Pharaoh and the chief of the royal executioners. In many places the Scriptures mention the chief of the executioners as the chief of the cooks, for μαγειρεύειν in Greek means to cook. Therefore, Joseph was sold to the chief of the army and the warriors, not to Potiphar, as it is written in Latin, but to Potiphar the eunuch. The question arises, how he is later said to have a wife. The Hebrews report that Joseph was bought by this person because of his excessive beauty for a disgraceful service, and after the Lord's men were dried up, he was later chosen according to the custom of the Hierophants as the high priest of Heliopolis; and his daughter was Aseneth, whom Joseph later took as his wife.
