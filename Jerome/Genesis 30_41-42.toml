(Ver. 41 and 42.) And the flocks conceived against the rods that Jacob had set before the flocks in the gutters, so that they conceived by the rods; but the sheep that were weak, he did not put the rods. And Laban's flocks were weak, but Jacob's were strong and healthy. This is not found in the Septuagint Interpreters, but instead of the weak and healthy ones, they translated something else, I don't know what, which does not make sense. But what the Scripture says is this: Jacob, wise and clever, observed justice and fairness even in a new way. For if all the ewes and goats were producing various offspring, there would be some suspicion of deceit, and openly Laban, envying this situation, would oppose it. Therefore, he managed everything in such a way that he himself would benefit from the result of his labor, and Laban would not be completely deprived. If ever the sheep and goats were bred in the early season, because the spring offspring is better, he would place rods in front of them so that diverse offspring would be born. But whatever sheep and goats were bred late and were seeking a male, he would not place objects in front of their eyes so that animals of a single color would be born. And whatever was first born belonged to him, because it was different and varied: whatever came after, belonged to Laban: for from one colored cattle, both black and white, were born. But in the place where it is written, that they conceive in rods: in Hebrew it has Jeamena (). I cannot express the force of the Hebrew word without going around it. Jeamena properly means the extreme heat in sexual intercourse, by which the whole body trembles, and is near the end of pleasurable satisfaction.
