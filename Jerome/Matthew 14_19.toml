They are ordered to sit down on the grass and, according to another Evangelist, to recline in groups of hundreds and of fifties. In this way from the repentance of the fifty, they ascended toward the perfect summit of one hundred.17He looked up to heaven that he might teach them to keep their eyes focused there. He then took in hand five loaves of bread and two fish; he broke the loaves and gave the food to the disciples. By the breaking of the bread, he makes it into a seedbed of foodâ€”for if the bread had been left intact and not pulled apart and broken into pieces, they would have been unable to feed the great crowds of men, women and children. The law with the prophets are therefore pulled apart and broken into pieces. Mysteries are made manifest, so that what did not feed the multitude of people in its original whole and unbroken state now feeds them in its divided state.

(Verse 19.) And when he had commanded the multitude to recline upon the hay. The sense is clearly evident according to the letter: let us reveal the sacraments of spiritual interpretation. They are commanded to recline upon the hay, and according to another Evangelist (Luke 9), upon the ground, by fifties or hundreds, so that after they have trampled upon their flesh and all its desires, and subjected all the pleasures of this world to themselves like dry hay, then by the number fifty they may ascend through penitence to the summit of perfection represented by the number one hundred.



Taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven, he blessed and broke the loaves and gave them to the disciples. He looked up to heaven, teaching that our eyes should be directed there. He took the five loaves and the two fish in his hands, and he broke them and gave them to the disciples. With the Lord breaking them, the food became a source of abundance. For if they had remained whole and not been torn into fragments, nor divided into a plentiful harvest, they would not have been able to feed such a great multitude of crowds, children, and women. Therefore, the law is broken with the prophets, and it is torn into pieces and its mysteries are brought forth in the midst, so that what was whole and permanent in its original state may be divided into parts and nourish the multitude of nations.
