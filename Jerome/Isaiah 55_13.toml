Thus when it is said in the Gospel, “A good tree cannot bring forth bad fruit,” in no way does this refer to the property of nature, as the heretics maintain, but to the will of the mind.… From this it is clear that each by his own will can make his soul a good or bad tree, which produced different fruit.
