(Verse 38) . Behold, the days are coming, says the Lord, when the city will be rebuilt for the Lord, from the tower of Ananeel (also known as Anamehel) to the corner gate. And the measuring line will extend beyond it, to the hill of Gareb, and will encompass Goatha (or according to the Septuagint, with chosen stones). And the entire valley of ruins (for which Theodotius placed the Hebrew word Phagarim, and ashes, and all Asaremoth, which we better read as Asademoth, for which Aquila interpreted as suburban) will extend to the Kidron Valley, to the corner of the Eastern Horse Gate. The holy place of the Lord will not be rooted up or destroyed forever. Those who receive the kingdom of Christ in the land of Judea, namely the Jews and our Judaizers, try to show the tower of Ananeel and the gate of the corner, and the hill of Gareb, and Goatha, and the valley of Phagarim, and all Asademoth, and the Cedron torrent, and the place of the corner gate of the east horses: and there they say that the sanctuary of the Lord, that is, the temple, is to be built, and will remain forever. Because they cannot show this accomplishment after the captivity during the times of Zorobabel and Ezra, they move on to the times of Christ, whom they say will come at the end of the world, so that he may descend upon Jerusalem adorned with gold and jewels, according to the Book of Revelation, and be built around this land, that is, from that place to this place, in a circuit (Rev. 21). And they take this ring of theirs, because it is situated by the tower of Anathoth, which is now called Jeremiah, three miles separated from Jerusalem, all the way to the Brook of Kidron, which is written in the Gospel (John 18), and is in the valley of Jehoshaphat, where there was a garden, in which Judas the betrayer handed over the Savior, the foundations of the city are laid. We are about to read, they say, that Anameel, the cousin of Sallum, was the son of Jeremiah, who bought the field, and this is the tower of Ananeel, ignorant of the Hebrew truth. For here it is written according to the Hebrew text, from the tower of Ananeel (which means 'grace of God') through Nun, namely the middle letter. There it says: 'Behold, Anameel (which means 'grace of God') the son of Sallum, your cousin, will come to you, through the middle letter Mem.' Therefore, invoking the Lord and Savior, who has the key of David, who opens and no one can shut, who shuts and no one can open; who also opened the sealed book of Isaiah and all the prophets (Isaiah 22); and the twenty-four elders who held harps worshiped (Revelation 3), indicating that only He can reveal the divine mysteries, let us approach the building of the city to which the prophetic word is directed: 'Glorious things are said of you, O city of God' (Psalm 87:3); and 'The streams of the river make glad the city of God' (Psalm 46:4). So the Church is built from the tower of obedience, or grace, and the gifts of God (for this is what Ananeel interprets), up to the gate of the corner, which may seem to have a lofty beginning, as long as we continue in this flesh, we cannot possess the straight line of truth: but we stand in the corner and with broken lines, and go out beyond the measuring line against it, that is, the gate of the corner, over the hill Gareb, which in our language is translated either as sojourning or scabies, to teach us to be strangers and foreigners, and not to easily consent to itching ears and the novelty of the worst dogmas. And Goatha will go around, he says, for which they were interpreted as seventy by a circuit, with chosen stones that roll upon the face of the earth, and are bound with a corner stone, as the apostle Peter says: And you yourselves are built up as living stones into a spiritual house, a holy priesthood, offering spiritual sacrifices and acceptable to God through Jesus Christ (1 Peter 2:5). And she will go around, he says, all the valley of Phagarim, which is interpreted as ruins; and ashes, understood, so that although we may seem to be without inhabitants: nevertheless, let us always fear ruins and consider ashes; and in repentance let us say with David: For I have eaten ashes as bread, and mixed my drink with weeping (Psalm 102:10). And it is said to those who lie down: Does one not rise again who falls? says the Lord (Jeremiah VIII, 4). And he says that the whole place, which we translate as the region of death, is divided into two words; Sade (), which means region, and Moth (), which translates as death: for which Aquila translates as suburbs, or fields, and rural areas. The region of death is the region of sins; and the suburbs are the region of pleasures, which goes up to the Brook Kidron, where the Lord was handed over, who is interpreted as darkness (John XVIII). See how many places the Church has, and how that Apostolic saying is fulfilled: That it may be without stain or wrinkle (Ephes. V, 27), and be preserved in the future and in the heavenly realms. You hear of corners, you hear of decay, you hear of ruins and ashes, and the region of death, and darkness, and you boast of your power and sinlessness. Finally, it follows: even up to the corner of the gate. And this corner, so that no true justice, no certain victory, may be shown in this world. Even though it is the eastern corner of the gate from which the light comes out, it is nevertheless called the horses: to teach us that we need to run and compete, and finally deserve to hear with the Lord: You have ascended on high, you have led captivity captive: you have received gifts for men; yea, for the rebellious also, that the LORD God might dwell among them (Psalm 68:18). In the Eastern gate, in the gate of the chariots, is the sanctification of the Lord. And then we may consider ourselves perfect, when we say to the Lord: The chariot of God is ten thousand times ten thousand: the Lord is among them, as in Sinai in the holy place (Psalm 68:17). Such a building, which is built upon the foundation of Christ, of which the Apostle speaks: 'As a wise architect, I have laid the foundation' (I Cor. III, 10), will never be destroyed, but will remain forever. The obscure and difficult matters must be discussed in more detail, so that we may quickly go through the obvious ones.
