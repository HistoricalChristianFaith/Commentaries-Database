(Verses 4, 5.) This is what the Lord of hosts says. Yet old men and old women will dwell in the streets of Jerusalem, each with staff in hand because of their many days. And the streets of the city will be filled with boys and girls playing in its streets. LXX: This is what the Lord Almighty says: Yet old men and old women will sit in the streets of Jerusalem, each with staff in hand because of their many days. And the streets of the city will be filled with boys and girls playing in its streets. So great, he says, will be the prosperity of all things and the peace and tranquility of war, with no enemy remaining, that old age in both sexes will reach the very last age, and trembling limbs will be supported by a ruling staff. The streets of the city will also be filled with playing boys and girls. However, this usually happens when there is security and deep peace in the cities, so that the joy of the cities may celebrate with games and dances the playful age. But if we refer to the Church, of which it is said: Glorious things have been spoken of you, O city of God (Psalm 87:3), and: The streams of the river make glad the city of God, the holy dwelling place of the Most High. God is in the midst of her, she shall not be moved (Psalm 46:4-5), who can doubt that the streets of the Church are the virtues, in which wisdom acts confidently and is proclaimed on the heights of the walls? Therefore, the Psalmist cries out to the Lord: I hold your commandments in high esteem (Psalm 119:96). In the streets, seeking the Lord and Savior, the bride speaks in the Song of Songs: I will arise and go about the city in the streets and in its squares, until I find him whom my soul loves (Song of Songs 3:2). Therefore, the elderly men and women will dwell or sit, of whom it is written (if anyone is willing to receive the book): Honorable old age, not measured by time or numbered by years (Wisdom 4:8). But dogs are the wisdom of men, and old age is a blameless life: of which the Lord also speaks to Moses: Gather with you seventy elders, whom you know to be elders (Num. XI, 16); wherefore before Abraham no one was called old, of whom we read: Abraham died being old: nourished in good old age, old and full of days (Gen. XXV, 8). For the glory of old men is gray hair, of whom it is said: The gray hair of a man is his wisdom (Wis. IV, 8). They will hold rods and staffs in their hands because of the multitude of days, and they will say to the disciples: What do you want? Shall I come to you with a rod, or in the spirit of gentleness and meekness (1 Corinthians 4:21)? For he who speaks wisdom from his lips, the rod strikes the foolish man. And on the contrary: He who spares his rod hates his son, but he who diligently corrects him loves him (Proverbs 13:24). And not only old men, but old women will also sit in the streets of Jerusalem, which Paul describes with apostolic words: Honor, he says. See widows who are truly widows. And in another place: Let a widow be chosen not less than sixty years old, who was the wife of one husband, having testimony in good works: if she has brought up children, if she has received strangers, if she has washed the feet of the saints, if she has relieved the afflicted, if she has diligently followed every good work (I Tim. V, 3, 9, 10). Such old men and old women will sit in the streets of Jerusalem, and they will hold staffs in their hands, and the streets of the city will be filled with playing boys and girls. These are the boys and girls, the old and young, whom the Psalmist exhorts to sing to the Lord, saying: Young men and maidens, old men and children, praise the name of the Lord (Ps. CXLVII, 12). And John the Evangelist and Apostle says: I write to you, young men, because your sins are forgiven you for the sake of the Savior's name: I write to you, fathers, because you have known him who is from the beginning (I John II, 12, 13). And of these things Solomon speaks in Proverbs: And He shall give subtlety to the innocent, and understanding to the young man. And again: Hear, O sons, the discipline of a father, and attend that you may know understanding (Prov. 1:4, 8). Concerning these boys, young men and girls, the forty-fourth psalm says, After her shall virgins be brought to the king. According to what is written: The daughters of Judah rejoiced and were glad because of your judgments. Lord (Ps. XCVI, 8). When they have heard from the Apostle: Rejoice, again I say rejoice (Philip. IV, 4), they will indicate the joy of the mind with a gesture of the body, and with a leaping dance, they will say with David: I will leap and dance in the sight of the Lord (II Sam. VI, 22).
