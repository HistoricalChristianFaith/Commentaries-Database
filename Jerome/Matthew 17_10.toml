Unless we know the reasons why the disciples asked about the name of Elijah, their questioning seems foolish and extraordinary. For what does asking about Elijah’s arrival have to do with what was written above? The Pharisees’ tradition, following the prophet Malachi of the twelve minor prophets, is that Elijah comes before the end. He turns the hearts of the fathers to their children and the hearts of children to their fathers and restores everything to its ancient state. So the disciples think that the transfiguration of glory is the one that they have seen on the mountain and say, “If you now have come in glory, why does your precursor not appear?” especially since they had seen Elijah disappear. But when they say, “The scribes say that Elijah must first come,” by the word first they are saying that unless Elijah comes, it is not the advent of the Savior according to the Scriptures. firstthey are saying that unless Elijah comes, it is not the advent of the Savior according to the Scriptures.

(Verse 10.) And the disciples asked him, saying, Why then do the scribes say that Elijah must come first? Unless we know the reasons why the disciples asked about the name of Elijah, their questioning seems foolish and extraordinary. For what does it matter to inquire about the coming of Elijah, which is written above? The tradition of the Pharisees is, according to the prophet Malachi (who is the last of the twelve), that Elijah will come before the coming of the Savior and restore the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the hearts of the children to the fathers, and restore everything to its former state (Malachi 4). Therefore, the disciples think that this transformation of glory, which they see on the mountain, is the one they have seen, and they say: If you have already come in glory, why does your precursor not appear, especially since they saw Elijah depart? However, when they add: The scribes say that Elijah must come first; by saying 'first,' they show that unless Elijah comes, the coming of the Savior according to the Scriptures is not fulfilled.
