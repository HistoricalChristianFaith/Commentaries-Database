We must seek for reasons for individual sayings and actions of the Lord. After the coin was found, after the tribute paid, what do the apostles’ sudden questions mean? Why precisely “at that time” did the disciples come to Jesus saying, “Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?” Because they had seen that the same tax had been paid for both Peter and the Lord. From the equal price they inferred that Peter may have been set over all the other apostles, since Peter had been compared with the Lord in the paying of the tax. So they ask who is greater in the kingdom of heaven. Jesus, seeing their thoughts and understanding the causes of their error, wants to heal their desire for glory with a struggle for humility.

(Chapter 18, Verse 1) At that time the disciples came to Jesus, saying, Who do you think is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven? This has often been discussed and is still worth considering. We must examine the reasons for each of the Lord's words and actions. After finding the coin, after paying the taxes, what does the sudden question from the apostles mean? At that time the disciples came to Jesus, saying, Who do you think is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven? Because they had seen the tribute paid by Peter and the Lord, equal in price, they decided that Peter should be preferred to all the other apostles, who had been compared to the Lord in the payment of the tribute. Therefore, they asked who is greater in the kingdom of heaven? And Jesus, seeing their thoughts and understanding the causes of their error, wanted to heal their desire for glory and their striving for humility.
