(Verse 28.) Is that man, Chonias (also known as Jechonias), like a broken and useless clay pot? Is he a vessel without any pleasure or usefulness? Why are he and his descendants rejected and thrown onto the ground that they do not know? Because of what we have said, Symmachus translated it as: Is he a vessel for trash, or worthless and discarded rubbish? In the Septuagint, there is nothing on this, but this is the only interpretation: Jechonias is dishonored, like a vessel in which there is no usefulness. And when this is said of Jechoniah, the son of Joachim, someone dares to refer it to the type of Christ; and from this, the Apostle says that the Lord Savior is the image of the invisible God (Colossians I), the firstborn of every creature, that is, wisdom, the Word, truth, life, and righteousness, he is called the ring that is thrown or pulled from the hand of the Lord and given to Nebuchadnezzar to rule. They were cast down, he says, he and his seed, and cast upon the unknown land: which no one doubts was done to Jechoniah. Jechonias is interpreted as the preparation of the Lord, in which in the present place the first syllable, that is, the name of the Lord, is taken away, and it is called Chonias, so that it is understood as prepared for destruction and perdition.
