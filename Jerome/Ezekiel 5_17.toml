(Verse 17) And I will send famine upon you, and the most evil beasts to annihilate you. And pestilence and blood shall pass through you, and I will bring the sword upon you. I am the Lord who has spoken. The most evil beasts are brought upon the desolate land, which has been devastated by famine, the sword, and pestilence. These times also show when familiar animals, like dogs, are driven to madness and attack their masters' flesh, and the land is filled with bears, wolves, and all other kinds of beasts. The pestilence and blood passing through it signify disease and the sword. But even in our Jerusalem the worst beasts are sent, when we are handed over to ignominious sufferings, and to a reprobate sense and consciousness of our sins, which torture and tear apart our soul (Rom. I). Dissensions, heresies, schisms, rivalries, envy, sadness, detractions, evil desires, greed, which is the root of all evils (II Cor. XII), are the worst beasts. When they are within us, we deserve to hear: Your transgression shall rebuke you (Jeremiah). And we pray and say: Do not deliver the soul confessing to you to the beasts (Ps. LXXIII, 19).
