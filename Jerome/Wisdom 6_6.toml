“The powerful will be severely tormented” and “To one whom much has been given, much will be required.” This refers in particular to priests. If they do not want to listen, guarding their hearts so as to glorify the Lord’s name by their good conduct, but instead people curse his name because of them, God will deprive them of every good and turn their blessing into a curse. Those who abuse their health in licentious behavior and corrupt their good name with sordid conduct change God’s blessings into curses.
