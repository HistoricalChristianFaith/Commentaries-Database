(Verse 3, 4.) Therefore my loins are filled with pain: anguish has taken hold of me, like the anguish of a woman in labor: I am bowed down when I hear it, I am troubled when I see it. My heart is faint, darkness has overwhelmed me. Babylon, my beloved, has become a wonder to me. The prophets are therefore obscured, because many individuals are changed in them. Therefore now the voice of Isaiah is introduced mourning for Babylon in a prophetic spirit, because such great evils are about to come upon her, that the one who narrates, overcome by fear, is unable to burst forth into words, seeing the bloodshed of such a multitude: and moved by the affection of mercy (for indeed he speaks of humans), he grieves no less than a woman wailing in childbirth; but he is troubled and fearful, and falling to the ground, with dim eyes he knows not what he is saying. But for the name that we translate as Babylon, in Hebrew it is read Neseph Esci (); and it is the very word that we placed at the beginning of the Babylonian Oneris, on the dark mountain: for it is written Neseph for dark or gloomy. And this city is specifically called thus, because of its height and the erect summit of pride reaching up to heaven.
