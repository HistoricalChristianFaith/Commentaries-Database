(Verse 25.) And Methuselah lived for 167 years and begot Lamech. And Methuselah lived, after he begot Lamech, for 802 years, and he begot sons and daughters. And all the days of Methuselah, that he lived, were 969 years, and he died. The famous question, and the subject of dispute among all the churches, is that, according to careful calculation, Methuselah is said to have lived fourteen years after the flood. For when Methuselah was sixty-seven years old, he begot Lamech. And again, Lamech, when he was eighty-eight years old, begot Noah. And they lived together until the day of Noah's birth, which was three hundred and fifty-five years after Methuselah's birth. But in the six hundredth year of Noah's life, the flood occurred. And by this calculation, it is proven that the flood happened in the nine hundred and fifty-fifth year of Methuselah's life. However, since he is said to have lived for more than 969 years, there is no doubt that he lived for 14 years after the flood. And how is it true that only eight souls were saved in the ark? Therefore, it remains that just as there is an error in number in many things, there is also an error in this. For in both the Hebrew and Samaritan books, I found it written: And Methuselah lived 187 years and fathered Lamech. And Methuselah lived, after he begot Lamech, seven hundred eighty-two years and begot sons and daughters. And all the days of Methuselah were nine hundred sixty-nine years, and he died. And Lamech lived one hundred eighty-two years and begot Noah. From the day of the birth of Methuselah to the day of the birth of Noah, there are three hundred sixty-nine years. Add to these six hundred years of Noah's life: because in the six hundredth year of his life the deluge occurred: and so it happens that in the nine hundred and sixty-ninth year of his life Methuselah died, in that year when the deluge began.
