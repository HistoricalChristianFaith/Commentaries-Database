This prophecy does not come from Jeremiah but from a similar passage in Zechariah, who is almost the last of the twelve prophets. Although the meaning does not differ much, Zechariah’s word order and vocabulary do conflict with Matthew’s quotation. In a copy of the Hebrew Scriptures given to me by a member of the Nazarene sect, I recently read an apocryphal edition of the book of Jeremiah in which this quotation from Matthew appeared word for word. Nevertheless it still seems more likely to me that Matthew took this prophecy from Zechariah, since it was the ordinary practice of the Evangelists and apostles to communicate only the meaning of texts from the Old Testament while neglecting to observe their word order.

(Verse 9, 10) Then was fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet Jeremiah, saying, 'And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the value of Him who was priced, whom they of the children of Israel priced, and gave them for the potter's field, as the Lord directed me.' This testimony is not found in Jeremiah. But in Zechariah, who is almost the last of the twelve prophets, a certain similarity is mentioned (Zech. 11). And although the meaning does not differ much, nevertheless both the order and the words are different. I recently read in a certain Hebrew volume, which a Hebrew of the Nazarene sect offered to me, an apocryphal book of Jeremiah, in which I found the following words written verbatim. However, it seems to me more like a testimony taken from Zechariah: just like the Evangelists and Apostles commonly do, who, omitting the order of words, only present the meaning from the Old Testament as an example.
