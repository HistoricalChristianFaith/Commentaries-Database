(Verse 6) Do not give what is holy to the dogs. Holy, it is the bread of the children. Therefore, we should not take the bread of the children and give it to the dogs.

Do not cast your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn and tear you to pieces. The pig does not appreciate ornamentation, as it wallows in the mire. And according to the Proverbs of Solomon: If he has a golden circle, he is found to be more vile. (Prov. XI, 22). Some interpret them as dogs who return to the vomit of their sins after believing in Christ: but they interpret pigs as those who have not yet believed in the Gospel, and who wallow in the mire of unbelief and vice. Therefore, it is not fitting for men of this kind to quickly believe the Gospel pearl, lest they trample on it and, once converted, begin to scatter us.
