If the wicked perish, there is no chance for their repentance. It does not say that the wicked shall perish but that the way of the wicked vanishes, that is, wickedness shall perish. Not the wicked but wickedness itself; not the one who was wicked will perish, but while he is repenting, wickedness vanishes.
