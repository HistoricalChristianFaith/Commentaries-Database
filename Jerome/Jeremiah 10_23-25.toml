“All are governed by their own free choice.” What Christian can bear to hear this? For if not one, or a few or many, but all of us are governed by our own free choice, what becomes of the help of God? How do you explain the proverb that “A person’s goings are ordered by the Lord?” Or “A person’s way is not in himself”? Or “No one can receive anything, unless it be given him from above”? And elsewhere, “What do you have that you did not receive?”
