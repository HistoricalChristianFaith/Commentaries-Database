(Verse 18 and following) But when he returned to the city in the morning, he was hungry. And seeing a fig tree by the road, he went to it and found nothing on it except leaves. And he said to it, 'May no fruit ever come from you again!' And immediately the fig tree withered. And when the disciples saw it, they marveled, saying, 'How did the fig tree wither at once?' After the darkness of the night had dispersed, as the morning light shone and midday approached, during which the Lord was going to illuminate the world by means of his passion, when he returned to the city, he was hungry. Whether to reveal the truth of his human flesh or to hunger for the salvation of believers and to burn with incredulity towards the Jews. And when he saw a certain tree (which we understand to be the Synagogue and assembly of the Jews) by the road, for it had the Law and therefore it was by the road, because it did not believe in the way, he came to it, standing namely and immobile, and not having the feet of the Gospel: and he found nothing in it, except leaves alone, the noise of promises, Pharisaic traditions, and the ostentation of the Law, and the ornaments of words without any fruits of truth. And another evangelist says: For the time had not yet come (Mark 10:13); either because the time of the salvation of Israel had not yet come, since the Gentile people had not yet entered, or because the time of faith had passed, because, coming to him first, and rejected, it had passed to the nations. And he said to him: May no fruit ever be born from you, either forever or for eternity: for both αἰὼν (( Al. αἰῶνα)) in Greek means. And the little bed was dried up, which did not have the food that the hungry Lord desired. Likewise, the leaves withered, so that only the trunk remained, and with the branches broken, the root revived. If it wishes to believe in the last times, may the shoot of faith sprout, and may the Scripture be fulfilled, saying: 'There is hope for a tree.' (Job 14:7). However, according to the letter, the Lord, who was to suffer among the peoples and bear the scandal of the cross, had to strengthen the hearts of his disciples with the anticipation of a sign. And the disciples were amazed, saying: How did it wither immediately? Therefore, by the same power, could the Savior also dry up his enemies, unless he had awaited their salvation through repentance.
