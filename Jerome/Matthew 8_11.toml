(Verse 11.) But I say to you, that many will come from the East and the West, and will recline with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven. Because God, the creator of the heavens, is the Father of Christ, therefore Abraham is also in the kingdom of heaven, along with whom the nations that believe in Christ, the Son of the Creator, will recline. And that same understanding is fulfilled, as we mentioned above, in the faith of the Gentile centurion: as the peoples who will believe from the East and the West are mentioned.
