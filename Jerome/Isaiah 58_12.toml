(Verse 12.) And the deserts of the ages will be built in you: you will raise the foundations of generation after generation: and you will be called the builder of walls, turning paths into peace. LXX: And the deserts will be built for you from the age and your foundations will be everlasting for generations and generations: and you will be called the builder of walls, and you will make paths rest in the middle. Not only, he says, will your light arise in the darkness, and your darkness will be like midday, and the Lord will give you rest always, and you will be like a well-watered garden, and so on; but what has long been deserted will be rebuilt in you, and the foundations of your buildings will remain for many generations: so that either you yourself will be called the builder of walls and ramparts, or someone will arise in you who will be the builder of walls, and he will turn the paths into peace, or according to the Septuagint, he will make the roads in the middle to rest. These Jews and their friends in the western provinces are referring to the restoration of the cities of Palestine. They argue that either these things were done under Zorobabel and Ezra, and Nehemiah, or they will happen in the future: the highest foundations must be laid for the restoration of Jerusalem and the surrounding cities, and such high walls must be built that no enemy can enter, and the entrance of all enemies into them must be prohibited. But we, following the order of the explanation that has been begun, say that what was deserted among the Jews is being built in the Church, not for a short time, but forever, and its foundations must be raised from both peoples, that is, in two generations. Where the Apostle says: Like a wise architect, I laid the foundation; another builds upon it. But let each one see how he builds upon it (1 Corinthians 3:10). And in another place: We are God's field, God's building (Ephesians 2:20). And it is to be called, or when someone is born in it, the builder of fences. About this we read in the psalm: Man is born in it, and the Most High has founded it (Psalm 87:5). The Scripture mentions that fields and vineyards are surrounded by hedgerows and walls, which is signified by the Greek term φραγμοῦς. You have transferred a vineyard from Egypt: you have uprooted the nations and planted it. And a little later: Why have you destroyed its walls? And let all who pass by pluck its grapes (Ps. LXXXIX, 9 and 13). And in the same Prophet: A vineyard has been made for the beloved; describing it in beautiful language, he says: I have built a tower and surrounded it with a wall (Eccles. II, 4). According to Ecclesiastes, whoever destroys her will be bitten by a snake. She is surrounded so that the access of all animals to the vineyard of God is prohibited. This snake is the crafty one who deceived Eve in paradise. Because she had destroyed God's commandments, she was exposed to his bites, and she heard from the Lord: You will watch his head, and he will watch your heel (Genesis 3:15). In that place where we have translated according to the Septuagint, so as not to seem to be innovating anything, because the testimony is well-known, and you will be called the builder of fences, in Hebrew it is written, and you will be called Goder Pheres, which Aquila interpreted as περιφράκτης διακοπῆς, which, according to the meaning, we can say opposes God's fierce anger. Finally, Symmachus translated, opposing a wall to the one who was killing (1 Kings 7), like Moses and Aaron, and Samuel, who resisted the anger of the Lord, and as if by building a wall, they set a limit to his indignation. This is also said to Jeremiah: Do not meet the Lord, do not want to resist His anger, and block the indignation with prayers as if with a wall (Jeremiah 7): and to Moses, as if the Lord was holding him: Let me go, he said, and I will strike down this people (Exodus 32, 10). Therefore, this builder of walls, fences, and hedges will transform paths into tranquility, so that the anger of God may not rage, but the Lord may be appeased and all the pathways of indignation may find rest.
