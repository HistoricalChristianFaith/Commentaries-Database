(Verse 21, 22.) But what remains will belong to the prince on all sides, either from here or from there ((The Vulgate is silent whether from here or from there)) as the firstfruits of the sanctuary and the possession of the city, bordering (or facing) twenty-five thousand firstfruits to the eastern boundary, and also from the sea ((The Vulgate says to the sea)) bordering (or facing) twenty-five thousand to the boundary of the sea. Similarly, in the areas belonging to the prince, there will be the firstfruits of the sanctuary and the sanctuary of the temple in its midst. There will also be possession of the Levites, and possession of the city in the middle of the prince's territory, between the boundary of Judah and the boundary of Benjamin, and it will belong to the prince. There has been much discussion about this prince above, and that he would receive only as much as one tribe. But now we learn something else, that whatever is left from all the tribes, only he shall receive it: so that there is no tribe that does not offer gifts to the prince: not from elsewhere, but from the firstfruits which serve the temple and the sanctuary and the delegated parts of the city. For this is what he says: From the east boundary to the western boundary, and from the northern boundary to the southern boundary, the firstfruits will belong to the seven and a half tribes. Within these firstfruits will be the city and its surrounding suburbs, as well as the sanctuary of the temple in the middle of the city. As for the land assigned to the Levites and the rest of the city, it will be considered as belonging to the prince. The area next to the firstfruits and the city, in the tribe of Judah, will be the western portion of the seven tribes. The eastern portion, in the tribe of Benjamin, will also belong to the prince. Since the sacraments of Holy Scripture are wondrous and should be contemplated more than spoken (Dan. XXXII). In the former division of the land beyond the Jordan by Moses, the land was divided among the two tribes of Reuben and Gad, and the half tribe of Manasseh (Joshua, XIII). But beyond the Jordan, by Joshua the son of Nun and Eleazar the son of Aaron, Judah possessed the south (Joshua, XV); and Ephraim and the half tribe of Manasseh possessed the north (Joshua, XVIII). Afterwards, with the spies sent to each tribe and a description of the land brought to Joshua and Eleazar, Benjamin received possession next to Judah from the south, and next to Ephraim and half the tribe of Manasseh. The second tribe, Simeon, received an inheritance within the tribe of Judah, so that what is written about Levi and Simeon would be fulfilled: I will divide them in Jacob, and scatter them in Israel (Gen. XLIX, 7). The third tribe, Zebulun, received Galilee, which includes Mount Tabor. On the fourth day, Isachar, where Jezreel is located, to the Jordan. On the fifth day, Aser, up to Mount Carmel, which overlooks the Great Sea, and Tyre and Sidon. On the sixth day, Nephthali, in Galilee and up to the Jordan, where Tiberias, which was once called Chenereth, is located. On the seventh day, Dan up to Joppa, where the towers of Ailon, Selebi, and Emmaus are located, which is now called Nicopolis: although we will later read that they took the city of Lesem in the tribe of Dan, which is now called Paneas. When these things are so, and there is such a difference between the previous description of the tribes and the one now held, let us consider how both in the current description and in the past, the tribe of Judah and Benjamin, the city, and the Temple have been located. In the previous description, Judah was to the south, and Benjamin to the north: but now it is the opposite, with Judah to the north and Benjamin to the south: after them, the second is Simeon, the third is Issachar, and the fourth is Zebulun, the fifth is Gad: namely, five tribes, as it is said in the following verses; for it is written:
