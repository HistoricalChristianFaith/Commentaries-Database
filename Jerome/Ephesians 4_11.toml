From this passage Paul clearly confirms the divinity of the Father and Son. What Christ is here said to have bestowed [as in his first letter to the Corinthians] is nothing less than the gift of God. … Failing to understand this, Sabellius confused the Father and the Son, not grasping that, though distinguishable, they work together with single intent.

It is not to be supposed that as with the first three … he has allotted different offices to shepherds and teachers. For he does not say “some shepherds, some teachers” but “some shepherds and teachers,” meaning that he who is a shepherd should at the same time be a teacher. No one in the church, even a saintly person, should take to himself the name of shepherd unless he can teach those whom he feeds.
