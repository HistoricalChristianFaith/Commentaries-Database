(Judges 5:24) Blessed among women, Jael, the wife of Heber the Kenite. Among women, namely Sarah, Rebecca, Rachel, Leah, and almost all women. Let her be blessed in the temple, the Lord is understood, so that her memorial may be there, just like Judith. And the reason why she is blessed is given, namely because she acted wisely and prudently, in that she gave milk to the one asking for water. Therefore, she gave milk, so that the fleeing enemy would find a stronger faith in her. And if it is asked why he did not give wine, it must be answered that the house of Rechab do not drink wine, as you have in the prophet Jeremiah (Jer. XXXV, 14).
