(Verse 17.) For what is its good and what is its beauty, except for the chosen grain and the wine that brings forth virgins? LXX: For if there is anything best from it, and if there is anything good from it, it is the grain for the youth and the wine with a good aroma for the virgins. Therefore, they say, the Maccabees, fleeing here and there with the help of the Lord, will prevail, so that, with the Macedonians expelled from the land of Israel, the temple may be purified, the precepts of the Law may be observed, and the instruction of the Scriptures may once again bring forth virgins, that is, the people of believers in one God, who were previously defiled by the worship of idols. In the chosen wheat, that is, the Bread, not young men, as the Seventy translated it, but they want it to be understood as chosen and learned men, who deserve to eat the Bread, that is, the Law of God. For wine, which in Hebrew is called Thiros, Aquila interpreted as 'oenoa', which can also refer to the abundance of the vineyard. This is what the Jews consider. But we understand the chosen wheat, whether of young men, and the wine producing virgins, or the wine of good odor for the virgins, to be the Lord and Savior, who speaks in the Gospel: Unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit (John 12:24). From this wheat is made that bread which comes down from heaven and strengthens the heart of man (Ps. 103). Those who are strong in Christ eat this bread, to whom John the Evangelist speaks: 'I write to you, young men, because the word of God abides in you (Al. us) and you are strong, and have overcome the evil one' (1 John 2:14). He himself is both the grain of the chosen, or the young men, and the wine that gladdens the heart of man, and it is drunk by those virgins who are holy in body and spirit, that they, being intoxicated and rejoicing, may follow the Church, and it may be said of them: 'Virgins shall be brought after her to the king, her neighbors shall be brought to thee: they shall be brought with gladness and rejoicing' (Ps. 44:15, 16). For how will those who are not joyful have joy, those who are intoxicated by the drink of the Savior, generated in virgins, and dare to say: 'Bring me into the wine cellars, comfort me with ointments' (Song of Solomon II, 4)? This wine is of good odor, as it is said in the same song: 'You shall drink of the wine of the unguentary, of the rivers of your pomegranates' (Ibidem). Those who follow the Lamb of God wherever He goes are intoxicated by this wine, dressed in white garments; for they have not defiled themselves with women: they have remained virgins (Apocalypse XIV).
