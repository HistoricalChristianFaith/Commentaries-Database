(Verse 16, 17.) Say to the nations: Behold, it has been heard in Jerusalem, the watchmen come from a distant land and they have given their voice over the cities of Judah: they have become like watchmen over it all around, because they have provoked me to anger, says the Lord. God wants all the nations around to know our judgment: and Jerusalem, being afflicted, to receive all discipline. It is announced with a famous saying in Jerusalem that the adversaries come from a distant land, and the noise of a roaring army rises against it, who besiege the city and close the city with fortifications so diligently, that you would think they are not adversaries, but rather watchmen over fields and vineyards. But all this was done not by the strength of the enemy, but by the fault of Jerusalem: because it provoked God to anger. For if they do not have power over the strength of their adversaries in pigs, how much more in men, and men who were once citizens of God's city?
