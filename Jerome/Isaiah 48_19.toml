“Your offspring would have been like the sand and your descendants like its grains.” This promise seems still to apply to the Jewish people.… But how can this be taken as a real promise to them since they do not have peace and justice? For he is either angry with them or pleased with them. If angry, how can their seed grow every day? If pleased, then how can they serve and yet not have peace and justice? For this becomes clear concerning the apostolic seed about which we read above, “Unless the Lord of the sabbath left us a seed we would have been like Sodom.” At that time it did not seem fulfilled, but in the advent of Christ it was, and before his face the seed of Israel endures. - "Commentary on Isaiah 13.17"
