(Verse 21, 22.) And my children have provoked me, they have not walked in my commandments, and they have not kept my judgments, to do the things that if a man does, he shall live in them, and they have violated my sabbaths. And I threatened to pour out my fury upon them, and to accomplish my anger against them in the wilderness. But I turned away my hand, and I did it for the sake of my name, so that it would not be violated in the sight of the nations, from whom I cast them out. But the sons, he says, followed the crimes of their parents and did everything that they had done: therefore, they deserved a similar punishment. However, the same mercy by which their fathers were spared because of the greatness of my compassion, and for the same reasons for which I had pity on their fathers: so that I, as the sole and same Creator of both, might temper my anger with similar patience. We have traversed the obvious and proceeded to more obscure matters.
