This barrenness is made fruitful by virginity, this eunuch forces entry to the kingdom of God and forcefully snatches it. Who is the observer of the sabbaths that never does the works of marriage? Such a person chooses what the Lord desires and offers more than is demanded of him; he does not think about leniency but the will of his apostle. He keeps the everlasting covenant of the Lord and does not leave what he says unfulfilled and again return to his [former] self, but he knows that he will receive in the home of the Lord the best place … and that instead of children of the flesh he will have spiritual children. Such was the Evangelist John … who, while Peter was walking slowly, was flying with the wings of virginity and ran to the Lord, and who, losing himself in the secrets of the divine birth, dared to say things of which the ages were ignorant: “In the beginning was the Word.” … Therefore, let all murmuring of the Jews end and cease to taunt that the kingdom of God is open to “half-men,” since purity is not measured in the disability of the body but in the will of the mind.

Those who please me are those who choose to be eunuchs voluntarily.… Who can receive this teaching, let him receive it. It is a matter of great faith and great virtue to be the purest kind of temple of God, in that one dedicates oneself completely to the Lord as a burnt offering and to be holy in body as well as spirit. Those are eunuchs who, thinking themselves to be “dry trees” because of their infertility, hear through Isaiah that instead of sons and daughters they will have a place prepared in heaven. Of this sort were Ebedmelech in Jeremiah and that eunuch of Queen Candace.
