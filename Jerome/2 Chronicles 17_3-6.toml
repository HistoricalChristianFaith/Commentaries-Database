Of Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah, it is written, “And the Lord was with Jehoshaphat, who walked in the first ways of David, his father.” From this it is clear that Jehoshaphat possessed the justice that David first possessed and that he did not commit the sins that David later committed. “He trusted not in Baalim,” he says, “but in the God of his father and walked in his commandments, and not according to the sins of Israel. And the Lord established the kingdom in his hand and all Judah brought presents to Jehoshaphat. And he acquired immense wealth and riches and much glory.” “And when his heart had taken courage for the ways of the Lord, he took away also the high places and the groves out of Judah.”
