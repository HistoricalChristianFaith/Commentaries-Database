(Verse 17) And leaving them, he went out outside the city to Bethany, and he stayed there. He left the unbelievers and, leaving the city of opposition, he went to Bethany, which means house of obedience, foreshadowing at that time the calling of the gentiles, and he stayed there because he could not remain in Israel. This also should be understood, that he was of such great poverty and was not flattered by anyone, that in the greatest city he found no guest, no dwelling, but he lived in a small field with Lazarus and his sisters: for their village is Bethany.
