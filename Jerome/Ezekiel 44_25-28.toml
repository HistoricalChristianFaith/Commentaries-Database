(Verse 25 onwards) And they shall sanctify my Sabbaths, and they shall not go unto a dead person, lest they be defiled (for the Septuagint translated it as, and they shall not go upon the soul of a dead person, lest they be defiled): except for father and mother, he said, and son and daughter, brother and sister who has no husband, they shall be defiled. And after he has been cleansed, seven days shall be numbered for him, and on the day of his entrance into the sanctuary and into the inner courtyard, to minister unto me in the sanctuary, he shall offer a sin-offering unto the Lord God (or he shall offer an atonement). But they will not have an inheritance: I will be their inheritance, and you shall not give them any possession in Israel; I will be their possession. Furthermore, it is commanded to the priests: in which it is to be observed that it does not say absolutely: and they shall sanctify the sabbaths; or according to Isaiah: My soul hates your new moons and sabbaths (Isa. 1:13): but with distinction, my sabbaths. Hence, it is also written in the Gospel: The priests in the temple violate the Sabbath, and they are without guilt (Matt. 12:5): not the Sabbath of God, but the Sabbath of the law, the Sabbath of the Jews, which they rightly violate who are the chosen race, royal, priestly. Furthermore, let us understand the Sabbath, which is sanctified, as the Apostle teaches, to have been left to the people of God, about whom it is said: 'If they shall enter into my rest' (Ps. 94:11), which is called the Sabbath in Hebrew. But God sanctifies the Sabbath, who does not bear the burden of sin on the Sabbath, nor says: 'As the heavy burden, they have been heavily laden upon me' (Ps. 37:5). Whoever is such, does not gather wood on the Sabbath; nor does he build upon the foundation of Jesus Christ with wood, hay, straw (1 Cor. 3); nor does he light a fire that consumes useless material, and he remains in one place on the day of Sabbath; nor does he go outside, but remains like a column placed in the temple of God, as John writes in the Apocalypse: 'He who conquers, I will make him a pillar in the temple of my God, and he shall go out no more' (Rev. 3:12). And what follows: They shall not enter the place where the dead person is, lest they be polluted. It is the proper office of the priesthood not to touch anything connected with death, so that the one who prays for the sins of others may approach the altar in a state of purity. Our Savior also speaks of these dead in the Gospel: Let the dead bury their own dead (Matthew 8:22). They are polluted by their dead father when they abandon their Creator, and by their dead mother when they depart from the Church. Likewise, by their son and daughter, for there is a distinction between thoughts and actions, which is more expressively stated in Greek as τὰ νοητὰ καὶ αἰσθητά. Also, if a brother and sister, who have been born of the same spirit, mistakenly believe that one of them has died, they become contaminated by this belief. However, this only applies if the sister remains a virgin and has not been defiled by any man. From this, we understand the virgin privilege, which is taken away by the touch of any man, thereby removing perfect purity. Whether this is said correctly or incorrectly, we leave it to the judgment of the reader. Furthermore, this is supported by the natural affection in the order of charity, as it is written: 'Set me as a seal upon your heart' (Song of Solomon 2:4). After God, the parent of all things, let the father and mother of the flesh also be loved and respected, as well as the son and daughter, and the brother and sister. However, this only applies if they have not left the household nor come under the authority of another. But after the priest has been purified according to the order of purification that is prescribed in the Mosaic law, let seven days be numbered for him, either the perfect number of penance, or after the consummation of the world, when we pass over to the true ogdoad, so that he may enter the holy of holies (which is the inner courtyard) and minister in the sanctuary and always offer a victim for the sin of conscience: and let there be no time when he does not remember that he has been defiled by his father and mother, son and daughter, brother and sister. For indeed we are compelled to do many things in the constraints of this world, either due to the condition of the flesh or the frailty of nature. But whoever is such that he ministers in the sanctuary, and enters the inner court, and offers a perpetual sacrifice to God, so that he may be a true priest, indeed an imitator of him about whom it is written: 'You are a priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek' (Psalm 110:4), this person will have no inheritance, except God who is his inheritance; nor will he receive possession among the common people of Israel; but rather a priestly one, so that the Lord may say about him: 'I am their inheritance and possession.' When they find him, they will speak and say: I will hold him, and I will not let him go; and they will sing with the prophet: The Lord is my portion (Ps. II, 26).
