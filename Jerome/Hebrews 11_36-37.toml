I know that some people criticize this passage [Matthew 26:8-11] because one Evangelist said only Judas became indignant since he kept the money purse and was a thief from the beginning, whereas Matthew wrote that all the apostles were indignant. Some may be unaware of the figure of speech called syllepsis, customarily termed “all for one and one for all.” The case is somewhat similar with Paul the apostle, who wrote in his epistle to the Hebrews (though many Latins have doubts about this), describing the sufferings and merits of the heroes of faith, inferring: “They were stoned, they were sawn in two, they were tempted, they were put to death by the sword.” [Hebrews 11:36-37] The Jews assert that only one person, Isaiah the prophet, was tortured. We may also point out that the apostles were indignant for the sake of the poor but Judas for the sake of his own gain. Hence his grumbling was also mixed with his misdeeds, because he had no concern for the poor but only wanted to be able to steal.
