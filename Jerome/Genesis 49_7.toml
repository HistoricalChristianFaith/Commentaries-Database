(Verse 7) Cursed be their fury, for it is stubborn; and their anger, for it is harsh. I will divide them in Jacob and scatter them in Israel. For Levi did not receive his own inheritance, but had a few cities to dwell in among all the tribes. As for Simeon, it is written in the Book of Joshua (19) that he did not even receive a portion of land as his own, but received something from the tribe of Judah. And in the Chronicles (1, 4) it is more explicitly written that he multiplied and did not have a place of possession, so he went out into the wilderness. Certain people interpret the prophetically killed men, the Apostles, and the paralyzed bull by the Pharisees as Christ.
