"He who
digs a pit will fall into it, and he who breaks down a wall will be bitten by a
snake. "This is partly unambiguous and partly to be understood in
a more complicated way. Since elsewhere
Solomon also says, "he that sets a trap will be caught in it" [Eccli. 27, 29.]. And in the seventh Psalm: "he laid out a
pond and dug it out, and then he fell into the hole he had made" [Ps. 7, 16.]. But the wall and the fence as well are the
doctrines of the Church, and the institution set up by the apostles and
prophets. And whoever knocks them down
or wants them to come to an end is bitten by a snake where he is not looking. Amos writes about this snake: "if he
goes down into the underworld, I will order a snake to kill him" [Am. 9, 3.].
