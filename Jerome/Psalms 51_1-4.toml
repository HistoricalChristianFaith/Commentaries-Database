Psalm 50 [51] shows the complete repentance of a sinner when David, who had gone into Bathsheba, the wife of Uriah the Hittite and was rebuked by the prophet Nathan, said, “I have sinned.” Immediately he deserved to hear “The Lord has removed your sin from you.” For he, who had added homicide to adultery and was moved to tears, said, “God, have compassion on me according to your great pity, and according to the multitude of your mercies take away my iniquity.” Since a great sin needed great mercy, he added, “Wash me completely from my iniquity, and my offense is always before me. I have sinned against you only”—for a king did not fear anyone else—“and I have done evil in your sight so that you will be justified in your speaking and you overcome when you judge.” “For God has included all things under sin so that he may be merciful to all.” He made so much progress that he who a little earlier had been a penitent sinner became a master and was able to say, “I will teach the unjust your ways, and sinners will be converted to you.” Since confession and beauty are before God, the one who confesses his sins and says, “My wounds have been destroyed and become putrefied,” changes the foulness of his wounds into a healthy state. But “he who hides his sins will not prosper.”
