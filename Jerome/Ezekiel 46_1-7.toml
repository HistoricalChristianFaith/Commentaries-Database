(Chapter 46—Verses 1 onwards). Thus says the Lord God: The gate of the inner court that faces east will be closed for six days, during which work is being done; but on the Sabbath day it will be opened, and also on the day of the new moon it will be opened. And the prince shall enter through the vestibule of the outer gate, and shall stand at the threshold of the gate. The priests shall offer his burnt offering and his peace offerings, and he shall worship at the threshold of the gate and then leave. But the gate shall not be closed until evening. And the people of the land shall worship at the entrance of that gate on the Sabbaths and on the new moons before the Lord. The prince shall offer on the Sabbaths, as a burnt offering to the Lord, six unblemished lambs and an unblemished ram, and a grain offering of an ephah for the ram. And for the lambs, whatever his hand gives as a sacrifice, and a hin of oil for each ephah. On the new moons, he shall offer an unblemished bull from the herd, and six lambs and rams shall be unblemished. And one ephah for a young bull, and one ephah for a ram shall he make a sacrifice: and with every ephah there shall be a hin of oil. Where we have translated ephah, which is a tenth part of an ephah, they have rendered it πέμμα, which in our language means a measure of volume. And where we have said sacrifice, they have used the Hebrew word Manaa, which Aquila translated as gift or sacrifice, and Theodotion translated as sacrifice. And meanwhile, before we discuss what these things mean, the very words of Scripture must be explained paraphrastically. 'The gate,' it says, 'of the inner court shall be closed for six days, as it is written: Six days you shall work and do all your works (Exod. XXIII, 12); and it shall not be any gate, but the one facing the East, where the sun of justice rises. Moreover, on the Sabbath day, that is, on the seventh day, which is a day of rest, it shall be opened each week, and again, when thirty days are complete, which is the end of one month and the beginning of another, that is, on the day of the calends, it shall be opened, so that what the seventh day has as a privilege in the week, the beginning of the month may have as a privilege as well.' But why it is opened on the seventh day, and on the first day of the month, the inner gate of the atrium facing the East will be explained in the following discourse. And the prince will enter, he says, through the path of the outer gate of the atrium: and he will stand at the threshold of the inner gate of the atrium, which faces the East: and he will not enter the inner atrium, but while he is standing there, other priests will make a burnt offering for him, which offering Symmachus interpreted as a holocaust: and peace offerings, or those pertaining to salvation, so that after the offering of the prince has been consumed by the holy fire, and the leader has been reconciled with God, then he may be able to worship on the threshold of the inner gate of the atrium where he stood, and he may exit. What then? Will the gate be immediately closed after the departure of the prince? By no means, but it will be open until evening, so that after the prince, all the people of the land may worship in front of that gate; they shall worship on the Sabbaths and the first days of the month when the gate is opened. And because he had said before: 'The priests shall make his burnt offering and his peace offerings,' and he had not indicated the number of burnt offerings, now he adds: 'On the Sabbaths, the prince shall offer this burnt offering to the Lord.' However, it is offered not by itself, but by the priests, of whom it is written: 'And the priests shall offer its burnt offering and its peace offerings: six flawless male lambs, and one flawless ram; and the sacrifice of the ram shall be measured by an ephah, which in Hebrew is called an Epha (). And the sacrifice that his hands who offer it are able to offer shall be six lambs; and for each ephah, the measure of oil shall be a hin, which is called in Hebrew a hin. But on the first day of the month, which is the day of the new moon, it shall have a greater privilege than the Sabbath, and a calf shall be offered from the herd, or a flawless bull.' The rest, that is, six spotless lambs and one spotless ram, and their sacrifices, shall possess the ritual of the Sabbath: only in this way, that just as in the ram the same amount of flour and oil is offered as a sacrifice, so it should be offered in the calf. These things are stated for the sake of clarity: now, with the Lord's gift, let us unlock the spiritual meaning. But when we have come to the seventh day, that is, the Sabbath, on which eternal rest is, or to the day of the Kalends, when after a blind night and horrible darkness, the beginning of light is, the Eastern gate is opened to us: and if any of us, by the merits of virtues, shall have attained to the name and dignity of leader by the way of the porch of the outer gate, that is, by the labours of this world: and shall enter the gate of the Church, which is as yet placed in earthly boundaries: it shall enter not the inner court, for this is written in the present place; but it shall stand at the threshold of the inner gate, and abide in it. But if the prince does not enter the inner atrium in the present Scripture, but stands at its threshold, there is no doubt that now we see and know in part; and not yet revealed, we contemplate the glory of the Lord. Finally, with the prince standing at the threshold of the gate of the inner atrium, the other priests, to whom this duty is delegated (whom we can understand as angelic virtues), will make a burnt offering and peace offerings on behalf of him. For we are born of the mercy of God, and every creature is unclean in comparison to the Creator, and must be cleansed by divine fire, as the lips of the prophet Isaiah were cleansed, so that after receiving peace through sacrifice, he may then stand at the threshold and worship the almighty God, and acknowledge his unworthiness to enter the inner court, and immediately enter. After the first person has exited, the inner gate of the court will not be closed until evening of this age, but will remain open so that the people of the earth may come to the door and worship him. Not at all times, but when they have rested from sins and the darkness of faith has been dispelled, and they have received the light of knowledge. But this very burnt offering that the prince offers through the priests on the Sabbath day is concluded with six unblemished lambs; namely, for the six days in which we work in the world, and a flawless ram, which is the leader of the flock; so that through each ram it may be offered in sacrifice an ephah, that is, a tenth part of a measure. In the sacrifice of the six lambs, a certain measure is not specified: but whatever amount the hand of the one offering has given, that is, according to the quality and measure of the works (Matthew 25). But he shall offer a hin of oil for each ephah, that is, the oil which the five virgins prepared for themselves, so that he may anoint the flour or mix it, and every offering of God may be full of the light of truth and the face of the one offering the oil may be brightened. But on the day of the kalends, that is, the thirtieth day, when the firstborn and the Levites are numbered in the Law, apart from all of Israel, of whom we have spoken above, an unblemished calf from the herd is offered, about which we discussed more fully in the previous chapter, and six lambs, and unblemished rams, and whatever is offered on the Sabbaths, so that we may attain eternal rest and deserve to hear: 'Well done, good servant, because you have been faithful in a few things, I will set you over many, enter into the rest of your Lord' (Matthew 25:21; Luke 19:17); and not only arrive at the gate of the inner courtyard, but also be able to enter its innermost parts, and possess it by work: 'Planted in the house of the Lord, they will flourish in the courts of our God' (Psalm 92:14).
