(V. 6,-8.) Because this is what the Lord says about the house (or to the house) of the king of Judah, Gilead, you are to me the head (or the beginning) of Lebanon. If I do not make you a desolation, cities uninhabitable. And I will consecrate (or build) upon you the one who kills men, and his weapons: and they will cut down your chosen cedars, and throw (or send) them into fire, and many nations will pass through this city, and each one will say to his neighbor: Why did the Lord do such to this great city? And they will answer, because they have forsaken the covenant of the Lord their God, and worshiped foreign gods, and served them. Scripture mentions the land of Gilead, which was possessed by half the tribe of Manasseh, beyond the Jordan. On this mountain, Jacob pursued Laban as he fled, and the mountain received the name σωρὸς, which means heap of testimony, because there Jacob and Laban swore an oath, gathering a heap of stones (Genesis 31). But the head, or beginning, of Mount Lebanon, which is entirely composed of cedars, is mentioned next by David when he sings: And the Lord will shake the cedars of Lebanon (Psalm 29:5). And elsewhere: I have seen the wicked exalted, and raised up like the cedars of Lebanon (Psalm 36:35). And in Zechariah we read: Open your doors, O Lebanon, and let the fire consume your cedars (Zechariah 11:1). Therefore, in this present passage, because he was speaking to the royal house, he metaphorically speaks to the Temple, or to the house of the tribe of Judah, either because it itself is on high, or because all the remedies for sins were sought from the Temple and the Sanctuary. Therefore, the same prophet also mentions: Is there no balm in Gilead, or physician there? Why then has there been no healing for the daughter of my people? (Jeremiah 8:21). He threatens therefore the royal household, the city of Jerusalem, and the Temple, which he calls the head of Lebanon, that it shall be reduced to a deserted state along with all its cities, not by the power of the Babylonian king, but by the command of the Lord, who says: I will sanctify over you a destroyer. But Nabuchodonosor is called holy, and all his army, because he carries out the judgement of God. And he will cut down, he says, your chosen cedars: the powerful and the leaders of the city; and they will throw them into the fire, so that the devouring flame consumes everything. And when everything has been destroyed, many nations will pass through the city and the Temple, which they were previously not allowed to enter; and each person will speak to their neighbor, asking why the Lord has caused such a sudden and great destruction to the famous and great city. And those who are questioned will respond and explain the causes of the ruination, saying: because they have forsaken the covenant of their Lord God, and have worshiped idols instead of God. Let the royal house of our city and its princes listen to this, and let the high cedars, which reach up to the heavens, also listen. They speak with arrogance: who will not see? Let them be consumed quickly by the flame of the Lord if they refuse to comply with His commandments. But there is another sanctification (or rather sacrifice) of the murderer and his weapons; and another of the priests and those who serve the Lord.
