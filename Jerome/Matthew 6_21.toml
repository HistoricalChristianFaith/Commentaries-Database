(Verse 21) For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also. This applies not only to money, but also to all passions and possessions. The stomach is the god of gluttons: there it has its heart, where its treasure is. The treasure of the luxurious is feasts. For the lascivious, it is playfulness; for the lover, it is desire. Everyone serves the one by whom he is conquered (2 Peter 2:19).
