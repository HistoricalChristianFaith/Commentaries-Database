"This is
an evil about all things that are done under the sun: that the same fate awaits
all Therefore the heart of man is full of evil; and madness is in their heart
while they live; and after that, they go to the dead. "Symmachus interprets this in his usual
clearer way, saying, "but even the heart of mankind is filled with
wickedness and impudence like their heart in life". But all of them succumb to death, for who is
able to continually live forever? The
Scripture has the same meaning regarding this. 
I said a little earlier, that when both good and bad things happen
equally to everyone, there is no difference between good and bad, for we are
taken from this life by indiscriminate death. 
Nonetheless we are filled with wrongdoings and impudence and wickedness,
and after all these trials in life we are suddenly taken by death and
afterwards we cannot consort with the living. 
Or indeed it could mean this: since the same difficulties afflict both
the just and the unjust, men are therefore provoked to commit sins. Then after he has tried all things, which are
done in vain, while he is unknowing, he descends to the world of the dead. "For
he who is attached to all living has hope, a live dog is better than a dead
lion."
