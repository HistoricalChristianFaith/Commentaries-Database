For if they preach without receiving reward for it, the possession of gold and silver and wealth was unnecessary. For had they had such, they would have been thought to be preaching, not for the sake of men's salvation, but their own gain.

As He had cut off riches, which are meant by gold and silver, He now almost cuts off necessaries of life; that the Apostles, teachers of the true religion, who taught men that all things are directed by God's providence, might show themselves to be without thought for the morrow.

In forbidding the scrip, neither scrip for your journey,He aimed at those philosophers commonly called Bactroperatæ (vid. Cotel. not. in Herm. Past. ii. 1.), who being despisers of this world, and esteeming all things as nothing, yet carry a bag about with them. Nor two coats. By the two coats He seems to mean a change of raiment; not to bid us be content with a single tunic in the snow and frosts of Scythia, but that they should not carry about a change with them, wearing one, and carrying about the other as provision for the future. Nor shoes. It is a precept of Plato, that the two extremities of the body should be left unprotected, and that we should not accustom ourselves to tender care of the head and feet; for if these parts be hardy, it will follow that the rest of the body will be vigorous and healthy. Nor staff; for having the protection of the Lord, why need we seek the aid of a staff?

As He had sent the Apostles forth unprovided and unencumbered on their mission, and the condition of the teachers seemed a hard one, He tempered the severity of the rules by this maxim, The labourer is worthy of his hire, i. e. Receive what you need for your food and clothing. Whence the Apostle says, Having food and raiment, let us therewith be content. (1 Tim. 6:8. Gal. 6:6.) And again, Let him that is catechized communicate unto him that catechizeth in all good things; that they whose disciples reap spiritual things, should make them partakers of their carnal things, not for the gratification of covetousness, but for the supply of wants.

Thus far we have expounded by the letter; but metaphorically, as we often find gold put for the sense, silver for the words, brass for the voice—all these we may say we are not to receive from others, but to have them given by the Lord. We are not to take up the teaching of heretics, of philosophers, and of corrupt doctrine.

Or; The Lord herein teaches us that our feet are not to be bound with the chains of death, but to be bare as we tread on the holy ground. We are not to carry a staff which may be turned into a serpent, nor to trust in any arm of flesh; for all such is a reed on which if a man lean ever so lightly, it will break and go into his hand and pierce him.

(Vers. 9, 10.) Do not possess gold, silver, or money in your belts. Take no bag for the journey, nor two tunics, nor sandals, nor staff. For the worker deserves his food. Therefore, he gives these precepts to the evangelizers of truth, to whom he had said before: Freely you have received, freely give. For if they preach in such a way that they do not accept payment, the possession of gold, silver, and money is superfluous. For if they had gold and silver, they seemed to preach not for the sake of the salvation of souls, but for the sake of profit. Nor is there money in their purses. He who cuts off wealth, almost cuts off the necessities of life, as the apostolic teachers of true religion, who taught that all things are governed by the providence of God, showed themselves to think nothing of tomorrow. Not a bag on the way. By this precept he condemns the philosophers, who are commonly called Bactroperitae, because they despise the world and consider everything as worthless, and carried the storeroom with them. Nor two tunics. In two tunics it seems to me to show a double garment. Not that in the regions of Scythia and freezing snow, one should be satisfied with one tunic: but rather that we understand clothing in the tunic: so that, dressed in one thing, we do not preserve another thing out of fear of future events. Nor footwear. And Plato taught that the two summits of the body should not be covered, nor should we become accustomed to the softness of the head and feet. For when these things have strength, the rest are stronger. Not the rod: Why do we seek the help of the Lord, the protection of the staff? And because he had sent apostles somewhat dumb and unprepared to preach, and the condition of masters seemed hard, he tempered the severity of the command with the following sentiment, saying: The worker is worthy of his food. Only, he said, take what is necessary for you in food and clothing. And the Apostle also repeats: Having food and clothing, let us be content with these (I Tim. VI, 8). And in another place: Let him who is being catechized communicate the word to him who is catechizing him in all good things (Galat. VI, 6): so that those who reap spiritual things may make them companions of their carnal things: not in greed, but in necessity. We have said these things historically. However, according to the anagoge, it is not permitted for teachers to possess gold and silver, and money that is in belts. We often read about gold in terms of its value; silver, in terms of its use in conversation; copper, in terms of its sound. These things we are not allowed to receive from others, but to possess them as gifts from the Lord. Nor are we to embrace the teachings of heretics, philosophers, or false doctrines that are weighed down by the world, nor should we have two minds or allow our feet to be bound by deadly chains. Instead, as we enter the holy land, we are to be naked; we are not to have a staff that turns into a snake or rely on any support from the flesh. For this kind of staff and stick is made of reeds, and if you press on it even a little, it will break and pierce the hand of the one leaning on it.
