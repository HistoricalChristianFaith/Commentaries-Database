"And I
returned and contemplated all the acts of oppression that are committed beneath
the sun: Behold! Tears of the oppressed with none to comfort them, and their
oppressors have the power - with none to comfort them. "After considering this I turned my eyes and attention
to this, so that I saw the slanderers and those sustaining chicanery. And look on those who, oppressed unjustly by
more powerful men, are not able to find a comforter for their tears. For this is only permitted in disasters and
in protest at the ill will of the matter. 
And wherever there is more distress and inconsolable suffering they see
the slanderers as stronger in their difficulties. And this is the cause: because they are not
worthy of consolation. He describes this
idea more fully in the seventy-second psalm of David, and Jeremiah in his own
book.
