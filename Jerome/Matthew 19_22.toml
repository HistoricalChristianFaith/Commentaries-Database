But because he had styled Him Good Master, and had not confessed Him as God, oras the Son of God, He tells him, that in comparison of God there is no saint tobe called good, of whom it is said, “Confess unto the Lord, for he is good;.
For Our Saviour does not reject this witness to His goodness, but corrected theerror of calling Him Good Master apart from God.
Hieron. cont. Vigilant., 15: That Vigilantius asserts that they who retain theuse of their property, and from time to time divide their incomes among the poor, do better than they who sell their possessions and lavish them in one actof charity, to him, not I, but God shall make answer, If thou wilt be perfect, "Go and sell.” That which you so extol, is but the second or third grade; which we indeed admit, only remembering that what is first is to be set before what is third or second.
For many who leave their riches do not therefore follow the Lord; and it is notsufficient for perfection that they despise money, unless they also follow the Saviour, that unless having forsaken evil, they also do what is good. For it is easier to contemn the hoard than quit the propensity .Therefore it follows, “And come and follow me;” for he follows the Lord who is his imitator, and who walks in his steps. It follows, “And when the young man had heard these words, he went away sorrowful.” This is the sorrow that leads to death. And the cause of his sorrowis added, “for he had great possessions,” thorns, that is, and briars, which choked the holy leaven.
