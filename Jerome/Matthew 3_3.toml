He prepared the souls of believers in whom the Lord would walk, so he might walk in purity along the purest of paths, saying, “I will live in them and move among them, and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.”

(Verse 3.) For this is he who is spoken of by the prophet Isaiah, saying: 'The voice of one crying out in the wilderness, prepare the way of the Lord, make straight his paths.' He was preparing the souls of the believers, in whom the Lord was going to walk, to walk in the purest ways, saying: 'I will dwell in them and walk among them, and I will be their God, and they shall be my people' (Leviticus 26:12). Porphyry compares this passage to the beginning of the Gospel of Mark, where it is written: 'The beginning of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, as it is written in the prophet Isaiah: Behold, I send my angel before your face, who will prepare your way.' The voice of one crying in the wilderness: Prepare the way of the Lord, make straight his paths. (Isa. XL, 3). For even though the testimony is from Malachi (Chap. III) and connected to Isaiah, it is asked how we can consider it as an example taken from one Isaiah. This question was answered fully by learned scholars. However, we think that the name of Isaiah was added by mistake of the scribes, which we can also prove in other places, or certainly from the fact that different testimonies of the Scriptures have become one body. Read the thirteenth Psalm, and you will find the same.
