(Verse 31.) And he healed them, so that the crowds marveled, seeing the mute speaking, the lame walking, the blind seeing; and they glorified the God of Israel. Concerning the mute, he remained silent, for he had nothing to say in opposition. This is accomplished with one word. Now let us consider the fact that the healed daughter of the Canaanite woman returned to Judea, and to the Sea of Galilee, and went up to the mountain; and like a bird calling its young to fly, she beckoned them, and there she sat, and the crowds gathered around her, bringing with them various afflictions; and after he healed them, he gave them food; and when this work was completed, he got into a boat, and came to the region of Magadan. And ascending the mountain, he sat there: and the crowds approached him. Notice that the mute, the lame, and the blind are led to the mountain, so that they may be healed by the Lord.
