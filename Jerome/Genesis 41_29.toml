(Verse 29.) Behold, seven years of great abundance are coming in all the land of Egypt. I wonder how the Hebrew word () Sabee, which we translated above as abundance or satiety, in reference to the well that the servants of Isaac dug, can now be translated most accurately as oath when we use the Seventy (Septuagint) translation. Both oath and seven and satiety and abundance can be understood as the context and order demand. But also in subsequent places, wherever abundance is mentioned, the same word is written in Hebrew.
