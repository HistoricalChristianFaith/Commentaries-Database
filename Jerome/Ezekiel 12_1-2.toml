(Chapter 12, Verses 1 et seq.) And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: Son of man, you dwell in the midst of a rebellious house: they have eyes to see, and do not see: and ears to hear, and do not hear: because they are a rebellious house. Because we translate it as: You dwell in the midst of a rebellious house, the LXX (Septuagint) has put: You dwell in the midst of their iniquities. But from what follows, Because they are a rebellious house, we understand that the preceding sentence also agrees with this verse. Furthermore, we learn from frequent teaching that in the midst of a house turning to bitterness, you, who by nature make God sweet and kind, make him bitter and cruel with the bitterness of your vices. Otherwise, we read about God: Taste and see that the Lord is sweet or pleasant (Psalm 33:9). But the prophet dwells in the midst of the people who provoke God to bitterness, who has eyes but does not see, ears but does not hear, not due to a defect of the senses, but due to the obstinacy of wickedness. And so the Lord said to the Jews: If you were blind, you would not have sin (John 9:41): accusing and condemning their voluntary blindness. Therefore, since they have eyes to see, but do not see; ears to hear, but do not hear; and they despise your words, teach them through images and pictures; and show them with visible examples, that they may recognize the impending captivity not only by hearing, but also by their eyes.
