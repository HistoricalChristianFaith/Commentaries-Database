(Chapter 21, verses 1 onwards) And when he drew near to Jerusalem and came to Bethphage, to the Mount of Olives, then Jesus sent two disciples, saying to them, 'Go into the village opposite you, and immediately you will find a donkey tied, and a colt with her. Untie them and bring them to me. If anyone says anything to you, you shall say, 'The Lord needs them,' and he will send them at once.' He went out of Jericho, with a multitude following him, and many blind people were healed, and he approached Jerusalem, greatly enriched with merchandise. The greeting of the believers was returned, he desired to enter the city of peace and the site of God's vision, and the fortress of the watchtower. And when he was approaching Jerusalem, and had come to Bethphage to the house of the jaws (which was a village of the priests, and bore the type of confession; and it was situated on the mount of Olives, where the light of knowledge, where the rest of labors and sorrows), he sent two of his disciples, the contemplative and the active, that is, knowledge and work, to enter the fortress. And he said to them: Go into the fortress that is opposite you. For it was opposite to the apostles, and he did not want to accept the yoke of teachings. And immediately, he says, you will find a donkey tied, and a colt with her: untie them and bring them to me. The donkey was tied with many chains of sins. The colt, too, was wild and impatient with the reins, as according to the Gospel of Luke (Chapter 19), it had many owners, not subject to one error and doctrine: and yet many owners who claimed illegal power for themselves, seeing the true Lord and his servants who had been sent to untie, dared not resist. We will explain what a female donkey is, and the offspring of a female donkey, in the following sections.
