(Verse 11.) But Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor asked him, saying: Are you the king of the Jews? The Jews accuse Jesus of impiety, because they were not even able to find anything false to accuse the Savior.

Jesus said to him: You say so. Thus he answered so as to speak the truth and not reveal his speech to calumny. And notice that although Pilate, who unwillingly pronounced the sentence, answered in part: yet he did not want to answer the priests and rulers, considering them unworthy of his speech.
