(Verse 14.) And I will make you a desert; and what follows: and a reproach to the nations that are around you, which is not found in the Septuagint: for which they added from their own, and your daughters in your vicinity. And again, according to both editions, in the sight of all passing by. However, it is beneficial for Jerusalem to be destroyed by all its vices, and to be brought to a desert, and to recognize its own sins, so that what should have been an example of virtues to other nations may be an example of miseries. But we can understand his daughters, the cities or villages, or the Churches dispersed throughout the whole world, so that whoever is a pilgrim of this world may say with the Psalmist: I am a stranger and a sojourner like all my fathers (Ps. 38:12); and regarding whom it is said: Those who pass by say not: The blessing of the Lord be upon you (Ps. 129:8), let him see his disgrace and mourn.
