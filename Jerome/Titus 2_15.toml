Speak these things, and exhort, and rebuke with all authority. He has set out three things: speak, exhort, and rebuke. And indeed, in what he says, "speak," it seems to refer to teaching. But what he introduced, "exhort," that is, παρακάλει, means something else in Greek than in Latin: for παράκλησις sounds more like comfort than exhortation. This word was also spoken of earlier concerning young people: Likewise, comfort the young, be modest in everything. About this we have expressed it in its place as it is read in Latin, as if it was written to exhort. Therefore, he comforts the listener who says: "For Christ, we beseech you, be reconciled to God" (1 Cor. 5:20), and humbles and submits himself, in order to gain whom he comforts. But as for the third, rebuke, it seems to me contrary to consolation, so that whoever despises consolation is worthy of rebuke and deserves to hear, 'You have forgotten the consolation that speaks to you as sons.' To Timothy we also read of one consolation and another rebuke, as the Apostle says, 'Be urgent in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort' [2 Tim. 4:2]. And there rebuke is taken up beforehand, and afterward severity is tempered by consolation. Here, however, he wants to console his disciples beforehand, and if they do not profit by consoling, then to rebuke them, and to rebuke them with all authority. For I interpret this to mean, 'Rebuke with all authority,' so that it is referred specially to rebuke, and not to the two preceding points in general. For it is not fitting to say, 'Console with all authority,' or 'Speak with all authority,' but only 'rebuke with all authority.'

Let no one despise you. Someone might think that this now written to Titus is the same as what was said to Timothy: Let no one despise your youth (1 Tim. IV, 14). But we, according to the differences of the Greek language, think that one thing signifies περιφρονείτω, which is written here, and another thing καταφρονείτω, which was said to Timothy, and the prepositions περὶ or κατὰ make a different meaning. And that it is not by chance or as he pleases that the Apostle Paul uses not only different names and words, but also different prepositions for the variety of causes, can be made clear from what he says: For the woman is of the man, and man by the woman (2 Cor. XI, 12). Elsewhere: For from him and through him and in him are all things (Rom. XI, 36). Also that, Paul an apostle not of men, neither by man (Galat. I, 1). Therefore, we consider καταφρόνησιν to properly pertain to contempt or when someone, stretched out between a horse and a rack, disregards pain and is not afraid of the judge's threat or the people's outcry, but for the confession of martyrdom, despises and disregards all punishments. On the other hand, there is a bad contempt which Habakkuk also testifies, speaking in the Holy Spirit: Look at the contemptuous, and behold, and wonder and perish (Hab. I, 5). According to what we have also written to Timothy: Let no man despise thy youth (1 Tim. IV, 12), that is, I do not want you to be seen such that you could be despised by anyone for merit. However, contempt as it is expressed, as the Stoics assert, who distinguish words subtly, wherein one who trusts himself, thinking himself better than another, despises someone whom he considers inferior and determines that he, that is, more knowledgeable, should be held in contempt. Such a thing, swelling with the vanity of pride and despising even the sky and sun, some Greeks have said in jest: Ἀεροβατῶ καὶ περιφρονῶ τὸν ἥλιον, which can be translated in Latin as, "I walk on air, and I am worth more than the sun." Therefore, contempt, which is now placed before Titus, has this meaning: No one among those who are in the churches should live this way while you are being idle, thinking that they are better. For what kind of disciple-building will exist if one considers oneself greater than the teacher? Hence, bishops, presbyters, and deacons should not only take great care that they should precede all the people to whom they preside in conduct and speech: indeed, lower ranks, exorcists, readers, doorkeepers, and all in general who serve the House of God. For the idea that the laypeople should be better than the clergy greatly destroys the Church of Christ.
