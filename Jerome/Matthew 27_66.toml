It was not enough for the Chief Priests to have crucified the Lord the Saviour, if they did not guard the sepulchre, and do their utmost to lay hands on Him asHe rose from the dead. But as Caiaphas prophesied without knowing it, that “it is expedient that one man should die for the people,” so now, Christ was a deceiver , not from truth into error, but leading men from error to truth, from vices to virtue, from death to life.
