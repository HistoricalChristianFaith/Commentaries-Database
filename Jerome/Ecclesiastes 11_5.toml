"As you do not know what is the way of the
spirit, nor how the bones do grow in the womb of her that is with child: even
so you know not the works of God who makes all. 
"Just as you do
not know the way of the spirit and of the soul entering a child, and are
unknowing of the types of bone and veins in the stomach of a pregnant
woman. It is hard to know how the human
body is formed from the simplest elements into the many varied forms and limbs,
and from the very same seed, one makes soft our hair, another makes our bones
hard; one connects the veins, another links the nerves together. Thus you cannot know the work of God, who has
made all things. From this he teaches
that the variety of things in the world must not be feared, and you must not
fear the winds and the clouds, which as we have mentioned above must be
judged. But although the sower ought to
reap in the course of his career, he ought to save the outcome for the
judgement of the Lord. " "
