Although it is a token of humility to call oneself “the least of all the saints,” one is guilty of deceit if one conceals the truth in the heart and says something else with the tongue. We must therefore look for an argument showing how Paul truly was “the least of all the saints” and yet did not fall from the rank of an apostle. The Lord says in the Gospel. “He who would be great among you, let him be less than all.” … Paul demonstrates this in his actions. … Therefore the apostle Paul was meekest of all who sought to be weak on Christ’s account.… Because of this humility, amazing grace was given to him. In this way he became “the least of all the saints” in order “to preach the unsearchable mysteries of God.”

Unsearchable and hidden can be given two senses. The riches were previously unable to be searched out. They are now laid open after the Lord’s passion. Another sense, perhaps even better: Those things which by nature were unsearchable to humanity are the ones that have been made known by God’s revelation.
