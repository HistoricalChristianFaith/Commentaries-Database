(Verse 18, 19) And it shall come to pass in that day, that the LORD shall hiss for the fly that is in the uttermost part of the rivers of Egypt, and for the bee that is in the land of Assyria. And they shall come, and shall rest all of them in the desolate valleys, and in the holes of the rocks, and upon all thorns, and upon all bushes. In the same day shall the Lord shave with a razor that is hired, namely, by them beyond the river, by the king of Assyria, the head, and the hair of the feet: and it shall also consume the beard. Therefore, you are in vain afraid of present but half-burnt towers, which have no fire within. For you must know that by its hiss the Lord signifies the flies of Egypt and its rivers, with no doubt seven channels of the Nile, which are about to be called forth. And he signifies the bee, which is in the land of Assyria. But he calls the flies of Egypt on account of the filth of idolatry and the weak people. And he calls the bee Assyrians, whose kingdom was most powerful at that time, and were very ready for war. Either because all the region of the Assyrians and Persians used bows, or because they had access to them all the time. Therefore, all will come and occupy your land in the torrents of the valleys, and in the caves of rocks, and in all the fruits, and in the holes, and in the wooded groves. However, these things are said by metaphor, so that because he had mentioned flies and bees once, he would maintain consistency in the translation of the rest. Let us read the books of Kings and Chronicles, and we will find that the holy king Josiah was killed by the Egyptians, and the people of Israel were subjugated to the power of Egypt (2 Kings 23; 2 Chronicles 35): so that he would appoint a king for them. And after not much time, Nebuchadnezzar came with an innumerable multitude of warriors, captured Jerusalem, and destroyed the other cities of Judaea. He burned down the Temple and placed Assyrian inhabitants in Judaea.
