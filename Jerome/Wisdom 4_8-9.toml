If it is said of the righteous person and of the member of the church, “Gray hair is a person’s wisdom,” why is it not said of the heretic’s iniquity, “A person’s gray hair is his folly”? Of this old age Daniel said to the old man, “You have grown old in evil.” Therefore, in the book of the Shepherd (if anyone is willing to accept that it be read), the church appears to Hermas first with gray hair, then as a young woman and a bride, with ornate hair.
