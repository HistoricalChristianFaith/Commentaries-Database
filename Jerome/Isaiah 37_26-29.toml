This is directed from the person of God against the words of Assyria, to whose blasphemy the Lord responds thus: “Do you not know that you did this with my permission? Do you not know that I predict the future and command that certain things be done through you? Hence, what I decreed long ago is being fulfilled at this time: that the hills (that is, princes who fight among themselves) and the fortified cities will be shaken and eradicated, and will perish when I withdraw my hand and offer them none of the assistance to which they have grown accustomed. They were also compared not to olive groves and vineyards and fruitful trees but to straw and turf, to roof grass, all of which impede fruitfulness and wither before they reach maturity. In this way I have also foreknown your sitting down and your going out and your coming in, and I predicted through the prophets the insanity with which you would rage against me. Through these I knew long ago that you would say, ‘I will ascend to heaven; I will set my throne above the stars of heaven, and I will be like the Most High.’ Thus, your anger and your pride have reached my ears, and I will bear you no longer, that you may understand that you are not capable by your own strength but by my will. For the impious Gentiles and the unfruitful trees deserved to be cut down and felled through you, as though you were my axe and saw. Hence, I put a ring or a bit in your nostrils to restrain your verbal blasphemy, that you would dare to speak such things no more. I will also place a bridle on your lips to tame your ferocity and to lead you back to Egypt.” Scripture employs the same imagery in the Psalms against the impious: “Constrain their jaws with a bit and bridle, that they not approach you.”

(Verse 26 and following) Have you not heard what I did to him in the past? From ancient times I formed it, and now I have brought it forth, and it has become a ruin of the hills that fight against me, and of fortified cities. The inhabitants of those cities were brought low, they trembled and were confused. They became like the grass of the field, and the green herb, and the roof grass that withered before it could mature. I have seen your dwelling place, your going out and your coming in, and your rage against me, when you raged against me. Your pride reaches my ears, so I will put a hoop in your nostrils and a bit in your lips, and I will bring you back on the path from which you came. These words are to be understood from the perspective of God in response to the blasphemy of the Assyrians: Do you not know that what you have done, you have done by my will, and that I have foretold these things, and commanded you to do them through you? Therefore, what I decreed long ago has been fulfilled in its time, that the hills, that is, the rulers who were previously fighting among themselves, and the heavily fortified cities, by my strengthening of my hand and without providing assistance as usual, would be uprooted and tremble and perish, and instead of olives and vineyards, and fruitful trees, there would be grass and weeds, and plants that are beaten down by hay and wither before reaching maturity. Therefore, I have known both your sitting down and your going out and your coming in beforehand, and the madness with which you were about to rage against me, as prophesied by the prophets. I spoke through them, knowing that you alone would declare, 'I will ascend into heaven, I will set my throne above the stars of heaven, and I will be like the Most High.' Therefore, your fury and your pride have reached my ears, and I will no longer bear you so that you may understand that you were able to act not by your own power, but by my will. For impious nations and unfruitful trees were deserving that they be cut down and fall by you, like my axe and saw. Therefore, I will place a circle or a bridle in your nostrils, so that I may restrain blasphemy from your mouth, and you may not dare to speak such things again; and I will apply a bridle to your lips, which will tame your ferocity and bring you back to the Assyrians. With this translation, the Scripture also uses it in the Psalms against the wicked: Put a bridle and a halter on their jaws, who do not come near you (Ps. 31:12).
