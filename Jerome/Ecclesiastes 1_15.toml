"A
twisted thing cannot be made straight, and what is not there cannot be
numbered. "Whoever is wicked cannot be corrected,
unless he was corrected beforehand. 
Anything that is already correct will receive embellishment; and that
which is deviated will receive correction. 
A man is not called wrong unless he has been diverted from the correct
path. This is contrary to the heretics,
who entertained certain characteristics, which do not seem to be sane. And since what is missing is lacking, it
cannot be numbered. Besides, only the
firstborn of Israel were counted. The
women, slaves, children and the people from Egypt, although of a great number,
were largely overlooked, being referred to as a reduction from the army,
without a number. The meaning of this
can also be: such wickedness is done in the sphere of the world that the world
is scarcely able to return to its completely good condition; nor is it able to
regain easily its order and complete state, in which it was first created. Another meaning of this is: when all men have
been restored to goodness through repentance, only the devil will remain in his
wickedness. For all things which are
done under the sun are done by his will and in the spirit of malevolence, while
sins are piled on sins at his instigation. 
Then it can also mean: so great is the number of deviants and of those
who have been taken away from God's flock by the devil that it is impossible to
count them.
