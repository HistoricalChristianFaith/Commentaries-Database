(Vers. 44 seqq.) «And outside the front gate of the cantor's treasury in the inner courtyard, which was on the side of the gate facing the north, their faces were towards the south: one on the side of the eastern gate, which faced the way of the north. And he said to me: This is the treasury that faces the southern way of the priests, who keep watch in the temple's guardrooms. Furthermore, the treasury that faces the way of the north will be for the priests who serve at the altar: these are the sons of Zadok who come near from the sons of Levi to the Lord, to minister to Him. And he measured the porch of the temple by the length of one hundred cubits, and the width of one hundred cubits, square: and the altar that was before the temple: and he brought me into the porch of the temple, and he measured the porch five cubits on this side, and five cubits on that side: and the breadth of the gate three cubits on this side, and three cubits on that side. And the length of the porch was twenty cubits, and the breadth eleven cubits, and there were steps to it: and pillars before the gates one on this side, and another on that side. Regarding the treasuries, the Seventy translated them as exedrae. And what we called exedrae, or the treasuries of the singers, was omitted by them. And again, after the measurement of the vestibule of five cubits on this side and five cubits on that side, they added from their own, and the width of the gate was fourteen cubits, whereas in the Hebrew it is only mentioned as a width of twelve cubits, and the width of the gate on this side was three cubits, and on that side was three cubits. I have reminded the reader not to be confused by the diversity of translations, but to be satisfied with the Hebrew truth in this particular place, especially when it comes to the measurements of the temple. Therefore, after the wall, which the Seventy translated as the περίβολον, which surrounded the whole temple in a square circuit, we read that the prophet was introduced into the inner courtyard, and then to the north, and to the south, and to the Eastern Gate, and again to the north: concerning which, as we were able, we have spoken, and in the diversity of which, either of names or of measurements, the past discourse showed what seemed to us: the meaning of which the testimony of the Savior briefly shows, saying: In my Father's house there are many mansions (John 14:2). After completing these things, he enters the temple, that is, the Holy of Holies, of which it is now said, and within the inner gate, the treasuries, or the singing halls. To them is given this command: Sing to the Lord a new song (Psalm 95:1). They cry out with the angels: Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace to people of good will (Luke 2:14). This inner courtyard was situated on the side of the gate that faced the North, the South, and the East, so that the singers of the Lord, and those who are engaged in the ministry of angels, may always remember by which steps they have reached the highest, and diligently understand the mysteries of each place. Finally, that man whose pen and cord were in his hand, having led the prophet into the inner courtyard which overlooked the southern road, spoke these words: 'This is the treasury or council chamber; and as Theodotius set it up, the chamber, which is separated for the dwelling of the priests, is for the observation of the temple guards. Furthermore, the treasury which overlooks the northern road will belong to the priests who stand guard at the service of the altar.' In which it should be noted that the priests to whom the custody of the temple has been entrusted dwell in the treasury, which faces the south, where the fullest light is. But those who stand guard at the ministry of the altar, where victims are offered for sin, should be in the treasury facing the north, for those who come from the north and offer victims for sins, desiring to receive and save them. Both of these, serving the Lord in their respective duties, are called the sons of Zadok, which means righteous or justifying. For God, the Almighty, whose name is written: The Lord is righteous and loves justice; His face has seen equity (Psalm 11: 8). But these are the sons of Sadoc of the sons of Levi, which is interpreted as 'assumed'. And they themselves are assumed by the Lord, so that they may approach Him, and never is it said of Moses alone: Moses approached the Lord; but also all who serve and minister to Him are said to draw near to the Lord. But this man who introduced Ezekiel into the inner courtyard, and so to speak, into the Holy of Holies, measured the courtyard itself, in which there were two chambers or treasuries assigned to the guards of the temple or the dwelling places of the altar, and he found it to be two hundred cubits in length and breadth: so that the priests of God who serve in the ministry, who had entered through a narrow and tight path, may have wide walkways and dwell in a perfect and complete number of virtues. And in the very courtyard there was an altar in front of the face of the temple, so that the prayers of the saints never ceased before God. Moreover, the aforementioned man led Ezekiel into the vestibule, or πρόπυλον of the temple, which measured five cubits on each side, for the one who was brought in had been trained in divine understanding and knew neither right nor left, but entered by the royal way. The width of the gate itself, which was the entrance to the vestibule of the temple, was three cubits on each side. In the elegant observance of the Holy Scriptures, it is not said from the right or the left, lest anything be named left in the Holy of Holies, but from this side and that side, that is, from both sides. And immediately the discerning reader understands that the number three relates to the mystery of the Trinity, which is the gate for those who approach God, for the Father is in the Son, and the Son is in the Father, and the Holy Spirit is in both. This number three is the gate for those who, after baptism in the Trinity, come to salvation. But what follows, the length of the vestibule is twenty cubits, and the width is eleven cubits, seems to raise the question of how the dual number, which refers to two decades, and the eleventh, which seems to have one less, can be said to complete the sacred number twelve in the temple vestibule. Most people solve this problem in the following way: Although the priests are holy and placed in the service of the temple, and offer daily sacrifices to Christ, because they dwell in this mortal and fragile body, subject to sickness and vice, they have the number twenty and eleven. Where was it that the Apostle said, 'Wretched man that I am, who will deliver me from this body of death' (Rom. VII, 24)? Not that we believe, according to the most savage heresy, that bodies are to be destroyed; but that it is our desire to be clothed upon, not stripped, and to receive immortality with this mortal, and to put on incorruption with this corruptible. However, what follows, 'And it was ascended by eight steps' (I Cor. XV), that is, to the inner gate, presents a great difficulty for those who know the Hebrew language. Finally, Symmachus, whom we have followed in this place, set out eight degrees: Seventy, ten; Theodotion and the second edition of Aquila, eleven; but the first edition set no number, but simply said, and the degrees by which it was ascended to it: so that either according to the custom of the previous gates, we understand eight degrees, as Symmachus understood, or certainly those which the inner gate had, whose number Scripture did not say (for which in Hebrew it is placed, Urob (), that is, breadth, Aste (), Esre (). But if it is read in this way, eleven signifies; but if we read 'Esre,' which means ten, without the final 's,' it does not signify ten but a pronoun (which). To experts in the Hebrew language, these may seem like delusions; but now we are not writing about controversies or speeches in which the composition of words is commonly used, but about explanations and commentaries on Hebrew books. But let us return to our task. The number eight or ten, which is a perfect number, or eleven, about which we have already spoken, is ascended to the gate of the holy ones, on the front of which there were columns, one on this side and another on that side. He did not say 'two' so as not to incur the number dual, but 'one and one', which is a perfect number, and imitates the unity of God. These, however, were two columns, of which it is also said in the Apocalypse: 'He who conquers, I will make him a pillar in the temple of my God, and he shall go out no more' (Rev. 3:12). And Peter and John are called the pillars of the Church (Gal. 2), through whom we enter into the Holy of Holies, and by whose teaching our entrance to Christ is made.
