Note exactly what the psalmist is saying: “And does justice.” Now, the Holy Spirit did not say, one who practices chastity, who applies wisdom, who exercises fortitude. Yet these are excellent virtues indeed. Wisdom, for example, is of great advantage to us; fortitude is valuable in resisting persecution; finally, temperance and chastity are indispensable in preventing us from losing our souls. Justice alone is the great virtue and the mother of them all. Someone may ask, “How is justice greater than all the other virtues?” The other virtues gratify the one who possesses them; justice does not give pleasure to the one possessing it but instead pleases others. If I am wise, wisdom delights me; if I am brave, my fortitude comforts me; if I have been chaste, my chastity is my joy. On the contrary, justice does not benefit the one who has it but all the wretched who do not have it. Suppose that some poor person has a quarrel with my brother; suppose that my brother is powerful and with his power crushes the other one, I mean, the stranger to me, the poor and wretched person. Of what avail is my wisdom to the poor person? Of what avail my courage? My chastity, how does it help the poor person? Justice is the virtue that benefits him, for I do not regard the person of my brother but judge according to truth. Justice knows no brother, it knows no father, it knows no other; it knows truth; it is not a respecter of persons; it imitates God.

This is a noble thing to say. Never, says the psalmist, has a neighbor murmured against him; never, he says, has he found occasion for his disparagement. This virtue is beyond … human power; it exists by the grace of God. “By whom the reprobate is despised.” Mark what it says: “By whom the reprobate is despised.” Even if he is an emperor, even if he is a governor, if he is a bishop, if he is a priest, … whoever he is, if he is evil, he is nothing in the sight of the saint.
