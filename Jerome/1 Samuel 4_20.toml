Read the Scriptures and you will never find holy women bearing children in pain, with the exception of Rachel, who, when she was on a journey and in the hippodrome, that is, in the course for horses which had been sold to Egypt, suffered while delivering her son, whom his father later called “son of the right hand.” Eve, when she was expelled from paradise and was told “You will bear children in pain,” is described as experiencing pain in childbirth. The wife of Phinehas, who was bent over and could not stand erect, like the woman whom the devil bound in the gospel, gave birth after she had heard that the ark of God was captured and her people were destroyed. But Sarah, because she was holy and postmenopausal, said to Isaac when he was born: “God has made laughter for me, for whoever hears about this will congratulate me.” The pains, therefore, which overcame the tower of the flock, are the pains of hell and the pains of death, which surrounded and attacked even the Savior but were never able to overtake him, as he himself says in - "Psalm 17:5: “The pains of death surrounded me and the torrents of evil shook me and the pains of hell attacked me.” Commentary on Micah 2.4"
