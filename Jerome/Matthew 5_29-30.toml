Therefore by the right eye and the right hand we must understand the love of brethren, husbands and wives, parents and kinsfolk; which if we find to hinder our view of the true light, we ought to sever from us.

Otherwise; As above He had placed lust in the looking on a woman, so now the thought and sense straying hither and thither He calls 'the eye.' By the right hand and the other parts of the body, He means the initial movements of desire and affection.

(Verse 29, 30.) And if your right eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one of your members than for your whole body to be thrown into hell. And if your right hand causes you to stumble, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one of your members than for your whole body to go into hell. For he had spoken earlier about a woman's desire, and now correctly referred to the wandering of thought and sense as an eye. On the right hand, as well as other parts of the body, the beginnings of the will and emotions are demonstrated: such as what we conceive in our minds, we accomplish in our actions. Therefore, we must be careful that what is best in us does not quickly turn into vice. For if the right eye and right hand cause stumbling, how much more those things that are on the left in us! For if the soul falters, how much more the body, which is inclined towards sin! Otherwise, in the right eye and in the right hand, the affections of brothers, wives, children, relatives, and close ones are shown, which if we see as an impediment to contemplate the true light, we must cut off such portions, so that while we desire to make others gain, we ourselves do not perish forever. Where is it said, concerning the high priest, whose soul is dedicated to the worship of God: 'He shall not defile himself for the dead among his people, except for his close relatives.' (Lev. 21:11), that is, he shall not experience any emotions except for those related to his dedication.
