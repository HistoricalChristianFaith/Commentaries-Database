"So what
I have seen to be good is that it is suitable to eat and drink and enjoy
pleasure with all one's labour that he toils beneath the sun during the brief
span of his life that God has given him, for that is his lot. Furthermore, every man to whom God has given
riches and possessions and has given him the power to enjoy them, possess his
share and be happy in his work: this is the gift of God. For he shall remember that the days of his
life are not many, while God provides him with the joy of his heart." This is in comparison to him, who consumes his wealth
in the darkness of his worries, and carries those things which are about to die
throughout the great tedium of his life, and says that that man is better, who
enjoys what he has. For here there is
but a small desire of enjoyment, but there in the latter indeed there is a
great magnitude of worries. He also
gives the reasons why the gift of God is to be able to enjoy riches. Since "he will not remember much of the
days of his life". For God turns
him to the happiness of his heart's desire: he will not be sad, he will not be
worried by thought, since he is led away by happiness and desire for present
things. But it is better understood as according to the apostle [Cf I Cor. 10, 2-4.],
seen as spiritual food and spiritual drink which is given by God and I
understood to see goodness in all of his toil, since we are only able to
consider true good things with great toil and enthusiasm. For what is permitted to be good, though,
until Christ appears in our life, is not yet openly considered good. And therefore God will not remember much of
the days of our life. We should also
note that here "perispasmos" is used in
a better way, in the place of the occupation of the spirit and true
happiness.
