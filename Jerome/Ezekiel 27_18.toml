(Verse 18.) Your Damascene merchant in the multitude of your works: in the abundance of different goods: in rich wine, in the finest wool. LXX: Your Damascene merchant in the multitude of your works, from the abundance of all your strength: wine from Helbon, and wool from Miletus. Regarding the rich wine, which Symmachus, Aquila, and Theodotion interpreted, and in the Hebrew text itself, it says, wine from Helbon. And again, when we settled ourselves in the best colored wool, both the Eagle and Theodotius transferred to the wool market of Soor. And it is significant that among the other trade of Tyre, the finest wine and the best wool were brought to its market from Damascus, which we still see today. But if Damascus is interpreted as drinking blood, and the true tradition of the Hebrews is that the field where Abel was killed by the fratricide Cain (Gen. IV) was in Damascus, from which the place derives its notable name, then rightly Paul went to Damascus after the killing of Stephen, the first martyr in Christ, in order to lead the believers in Christ as prisoners to Jerusalem. And by the mercy of God, who made the blind see and the sighted blind, he lost the eyes of the flesh so that he could receive the eyes of the mind. And scales fell from his eyes, with which he had lost the light of truth, so that he could go to the street that is called Straight and find Ananias, which is interpreted in our language as obedient (Acts IX). Therefore, from this land, which is called 'Cursed is the ground that opened its mouth to receive your brother's blood' (Gen. IV, 11), the Tyrians gather at the market, and there is rich wine and shining wool: either wine from Chelbon, which means milky. Seventy are for the best-colored wool, from Miletus, or Tyre, they say. Miletus is not found in Hebrew, but because the finest wool is brought from there, they have interpreted 'Soor' as Miletus. From this it is clear that Tyre feeds on the milk of infancy and does not have its own clothing, but rather obtains it from elsewhere and from various provinces. The interpretation of Damascus as 'the blood of Cilicia' and 'the blood of a kiss' does not fit the current context. Frequently, Hebrew names are interpreted in various ways due to the diversity of accents and the change of letters and vowels, especially those that have their own peculiarities among them.
