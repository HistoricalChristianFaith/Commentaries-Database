(Verse 5.) And this will be the peace: When the Assyrian comes into our land and treads on our houses. LXX: And this will be the peace; When the Assyrian comes and rises over your land and when he ascends over your region. When the devil comes, who is interpreted as 'accuser’, that is, accusing and reproving, over the land and region of the believers, and of those whom the Lord will feed in strength and in the exaltedness of the name of His Lord God, and he treads on them with various tribulations, and on the houses of our souls, that is, our bodies, as if he were proudly rising and pressing down, and yet nothing separates us from the love of Christ: then the peace of Christ, or Christ Himself, will be in us, and it will be said of the holy one, The enemy will not profit anything against him. Let us give an example, so that what we say can become more evident. An Assyrian came upon the land of Paul long ago, and he ascended above his territory, when he was in great difficulties; more abundant in afflictions, excessively in prisons, frequently in deaths: when he received forty-minus-one beatings from the Jews, he was beaten with rods three times, stoned once, shipwrecked three times, he was in the depths of the sea night and day, in dangers from robbers, in dangers from false brothers, in dangers from his own people, in dangers from gentiles; but in all these things he overcame because of him who loved him. And so he was filled with peace, because he had been filled with insults. (1 Corinthians 11) The Jews in the coming of Christ, which they pretend for themselves, contend that all these things will happen according to the letter.
