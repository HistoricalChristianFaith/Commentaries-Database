"Whatever
my eyes desired I did not deny them; I did not deprive myself of any joy. Indeed my heart drew joy from all my
activities, and this was my reward for all my endeavours. "The eyes of the heart and the sight of the mind desire
to gaze on spiritual matters, which the sinner does not see, so forbids his
heart from true happiness. Therefore
Ecclesiastes gave himself completely over to this cause and balanced eternal
glory lightly in an world of discord. 
This is our lot, and our continual reward if we work for our virtues.
