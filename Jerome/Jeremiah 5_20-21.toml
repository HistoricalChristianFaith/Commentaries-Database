(Verse 20, 21.) Announce this to the house of Jacob, and make it heard in Judah, saying: Hear, foolish people, who have no understanding: who have eyes but do not see, and ears but do not hear. In many ways they sin, turning away from salvation, and he calls the people foolish, who have abandoned the author of wisdom, and he compares them to idols, about which it is written: They have eyes but do not see: they have ears but do not hear. Let them be like those who make them, and all who trust in them (Psalm 115:5, 6). But he speaks specifically to Judah and the house of Jacob, for Israel had long rejoiced in Assyria. And at the same time, he gives the understanding that even without command, we should naturally understand what is right.
