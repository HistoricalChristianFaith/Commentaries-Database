(Verse 6) But when you pray, go into your room, close the door, and pray to your Father who is in secret. And your Father who sees in secret will reward you. This is simply understood, it teaches the listener to flee from vain glory in prayer. But it seems to me that this is more of a command, that we should pray to the Lord with our thoughts confined within our hearts and our lips closed, which we also read Anna did in the Book of Kings; Her lips, it says, were moving (1 Samuel 1:13).
