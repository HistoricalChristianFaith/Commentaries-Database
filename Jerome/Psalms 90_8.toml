“You have kept our iniquities before you.” Nothing eludes you; night does not conceal our sins, nor does the darkness cover them; all things are clear before you: “Our life in light of your scrutiny.” This is expressed much better in the Hebrew: “our hidden sins in the light of your scrutiny.” Whatever we do, whatever we think we are doing in secret, lies open before your eyes. “All our days have passed away.” Our life hurries on at a great pace, and when we least expect it, it slips away, and we die. These very words we speak are of death, and we do not take thought. “We have spent our years like a spider.” Meditate on these words of the psalmist. In the same way that the spider produces, as it were, a thread and runs to and fro, back and forth, and weaves the whole day long, and his labor, indeed, is great but the result is nil; so, too, human life runs about hither and thither. We search for possessions, and we accumulate wealth; we procreate children; we labor and toil; we rise in power and authority; we do everything; and do not realize that we are spiders weaving a web.
