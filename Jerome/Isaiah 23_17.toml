(Verse 17) And it will be, after seventy years, the Lord will visit Tyre, and He will restore it to its merchandise, and again it will commit fornication with all the kingdoms of the earth on the face of the earth. All these things are indicated by the consonant letters of the Greeks and the Phoenicians, that after seventy years, it was restored and returned to its former power, and it became a market for all nations, which I think are called fornications, just as one who commits fornication enters a brothel and gives a fee for immorality: in the same way, the instigator, coming together from the whole world, will fill the beauty of the city like that of a harlot.
