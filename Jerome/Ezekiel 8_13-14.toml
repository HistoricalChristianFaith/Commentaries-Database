(Verse 13, 14). And he said to me: You will still see greater abominations that they (or these) do. And he brought me through the entrance of the gate of the house of the Lord, which faced north; and behold, there were women sitting there, mourning for Adonis. Whom we interpret as Adonis, and in the Hebrew and Syriac languages is called Thamuz. Therefore, because according to the Gentile fable, in the month of June the lover of Venus and the most beautiful young man is killed, and it is narrated that he then revived, they also call the same month by the same name and celebrate an annual commemoration for him, in which he is mourned by women as if dead, and then praised and honored when he revives. And afterwards, when the leaders and elders of the house of Israel saw what had been done in the temple and in the dark chambers, even the vices of women are described, who lament in private the loss of their lovers and rejoice if they are able to obtain them. And because the same Gentile people subtly interpret such fables of poets, which have obscenity, as the killing and resurrection of Adonis, accompanied by lamentation and joy: the former of which he thinks is shown in the seeds that die in the earth, and the latter in the crops in which the dead seeds are reborn; we also call those women who are saddened or excited by the good and evil of the world, with a soft and effeminate spirit: and we say that they lament for Thammuz, namely, those things which are considered the most beautiful in worldly matters.
