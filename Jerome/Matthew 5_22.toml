(Verse 22) Because whoever is angry with his brother will be liable to judgment. In some manuscripts it is added, without cause: but in the true definitive sentence, anger is completely eliminated, as the Scripture says: Whoever is angry with his brother. For if we are commanded to offer the other cheek to the one who strikes us, and to love our enemies, and to pray for those who persecute us (Luke 6), all occasion for anger is removed. Therefore, without cause must be removed, because the anger of man does not produce the righteousness of God (James 1).



But whoever says to his brother, 'Raca,' shall be liable to the council. This word 'Raca' is properly of the Hebrews: for Raca signifies 'empty,' that is, foolish or senseless: which we can call a common insult, without a brain. If we are to give an account for idle words, how much more for an insult (Matthew 5:22)! But it is also distinctly added: Whoever says to his brother, 'Raca.' For our brother is no one else, unless he has the same Father as us. When someone believes in God in the same way and knows Christ as the wisdom of God (1 Cor. 1): by what means can it be indicated by the praise of foolishness?

But whoever says, 'You fool!' will be liable to the hell of fire. Ἀπὸ κοινοῦ ex superioribus subauditur: Whoever says to his brother, 'You fool!' will be liable to the hell of fire. For whoever says to a believer, 'You fool!' is impious in religion.
