(Verse 24, 25.) Behold, fortifications have been built against the city, in order to take it; and the city has been given into the hands of the Chaldeans, who fight against it with the sword, famine, and pestilence. And whatever you have spoken has happened, as you yourself see; and you say to me, Lord God, buy the field with silver, and have witnesses, when the city has been given into the hands of the Chaldeans? It was the tenth year of King Zedekiah, for thus it is written: The word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord in the tenth year of Zedekiah king of Judah: at that time the army of the king of Babylon was besieging Jerusalem, and Jeremiah the prophet was confined in the court of the prison. And rightly now it is said: Behold, the fortifications are built against the city, so that it may be captured; and the city has been delivered into the hands of the Chaldeans; they have neither whom to conquer nor whom to capture. For now they have been consumed by sword, famine, and pestilence; and we see that whatever you have said has been fulfilled; therefore why do you say to me, Lord: Buy a field for silver, and call witnesses; when the city has been delivered into the hands of the Chaldeans? Therefore, he does not reprimand, but he asks; and he wants to learn not so much for himself as for others, who were sitting in the courtyard of the prison; and perhaps they silently reprimanded, how the same prophet, whom they believed to proclaim the truth, could say that the city is to be captured and buy a field as if he were going to possess it.
