(Verse 19, 20) And one scribe, approaching, said to him: Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go. And Jesus says to him: Foxes have dens, and birds of the sky have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head. This scribe of the law, who knew only the letter that kills, if he had said: Lord, I will follow you wherever you go, he would not have been rejected by the Lord; but because he esteemed one teacher out of many, and was a learner of letters, which is more significantly said in Greek, γραμματεὺς, and not a spiritual hearer: therefore, he has no place where Jesus can lay his head. Now, it is shown to us, and because of this the scribe is rejected, that he, seeing the greatness of the signs, wanted to follow the Savior in order to seek profit from the miracles of his works, desiring the same thing that Simon Magus wanted to buy from Peter (Acts 8). Therefore, such a faith is rightfully condemned by the Lord's judgment and it is said to him: Why do you desire to follow me because of riches and the profits of the world, when I am of such great poverty that I don't even have a small shelter and I don't use my own roof?
