In the Septuagint “listen to me” is said twice to teach us that we ought to listen with the ears of our body and with the understanding of our soul.… For “tribe,” as we have translated, Theodotion has “race,” Symmachus “people” and the Septuagint “kings.” For we are a tribe and line and a royal, priestly race of the Lord, such as was Abraham, who was called “king,” and the rest of the saints, concerning whom it is written, “touch not my christs.”
