(Verse 9.) And behold, Jesus met them, saying: Greetings. Those who were searching, those who were running in this manner, deserved to meet the risen Lord, and first to hear, Greetings: so that the curse of the woman Eve would be overturned in women.

But they drew near and held his feet, and adored him. These came near and held his feet, because they adored him. But she, who sought the living among the dead, and still did not know that the Son of God had risen, rightly hears: Do not touch me, for I have not yet ascended to my Father (John 20:17).
