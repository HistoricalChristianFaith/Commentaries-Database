Hard as were the hearts of the Jews in unbelief, they yet perceived that the Lord's sentence was directed against themselves.

(Verse 45, 46.) And when the chief priests and Pharisees heard his parables, they realized that he was speaking about them. And they sought to arrest him, but they feared the crowds because they regarded him as a prophet. Though they had hard hearts and were dull in their disbelief and impiety towards the Son of God, they could not deny the clear accusations, and they understood that all of the Lord's judgments were directed against them. Therefore, they indeed wanted to kill him, but they feared the crowds because they regarded him as a prophet. The crowd is always fickle, and does not persist in a fixed will: it is like the waves, being carried back and forth by the force of different winds. They now venerate and worship him as if he were a prophet, but later they shout against him: Crucify him, crucify such a person (John 19:6).
