He calls them blind because they were not yet able to say, “By your light we shall see the light.” They were ignorant of Christ’s way. They apparently had some knowledge of the law, however inadequately conceived. Some propose a spiritual interpretation here: that the two blind men are to be understood as the Pharisees and Sadducees. Others view one of them as symbolizing the people following natural law without Christ, hence blind, and the other as symbolizing people following the written law of the old covenant in a blinded way. In any event, they were not able to see for themselves. Yet they heard the announcement of the Savior’s coming. They proclaimed him Son of David.But let us suppose that each of the two blind men is blind with respect to the people of the Jews. What might it mean that the crowd rebuked them? It could suggest that the Gentile crowd was rebuking the Jews. Thus let us remember that the apostle advises those of us who are Gentiles not to boast or be haughty against our own roots in the old covenant. For we were the wild olive tree grafted on to a good olive tree. So in no way should we begrudge the salvation of the prior people of the covenant, the Jews.
