(Verse 15, 16.) And they shall devour and subject to stones of slings: and drinking, they shall be intoxicated as with wine (Vulgate: with wine), and shall be filled like bowls and like the horns of the altar, and the Lord their God shall save them in that day as the flock of his people, because holy stones shall be lifted up upon his land. LXX: And they shall consume them, and bury them in stones of slings, and they shall drink their blood like wine, and they shall be filled like the bowls of the altar, and the Lord shall save them on that day as his flock, because holy stones shall roll on his land. For what we have said, they will be exalted, and it is written in Hebrew, Methnosasoth (), can be interpreted as wandering or fleeing. With the children of Zion protected, and the Lord singing, and going in a whirlwind against their adversaries, the destruction of the Greeks will be so great that I will not say by swords, but they will be crushed by the throwing of stones and the rotations of catapults, so that they will be spoils and food for their enemies. Then they will be drunk as if with wine. Not those who have been killed, but they will be drunk with their own blood; but those who conquer will fight as if drunk with desperation, and they will please the Lord like the horns of the altar, and their libation. For this is understood in the bowls, in which the offerings are poured out on the altar. The Lord will also save them like sheep and the flock of his people: for he will not fight like an armed and trained army against the Macedonians; but he will come like a flock prepared for death, and with the help of the Lord, he will prevail. And the holy stones that were oppressed (for they are called stones, on account of the hardness of trials and the courage of the soul) shall be lifted up from their humility, and they shall be on the land of his glory. Otherwise: his holy stones of the priestly race fleeing in different directions, with him granting them victory, shall attain it, let us say, according to the anagoge, nay, let us explain the prophecy enveloped in many obscurities. The sons of Zion, protected by their Lord, shall devour their adversaries, whom we understand to be the sons of Greece. And they shall subject them to stones of slings, and menaces of Scriptures, making their adversaries subject and humble: for nothing strikes so much as an example from the holy Scriptures, and a testimony emitted by the rotation of the mouth. But what is said in the Septuagint: And they shall drink their blood like wine, we do not read thus in Hebrew; but they shall be drunken with wine, so that they may hear that from the Song of Songs: Drink, O friends, and be intoxicated (Song of Songs 5:1). And so their drunkenness will please them, like a sacrificial altar; and like the horns or angles of an altar. The Lord will also save them, like a flock of his people, for the holy stones will roll upon his land, which will be so light and shining that they will not wait for the hands of builders, but will themselves hasten to be placed upon the foundation of Christ, and to be held by the corner stone, of which even the Apostle Peter speaks: 'You yourselves, as living stones, are being built into a spiritual house, to be a holy priesthood, offering spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God.' (I Peter 2:5). These are the stones that will cry out if the people of Judah keep silent (Luke XIX), and they will roll as long as they are on earth, for earthly dwelling weighs down the senses that attend to many cares (Wisdom IX), and the Holy One, who is in the flesh, speaks: Who will give me wings like a dove? (Psalm LIV, 7) Whoever is able, strives and rolls; and is lifted up to the heights, but is held back by the frailty of the flesh. And that earth on which the stones roll is the one of which we read: Sing to the Lord, all the earth (Psalm XCV, 1). And let all the earth adore you and sing to you (Ps. 65:4).
