(Verse 25.) With impending distress, they will seek peace, and it will not be. This cannot possibly be reconciled with the Septuagint. For if propitiation comes, how will they seek peace and not find it? But he who has heard from the apostles will seek peace and not find it, for he has not kept it in his mind, nor has he made it rest, but driven away by wicked deeds, he cannot find it. Indeed, peace is that which surpasses all understanding, and which the victorious Savior, ascending to the Father, left to the apostles.
