The scribes and Pharisees have the knowledge of the prophets and of the law. They know that Christ is the Son of God. They are not ignorant that he was born of the Virgin. Yet they did not seek to serve the people to whom they were accountable. They themselves were not entering the kingdom of heaven, nor did they permit others who were able to do so. Hosea the prophet declares of them, “The priests have stolen the way, they have killed the [people of] Shechem,” and again, “The priests did not ask where the Lord is.” Surely every teacher who misleads his students shuts the gate of the kingdom of heaven before them.
