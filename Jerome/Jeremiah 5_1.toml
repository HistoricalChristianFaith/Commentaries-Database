After the address of the Lord in which he commanded, “go throughout Jerusalem,” and so on, the prophet addresses the Lord in return: “Lord, your eyes look for faith,” which is ʾemûnā in Hebrew, referring not to the works of the Jews, in which they exulted according to ceremonies of the law, but to the faith of Christians, through which we are saved by faith. In this chapter, therefore, we learn that supplications are brought for the correction of our faults. This is why he says, “You struck them, and they did not grieve; you wore them out, but they refused to accept discipline.” For Jerusalem was emended through many torments and chastisements and was found to have no shame for their faults after all of this, but with rock-hard shamelessness on their brow, they would not convert to the better way.
