Lately under Caesar Augustus, Judaea, which was subject to the Romans, had been made tributary when the census was held of the whole world; and there was a great division among the people, some saying that tribute ought to be paid to the Romans in return forthe security and quiet which their arms maintained for all. The Pharisees on the other hand, self- satisfied in their own righteousness, contended that the people of God who paid tithes and gave first-fruits, and did all the other things which are written in the Law, ought not to be subject to human laws.
This smooth and treacherous enquiry was a kind of challenge to the answerer to fear God rather than Caesar, and immediately they say, “Tell us therefore, whatthinkest Thou? Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar or not? "Should He say tribute should not be paid, the Herodians would immediately accuse Him as a person disaffected to the Emperor.
This is the first excellence of the answerer, that He discerns the thoughts of His examiners, and calls them not disciples but tempter. A hypocrite is he whois one thing, and feigns himself another.
Wisdom does ever wisely, and so the tempters are best confuted out of their own words; therefore it follows, “Shew me the tribute money; and they brought unto Him a denarius.” This was a coin reckoned equivalent to ten sesterces, and bore the image of Caesar. Let those who think that the Saviour asks because He is ignorant, learn from the present place that it is not so, for at all events Jesus must have known whose image was on the coin. "They say unto Him, Caesar’s;” not Augustus, but Tiberius, under whom also the Lord suffered. All the Roman Emperors were called Caesar, from Caius Caesar who first seized the chief power. “Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar’s;” i. e. the coin, tribute, or money.
They who ought to have believed did but wonder at His great wisdom, that their craft had found no means for ensnaring Him: whence it follows, “When they had heard these words, they marvelled, and left Him, and went their way,” carrying away their unbelief and wonder together.
