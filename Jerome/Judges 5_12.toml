(Judges 5:12) Rise, rise Deborah; rise, speak the Song. It is noteworthy that in Hebrew it is read 'exspergisce,' that is, 'exspergisce' in the spirit of prophecy. Therefore, by the voices of the aforementioned teachers, Deborah is urged to be 'exspergisce' in the spirit of prophecy and praise, and not to cease from praising God. Hence, it follows: Speak the Song. Rise, Barak, and take your captives, son of Abinoam. In Hebrew, it is said: 'Praedare praedam, tuam fili Abinoem.' This statement also warns the same wise men of Barak to plunder the remnants of their enemies, and to bring them to utter destruction, and to commendably acquire the name of victory for themselves.
