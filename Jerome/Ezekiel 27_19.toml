(Verse 19.) Both Greece and Mozel (also known as Moscow) have put forward wrought iron during your markets. Stacte and calamus are in your business dealings. The Septuagint version adds the following about Dan, Javan, and Mozel in your markets. Wrought iron is made by skilled craftsmen, and the wheel is part of your trade. The name Dan was taken from the patriarch and the tribe, and it refers to the place where the tribe lived. Today, that place is called Paneas, which was once known as Caesarea Philippi. And so the Jordan River obtained its name, from Jor, which means 'river', and Dan, which flows from Lebanon. Javan, on the other hand, represents Greece, which as we have said, both is and is not. Symmachus also translates Mozel as carrying, so the meaning is: Dan and Greece have brought iron goods to your markets, and so on. Aquila, however, translates Mozel as Uzal. From these regions, it is believed that iron, stacte, and reed are exported to the Tyrian markets. Let us declare that Greece, that is, Javan, possesses expertly crafted iron and is very ready for war, boasting that it can express everything with judgment and reason through the art of dialectic. It promises a vocal sound that can be interpreted on paper and the pure scent of stacte, whether it be the crafted iron or the wheel that turns with the arrangement of words, and it possesses the flow of speech.
