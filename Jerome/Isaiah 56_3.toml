(Verse 3.) And let not the son of the stranger, who adheres to the Lord, say, 'The Lord will surely separate me from His people.' And let not the eunuch say, 'Behold, I am a dry tree.' LXX: Neither let the foreigner, who is joined to the Lord, say, 'The Lord will surely separate me from His people.' And let not the eunuch say, 'I am a dry tree.' Those who understand this passage humbly refer it to proselytes from the nations and truly to eunuchs, as it is said that even strangers, if they receive the law of the Lord and are circumcised, and eunuchs, like the eunuch of Queen Candace (Acts 8), who could not even be idle on a journey, and while he was seeking an interpreter of the reading, found Christ whom he was seeking, may not be excluded from the salvation of God. But this, they say, is said against the Jews, who boast of the nobility of their lineage, and claim to be descendants of Abraham, and believe those to be blessed who have offspring in Zion and dwellers in Jerusalem (John VIII). But we, who were previously interpreted as thorns and thistles and κονύζη and στοιβὴν (Above, to chapter LV), we now understand to be turned into fir trees, cypresses, and myrtle trees, and the same people are being challenged in regard to the faith of the Gospel: which they should not despair of, as long as they adhere to the Lord; and they should not consider themselves separated from God's people. For all who have been baptized in Christ have clothed themselves with Christ (Galatians 3:27). There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither circumcision nor uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave, nor free, but Christ is all and in all (Colossians 3:11). And it is written in Deuteronomy: Rejoice, O Gentiles, with His people, that is, the God who had the prior people of the Jews (Deuteronomy 33:43). Those who come from the East and West will rest in the bosom of Abraham. This is what John the Baptist also said: And do not say, we have Abraham as our father. For I tell you, God is able from these stones to raise up children for Abraham (Matthew 3:9). And just as there is no distinction among proselytes, both men and women are equally called to salvation; so also in eunuchs who have castrated themselves for the sake of the kingdom of heaven, both sexes are accepted; those who have mortified their members upon the earth, fornication, uncleanness, passion, evil desire, until they all attain to the perfect man, and can say with the Apostle: We know no one according to the flesh. And if we have known Christ according to the flesh, but now we no longer know him (I Cor. V, 16). Therefore, in the case of eunuchs, they should in no way be understood, whom a passionate poet describes (Lucan. lib. X):

And also the unfortunate youth, cut off by the sword, and the men who were cut off . . . . . . . But those of whom the Lord speaks in the Gospel: 'Those who have castrated themselves for the kingdom of heaven' (Matthew 19:12), such were also the Apostles, to whom, marveling and saying because of the difficulty: 'Who then can be saved?' the Savior answered: 'He who can accept it, let him accept it.' Therefore, the Apostle also testifies that he does not have the commandment of the Lord regarding such eunuchs, that is, regarding virgins, but he gives advice as if having obtained mercy from the Lord, desiring that all be like himself: 'For the time is short,' he says, 'it remains, that both they who have wives be as though they had none' (1 Corinthians 7:29). For whoever is called to freedom and released from the duty of marriage, that person is truly a servant of Christ.
