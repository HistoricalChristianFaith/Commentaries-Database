(Vers. 6, 7.) And you, son of man, groan in the breaking of your loins, and groan bitterly before them. And when they say to you, 'Why do you groan?' you shall say, 'Because of the news, for it is coming, and every heart shall melt, and all hands shall be loosened, and every spirit shall faint, and water shall flow from all knees. Behold, it is coming, and it shall be,' says the Lord (Vulgate adds 'God'). LXX: And you, son of man, groan in the breaking of your loins, and groan in pains before them. And it shall come to pass, if they shall say unto thee: Wherefore dost thou mourn? and thou shalt say: Because of the tidings, for it cometh, and every heart shall be taken and all hands shall be weakened, and every spirit shall faint, and all thighs shall be filled with moisture. Behold it cometh, and it shall be, saith the Lord God. First he had said: prophesy, or pour out upon the South, the African and the South wind, and upon the southern leap. And because it seemed obscure, and the people knew not the words of the prophet, it is set down more plainly the southern leap to be Jerusalem, and all unfruitful trees, by the roots of which the axe is laid (Matt. III, Luke III), are understood to be its inhabitants: and the sword is interpreted as fire. Thirdly, the prophet is commanded, while they are silent and not questioning, to do those things by which he may be interrogated, and to respond what the Lord has spoken. 'Groan,' he says, 'lament, not with a slight voice, nor with moderate pain, but with contrition of the loins, so that your groaning may come forth from the depths of your bowels and the bitterness of your soul. And you shall do this before them: that when they have asked you why you are broken by such groaning, and what evil has befallen you that you groan in this way, you may respond to them in my words: 'Therefore, I lament, and I am unable to hide the pain of my heart, because the prophecy that had always resounded in my ears is being fulfilled by deed and is coming to pass: namely, the impending army of the raging Babylonians.' When he comes and surrounds Jerusalem, then every heart will melt, and all hands will be dissolved, so that, with the fear of men overwhelming their minds, no one will dare to resist. For the spirit of all warriors will weaken, and such great trembling and fear will seize everyone, that limbs and organs will dissolve under the pressure of fear, and the bladder will not be able to hold urine: so that urine will soil the knees. For it is natural, when fear presses, for the bladder to relax, and for moisture to flow against the will of man. Indeed, this often happens in the severity of illnesses, that after the strength of the sick people has diminished, not only their knees, but also their beds are soiled. Look, he says, it is coming, which I have often predicted, and it is being accomplished and will happen, not by me, but the Lord has spoken. I know someone who, in the contrition of his loins and with flowing waters, has repeated many testimonies, so that the chastity of the prophets may be fulfilled, and the bitterness of his soul and the internal pain of his mind, which the waters of his seed pollute his knees. But this explanation does not pertain to the current place.
