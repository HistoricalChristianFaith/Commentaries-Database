(Verse 52) And the earth shook, and the rocks were split, and the tombs were opened. There is no doubt that this signifies, literally, the magnitude of the signs, such as the crucified Lord and the heavens and the earth, demonstrating everything. But it seems to me that the earthquake and the rest symbolize the belief of the believers, who, having abandoned the vices of their past errors and softened the hardness of their hearts, who were previously like the tombs of the dead, have now recognized the Creator.
