"Once
more I saw under the sun that the race is not won by the swift; nor the battle
by the strong, nor does bread come to the wise, riches to the intelligent, nor
favour to the learned; but time and death will happen to them all. "He who is bound by manacles and by heavy lead chains is
oppressed: "for wickedness sits upon a talent of lead" [Zach. 5, 7.], and in the Psalm it says, "they
weigh on me like a heavy burden" [Ps. 37, 5.]. It is not talking about that race, about
which is said, "I took up the race, and I kept my faith" [II. Tim. 4, 7.]. But that man is swift and his spirit is not
weighed down, nonetheless even he is not able to arrive at the goal without God
helping him. But when there has been a
war against adverse leaders, about whom it is written, "make war
sacred" [Ier. 6, 4.],
even a strong man will not be able to win with his own strength. This is also true of the sons of man and the
wise who cannot have living bread for the spirit, except through encouraging
wisdom: "Come, eat my bread" [Prov. 9, 5.]. And since there are riches, about which the
apostle says, "riches come through good deeds" [I Tim. 6, 18.],
and in another place, "you have been made rich in every utterance and
knowledge" [I Cor. 1, 5.];
it must be understood that a wise man cannot amass these riches, unless he
receives them from God, who possesses them. 
In another place these riches are mentioned too: "redemption of the
spirit for man is his own riches" [Prov. 15, 8.]. However learned a man is, he will not be able
to find grace too, unless accompanied by wisdom and given by God. Paul also knows this: "I worked more
than all men," he says, "yet not I but the grace of God which was
with me". Then again he says, "His grace in me was not in
vain". And right to the end man
does not know when the time will come, when the unknown fate and end of all
things will come. This reading is
according to "anagoge". But in order to explain this more easily, I
should mention that the epistle to the Romans agrees with this
verse: "So then it is not of him that wants, nor of him that runs,
but of God that shows mercy." [Rom. 9, 16.] He also says this: "there is no bread
for the wise", this example is proved every day for many people, who
although they are very wise, still do not have the necessary sustenance for
life. And: "there is no grace for
the knowledgeable". For you may see
in the Church that the ignorant and unskilled prosper. And this is both because they have nourished
their boldness, and followed the fluency of their tongue, while they do not
think about what they say, they think that they are wise and learned, and as if
they have the greatest favour of the populous, which delights and is brought
together more by more polished words. On
the other hand a learned man lies in obscurity and suffers persecution; and not
only does he not have grace in the people's eyes, but also fades away through
poverty and hunger. But these things
happen because all things occur by uncertainty, and there is no retribution of
merit in this world, but in the future.
