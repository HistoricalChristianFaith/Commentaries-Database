These words apply to those who complain: Why wasn’t I created such that I would be free from sin forever? Why was I fashioned such a vessel that I could not endure hard like metal instead of being fragile and easily broken whenever touched?… Let us blush and say what those say who have already obtained their rewards. Let us, who are sinners on earth and encased in this fragile and mortal body, say what we know the saints are saying in heaven.

If the apostle makes such a confession, how much more should the sinner? Scripture says: “The just man accuses himself when he begins to speak.” If the just man is prompt to accuse himself, how much more should the sinner be?
