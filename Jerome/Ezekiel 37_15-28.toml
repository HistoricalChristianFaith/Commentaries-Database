(Verse 15 and following) \"And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: And you, son of man, take for yourself one piece of wood and write on it 'Judah' and the children of Israel, his companions, and take another piece of wood and write on it 'Joseph, the wood of Ephraim,' and all the house of Israel, his companions. And join them one to another for yourself into one piece of wood; and they will be in unity in your hand. But when the children of your people speak to you, saying: Will you not tell us what these things mean to you? You shall speak to them: Thus says the Lord God: Behold, I will take the wood of Joseph, which is in the hand of Ephraim, and the tribes of Israel, his associates; and I will join them with the wood of Judah, and make them one wood, and they shall be one in my hand. And the wood on which you have written shall be visible to their eyes. And you shall say to them: Thus says the Lord God: Behold, I will take the sons of Israel from among the nations to which they have gone, and I will gather them together from all sides, and bring them to their own land. And I will make them one nation in the land on the mountains of Israel, and one king shall be king over them all, and they shall have no more princes; And there will no longer be two nations, nor will they be divided into two kingdoms anymore; nor will they defile themselves anymore with their idols, and with abominations, and with all their iniquities, and I will save them from all their dwelling places, in which they have sinned, and I will cleanse them, and they will be my people, and I will be their God. And my servant David will be their king over them, and there will be one shepherd for all of them, they will walk in my judgments, and they will keep my commandments, and they will do them. And they shall dwell upon the land which I gave to my servant Jacob: wherein your fathers dwelt, and they shall dwell therein, they and their children, and their children's children, forever: and my servant David shall be their prince forever. And I will make a covenant of peace with them: it shall be an everlasting covenant with them, and I will establish them, and multiply them, and I will put my sanctuary in the midst of them forever. And my tabernacle will be among them, and I will be their God, and they will be my people. And the nations shall know that I am the Lord, the sanctifier of Israel, when my sanctification is in their midst forever. LXX: And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: And you, son of man, take for yourself one staff, and write on it Judah, and the children of Israel who are associated with him, and take another staff for yourself, and write on it Joseph, the staff of Ephraim, and all the children of Israel who are associated with him, and join them together for yourself into one staff, that they may be joined together, and they will be in your hand. And it shall come to pass, when the children of Israel shall speak unto thee, saying, Shew us what thou meanest by these? That thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will take the stick of Joseph, which is in the hand of Ephraim, and the tribes of Israel his fellows, and will put them with him, even with the stick of Judah, and make them one stick, and they shall be one in mine hand. And the sticks whereon thou writest shall be in thine hand before their eyes. And say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will take the children of Israel from among the heathen, whither they be gone, and will gather them on every side, and bring them into their own land: And I will make them one nation in the land upon the mountains of Israel; and one king shall be king to them all: and they shall be no more two nations, neither shall they be divided into two kingdoms any more at all. And they shall no longer be divided into two nations or two kingdoms, so that they will not defile themselves with their idols, their abominations, and all their transgressions. And I will deliver them from all their iniquities, in which they have sinned, and I will cleanse them, and they shall be my people, and I will be their God. And my servant David shall be their prince in their midst, and there shall be one shepherd for all of them, because they shall walk in my commandments and keep my statutes and do them. And they shall dwell in the land that I have given to my servant Jacob, where their fathers dwelt. And they shall dwell in it, they and their children, and their children's children, forever. And my servant David shall be their prince forever. And I will make with them a covenant of peace, an everlasting covenant. And I will give them and multiply them, and I will set my sanctuary in their midst forever. And my tabernacle shall be with them, and I will be their God, and they shall be my people. And the nations shall know that I am the Lord, who sanctify you, when my sanctuary is in their midst forever.\" The history of the Kings (3 Kings 12) tells that under Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, the twelve tribes were divided, and two, namely Judah and Benjamin, followed Rehoboam, who reigned in Jerusalem, and his kingdom was called Judah. But the other ten tribes, who said, \"We have no share in David, nor inheritance in the son of Jesse,\" submitted their necks and served Jeroboam, the son of Nebat from the tribe of Ephraim, who was the son of Joseph. They were mostly called by the ancient name Israel, and for a long time the kingdom of Judah and Israel had conflicts with each other, and obeyed their own kings (4 Kings 25). The first ten tribes were captured by the Assyrians, and after some time those called Judah were taken captive by the Chaldeans into Babylon, and the tribe of Judah was restored to the ancient land after seventy years. But the ten tribes called Israel still serve as captives in the mountains and cities of the Medes to this day (4 Kings 25). Therefore, the present prophecy from the mouth of the Lord promises that both kingdoms should be joined together, that is, the kingdom of Judah and the kingdom of Israel, and the Ephraim branch, which is descended from the line of Joseph, with the remaining tribes that are associated with it, should be removed, and joined to the branch of Judah, so that they are not called Judah and Israel, but are called Judah by one name: and under the figure of the prophet who precedes in the type of the Lord and Savior, they should hold not with two hands, but with one hand of Christ. For he says that he will assume the children of Israel from among the nations to which they were taken captive, and he will bring them back to the land and mountains of Israel, of which we read above. And one nation will be called, and it will be ruled by the authority of one king, so that they will no longer be polluted by idols and their abominations. But when they are freed from the seats of captivity, in which they have sinned, they must be cleansed of all vices and they will become the people of God, so that the Lord will be their God. And my servant David shall reign over them, says the Lord (Luke 1). And the Angel speaks about him in the Gospel, that he will reign over the house of Jacob, and his kingdom shall have no end. And his mercy shall be so great that he shall be called not only king, but also shepherd, because he softens the proud name of ruler with the name of shepherd. And after they have become one nation and have dwelt in the land of Israel and the mountains, they shall walk in all the judgments of the Lord and keep His commandments. And they shall dwell not in any other land, but in the land that He gave to His servant Jacob, where their fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and the rest of the saints, dwell. And not only they themselves shall dwell, but also their sons and grandsons, according to that saying of Virgil (Aeneid, Book IV).

And those who are born of them, and those who will be born from them, may they dwell not for a short time, but forever. But you want to know, he says, who this king and shepherd is? He is the one of whom I have spoken before, my servant David. Though he was in the form of God, he did not consider it robbery to be equal with God; but he emptied himself, taking the form of a servant, and became obedient to the Father even unto death, death on a cross (Philippians 2:6 seq.). And when they are under such a king, I will establish a covenant of peace with them. Not like in the Old Testament of battles and wars, but a covenant of peace that surpasses all understanding, of which the Savior speaks to the Apostles: 'Peace I leave with you, My peace I give to you' (John 14:27). And the prophet says: 'His dwelling place shall be in peace' (Psalm 76:2). When He establishes and strengthens them in the Church, so that they can say: 'He set my feet upon a rock' (Psalm 40:3), then they will multiply either in number of believers or in the increase of virtues. And I will give, he says, my sanctification, or sanctuary among them forever, which the Jews interpret as the temple, which was built under Zerubbabel. But how can this be fulfilled, which is said forever, when that temple which was built by Zerubbabel and later restored, was burned by Roman fire? All of these things are to be referred to the Church and to the times of the Savior, when his tabernacle was placed in the Church: where our God was made, and we became his people. And the progress of all is, that they may know that He Himself is the Lord, and He Himself sanctifies Israel, not according to the flesh, but according to the spirit: when His sanctification was made among the believers forever. And when the Lord rejected the tribe of Ephraim, and chose the tribe of Judah, and in the Psalms we read, in which it is written: And He rejected the tabernacle of Joseph, and He did not choose the tribe of Ephraim; but He chose the tribe of Judah (Psalm 78:67, 68), of which it is written: The prince shall not fail from Judah, nor the leader from his thighs, until He comes to whom it is reserved: and He shall be the expectation of the nations (Genesis 49:10). Truly, in the coming of the Lord and Savior, the two rods, as it is written in Hebrew, the two pieces of wood are joined together as a scepter, and in the baptism of Christ, they are separated and united: so that they may become one new man and one nation, no longer polluted by idols and abominations; but through the cleansing of the world, they may be the people of God, and Christ may reign over them, and they may dwell upon the gentle earth, the land of the living, which He had given to His servant Jacob, who supplanted the people of Israel in the womb of his mother. But if we wish, according to the prophecy of Hosea, which is directed almost entirely to the ten tribes, that is, to Joseph and Ephraim, and Samaria, and Israel, to understand the false knowledge of the name, and the various crowds of heretics, we will say this, that at the end of time when the fullness of the Gentiles has entered, and all Israel has been saved (Rom. XI), then even the adversaries of the people, who fought against the house of Judah and the confession of the Church, will surrender to the faith of the Church, and leaving behind all errors and the princes of this world who are destroyed, and their patriarchs who led them into the abyss of blasphemy, they will rise and abandon their idols and their abominations, which they themselves fabricated in their hearts, and they will pass from all their seats, in which they sinned, to the faith of the Church, and they will be cleansed, and they will be the people of Christ, and He will be their God: all of which I know more fully were said by the prophet Hosea. But if Judaizing Jews and Christians want to refer these things to a thousand years in the future, they are compelled by necessity to undertake all the things that those who are saved must do when they dwell in the land of Israel: to build Jerusalem, to construct the temple, to perform all the ceremonies of the Law, to observe the Sabbath, to accept circumcision, to eat and drink, and to consider an abundance of wealth as the highest bliss and ultimate value, even though the Apostle says: Food for the stomach and the stomach for food, but God will destroy both this and them (I Cor. VI, 13). However, just as in the type of the resurrection the higher prophetic discourse demonstrated the resurrection of the Jewish people, not carnal but spiritual, so this prophecy pertains not at all to the flesh but to the happiness of the soul, and to the faith of Christ, by which we are cleansed in baptism, whose kingdom is forever, so that we do not expect things to come which have already passed, and which we know to be happening every day.
