(Verses 7, 8.) How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of the messenger of good news, who announces peace, who brings good news, who announces salvation, who says to Zion, 'Your God reigns.' The voice of your watchmen—they lift up their voice; together they sing for joy; for eye to eye they see the return of the Lord to Zion. LXX: As the hour over the mountains, so the feet of the messenger who hears the message of peace, who hears the message of good news, for I will make my salvation heard, saying, 'Zion, your God reigns.' The voice of those who keep watch over you is exalted, and they shall rejoice together, for they shall see eye to eye when the Lord has mercy on Zion. Consequently, concerning the one who said above, 'I myself who spoke, behold I am present,' now the Prophet testifies that he himself has preached the Gospel over the mountains, that is, over the Apostles, about whom it is written: 'Approach the everlasting mountains' (Micah 2:9, LXX), and their doctrine is the illumination of God. Where in the Psalms it says of Him: Thou enlightenest wonderously from the everlasting hills (Ps. LXXV, 5). He has announced and preached peace to those who were far off, that is, to the Gentiles; and near, that is, to the Jews: reconciling the world to God, of whom it is sung in the psalm under the name of Solomon: Justice shall rise up in his days, and abundance of peace, till the moon be taken away (Ps. LXXI, 7). And in the same Prophet, about the Child who is born, and the Son who is given to us, whose principate is upon his shoulder, and he shall be called the Angel of great counsel, it is said afterwards (above, IX, 7): And there shall be no end of his peace. For he is our peace, who has made both one, and has broken down the middle wall of partition between us; Having abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the law of commandments contained in ordinances; for to make in himself of two one new man, so making peace; And that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the cross, having slain the enmity thereby: And came and preached peace to you which were afar off, and to them that were nigh. For through him we both have access by one Spirit unto the Father. Now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellowcitizens with the saints, and of the household of God; And are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone; In whom all the building fitly framed together grows unto an holy temple in the Lord: In whom ye also are built together for an habitation of God through the Spirit. These are the good things that the Lord promises to those who believe: Hear me and you will eat good things; and your soul will delight in good things; and not only good things, but also salvation he announced to all, which he himself gave who says to Zion, that is, to the Church: Your God reigns. Hence the Apostle speaks to the Holy Ones: Let sin not reign in your mortal body, so that you obey its desires (Rom. VI, 12). And writing about sinners, he says: Death reigned from Adam to Moses (Rom. V, 14). And what follows: The voice of your watchmen, or your custodians, signifies the Apostles, about whom God speaks to the Church in another place (Below, LXII, 6): I have set watchmen upon thy walls, O Jerusalem, which shall never hold their peace day nor night: ye that make mention of the LORD, keep not silence. Wherefore it is said unto them (Above, XL, 9): Get thee up into the high mountain, O Zion, that bringest good tidings; lift up thy voice with strength, O Jerusalem, that bringest good tidings. These same ones will praise God with equal voice, and with eyes they will see face to face. Which the Apostle says in other words: Face to face (1 Corinthians 13); when the Holy One sings: My eyes are always toward the Lord (Psalm 25:15). And: To you I lift up my eyes, you who are enthroned in the heavens (Psalm 121:1). And the Lord will answer them: For the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous, and his ears are open to their prayer (Psalm 34:16). The translation of the Septuagint is like this: as the hour, that is, time above the mountains: just as the feet of one who brings good news of peace, and so on, Paul, following the sense of the Hebrew Truth, puts in his Epistle to the Romans: How beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news, who bring the message of peace (Romans 10:15): intending the Apostles, whose feet the Lord washed (John 13), so that they might be clean and beautiful for preaching, and go throughout the whole world, and quickly fill the world with the teaching of Christ. Now, ὥρα, that is, hour, according to the Septuagint, and the ambiguity of the Greek word can mean either time or beauty. If it refers to time, it will be appropriate to say: I heard you at the right time, and I was your helper on the day of salvation (Isaiah 49:8). Hence, the Apostle concludes: Behold, now is the acceptable time; behold, now is the day of salvation (2 Corinthians 6:2). For at the right time, he shed his blood for all, when everyone had turned away and had become useless at the same time. There was none who did good, not even one (Ps. 14:3): so that he might taste death for all, because all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God (Rom. 3:23). But if we refer beauty to that which is said in the psalm: You are fairer than the sons of men (Ps. 45:2); (for what is more beautiful than for the form of a servant to become the form of God, and to sit and reign with Christ in the heavens?) it can be called watchfulness according to the breadth of the Greek language, and solicitude, according to what the Saint says: You will multiply me in my soul, in your power (Ps. 137:4). For you will make me abound [multiply] in Greek, it is said πολυωρήσεις με [poluōrēseis me], which means you will consider me worthy with much care and concern. And elsewhere: According to your greatness you have multiplied [πολυώρησας | poluōrēsas] the sons of men (Ps. XI, 9); which in other Greek words means you have valued [ἠξίωσας | ēxiōsas] them with much time [πολλῆς ὤρας | pollēs hōras] and thought [φροντίδος | phrontidos]. But these [translations] are superfluous; and it is more fitting to receive the beautiful feet of Christ or the Apostles, since, besides the Seventy [Septuaginta], all others have translated [it] similarly, with Paul approving their interpretation.
