(Verses 37, 38) He has abandoned his shelter (or den) like a lion. (And to be more accurate, his tent: for this is what 'Succho' means in Hebrew.) Because their land has become a desolation (or impassable) from the wrath of the dove (or from the face of the great sword) and from the face of the fury of the Lord. The Lord, of whom it was said above, will roar from on high, and from his holy dwelling he will give forth his voice. Roaring, he will roar over his glory, he himself will abandon his tent, of which it is written: He has made it in peace, or in Salem, that is, his dwelling place, and his habitation in Zion (Psalm 75:2): he himself will abandon his seat, and he will fulfill what he spoke through the same prophet: I have forsaken my house, I have abandoned my inheritance (Jeremiah 12:7). But it left its den like a lion, so that all the beasts have power over its land. For with the lion as their guardian and ruler, no one dares approach it. It has become, he says, their land, undoubtedly to the point that either the Jewish people or certainly all the nations will be desolated and made impassable by the face of the dove's wrath. It is not surprising that the dove of the Lord is understood to be Nebuchadnezzar, who has read himself being called the servant of the Lord above him. For why they have translated Seventy, a great sword. May we receive a dove and in the person of Jerusalem, that he may be angry and sad, having lost the custody of his lion, and his land coming into desolation.
