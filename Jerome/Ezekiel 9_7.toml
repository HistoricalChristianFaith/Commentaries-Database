(Verse 7) They therefore began with the older men who were before the house. And he said to them: Defile the house, and fill the courts with the slain. Fill the courts with the slain. For the courts, which are called the Asroth in Hebrew, the Seventy set up roads. However, the older men, of whom we read above that they had censers and offered incense to idols, are killed. There is no longer any religious worship in the temple, for, having offended the God of religion, all things are defiled, so that where there is sin, there is also judgment. The atriums are filled with corpses in the temple, and not the streets, which were certainly outside, unless we can perhaps understand the streets as the city squares. The angels could not dare to defile the temple with the blood of the dead, in which the glory of God previously dwelt, unless the Lord of departing glory commanded it. Everyone who is dead because of sin defiles the atriums of the temple and the streets of the Lord's city, in which he lives. But when he rises again with Christ, he ceases to be dead.


And they went out and struck those who were in the city. Or, as others have translated: they struck the city, calling the city itself the ones who were in the city.
