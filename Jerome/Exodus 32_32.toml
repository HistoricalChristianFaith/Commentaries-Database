He sought to imitate the shepherd who would, he knew, carry on his shoulders even the wandering sheep. “The good shepherd”—these are the Lord’s own words—“lays down his life for the sheep.” One of his disciples can wish to be anathema from Christ for his brothers’ sake, his kinsmen according to the flesh who were Israelites.
