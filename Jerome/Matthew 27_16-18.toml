(Verse 16 onwards) At that time he had a notorious prisoner called Barabbas. So when they had gathered, Pilate said to them: Whom do you want me to release to you, Barabbas or Jesus who is called Christ? For he knew that they had handed Him over out of envy. Now, in the Gospel written according to the Hebrews, 'the son of their teacher' is interpreted as referring to this man, who had been condemned for sedition and murder. However, Pilate offers them the option of releasing whoever they want, either the robber or Jesus, not doubting that they would choose Jesus, knowing that He had been handed over out of envy. Therefore, the evident cause of the cross is envy.
