But it seems that the Lord could not in so short a distance have sate upon both animals; seeing then that the history has either an impossibility or ameanness, we are sent to higher things, that is, to the figurative sense.
The multitudes that came out of Jericho, and followed the Saviour, cast down their garments, and strewed the way with branches of trees; and therefore it follows, “But the multitudes spread their garments in the way;” that is, beneath the feet of the ass, that it should not stumble against a stone, nor tread upon a thorn, nor fall into a ditch. “Others cut down branches from the trees, and strewed them in the way;” from the fruit-trees, that is, with which mount Olivet was clothed. I shall shortly examine what is the meaning of this word, Hosanna. In the hundred and seventeenth Psalm, which is clearly written of the Saviour’s coming, we read this among other things; “Save me now,O Lord, send now prosperity. Blessed art thou that art to come in the name of the Lord.” For that which the LXX give &#937;&#922;&#965;&#961;&#953;&#949;, &#963;&#969;&#963;&#959;&#957; &#948;&#951;,“Save now, O Lord;” we read in the Hebrew, ‘Anna, adonai osianna,’ whichSymmachus renders more plainly, “I pray thee, O Lord, save, I pray thee.” Let none think that it is a word made up of two words, one Greek and one Hebrew, for it is pure Hebrew.
For it signifies that the coming of Christ is the salvation of the world, whence it follows, “Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord.” Which same thing the Saviour in the Gospel confirms, “I am come in my John Father's name.” .
Or by that which is added, “Hosanna,” that is, Salvation, “in the highest,” itis clearly shown that the coming of Christ is not the salvation of man only, but of the whole world, joining earthly things to things heavenly.
Mystically; The Lord draws near to Jerusalem departing from Jericho, and taking great multitudes with Him, because great and laden with great wares, that is, the salvation of believers that has been entrusted to Him, He seeks to enter the city of peace, the place of the beholding of God. And He comes toBethphage, that is, to The house of the jawbones; He bare also the type of confession; and halted on Mount Olivet, where is the light of knowledge, and the repose from toils and pains. By the village over against the Apostles is denoted this world; for that was against the Apostles, and was not willing to receive the light of their teaching.
Or, because there is theory and practice, that is, knowledge and works. By theass which had been under the yoke, and was broken, the synagogue is understood. By the ass’s colt wild and unbroken, the Gentile people; for the Jewish nationis towards God the mother of the Gentiles.
When He says, “The multitudes that went before and that followed,” He shewsthat both people, those who before the Gospel, and those who after the Gospel, believed on the Lord, praise Jesus with the harmonious voice of confession.
