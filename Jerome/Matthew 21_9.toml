(Verse 9.) But the crowds that went before him and that followed him were shouting, saying, 'Hosanna to the Son of David! Blessings on the one who comes in the name of the Lord! Hosanna in the highest!' Let us now follow the spiritual order of discourse, for the story is clear. The crowds that had come out of Jericho and had followed the Savior and his disciples, after they saw the foal of a donkey loosed (which had been tied up before) and adorned with the apostles' garments, and the Lord Jesus sitting on it, they placed their garments on the ground and spread branches of trees on the road. And when they had completed all things with great effort, they also give testimony of their voice: and those who went before and those who followed after confessed not with a short and silent confession, but with a very loud clamor: Hosanna to the Son of David, blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord. And what he says: The crowds that went before and that followed after, showed both the people who believed in the Lord before the Gospel, and those who believed in the Lord after the Gospel, praising Jesus with a unified voice of confession: and according to the example of the parable of the workers of different hours in the higher story, to accept one reward of faith. Furthermore, regarding what follows: 'Hosanna to the Son of David,' I remember having said, in a short letter to Damasus, who was the bishop of the city of Rome at that time, and now I will briefly explain. In the 117th psalm, which clearly speaks of the coming of the Savior, among other things we read: 'The stone which the builders rejected has become the cornerstone.' This was done by the Lord, and it is marvelous in our eyes. This is the day which the Lord hath made; we will rejoice and be glad in it. And immediately it follows: O Lord, save me: O Lord, prosper me. Blessed be he that cometh in the name of the Lord: we have blessed you out of the house of the Lord, etc. (Psalm 118:22 seqq.). For what is said in the Septuagint interpreters; O Lord, save now, that is, O Lord, save; in Hebrew we read: Hosanna, which Symmachus interprets more clearly, saying: I beseech thee, Lord, save, I beseech thee. Therefore, no one thinks that the phrase is composed of two words, namely Greek and Hebrew, but it is entirely Hebrew and signifies that the coming of Christ is the salvation of the world. Hence, it follows: Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord. This is also confirmed by the Savior Himself in the Gospel: I came in my Father's name, and you did not receive me. Another will come in his own name, and you will receive him (John 5:43). Moreover, the joining of 'Hosanna', that is, 'salvation in the highest', clearly shows that the coming of Christ is not only the salvation of mankind, but of the whole world: connecting the earthly with the heavenly, so that every knee shall bow, of those in heaven, on earth, and under the earth (Philippians 2:10).
