(Verse 16) But blessed are your eyes, for they see; and your ears, for they hear. Unless we had read above about auditors called to understanding, with the Savior saying: "He who has ears to hear, let him hear," we would now think that the eyes and ears that receive blessedness are understood as bodily (or physical). But to me, those blessed eyes seem to be the ones that can recognize the sacraments of Christ, and those ears that Jesus commanded to be lifted up on high so that they may behold the gleaming wheat fields (John 4:9); and those blessed ears of which Isaiah speaks: "The Lord has opened my ear" (Isaiah 50:5).
