"Behold,
I have found this, says the preacher, counting one by one, to find out the
account. Which still my soul seeks, but
I have not found it. I have found one
man among a thousand, but one woman among all those I have not found. Only this
have I found: that God has made man righteous, but he has sought out many
inventions. "He says, "I found this", teaching
all things diligently, that by sinning little by little, and adding one crime
on top of another, we amass a great number of sins for ourselves. '"esebon"'
even, which all translate as "logismon"
in Greek, according to the ambiguity of the Hebrew language can be said by us
to be 'number', 'sum', 'account', and 'consideration'. But, he says, my spirit sought even this
question of whether woman is rightly found to be guilty. And although I found scarcely any men to be
good, thus so that only one from a thousand can be found, I couldn't even find
one woman to be completely good. For all
of them have led me not to virtue but to self-indulgence. And because man's heart is predisposed
towards wickedness from boyhood, and almost all of us offend God in some way,
in this failing of mankind, women are more prone to this fate. The famous poet says about this:
"inconstant and always changeable is woman" [Virg. Aen. 4. 569/70.]. And the apostle says, "always learning
yet never arriving at the knowledge of the truth" [II Tim. 3.7.]. But he does not condemn this nature as being
common to all mankind, or say that God the creator does evil things, because he
is the creator of these things, but he warns subtly those who are not able to
avoid evil, and says that we are created good by God; but he also says that
because we are left with our own free-will to deteriorate into a worse and
worse state through our own vices, while we seek greater things and contemplate
many things beyond our strength. Differently:
while I consider the reason behind each and every one of these verses, I have
found no thought, which is not perturbed from outside by wicked thoughts. But in a thousand men I have found one man,
who is made in the image of his creator; and not in a thousand of any kind, but
of one thousand "men". There is not a like number of women
corresponding to men. In the thousand,
those who have not been close to a woman have therefore remained the most pure. But all this must be taken as a
metaphor. In many though, who enthuse
and every day sweat in their thinking, scarcely can there be found one pure
thought, that is worthy of the name of man. 
We can take thoughts for men though, and women for work, and say that
the thoughts of man can only be seen as pure with great difficulty. But since the body does work, it is always
mixed up with some fault. But instead of
that which we said above interpreting the Hebrew phrase, "one upon
another, so that a great accumulation is made" we could either say 'account',
or 'thought'; Symmachus interprets this more clearly, saying, "one upon
another makes an amount". And we
are accustomed to call this complete and neutral, which I sought and had wanted
to find. The Hebrews name this in the
case of females, just as in the phrase "I sought one from God, this I
ask" [Ps. 26, 4.],
in place of that which is one. [[lit. "pro eo quod est unum"]]
