(Verse 25.) But Judas, who betrayed him, answered and said: 'Is it I, Lord?' Lest he should appear to betray himself by remaining silent, he likewise asks, being tormented by his conscience, who had boldly put his hand into the dish.

Am I, Rabbi? He said to him: You have said it. And he joins a mingling of emotion, or a sign of disbelief. For the others who were not going to betray, they say: Am I, Lord? This one who was going to betray did not call him Lord, but rather teacher, as if he had an excuse, if he denied the Lord, at least he betrayed the teacher. And he said to him: You have said it. The betrayer is refuted by the same response, with which he will later answer Pilate.
