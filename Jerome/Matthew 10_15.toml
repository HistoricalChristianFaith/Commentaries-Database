The Apostles, on entering a strange town, could not know of each inhabitant what sort of man he was; they were to choose their host therefore by the report of the people, and opinion of the neighbours, that the worthiness of the preacher might not be disgraced by the ill character of his entertainer.
One host is chosen who does not so much confer a favour upon him who is to abide with him, as receive one. For it is said, “Who in it is worthy,” that he may know that he rather receives than does a favour.
Also they shake off the dust as a testimony of the Apostles’ toil, that in preaching the Gospel they had come even so far, or as a token that from those that rejected the Gospel they would accept nothing, not even the necessaries of life.
Because to the men of Sodom and Gomorrah no man had ever preached; but this city had been preached to and had rejected the Gospel.
But if it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom than for that city, hence we may learn that there is difference of degree in the punishment of sinners.
