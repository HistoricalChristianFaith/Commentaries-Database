(v. 15) Truly I say to you, it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah on the day of judgment than for that city. If it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah ((or Gomorheis)) than for that city which did not receive the Gospel, and therefore more tolerable, because to Sodom and Gomorrah the preaching was not given, but to this city it was given, and yet it did not receive the Gospel: therefore among sinners there are different punishments.
