quote='''
Christ speaks here of the whole of his humanity, which he had taken on him in its entirety at his birth. Then shall the sheep that was lost22 and was wandering in the lower world be carried healthy on the Savior’s shoulders. And the sheep that was sick with sin shall be taken care of by the mercy of the Judge.
