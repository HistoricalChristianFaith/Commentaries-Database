(Vers. 7 seqq.) How can I be propitious to you? Your sons have forsaken me, and they swear by those who are not gods. I have satisfied them, and they have committed adultery, and they have indulged in the house of a prostitute. They are lovers of horses, and they have become emissaries to me. Each one neighs after his neighbor's wife. Will I not visit them for these things, says the Lord? Will my soul not avenge itself on such a nation? Catalogue of the sins of Jerusalem: while she says that she does not know God, by whom she can be shown mercy. Your sons have forsaken me, she says. Not my sons, but yours: they swear by those who are not gods, I have fed them and they have committed adultery. Let those who received wealth from the Lord listen to this and serve luxury. The lovers of horses have become lovers of women. Concerning emissaries, it is written in Hebrew: Mosechim (), which all translated with a consonant voice, that is, pulling, to show the greatness of the genitals, as in the said Ezekiel: like the flesh of donkeys, their flesh (Ezek. XXIII, 20). This is what is written in another place: They were compared to foolish beasts, and became like them (Psalm 48:13). And it shows such madness of lust, that not only does it call desire for pleasure, but also neighing, that is, the sound of horses, and it preserves the metaphor of raging horses for lust. When you do these things, he says, are you not worthy of punishment? And note that here visitation is used as punishment and torment, according to what is written: I will visit their iniquities with a rod. And in such a nation my soul will not be avenged (Psalm 88:33)? After it is bound by sins, it is not called the people of God, but a nation from which the soul of God has departed, according to what is written: My soul hates your new moons, your Sabbaths and your festivals (Isaiah 1:13). But what is said in the Old Testament for emotion, is written in the New Testament for truth: With the Savior saying: I have the power to lay down my life, and I have the power to take it up again (John 10:18).
