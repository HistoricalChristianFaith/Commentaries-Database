(Verse 9.) And they asked him, saying: Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath day? that they might accuse him. Because he had previously defended himself and his disciples against the accusation of breaking the sabbath by a valid example, the Pharisees now want to falsely accuse him. They ask whether it is lawful to heal on the sabbath day, so that if he does not heal, they can accuse him of cruelty or weakness; but if he does heal, they can accuse him of transgression.
