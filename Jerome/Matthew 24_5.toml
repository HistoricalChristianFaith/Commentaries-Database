They ask Him three things. First, The time of the destruction of Jerusalem, saying, “Tell us when shall these things be?” Secondly, The time of Christ's coming, saying, “And what shall be the sign of Thy coming?” Thirdly, The time of the consummation of this world, saying, “And of the end of the world?”.
One of them of whom He speaks was Simon of Samaria, of whom we read in the Acts of the Apostles, that he gave himself out to be the great Power, leaving these things written in his works I suppose all heresiarchs. to be Antichrists, and under the name of Christ to teach those things which are contrary to Christ. No wonder if we see some led away by such teachers, when the Lord has said, “And shall deceive many.”
