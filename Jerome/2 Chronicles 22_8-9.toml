The Lord established the kingdom in Jehoshaphat’s hand, and all Judah brought presents to him. And he acquired immense wealth and riches and much glory.… And, lest we suppose that the justice he possessed in the past was destroyed by the fact that he committed this sin and was reproved by the prophet, it is written subsequently of Uzziah, his descendant, that Jehu found him lying in Samaria, and, when he was brought in, he killed him: “And they buried him,” he says, “because he was the son of Jehoshaphat, who has sought the Lord with all his heart.”
