(Verse 25.) Do not go out to the fields, and do not walk on the road, for the sword of the enemy is all around. The Gospel teaches (Matthew 24) that we should not go out into the field or descend from the height of roofs, but rather listen to this: 'Escape to the mountain to be saved' (Genesis 19:17). We are instructed in Isaiah and Micah (Isaiah 2, Micah 4) to run to and climb to this mountain. According to the literal meaning, we are commanded not to go outside or leave the walls, but to protect ourselves with strong fortifications.
