(Verse 2) This is the first year of King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon (which is not in the LXX. And it follows): What Jeremiah the Prophet spoke to all the people of Judah and to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying. In the fourth year of the reign of King Jehoiakim, son of Josiah and father of Jeconiah, Nebuchadnezzar became the ruler in Babylon, and it happened that the year which was the first for Nebuchadnezzar in Babylon was the fourth for King Jehoiakim in Jerusalem. Finally, in the eighth year of his reign, Jechoniah, along with his mother and the princes, was led into captivity, having only reigned for three months after the death of his father, Joachim. However, Joachim was killed in the eleventh year of his reign in Jerusalem (2 Kings 24).
