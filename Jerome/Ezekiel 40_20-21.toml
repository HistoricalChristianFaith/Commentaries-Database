(Verse 20, 21.) He also measured the gate of the outer court that faced north, both in length and width. It had three rooms on each side, and its front and vestibule were the same size as those of the gate that faced east. The gate was fifty cubits long and twenty-five cubits wide, and its windows, vestibule, and carvings were all the same size as those of the gate that faced east. There were seven steps in its ascent, and a vestibule before it. And there was a gate of the inner court opposite the gate to the north and east. And it was measured from gate to gate, one hundred cubits. Seventy: And he brought me to the north gate and behold, a gate facing the outer court. And it was measured, its length and its width, with its three sides here, and three there, and its threshing floor, and its rooms (which it did not have in Hebrew) and its palm tree. And it was made in the measurement of the gate facing east: its length was fifty cubits, and its width was twenty-five cubits. And its windows and palm trees were like the gate that faced east. And it had seven steps leading up to it, with palm trees on the inside. And the inner gate of the courtyard faced the gate of the north (which is not mentioned in Hebrew, like the gate that faces east). And the courtyard was measured from gate to gate, a hundred cubits. What the Hebrew words "thee," "elau," and "elamoth" mean, we have already explained in more detail. But our translation will teach you their meaning in the present context. However, there was a man whose cord was in his hand, and also the gate of the outer court of the north, or he brought the prophet through the gate of the north to the outer court. In which it is to be considered that it is first introduced through the gate of the north, secondly, through the gate of the south, thirdly, through the gate of the east. For from the north evil flames are kindled upon the inhabitants of the earth. And it is clear that the one who dwells on the earth, and is not a stranger or a foreigner, is exposed to the spears of him who comes from the north, whose spears are on fire, which, according to the Apostle, are extinguished by the shield of faith. And towards the North, the outer courtyard is called; but towards the South, that is, towards the South, it is not outside, but inside. For the Scripture says: And he brought me to the inner court by the South gate, which is also found written in the Eastern courtyard. For the first one entered with power, trampling underfoot the North, and by the fiftieth and twenty-fifth number, reached the top of the hundredth; then he was brought in to the South side, and expelled the cold of the North: and then he reached perfect power, that is, the Eastern gate, where the sun of justice rises, and through which only the high priest enters. And this must be noted, that while there are four cardinal directions, the western gate is not mentioned, about which it is written in the beginning of the sixty-seventh psalm: Make a way for Him who ascends in the West, the Lord is His name (Psalm 7:5); so that after we prepare a way for the Lord and fulfill what John the Baptist proclaims in the wilderness: Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight His paths (Matthew 3:3), we may be able to hear what is said in the last part of the same psalm: Sing to God, sing praises to the Lord, who ascends above the highest heavens to the East (Psalm 68:33). But what is said about the three chambers in this passage, three on one side and three on the other, teaches us that both the letter and the spirit, as well as understanding in both literal and figurative sense, pertain to the sacraments of the Trinity. And what is said about the front and the vestibule according to the measurement of the previous gate signifies the Eastern gate, which is called 'first' not in order but in merit. And it had, it says, fifty cubits in length and twenty-five in width, so that eternal rest might be demonstrated after fifty weeks following seven weeks: extending during the day of resurrection to the kingdoms of heaven, in which true rest is found. But in twenty-five, of which number we spoke earlier, let the measurement of the five senses be preserved through the five orders of the square, of which one is adapted to length and another to width, so that in length there may be rest and delight of a more sacred knowledge; in width, a demonstration of present things that pertain to the senses. And it is inferred: And its windows, and vestibules, and sculptures, or as the Seventy added, palm trees, were according to the measurement of the gate that looked towards the East, this is subtly indicated, that whoever is positioned at the entrance of virtues, enters three and three chambers, recognizes the front and vestibule of the measurement of the previous gate, comes to them, and sees what has been most abundantly received in the Eastern gate. Furthermore, what follows: And there was a seven-step ascent, and a vestibule before it, or within it, this has the meaning that through the seven steps of the week, and the lamps that are lit from the face of the North, and the Jewish ceremonies to which God gave commandments that are not good, and the justifications in which they do not live, we ascend to higher things and to its vestibule, that is, to the gates, for which the Seventy Elamites translated. The vestibule before the gate is both interior and exterior. Not only is there one gate to the North, which is called the outer gate, but there is also another inner gate, which resembles the Eastern gate, as the Seventy have clearly stated. And the inner gate of the court faces the gate to the North, just as the gate that faced the East. And the distance from the outer gate to the inner gate of the same North is one hundred cubits, so that by means of these steps and measurements, we may be able to reach the inner gate by departing from the outer gate, as has been said in the explanation of the numbers.
