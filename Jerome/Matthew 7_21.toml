(Verse 21.) Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven. As he said before, those who have a garment of good life should not be received on account of the wickedness of their teachings: so now he asserts the opposite, that even faith should not be given to those who, although they possess the integrity of faith, live wickedly and destroy the integrity of doctrine with evil deeds. For both the work is necessary for the servants of God, so that both the work is confirmed by speech, and speech is confirmed by works. This statement may seem contrary to that: No one can say, 'Jesus is Lord,' except in the Holy Spirit (1 Cor. 12:3). But it is customary for the sayings of the Scriptures to be taken for actions, as it is immediately approved in the following passages, refuting those who boast of having knowledge of the Lord without works, and they hear from the Savior: Depart from me, you workers of iniquity, I do not know you (Luke 13). And the Apostle speaks in this sense: They profess to know God, but by their deeds they deny Him (Titus 1:16).
