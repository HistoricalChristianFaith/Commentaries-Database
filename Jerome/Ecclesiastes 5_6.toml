"In
spite of all dreams, futility and idle chatter, rather: Fear God! "The Hebrews explain this passage in great detail, and
in the following way: and you should not do the things detailed above, about
which he has already spoken, lest you believe too readily in dreams. For when you see different things, your mind
will be troubled by many fears throughout your night's rest, or aroused by
promises, you despise those things that are dream-like. You should only fear God. For he, who believes in dreams, gives himself
over to vanities and nonsense. Another
meaning of this passage is, since I have said and admonished, "you should
not let your mouth bring guilt on your flesh", and to seek this or that
excuse; I introduce this now, since in the dream of that life, and in the
appearance, shade, cloud in which we live, we are able to find many things,
which seem true to life to us and excuse our sins. Therefore I advise that you beware that
alone, lest you think God is absent, but fear Him, and know He is present in
all your toil, and do not force yourself to be hidden in free will, but want
whatever it is that you do.
