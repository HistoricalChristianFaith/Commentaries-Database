(Verse 11) Behold, all of you who kindle fire, girded with flames, walk in the light of your fire, and in the flames that you have kindled: it is made by my hand, you will sleep in sorrows.  LXX: Behold, all of you who kindle fire, and strengthen the flame; walk in the light of your fire, and in the flame that you have kindled; these things have been made for you because of me. You will sleep in mourning. Exhortation is useless, and there is no hope of salvation after wicked deeds. All have turned aside, together they have become useless; there is none who does good, there is not even one (Psalm 14:3); all light their own fire and prepare their own torches. For they are like a bundle of dry grass, wood, straw, thorns, and thistles, which will be consumed by eternal fire. Hence it is also written in Proverbs: Fire thrives where there are many logs (Proverbs 26:20). But if a small spark can ignite a large material, how much destruction can a great flame cause? It is also said in the Letter to the Hebrews, concerning the land which produces thorns and thistles, that it is worthless, cursed, and its end is to be burned (Hebrews 6:8). Therefore, those who are girded with flames and surrounded, and have made the fire strong in themselves, are provoked to salvation, and it is said to them: Walk in the light of your fire; and in the flames that you have ignited, so that they may learn the power of God in punishment and suffering, and return to salvation. However, it signifies the devastation of the Jewish people, who were handed over to the Romans, and who continue to bear the yoke of captivity. For all these things have been done by the hand of Christ, and they will sleep in sadness and sorrow; because they did not want to receive the Son of God with either kindness or torment. He speaks to them, saying: Go into the eternal fire, which has been prepared for the devil and his angels (Matt. 25:41). This is also what the Apostle says: Wrath has come upon you to the end (1 Thess. 2:16). In this chapter, we learn that according to the quality of sin, each person kindles a fire for themselves. And just as in the same location, and if it can be said, in the same bed, some are healthy while others are burning with the heat of fever, feeling different torments due to the diversity of bodily fluids and phlegm: so the fire that is kindled by sinners has its material in sins and iniquity, of which it is written: Evil will burn like a fire, and like dry grass it will be consumed by fire (Isaiah 9:18).
