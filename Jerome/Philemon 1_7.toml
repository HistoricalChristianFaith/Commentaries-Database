"For we have had great joy and consolation in your love, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through you, brother." He emphasizes and teaches more fully why he said, "I give thanks to my God always remembering you in my prayers." It was worthy indeed to give thanks to God for the love of Philemon, who had refreshed the internal affection of the heart and the deep recesses of the saints by receiving them. And this is the apostolic idiom; to always call it "hearts," wanting to show the fullness of love in the mind. Thus, rejoicing with those who were rejoicing, and believing himself to have been refreshed with those who had rested, he has a joy not transient and light, and one that might happen by chance; but great, and as love was to Philemon, eminent, increased by the consolation descending upon Philemon's love, full of the Father of mercies and the God of all consolation.
