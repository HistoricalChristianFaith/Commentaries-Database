But also let our people learn to lead in good works for necessary uses, that they may not be unfruitful. He had said above: Send Zenas, the teacher of the law, and Apollo and care for them that nothing be wanting to them. Since therefore a hidden answer might arise, so that anyone who reads this Epistle, not Titus only, might ask whence he should supply those who had no provision for their journey, he solved this difficulty and removed every obstacle by saying: But also let our people learn to lead in good works for necessary uses, that they may not be unfruitful. He calls our own those who had believed in Christ, who, because they were Christ's, deserved rightly to be called both Paul's and Titus's. You have, he says, the power over the disciples; teach them not to be unfruitful, but to serve as evangelists and apostolic men, who serve with good works, and to serve not in any causes, but in necessary uses, for having food and clothing ((or clothing)), let us be content with these (1 Timothy 6:8); and those who serve the altar should live by the altar; and those who have become participants in our spiritual things should share their carnal goods with us. And lest they easily despise either the letter of Paul or the instruction of Titus, he calls those who do not minister to the evangelists unfruitful. And Solomon himself says in Proverbs: But the fruit of charity (Prov. 3:12). And Paul himself first calls charity the fruit of the spirit (Gal. 5). But charity is especially proven in communication and in ministry. That they may not be unfruitful. For every tree that does not produce good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire (Mat. 5:10). But I say this: he who sows sparingly will also reap sparingly. To not give necessary support to apostolic men and evangelizers of Christ is to condemn oneself to sterility.
