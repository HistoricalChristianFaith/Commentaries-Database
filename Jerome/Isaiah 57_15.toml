Thus says the Lord, who is exalted and sublime, who dwells in the heights and is holy in the saints, though not as in a locality but in the merit of those in whom he lives, one of whom said in the Psalms: “I will exalt you, O Lord, for you have raised me.” … It is not to be understood from this that God is elevated by human speech but that God can be exalted also in the humble, according to what was said elsewhere: “God has become my salvation.” … Moreover, just as wisdom does not enter a wicked soul, neither does it dwell in a body subjected to sins. In this way does the holy One dwell in saints. And wherever there is filth, purity cannot live.… For Christ does not dwell in earthly places but in regions above the heavens, which proclaim the glory of the Lord.
