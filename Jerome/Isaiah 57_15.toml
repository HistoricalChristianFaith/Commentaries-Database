Thus says the Lord, who is exalted and sublime, who dwells in the heights and is holy in the saints, though not as in a locality but in the merit of those in whom he lives, one of whom said in the Psalms: “I will exalt you, O Lord, for you have raised me.” … It is not to be understood from this that God is elevated by human speech but that God can be exalted also in the humble, according to what was said elsewhere: “God has become my salvation.” … Moreover, just as wisdom does not enter a wicked soul, neither does it dwell in a body subjected to sins. In this way does the holy One dwell in saints. And wherever there is filth, purity cannot live.… For Christ does not dwell in earthly places but in regions above the heavens, which proclaim the glory of the Lord.

(Verse 15) For thus says the high and lofty One who inhabits eternity, whose name is Holy: I dwell in the high and holy place, with him who has a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite. LXX: Thus says the high and lofty One who inhabits eternity, whose name is Holy: I dwell in the high and holy place, and also with him who is of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite. The prophetic speech began against the people of the Jews, whose leaders he accused of being blind spies, mute dogs, ignorant shepherds, wicked sons, and the offspring of adulterers and prostitutes. After this, he came to Jerusalem, to which he reproached for its immorality, because it had spread its bed to its lovers, and had openly welcomed and adorned itself with all idols, and had sent envoys far away, in order to enjoy foreign lovers as well. With the rebuke finished, he came to those who trust in the Lord, and to whom he had promised to possess the land and the mountain, and for whom he had commanded the journey to be prepared for their return; undoubtedly the Apostles, in whose preaching they believed from both peoples. Hence he begins with the praises of God and testifies in the following discourse what he promised concerning the return of his people. For thus says the exalted and sublime Lord, who dwells in the highest places and is Holy in the Holy, not by place, but by the merit of those in whom he dwells, of whom one says in the psalm: I will exalt you, Lord, for you have upheld me (Ps. 29:1). And again: Exalt Yourself, O Lord, You who judge the earth (Ps. XCIII, 2); not so that God is lifted up by human words, but according to what is said elsewhere: The Lord has become my salvation (Ps. CXVII, 21), let Him also be exalted by the humble. He resists the proud and gives grace to the humble (James IV): so that He may lift them up and make them dwell in the heights. For the Lord is exalted, and He looks upon the lowly (Ps. CXXXVII, 6). And in the Gospel the angels cry out: Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace (Luke II, 14). And again in the Psalms: Praise the Lord from the heavens: praise him in the highest. And not only does the Most High dwell in the highest, but the Holy One also dwells in the holy. As it is said elsewhere: Be holy; for I am holy. And just as wisdom does not enter into a perverse soul, nor does it dwell in a body subject to sin: so the holy one dwells in the holy; and wherever there are impurities, purity cannot dwell, as the holy one says to the Lord: But you inhabit the holy place, the praise of Israel. And we also dare to say in prayer: Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. And in the second psalm we read: He who dwells in heaven shall laugh at them, and the Lord shall mock them (Ps. II, 4). For Christ does not dwell in those who are earthly, but in those who are supercelestial, who proclaim the glory of the Lord, of whom it is said: He shall hear him from his holy heaven (Ps. XIX, 7). And again: The heavens are the Lord's heavens (Ps. XIII, 16): in which sense even Moses, the servant of God, agrees with the same voice: Behold the heavens of the Lord thy God, and the heaven of heavens (Deut. X); which we must certainly not understand in the Jewish manner, that God is confined to any place and dwells only in heaven, for he is everywhere present and all things are contained by him: but by heavens, let us rightly understand the highest ones, the Saints and the Virtues. For this is the one who dwells in heaven, of whom it is written in the Gospel: No one ascends to heaven unless he descends from heaven, the Son of Man who is in heaven (John 3:13). This one finds rest in the holy and dwells with the humble and those who are contrite in spirit. Of them, it is said: A crushed spirit is a sacrifice to God; a contrite and humbled heart, O God, you will not despise (Psalm 51:19). He himself gives patience to the weak, so that they may endure tribulation while being placed in narrow circumstances, with hope for the future. He himself gives life, especially to those who were dead by sin. Of whom it is said: With you is the fountain of life (Ps. XXXV, 10) . He who speaks in the Gospel: I am the way, the truth, and the life (John XIV, 6) .
