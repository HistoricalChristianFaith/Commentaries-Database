(Chapter 64, Verses 1 and following.) Oh, that you would tear open the heavens and come down, so that the mountains would quake before you! As when fire kindles brushwood and the fire causes water to boil, to make your name known to your adversaries, so that the nations might tremble at your presence! When you did awesome deeds that we did not expect, you came down, the mountains quaked at your presence. Chapter 70: If you open the heavens, trembling will seize the mountains from you, and they will melt like wax before fire, and the fire will consume your adversaries, and your name will be made known among your adversaries, and the nations will tremble at your presence. When you have done glorious things, the mountains will tremble because of you. For our enemies have trampled your sanctuary, and we have become like those in the beginning, when your name was not invoked upon us. Therefore, we implore and say: Oh, that you would tear open the heavens and come down; that you, who are always promised, would finally fulfill your promises. But this was said at that time when the Saviour had not yet come, nor had he taken upon himself a human nature and substance from a virgin's womb in order to save humanity: so that as we have borne the image of the earthy, we may bear the image of the heavenly (1 Corinthians 15). But if you were to do it, they say, and the heavens were to open up, or even the heavens, at the coming of your majesty, would flow down, or if trembling were to seize the mountains, and they were to be consumed, as wax is consumed by fire. And the heavens were opened before Ezekiel, and he saw a great vision (Ezek. I). But even Moses, in the blessings of Deuteronomy, implores: May the Lord open his good treasury, the heavens, to give you blessing (Deut. XXVIII). And in the Gospel (Matt. III), it is said (or it is testified) that John the Baptist saw the heavens opened, and the Holy Spirit descending upon the Lord in the form of a dove. But the mountains, which at the coming of the Lord, of whom it is written: God is a consuming fire (Deut. IV, 24), will be consumed like wax and melt, are the opposing powers, and all those who rise up against the knowledge of God. Concerning them, it is also sung in the ninety-sixth psalm: The earth saw and trembled. The mountains melted like wax before the Lord, before the Lord of all the earth (Psalm 96:4, 5). For if you were to come down and fulfill your promises, the waters of the sea would dry up and their saltiness would be consumed by fire (according to Symmachus). This is also written in another psalm: Like smoke disappears, let them disappear; like wax melts before fire, let the sinners perish before God (Psalm 68:2). And it should be noted that when the waters of the sea are consumed by divine fire, then the name of the Lord Savior becomes known to his enemies. Concerning this, it is said in the sixty-seventh psalm: The tongue of your dogs is from enemies themselves, so that those who had not sensed his kindness may know by the destruction and their own captivity of their city. And the nations will be troubled by his presence, or rather, as it is more significantly said in Hebrew, they will be moved: so that those who were previously immobile may come to salvation. And when he has done wonderful things and shown signs in the Gospel, which he once showed in Egypt and in the wilderness, they will confess that they cannot bear the glory of his coming, either because trembling has seized the mountains. And beautifully, as if those who had prayed above were heard: Oh, that you would tear open the heavens and come down, that the mountains would melt away at your presence, afterwards they say: You have descended, the Word has become flesh and dwelt among us, truly Emmanuel, which is interpreted as God with us. And therefore all the mountains have flowed down from your face, of which we have spoken above. The Hebrews have interpreted this passage as follows: Thus the fire will burn the wicked, just as water boils with the heat of fire; for they do not understand the word Amasim () as destruction and decay, as others have interpreted, but they understand it as referring to the wicked.
