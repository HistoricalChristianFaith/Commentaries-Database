(Verse 17 and following) But when you fast, anoint your head and wash your face, so that you may not appear to be fasting to men, but to your Father who is in secret: and your Father who sees in secret will repay you. Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where rust and moth destroy, and where thieves break in and steal. He is speaking according to the custom of the province of Palestine, where they usually anoint their heads on festive days. Therefore, he commanded us to show ourselves joyful and festive when we fast. Those reading it from the Psalmist: The oil of the sinner shall not anoint my head (Ps. 140:5), on the contrary they want the good oil, about which it is said elsewhere: God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows (Ps. 44:8). And He commands that we, who practice virtues, should anoint the principal (ἡγεμονικὸν) oil of our hearts with spiritual oil.
