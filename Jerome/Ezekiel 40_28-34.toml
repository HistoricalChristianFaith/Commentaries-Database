(Versed. 28 seqq.) And he led me into the inner courtyard by the eastern way: and he measured the gate according to the upper measurements; its chamber and its front and its vestibule as before, and its windows and its vestibules all around, with a length of fifty cubits and a width of twenty-five cubits. And its vestibule, that is, the outer courtyard (which the Septuagint and Symmachus have placed as the inner courtyard); and carved palm trees on its front, both here and there, and with eight steps leading up to it. » From the Northern region, into whose courtyard only seven steps were ascended, one passes to the Southern gate and courtyard of the same region, to which not only seven, as mentioned above, but eight steps are ascended: namely, so that we may pass from the Old to the New; and to speak more clearly, through the patriarchs and prophets, we come to the apostles: so that in one week there is an octet in the other. But now it comes to the last, or rather to the highest, and introduces the prophet through the way of the inner gate, or through the courtyard, to which one goes through the Eastern gate. In this place, according to the Septuagint, the way is only mentioned; in the Northern and Southern regions, it is completely silent, so that we can understand that in the Eastern region only is that way to be understood, which says: I am the way, the truth and the life (John 14:6). For through Him we come to the Father, and it is written about Him: Blessed are the undefiled in the way (Psalm 119:1), who think nothing left of Christ, but their faith is pure and not in any way polluted by the stain of heretics. Likewise, the number of rooms, facades, entrances, windows, and the amount of light in them, as well as the same measurement of length and width: fifty by twenty-five cubits, preserving the sacredness, and the vestibule of its gate or inner courtyard, which is placed outside according to the Hebrew, so that everything is enclosed by the Eastern light, according to what is written: 'There is no one who can hide from its heat' (Psalm 19:7). But if we understand the atrium both externally and internally: thus it must be understood that God is both encompassing and indwelling, saying through the prophet: He who holds the heavens in the palm of his hand, and the earth in his fist (Isaiah XL, 12): so that everything may be seen as included in him. And again: Heaven is my throne, and the earth is the footstool of my feet (Isaiah LXVI, 1), so that he is believed to exist within all things: according to that verse from Virgil's Aeneid (Book VI).

In the beginning, the sky and the earth, and the liquid fields, And the shining globe of the moon, and the Astra of Titania, A Spirit nourishes them within: and infused throughout their limbs, The Mind moves the whole mass, and mingles itself with the great body.

And when, through the weapons of justice, on the right and left, through glory and disgrace, through good and bad reputation, through praise and blame, we have obtained victory over this world (2 Cor. 6): then palms are given to us on both sides, which neither joys have changed, nor sorrow, nor prosperity, nor adversity have overcome: and not by seven (or eight) degrees, as in the region of the North, nor by seven and eight, as in the South, are we contained, but by only eight (or seven) degrees do we ascend to the highest: because the number eight is sufficient for us, that is, the sacrament of the Gospel; so that we may say with the Apostle: And though we have known Christ according to the flesh, yet now we know him no more (2 Cor. 5:16), it is understood, according to the flesh.
