(Verse 12.) And Judas, having been comforted, went up to those who were shearing his sheep: himself, and his shepherd Hirah the Odollamite. For the shepherd is read as a friend. But the word is ambiguous, because with the same letters both names are written: but the friend Ree is read as the shepherd Roe.
