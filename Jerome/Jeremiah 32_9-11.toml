(v. 9 seqq.) But I understood that it was the word of the Lord, and I bought a field from my cousin Anameel, who is in Anathoth, and I weighed out the silver, seven shekels and ten silver coins. And I wrote it in a book, and signed it, and called witnesses, and weighed the silver on a scale. And I received the sealed deed, the terms and conditions, and the external seals. It was indeed difficult and almost absurd, worthy of laughter, for the one who was prophesying the imminent capture of Jerusalem and the captivity of all, to buy a field in Anathoth that he would never possess. But I understood, he said, that it was the word of the Lord and that my purchase should be connected with the argument and prophecy of the Lord; and therefore I obeyed his command to make the purchase; nor was it in vain that God spoke to me about such a matter: and I weighed out seventeen shekels of silver, which we convert into staters. Now a shekel has twenty obols, as it is written in the final volume of Ezekiel (Ezek. 45). And the Prophet bought it for seventeen shekels, a number in which the boy David, servant of the Lord, sang on the day when the Lord delivered him from the hand of all his enemies and from the hand of Saul, and said: I will love you, O Lord, my strength; the Lord is my rock, my fortress, and my deliverer. My God, my helper, and I will hope in Him: my protector, and the horn of my salvation (Psalm XVII, 1). The number ten indicates a mystical number, as shown in the Decalogue which was written on stone tablets by the finger of God, and the days of fasting and propitiation in the seventh month (Exodus XIII). We also prove, with numerous testimonies from the Scriptures, that the number seven, in which true Sabbath and rest exist, is holy. I could have provided at least a few examples, if it were not pointless to teach what is already known. Therefore, in this number, a possession is bought by a prophet and priest, and it is written in a book and signed, and witnesses are brought forth, and silver is carefully weighed out, so that all the rights of sale and purchase are preserved, and there is a certain ownership, confirmed by agreements and promises. Or let those who try to claim false wills, and sometimes even wills with witnesses, listen to this.
