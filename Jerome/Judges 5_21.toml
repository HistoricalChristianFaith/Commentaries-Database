(Judges 5:21) The River Kishon swept away their corpses. For there is the place of their downfall; and it is as if one were to ask, where? and the answer is: In the River Kishon, that is, in the Red Sea. Hence it follows: The river Kishon, the river of Kishon. It calls the River Kishon the Red Sea. For Kishon means of old, because ancient miracles were performed there, when the children of Israel passed over and the Egyptians perished. And because the Red Sea vomited forth the dead Egyptians, so that the Israelites saw their dead bodies on the shore of the sea, and the same bodies were carried away by the fish and sea creatures: therefore the River Kishon swept away their corpses, so that the fish and sea creatures of the Red Sea might eat the bodies of the Canaanites, in place of the bodies of the Egyptians taken from them. Trample, my soul, the mighty ones. This is what Deborah, representing all of Israel, says, that they may crush the necks of their strongest enemies with one mind, that is, the strongest ones: as it is also written in the book of Joshua about the five kings of the Canaanites (Josh. 10:24).
