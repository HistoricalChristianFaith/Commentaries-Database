(Vers. 15 seqq.) It is a creature that I saw beside the river Chobar. And when the Cherubim walked, the wheels also went beside them. And when the Cherubim lifted their wings to be lifted up from the ground, the wheels did not resist, but were also beside them. When they stood, they stood, and when they were lifted up, they were lifted up. For the spirit of life was in them. All things live to God and feel their Creator. For God is not the God of the dead but of the living (Matthew 22:32). And all the bodies of the wheels are full of eyes  (Supra I) . And in the psalm it is said: The heavens declare the glory of God, and the firmament proclaims the work of his hands. Day unto day speaks forth speech, and night unto night reveals knowledge  (Ps. 19:1-2) . The sun also and the moon, the sea and the rivers, the mountains and hills praise God, and in their own cycle they revolve through the years, and we perceive the order of the heavens on earth, so that, by preserving the order of the ancient law, they may turn and run; and let us not see anything new upon the earth. But when it is said, 'It is an animal, which I saw by the river Chobar' (Ecclesiastes 1)', Scripture shows that we should understand the same thing in the interpretation of 'animal' as we understood above.
