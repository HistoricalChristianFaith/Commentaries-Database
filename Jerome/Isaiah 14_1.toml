(Chapter XIV - Verse 1) The time is near for it to come, and its days will not be prolonged. It says that the time is pressing and that it must be captured from the enemies. After the captivity of Jerusalem, not much time passed, and it was devastated by the Medes and Persians.

For the Lord will have mercy on Jacob and will still choose Israel and cause them to rest on their own land. This is more fully explained by Zephaniah: Rejoice, O daughter of Zion; shout aloud, O Israel; be glad and exult with all your heart, O daughter of Jerusalem; for the Lord has taken away your judgments; he has turned away your enemies (Zephaniah 3:14-15). This signifies the time when King Cyrus of Persia allowed the captive people of Jerusalem to return. Read the book of Ezra (Ezra 1), Haggai (Haggai 1) and Zechariah (Zechariah 1), when under Zerubbabel, the high priest Joshua, Ezra, and Nehemiah, the altar, the Temple, and the walls of the city were rebuilt.
