(Verse 42, 43.) Give to him who asks of you, and do not turn away from him who wants to borrow from you. You have heard that it was said: Love your neighbor and hate your enemy. If we understand this saying to mean only about almsgiving, it cannot apply to most of the poor. But even if the rich give constantly, they cannot give constantly. Therefore, after the good of almsgiving, instructions are given to the apostles, that is, to the teachers, so that those who have received for free may give for free (Matthew 10). Money of this kind never runs out; but the more it is given, the more it is doubled. And when it waters the fields under its control, the spring's waters never dry up.
