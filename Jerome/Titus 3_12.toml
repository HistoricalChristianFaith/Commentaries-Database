When you come, please hurry to me in Nicopolis, Artemas or Tychicus. I have decided to spend the winter there. In the beginning of this letter we read, "The reason I left you in Crete was to straighten out what was left unfinished and to appoint elders in every town, as I directed you." So that after Paul's departure, the Cretans, who had recently believed and were not left as orphans, but had an apostolic man who would correct what appeared to be lacking. Therefore, because after the foundation of other churches it was necessary for Titus, who would build up the building, he writes to him, that he would send Arteman or Tychicus to Crete, one of the two who were with him, to fulfill his position: he himself would come to Nicopolis, testifying that he would winter there. We approve Paul's paternal affections towards the Cretans from this. Titus has a necessary ministry in the Gospel: however, he does not want him to come to him before Artemas or Tychicus, his successor, arrives in his place. Nicopolis itself is so named because of Augustus' victory, which he won there against Antony and Cleopatra.
