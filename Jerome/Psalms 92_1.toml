“It is good to confess to the Lord, to sing praise to your name, most High.” The psalmist did not say that it is good to sing and after that confess. Note the order: it is good to confess, and it is good to sing. First repent and wash away sin with your tears; then sing to the Lord. “It is good to confess to the Lord”—not to people but to God. Confess your sins to him who is able to heal you. “And to sing praise to your name, most High.”
