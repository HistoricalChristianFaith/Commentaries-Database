Whatever righteousness that we who are unclean in ourselves appear to possess may be compared with the rag of a menstruating woman, for which Theodotion uses the Hebrew word eddim and which Symmachus translates with the Greek term kyēseōn, that is, “of she who gives birth,” while Aquila uses the word martyriōn, that is, “of the witnesses,” from when a woman is proven to be a virgin by the issue of blood during her first act of marital intercourse. “And we fall,” Isaiah continues, “like leaves from a tree, which are then dispersed by the wind on account of our iniquities.” It must be borne in mind here that the righteousness that is in the law will be called unclean in comparison with the purity of the gospel. For what was previously glorified is no longer glorified, due to the surpassing glory of the latter. Hence, the apostle Paul, who fulfilled everything according to the righteousness that is in the law, says that he considered everything as loss, or dung, in order to gain Christ, on account of the magnificent knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ, and so that he may not be found having the righteousness in him that is from the law but the righteousness from God that comes through faith in Christ. For there is a righteous person who dies in his righteousness if, after receiving the truth of the gospel, he chooses to use legal shadows and to pursue righteousness in a manner that is not righteous.

(Verse 6.) Behold, you are angry, and we have sinned; we have always been in them, and we shall be saved. And we have become like the unclean, all of us, like the soiled cloths of our entire righteousness. And we have fallen like leaves, and our iniquities have swept us away like the wind. LXX: Behold, you are angry, and we have all sinned; therefore, we have erred and have become like all the unclean, like a cloth that sits, all our righteousnesses: and we have flowed away like leaves because of our iniquities: as the wind will take us away. A disorder of priorities. Not because you are angry, we have sinned; but because we have sinned, you are angry. And because we have sinned, you are angry with us, O Lord: therefore we have gone astray and have left the right path. Whether according to the Hebrew, who we have always been in sins, we shall be saved only by your mercy, who we are defiled through ourselves; and whatever righteousness we appear to have is compared to the rag of a sitting or menstruating woman. For which Theodotion put the Hebrew word Eddim (), which Symmachus interpreted as κυουσῶν, that is, of those giving birth; Aquila as μαρτυριῶν, that is, of testimonies: when blood is approved in the first marital union of a virgin. And we have fallen away, he says, like leaves from trees, which are scattered by the blasts of the winds because of our iniquities. In this, it should be considered that the righteousness which is in the Law is called impurity in comparison to the purity of the Gospel. For what was once glorified is not glorified anymore because of the surpassing glory. Therefore, the apostle Paul, who had fulfilled everything according to the righteousness which is in the Law, says that he has considered all things as loss in order to gain Christ (Philippians III), and because of the surpassing knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ, for whom he considers everything as worthless, so that he may gain Christ and be found in Him, not having his own righteousness which is from the Law, but the righteousness which comes from God through faith in Christ. For he is just who dies in his own righteousness (Eccles. 7), if after the truth of the Gospel he wishes to exercise legal shadows, and not to pursue what is justly just. Hence, according to the wisest Solomon, every man seems just to himself, when he is engaged in the law: to whom the Lord speaks in the Gospel: 'You are they who justify yourselves before men' (Luke 16:15). Which Paul, in fleeing, says: 'I am conscious of nothing, yet I am not justified in this' (2 Cor. 4:4). But the righteousness of God, of which Solomon speaks: Understand true righteousness. Therefore there is another righteousness which does not have truth, and this is true righteousness, about which it is said again in the Gospel: Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness (Matthew 5:6). Many prophets and righteous people desired to see it, and did not see it. But Abraham saw this righteousness and rejoiced, not following the dead letter, but the life-giving spirit. No wonder these things are said about men, since even the stars, compared to the justice of God, are not clean, and what perverse thing He has devised against His angels. If anyone, therefore, after the Gospel of Christ and the coming of the Son of God, observes the ceremonies of the pedagogue Law, let him hear the people confessing that all that righteousness is compared to the filthiest rag, to which even Esther compares her diadem, which was the emblem of royal power, which she wore not by choice, but by necessity: You know my necessity: for I detest the sign of my pride which is over my head in the days of my appearance: I abhor it like a menstrual cloth: nor do I wear it on my days of rest.
