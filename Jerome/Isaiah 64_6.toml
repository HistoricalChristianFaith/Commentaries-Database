Whatever righteousness that we who are unclean in ourselves appear to possess may be compared with the rag of a menstruating woman, for which Theodotion uses the Hebrew word eddim and which Symmachus translates with the Greek term kyēseōn, that is, “of she who gives birth,” while Aquila uses the word martyriōn, that is, “of the witnesses,” from when a woman is proven to be a virgin by the issue of blood during her first act of marital intercourse. “And we fall,” Isaiah continues, “like leaves from a tree, which are then dispersed by the wind on account of our iniquities.” It must be borne in mind here that the righteousness that is in the law will be called unclean in comparison with the purity of the gospel. For what was previously glorified is no longer glorified, due to the surpassing glory of the latter. Hence, the apostle Paul, who fulfilled everything according to the righteousness that is in the law, says that he considered everything as loss, or dung, in order to gain Christ, on account of the magnificent knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ, and so that he may not be found having the righteousness in him that is from the law but the righteousness from God that comes through faith in Christ. For there is a righteous person who dies in his righteousness if, after receiving the truth of the gospel, he chooses to use legal shadows and to pursue righteousness in a manner that is not righteous.
