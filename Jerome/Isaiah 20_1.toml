(Chapter 20, Verse 1) In the year that Tharhaka came to Ashdod, when Sargon the king of Assyria sent him and fought against Ashdod and took it. At that time the Lord spoke by Isaiah the son of Amoz, saying, Go and loose the sackcloth from your waist and take off your sandals from your feet. And he did so, walking naked and barefoot. Then the Lord said, As my servant Isaiah has walked naked and barefoot for three years as a sign and a portent against Egypt and Cush. Thus the king of Assyria will threaten the captivity of Egypt, and the exile of Ethiopia, the young and old stripped and barefoot, with naked buttocks, the disgrace of Egypt. And they will be afraid and ashamed because of their hope in Ethiopia, and because of their glory in Egypt. And the inhabitants of this island will say on that day: Behold, this was our hope, to whom we fled for help, that he might deliver us from the face of the king of Assyria, and how will we be able to escape? We have set the whole content of this chapter, so that we may discuss each part separately. Azotus, which is called Ashdod in Hebrew, was a very powerful city in Palestine among the five cities. It was captured and held by Sargon, the king of the Assyrians, who is also known by seven names, by sending his general named Tartan. At the time when the neighboring city was captured, Isaiah is commanded to walk naked and barefoot, after taking off his sackcloth garment (for this was the prophetic attire of a people grieving for their sins) and his sandals, which the Greek translation calls caligas, thus symbolizing the captivity of Egypt and Ethiopia, who were allies of the Egyptians. In this way, just as Isaiah walked naked and showed his bare buttocks as a sign of disgrace to those who saw, all of Egypt and Ethiopia would become naked and bare, with nothing remaining on the land, as the Assyrians ravaged the region. Nor let anyone think that this is contrary to the previous happiness promised to the Egyptians, because there they are taught about future bliss after the evils. Here, however, the present captivity is narrated, through which Israel, Damascus, and the Philistines were devastated, and the right way to Egypt was taken, and both the Ethiopians and the Egyptians were conquered. And so that it does not seem ambiguous to anyone, let us consider the testimony of Isaiah himself: But when Sennacherib returned, he found the king of Assyria fighting against Libnah, for he had heard that he had departed from Lachish; and he heard about Tirhakah, the king of Ethiopia, saying, 'He has come out to fight against you.' (2 Kings 19:8-9). At the same time, we learn obedience from the prophets, because a noble man (for the Hebrews report that Isaiah was the father-in-law of Manasseh, the son of Hezekiah, king of Judah) did not hesitate to walk naked; but considering nothing more honorable than God's commands, he removed the sackcloth in which he had been clothed, and being stripped naked, he first had a tunic, and that itself made of haircloth. And when it is said: It shall be a sign and a wonder for three years upon Egypt and upon Ethiopia, it signifies that Egypt and Ethiopia shall be devastated by the Assyrians for three years. Then, he said, the inhabitant of this island, that is Jerusalem, which is battered by the waves of neighboring nations, will say: Is this our hope? And did we flee to them for help, who could not rescue themselves from the evil of captivity? Therefore, this is the order of God's providence, disposing of all human kind with ineffable judgment. In contrast, Israel hoped in Damascus against the wrath of God: let the city be destroyed, which offers assistance to the wicked against His will. Judas hoped in the Egyptians: and let Egypt be destroyed. The Egyptians put their trust in the Ethiopians: let the Ethiopians also be conquered by the Assyrians. The Assyrians became proud, considering victory to be not of God, but of their own strength: and let them be conquered by the Babylonians. Babylon raised its head against God: and let it be overcome by the Medes and Persians. The Persians and Medes persecuted the people of God to some extent, and a fierce ram scattered all peoples to the East and West; let Alexander the goat come and crush him under his feet. And he who is beyond measure upright, let him perish by poison, and let his kingdom be divided into parts; and when over a long period of time they have clashed against each other, with the Roman conquering, let it be plundered. The Roman himself, with teeth and claws of iron, tore the flesh of the saints, and with a bloody mouth, he mutilated: let the stone be cut out from the mountain without hands, and let it crush the first kingdom, most powerful and iron, then fragile and weak, like a potter's vessel (Daniel 2).
