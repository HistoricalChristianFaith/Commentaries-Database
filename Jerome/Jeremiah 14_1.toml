(Chapter XIVâ€”Verse 1) The word of the Lord came to Jeremiah concerning the words of drought. The anger of God is evident in everything. Therefore, the sun sets on sinners at noon, and the moon, stars, and other celestial bodies do not give their light (Amos VIII). It can be assumed that there was no rain during the time of the siege, so that the besieged would suffer from a lack of water. Truly, the city only has one source, the fountain of Siloam, and it does not have a continuous supply. And to this day, the lack of rainfall not only causes a scarcity of crops but also a shortage of drinking water.
