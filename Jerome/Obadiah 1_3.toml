“The pride of your heart has deceived you.” This is directed against the heretics. “You who dwell in the rock”—the rock frequently refers to the Lord or standing on something solid, as the prophet says, “He has placed my feet upon a rock.” To Peter he said, “You are Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church.” Nevertheless it is also frequently used in another way. Ezekiel says, “I will take the heart of stone out of your flesh.” In Matthew we read that God is able to raise up children of Abraham from these stones. Ultimately, since here it does not say the inhabitants are on top of the rocks but rather in the fissure of the rocks, those referred to here are like heresies that split the rock of Christ and the church.
