(Vers. 20 seqq.) And Judaea shall be inhabited forever, and Jerusalem from generation to generation; and I will cleanse their blood, which I have not cleansed: and the Lord will dwell in Zion. LXX: But Judaea shall be inhabited forever, and Jerusalem from generation to generation, and I will require their blood, which I have not yet avenged, and the Lord will dwell in Zion. It is not this Judaea, which we see desolate, that shall be inhabited forever; nor is it this Jerusalem, whose ruins we behold; but it is that Judaea, whose daughters have rejoiced and been glad in all the judgments of the Lord. And at the end of the fiftieth psalm we read: Do good, O Lord, in your good pleasure to Zion, that the walls of Jerusalem may be built up. In this province of confession and glory, and in this city where the peace of the Lord is seen, there will be an eternal dwelling, not in one, or in three, or in many generations, but from generation to generation, that is, in two generations of those who have believed, both from the Jews and from the Gentiles. And the Lord will cleanse the blood of all sins, which He had not cleansed before, so that He may cleanse them in the Gospel, whom He had left impure as sinners in the Law. For He has concluded all under sin, so that He may have mercy on all (Rom. 11); whether He avenges the blood of His servants, which they shed in martyrdom for the confession of His name. And the Lord will dwell in Zion, of which it is written: Its foundations are in the holy mountains; the Lord loves the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob (Ps. 68:1).
