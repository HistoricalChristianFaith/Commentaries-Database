(Verse 8.) And they went out quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy, running to tell his disciples. The women's minds were filled with mixed emotions, fear and joy: one because of the greatness of the miracle, the other out of longing for the risen one; and yet both stirred up a feminine fervor. They went to the apostles, so that through them the seed of faith might be scattered.
