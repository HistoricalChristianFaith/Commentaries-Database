(Verses 5, 6.) Do not go into the way of the Gentiles, and do not enter into the cities of the Samaritans: but go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel. This place is not contrary to the commandment which is afterwards said: Going, teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost  (Matt. 28:19) . Because this is before the resurrection, and that after the resurrection is the commandment. And it was necessary to announce the first coming of Christ to the Jews, so that they would not have a just excuse for rejecting Him; because He sent the apostles to the Gentiles and to the Samaritans. But according to the tropology, those of us who are called by the name of Christ are commanded not to walk in the error of the way of the gentiles and heretics, so that as their religion is separated, let their way of life be separated as well.
