"The
gentle words of the wise are heard above the shouts of a king over fools. "Whosoever you see in the Church declaiming and arousing
applause by whatever refinery or charm, he who shakes off his laughter and
incites the crowd to feigned happiness, know that this is a sign of
foolishness, equally of him who speaks, and of those who listen to him. For the words of the wise are heard in peace
and respectful silence. He who is
foolish and is powerful speaks to fools and cannot hear himself because of
either the noise of his own voice or that of the applauding crowd.
