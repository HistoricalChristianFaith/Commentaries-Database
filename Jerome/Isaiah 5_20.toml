It is of the same crime to call goodness, light and sweetness by contrary names as it is to apply the names of the virtues to evil, darkness and bitterness. This is directed against those who do not think it a sin to curse the good, nor consider it an offense to praise evil. The Jews called good evil, and light darkness, and sweetness bitterness, when they received Barabbas, thief and traitor, while crucifying Jesus, who came only for the lost sheep of the house of Israel, to save those who were dying. In Barabbas we can understand the devil, who though he was night and darkness, changed to appear as an angel of light. Hence the apostle said, “What participation does righteousness have with iniquity? What does light have in common with darkness? What agreement does Christ have with Belial?” For a lamp must not be taken and placed under a basket or a bed but should be set on a stand that it might illuminate everyone. Nor should a tree that bears evil fruit be called a good tree. Hence it is told with mystical language in Genesis that God separated the light from the darkness, both of which were born above the waters in the beginning. But the Savior himself testifies in the Gospel that he shall be called good: “The good shepherd lays down his life for his sheep.” He also calls himself light: “I am the light of the world.” And we say that he is the daily heavenly bread with which we are filled: “Taste and see how sweet is the Lord.” - "Commentary on Isaiah 2.5.20"
