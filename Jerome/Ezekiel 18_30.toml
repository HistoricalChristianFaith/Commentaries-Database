These words show us that the mind must not fail to believe in the promised blessings and give way to despair; and the soul once marked out for perdition must not refuse to apply remedies on the ground that its wounds are past curing.

(Verse 30.) Therefore, I will judge each one according to their ways, O house of Israel, says the Lord God. Whether they are from the multitude of nations or from the people of Israel who are being judged: God does not show partiality (Colossians 3:25), but each one will be rewarded according to their faith, and will be condemned for their wickedness and unbelief.
