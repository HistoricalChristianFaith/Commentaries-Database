(Verse 51) And behold, one of those who were with Jesus stretched out his hand and drew his sword, and striking the high priest's servant, cut off his ear. In another gospel, it is written that Peter did this with the same zeal as the other things. The servant of the high priest is also called Malchus: the ear that was cut off is the right one. By way of a passing remark, it should be said that Malchus, meaning the former king of the Jewish people, became a servant of the impious and devouring priests. And he may have lost his right ear, so that he hears all the worthlessness of letters in his left: but the Lord in those who wanted to believe from the Jews restored the right ear, and made them a royal and priestly people.
