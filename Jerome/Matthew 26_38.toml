What we said before about Christâ€™s suffering and what took place before it is also brought out in this chapter. It shows that the Lord, to test the fidelity of the human nature he had taken on, truly felt sorrowful. However, lest the suffering in his soul be overwhelming, he began to feel sorrowful over the events taking place just before his suffering. For it is one thing to feel sorrowful and another thing to begin to feel sorrowful. But he felt sorrowful, not because he feared the suffering that lay ahead and because he had scolded Peter for his timidity but because of the most unfortunate Judas and the falling away of all the apostles and the rejection by the Jewish people and the overturning of woeful Jerusalem. Jonah too became sad when the plant or ivy had withered, unwilling to have his booth disappear.

(Verse 38.) Then he said to them, My soul is sorrowful, even to death; wait here, and watch with me. The soul is saddened and not, however, by death, but is saddened even unto death, until he frees his apostles by his suffering. And what he commanded: wait here, and watch with me, he does not forbid sleep, the time of which was not imminent with danger, but he forbids sleep of unfaithfulness, and dulness of mind. Therefore, let those who suspect that Jesus took on an irrational soul declare how he could be saddened and know the time of sadness. Although even dumb animals die, they do not know the reasons or the time until which they must be saddened.
