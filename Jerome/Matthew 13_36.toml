(Verse 36) Then Jesus dismissed the crowds and went into the house. And his disciples came to him, saying, 'Explain to us the parable of the weeds of the field.' Jesus sent the crowds away and returned to the house, so that his disciples could come to him and privately ask him about the things that the people were not worthy to hear or understand. 'Explain to us the parable of the weeds of the field.'
