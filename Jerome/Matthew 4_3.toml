(Verse 3.) Say that these stones become bread. It is fittingly said to the hungry: say that these stones become bread. You are tempting him with two opposing arguments, O devil. If these stones can become bread at his command, then you are foolishly tempting someone of such great power. But if he cannot do it, then you are foolishly suspecting the Son of God. If you are the Son of God, say that these stones become bread.
