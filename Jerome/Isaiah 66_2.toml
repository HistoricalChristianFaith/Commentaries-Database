With the altar and earthly temple removed, which a human hand had built, the sacrifices of the Jews were also rightly removed, lest they say, perhaps, “We are not so foolish as to think that God can be enclosed in one place, but we will choose a different location for offering the sacrifices to God that are commanded in the law.” He who sits in heaven, therefore, the very Creator of the universe, who refuses to be held in an earthly temple, willingly adopts the person as his temple who is humble and meek and trembles at his word, according to the apostle, “But you are the temple of God, and the Holy Spirit dwells in you.”
