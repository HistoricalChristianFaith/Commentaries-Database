(Vers. 7, 8.) I left my house, I abandoned my inheritance: I gave my beloved soul into the hands of its enemies. My inheritance became like a lion in the forest: it roared against me, therefore I hated it. He who spoke in the Gospel: Rise, let us go from here (John 14:31). And again: Your house will be left desolate (Luke 13:35), here and also in the same prophet he threatens; and he says that he has done what he was going to do. For the inheritance of the Lord is Israel, and his inheritance is as a rope. But when he says: 'I have given my beloved soul into the hand of his enemies,' that means, I have the power to lay down my soul, and I have the power to take it up again (John 10:18). Indeed, the inheritance of the Lord, the people of the Jews, once rebelled against him like a lion in the forest: when they shouted with a loud voice against him in their suffering. And because they raised their voice against him, he therefore hated them, and rejected them, and what was once beloved and cherished is now called hateful.
