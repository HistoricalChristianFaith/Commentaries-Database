The watchman of the house of Israel can be understood as king or a prophet; the watchman of the church can be understood as to be the bishop or the presbyter who has been chosen by the people, in the reading of the Scriptures, recognizing and foreseeing what the future will hold, proclaiming to the people and correcting what is wrong.
