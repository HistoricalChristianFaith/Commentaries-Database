"A time
to acquire and a time to lose. A time to
keep and a time to throw away. "As is in many verses before the meaning is
the same here too, which is apparent before and following this verse, in that
he says: "A time to destroy and a time to build. 
" And then "A
time to rend and a time to mend. "Just
as the Synagogue is destroyed so that the Church can be built and schism is
only brought about by the law so that the Gospels are unified, because each
preacher has carried it out one by one, unifying from the law and the prophets
the testimonies of the arrival of the Lord. 
And thus there was a time for seeking and guarding Israel, a time for
losing and discarding it. Or perhaps in
fact a time for seeking a nation in the tribes and a time for losing the people
of the Jews. A time for guarding the
believers of the nations and a time for dismissing the faithless from
Israel. "A time for silence and a time for
speaking. "I think that the
Pythagoreans, whose discipline is to remain silent for five years and
afterwards to speak to learned men, took the origin of their decree from
this. Let us learn therefore and so
remain silent first, so that afterwards we open our mouths only to speak. Let us be silent for a set period and depend
on the utterances of our teacher. 
Nothing seems right to us unless we learn that after much silence we are
made into teachers by our pupils. Now
though instead of the world slipping day by day into a far worse situation, we
teach in churches what we do not know. 
And if by composing words or at the bidding of the devil, who is the
patron of madness, we have aroused the applause of the common people, then we
think we understand, (contrary to our conscience), what it is we were able to
dissuade others from. We do not learn all the arts without a teacher, only
those which are so common and easy that they don't require a tutor.
