“The foolish and bold woman comes to want bread.” What bread? Surely that bread which comes down from heaven. And he immediately adds, “The earthborn perish in her house, rush into the depths of hell.” Who are the earthborn that perish in her house? They of course who follow the first Adam, who is of the earth, and not the second, who is from heaven.
