“The hour will come in which all who are in the tombs shall hear the voice of the Son of God and shall come forth.” They shall hear with ears and come forth with feet. This Lazarus had already done. They shall, moreover, come forth from the tombs; that is, they who had been laid in the tombs, the dead, shall come and shall rise again from their graves. For the dew that God gives is healing to their bones. Then shall be fulfilled what God says by the prophet, “Go, my people, into your closets for a little while, until mine anger pass.” The closets signify the graves, out of which is brought forth which had been laid therein. And they shall come out of the graves like young mules free from the halter. Their heart shall rejoice, and their bones shall rise like the sun; all flesh shall come into the presence of the Lord, and he shall command the fishes of the sea; and they shall give up the bones which they had eaten; and he shall bring joint to joint, and bone to bone;104 and they who slept in the dust of the earth shall arise, some to life eternal, others to shame and everlasting confusion.

“The hairs of your head are numbered.” If the hairs, I suppose the teeth would be more easily numbered. But there is no object in numbering them if they are some day to perish. “The hour will come in which all who are in the tombs shall hear the voice of the Son of God and shall come forth.” … Then shall be fulfilled what God says by the prophet, “Go, my people, into your closets for a little while, until my anger pass.” The closets signify the graves, out of which is brought forth which had been laid therein. And they shall come out of the graves like young mules free from the halter.
