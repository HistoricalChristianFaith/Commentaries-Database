(Verse 15.) Therefore, thus says the Lord of hosts to the prophets: Behold, I will feed them wormwood (or sorrow, and according to Symmachus, bitterness) and give them gall to drink (or bitter water), because from the prophets of Jerusalem pollution has gone out into all the land. Let us use this testimony against those who disseminate letters full of lies, deceit, and perjury throughout the world, so that they may defile the ears of those who hear them and harm the reputation of the innocent. Thus, may what is written be fulfilled in them: Pollution has gone out from the prophets of Jerusalem to all the land. For it is not enough for them to devour their own iniquity and harm their neighbors, but they strive to defame those whom they once hated throughout the world, and spread blasphemies everywhere.
