We are commanded to show him our ways and make our ways to him, which are made straight, not by our own efforts but by his help and mercy. Whence it is written, “Make straight your way in my sight” (or as other copies have it, “make straight my way in your sight”), so that what is straight to him may also appear straight to me. Solomon also says, “Lay open your works to the Lord, and your thoughts shall be directed.” For our thoughts are directed then, and only then, when we lay open to the Lord, as to a firm and very stable rock, everything that we do and impute everything to him.
