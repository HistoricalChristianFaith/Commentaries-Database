Women attended to the food and clothing for their masters from their own possessions. This was according to Jewish custom. This practice did not proceed from Gentile law and even could have been a scandal among the Gentiles. Paul himself mentions that he was unable to continue this custom: “Can it really be said that we do not have the ability to lead the sisters around the women just as the other apostles also do?” These women waited on the Lord out of their own resources. He reaped from their physical support as they benefited from his spiritual blessing. It was not because the Lord of all creatures was out of necessity looking for food but rather that he might present a model of teaching and discipleship for them. Note carefully, though, what sort of attendants he had: Mary Magdalene from whom he cast out seven demons. Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and her own aunt, the sister of Mary, the mother of the Lord. The mother of Zebedee’s sons, a woman who had sought to care for her children in the kingdom. And there were other women present.

(Verse 55, 56.) And there were many women there from afar who had followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering to him; among whom were Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, and Joseph's mother, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee. It was a Jewish custom, and it was not considered wrong according to the ancient customs of the gentiles, for women to provide food and clothing to their teachers out of their own means. Paul mentioned that he had rejected this because it could cause scandal among the nations. For he himself says: Do we not have the power to lead about sisters, women, as the other Apostles do? And the Lord commanded that they ministered of the substance they had, to support their carnal needs, which they themselves were able to provide for their spiritual needs. Not that the Lord needed the food of creatures, but to show by example to teachers that they should be content with the food and clothing provided by their disciples. But let us see what companions he had: Mary Magdalene, from whom he had cast out seven demons, and Mary the mother of James, and Joseph's mother, the sister of Mary, the mother of the Lord, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee, who had asked just a little before for a kingdom for her children, and others whom we read about in the other Gospels (Luke 8).
