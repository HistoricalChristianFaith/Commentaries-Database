"So I
said to myself: the fate of the fool will befall me also; to what advantage
then have I become wise? But I concluded
that this, too, was vanity. For there is
no comparison between the remembrance of the wise and of the fool at all, for
as the succeeding days roll by, is all forgotten? How can the wise man's death be like the
fool's? "I have stated that the wise man and the fool, the
righteous and wicked are destined to die by the same fate and all wicked things
in this world will suffer a similar fate; what profit is there for me then,
that I have sought wisdom and worked more than others? On reconsidering the matter and applying
myself to it diligently I saw that my opinion was unfounded. For the wise and foolish will not have
similar remembrance in the future when the end of the world comes; and they
will be confined for no reason by equal death because the wise man will
continue to the joys of heaven and the fool to his punishment. The Septuagint translates the meaning of the
Hebrew here more clearly, for it doesn't necessarily follow the Hebrew word
order: "and to what purpose have I become wise?" Then I said to myself copiously, (for the
fool is he, who speaks too much), 'for this is also vanity, because there is no
remembrance of the wise with the fool for ever, and so on.' Since he tried to convince us that his prior
thoughts were foolish, he bore witness that he had spoken foolishly, and that
he had erred, and it was by doing this that he realised his folly.
