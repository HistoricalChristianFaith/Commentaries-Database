(Vers. 11-13.) Step back, step back, go out from there, do not touch the impure: go out from its midst, you who carry the vessels of the Lord. For you will not go out in tumult, nor will you hurry in flight. For the Lord will go before you, and the God of Israel will gather you together. LXX: Step back, step back, come out from there, and do not touch the unclean thing: go out from its midst: separate yourselves, you who carry the vessels of the Lord, for you will not go out in tumult, nor will you go in flight, but the Lord will go before you, and the God of Israel will gather you together. And the Jews try to argue this: Go out of Babylon, and abandon their idols. Go out from its midst, and bring back the vessels that Nebuchadnezzar, having captured Jerusalem, took (2 Kings 15), with Cyrus releasing the captives under Zerubbabel and Ezra (Ezra 1), to the temple; not as before when you fled from Egypt with tumult and fear, so you shall go out of Babylon; but with peace and the will of the Persian and Median king, in whom the will of the Lord appeared, who protected and gathered you. Others interpret what we have said about Babylon as referring to the Roman kingdom, that in the coming of Christ, who will set them free, all these things will be fulfilled. But we, hearing above: How beautiful are the feet of the one announcing and preaching peace on the mountains. And: The Lord will reveal his arm in the sight of all nations. And, all the ends of the earth will see the salvation of our God, by no means do we understand this about the Jews, but about the choir of the Apostles and all the Saints. To them it is commanded, that they depart from Jerusalem, and preach the Gospel in the whole world, the Lord and Savior saying: Go forth and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit (Matthew 28:19): so that they may in no way remain with the blasphemous Jews, upon whose destruction the Roman army is prepared; but rather they should leave the polluted ones and be separated and cleansed from them, who bear the vessels of the Lord. For indeed they are temples of the Holy Spirit (I Cor. III), and great houses are vessels of gold and silver. Such was the Apostle Paul, who is called a chosen vessel (Act. IX), for he had prepared himself as a precious and suitable vessel for the ministry of God. Or certainly this must be said, that the vessels of the Lord are the spiritual armor of God. Of which even the Apostle Paul spoke: Put on the armor of God (Ephes. VI, 11), and he enumerates each one: the breastplate of righteousness, and the shield of faith, and the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the spirit, which is the word of God. To these things, add the belt of truth and shoes for the preparation of the Gospel of peace. And elsewhere: Therefore, putting aside the works of darkness, let us put on the weapons of light (Rom. XIII, 13). It follows: You will not go out in tumult, nor will you go in flight. For as victors they departed from Jerusalem, not as those defeated, in order to subjugate the world to the Gospel of God, who daily preached in the Temple, and had subjected many thousands of Jews to the faith of Christ, also to subjugate his world to the Gospel. For they held the Lord as the leader, who would gather them, the God of Israel, that is, to make one flock out of the entire world, so that what the Lord speaks in the Gospel to the Father would be fulfilled (John 17:21): Give that as you and I are one, so may they be one in us: so that with the same mind and the same opinion, leaving behind conflicting vices and opposing things, they may embrace one and only virtue. For vices and disturbances do not follow one another: that which is said about virtues, in which there are no excesses or deficiencies, that is, neither more nor less, but all things are moderate. Furthermore, in vices, everything is contrary, such as fear to boldness, impiety to superstition, and extravagance to restraint.

Behold, my servant shall understand, he shall be exalted and extolled, and shall be very high. As many were astonished at him; so his appearance was marred more than any man, and his form more than the sons of men. He shall sprinkle many nations; kings shall shut their mouths at him: for that which had not been told them shall they see; and that which they had not heard shall they consider. LXX: Behold, my servant shall understand, and he shall be exalted, and shall be very glorious. Just as many were astonished at you, so your appearance will be marvelous among people, and your glory among the children of men. So many nations will be amazed at him, and kings will shut their mouths because of him. For they will see what was not proclaimed to them, and they will understand what they had not heard. So that there may be no ambiguity for readers, it is clear who will say: I, who spoke, am here; and the holy arm of the Lord, which has been revealed to all nations, God the Almighty Father clearly teaches: Behold my servant or my son whom I have sent, about whom we have spoken of his difference before. But he emptied himself, taking the form of a servant, being born in the likeness of men. And being found in human form, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross (Philippians 2). Therefore God has highly exalted him and bestowed on him the name that is above every name. As it is written in the psalm: I will bless the Lord who gives me understanding (Psalm 16:7); and concerning him, David sings: Who made the heavens with understanding (Psalm 135:5). He Himself is indeed wisdom and understanding, who progressed in wisdom and understanding as if a child in age and wisdom: of whom Peter also speaks: God of our fathers has glorified His Son Jesus, whom you indeed handed over and denied in the presence of Pilate who was willing to release Him. But you denied the Holy and Righteous One (Acts 3:13-14), of whom we have also shown above: I am a witness, says the Lord, and the chosen child upon whom many will marvel when they perceive His signs (Isaiah 43:10). And from this will be a greater miracle, that his appearance will be inglorious among men: not because it signifies ugliness of form, but because he came in humility and poverty. Though he was rich, he became poor for us; and to those who believe, he said: Learn from me, for I am meek and humble of heart (Matt. XI, 29); of whom Clement, an apostolic man who governed the Church of Rome after Peter, writes to the Corinthians: The Lord Jesus Christ, the scepter of God, did not come in the boasting of pride, though he could do all things, but in humility. As soon as he was struck by the officer of the priest, he answered, If I have spoken wrongly, give evidence of the wrong; but if well, why do you strike me? having twelve legions of angels who would obey his command. He shall sprinkle many nations, purifying them with his own blood and consecrating them in the baptism of God's service. Kings themselves will hold their mouths in check, and rulers of the world whose wisdom has been overthrown by the preaching of the cross; and those who had no Law and Prophets, and to whom he had not been proclaimed, will see and understand. Of whom the Savior also speaks: Blessed are those who have not seen and have believed (John 20:29). In comparison to them, the hardness of the Jews is reproved, who, seeing and hearing, have fulfilled Isaiah's prophecy in themselves, saying: 'You will indeed hear but never understand, and you will indeed see but never perceive. For this people's heart has grown dull, and with their ears they can barely hear' (Isaiah 6:9-10).
