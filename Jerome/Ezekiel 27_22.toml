(Verse 22.) Sellers of Sheba and Reama (or Rema), your own merchants with all the choicest spices, and precious stone, and gold which they have set forth in your market. In the Psalms where it is written, 'The kings of the Arabs and Sheba shall offer gifts to you' (Ps. 72:10), in Hebrew it has, 'The kings of Sheba and Sheba shall offer gifts to you,' of which one Sheba is written with the letter Sin, the other with Samech, which is similar to our letter S. Therefore, since Saba is interpreted as a conversion, it must be said that in this present passage it does not signify conversion, but rather aversion, from which the gifts of Tyre are brought with all kinds of aromas and the best odors, and with precious stone and gold, all of which are offered for sale in the markets of Tyre. For they themselves fabricate the best odor and precious stone with which they strive to build up their own perversity in the Churches, and they promise gold in the sense, and all these things are perverse. For nothing is received for free, nor is anything given for free, but all things are bought, as when the kings of the Arabs and Saba offer gifts to Christ for free. These are the ones who do everything for the sake of shameful gain: and they received these gifts from Him who says in the Gospel: 'All these things were given to me, and I will give them to you if you fall down and worship me' (Matthew 4:9). Reama, or according to the Septuagint Rhegma, I could not find in any other place in the Scriptures, nor could I find what region it is or what it signifies; except that it is clear, and from what is connected, that Saba is a neighboring region to this province.
