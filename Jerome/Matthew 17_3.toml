While the scribes and Pharisees were testing him, he was unwilling to give signs from heaven to those demanding them; however, he silenced their perverse demand with a prudent response. Here, indeed, so that he might increase the faith of the apostles, he gave a sign from heaven. Thereupon Elijah descended from the place to which he had ascended. Moses rose from the lower regions.

(Verse 3.) And behold, Moses and Elijah appeared to them, talking with him. When the scribes and Pharisees tested him, seeking signs from heaven, he did not want to give them, but refuted their wicked request with a prudent response. But in order to increase the faith of the apostles, he gives a sign from heaven, with Elijah descending from where he had ascended, and with Moses rising from the dead. This is also commanded to Ahaz through Isaiah, to ask for a sign from above or from below (Isaiah 7 and 2 Kings 2). For what was said: Moses and Elias appeared to them, speaking with him; and in another Gospel it is reported that he announced what he would suffer in Jerusalem (Luke IX): The law and the prophets are shown, who announced with frequent voices both the passion of the Lord and his resurrection.
