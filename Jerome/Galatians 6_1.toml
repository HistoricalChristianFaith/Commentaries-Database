The Spirit-led person should correct a sinner gently and meekly. He must not be inflexible, angry or aggrieved in his desire to correct him. He should stir him up with the promise of salvation, promising remission and bringing forth the testimony of Christ.

Maybe Paul is saying that you should identify with the sinner in order to do him good. This is not to imply, of course, that one should seemingly commit the same wrong and pretend that one is also subject to it. No, in another’s wrongdoing one should think of what might befall oneself. Help the other with the same compassion that one would hope to receive from another.

It is reasonable to ask why one should instruct the sinner in a spirit of gentleness. It is good to reflect that one might oneself be tempted. Would the righteous person, who is certain of his own resolve and confident that he cannot fall, therefore have no duty to instruct the sinner in the spirit of gentleness? To this we reply that even if the righteous one has prevailed, knowing with what difficulty he prevailed over his own temptations he should rather be ready to extend pardon to the sinner.… Overcoming or not overcoming is sometimes in our own power. But being tempted is in the power of the tempter. The Savior himself was tempted. So who of us can be sure that he might cross this sea of life without any temptation?

(Chapter VI - Verse 1) Brothers, even if a man is overtaken in any trespass, you who are spiritual should restore him in a spirit of gentleness. Keep watch on yourself, lest you too be tempted. Knowing that Paul was a servant of God, who did not desire the death of a sinner but their repentance (Ezekiel 18:23, 33). And except for the Trinity, every creature, though it may not sin, is still capable of sinning. Therefore, he also encourages those who are spiritual to reach out a helping hand to one who is falling, being mindful of their own fear of sin. And beautifully preoccupying in the offense, he calls him a man who can die: showing the fragility of his condition from his very name; so that he may be worthy of forgiveness, who, like a man deceived by error and immersed in a whirlpool, is unable to lift himself up without help and assistance. However, a man is not added to the spiritual realm, but he is commanded as if by God, to instruct a man preoccupied in the offense: or (as is better expressed in Greek) to perfect in the spirit of gentleness. However, the one who is being perfected does not lack everything, but something. In fact, if he has not erred with many sins, but has been preoccupied with some fault, let him apply the spirit of gentleness and meekness in correcting the spiritual sinner, so that he does not desire to correct the wandering one in a rigid, angry, and sad manner; but let him provoke him, promising salvation and forgiveness. Let him bring forth the testimony of Christ: that he invites those burdened by the weight of the law and sins to his gentle and light yoke, so that they may learn that he is humble and meek, and find rest for their souls (Matthew 11). Let us use this testimony against heretics: who, inventing various nature myths, say that a spiritual tree is good and never produces bad fruits. Behold the Apostle, whose authority they themselves also follow, says that those who are spiritual can sin if they are puffed up with the pride of their heart and fall. This we also confess; and that earthly beings can become spiritual if they turn to better things. Can what is written to the Corinthians be opposed to us: What do you want? Shall I come to you with a rod, or in charity, and the spirit of meekness (I Cor. IV, 21)? For if there, he says that he comes to sinners not in the spirit of meekness, but with a rod: how does he here not employ a rod, but the spirit of meekness, with those who have been prevented from sinning in any way? But there, it is said to those who, after sinning, not feeling their own error, were unwilling to be subject to their superiors and corrected by penance. But when the understanding sinner acknowledges his wound and gives himself to the physician to be healed, there the rod is not necessary, but the spirit of gentleness. And it may be questioned whether someone should instruct the sinner in the spirit of gentleness for this reason: that he should consider himself so as not to be tempted. Therefore, the righteous person, who is sure in his own mind and knows that he cannot stumble, should not instruct the sinner in the spirit of gentleness? To this, we will say that even if the righteous person has overcome, knowing how great a struggle he has won, he will offer more forgiveness to the one who sins. For even the Savior was tempted, in all things like us, without sin: so that he can sympathize and commiserate with our weaknesses, having experienced them himself, and to show how difficult it is to achieve victory in the flesh. If a virgin remains until old age, forgive those who were once deceived by the heat of youth, knowing the difficulties they have overcome. If someone, for the confession of Christ's name, witnessed another denying him in torment, let them sympathize with the wounds of the denier, and marvel not so much at their defeat, but at their own victory. Also, pay attention to the caution of the writer, for he did not say, 'Considering yourself, lest you fall,' but rather, 'lest you be tempted also.' To conquer or to be conquered is sometimes within our power; however, to be tempted is within the power of the one tempting. For if the Savior was tempted, who can be confident that they will pass through the storms of this life without being tempted? Those who believe that Paul spoke according to humility, and not truly, say this not out of ignorance of the language but rather of the knowledge of this matter. For he should have spoken in order, saying: You, who are spiritual, instruct such in the spirit of gentleness, considering yourselves, lest you also be tempted; and not to place the plural number into the singular. Therefore, the Hebrew among the Hebrews, and one who was very learned in the vernacular language, was unable to express profound meanings in a foreign language; nor did he greatly care about the words, since he had the meaning in safety. These things according to simple understanding. Furthermore, in order to continue the order of the second exposition, this passage about the end of the Epistle to the Romans must be explained. For there, when he was writing about the food and observances of the Jews, and those who despised the precepts of the Law according to the letter, he described the strong and perfect: but he also recounted the weak and little ones who were still being led by old customs, and saw that there was a dispute between the spiritual and the carnal. He warned the spiritual not to despise the carnal, and said: Receive the weak in faith, not for the purpose of argumentation of opinions. For another believes he may eat all things: but he that is weak, let him eat herbs. Let not him that eateth, despise him that eateth not: and he that eateth not, let him not judge him that eateth. For God hath taken him to him. Who art thou that judgest another man's servant? To his own lord he standeth or falleth. And he shall stand: for God is able to make him stand. And another judgeth every day a day: let every man abound in his own sense. He that regardeth the day, regardeth it unto the Lord. And he that eateth, eateth unto the Lord: for he giveth thanks to God. And he that eateth not, eateth not unto the Lord and giveth thanks to God. For whether we live, we live unto the Lord: or whether we die, we die unto the Lord. Therefore, whether we live or whether we die, we are the Lord's. For unto this end Christ died and rose again: that he might be Lord both of the dead and of the living. But thou, why dost thou judge thy brother? Or thou, why dost thou despise thy brother? For we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ. For it is written: As I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall bow to me and every tongue shall confess to God. Therefore, every one of us shall render account to God for himself. And again: But we must bear the weaknesses of the weak, and not please ourselves. Let each one of you please his neighbor for his good, to build him up. (Romans 15:1-2).
