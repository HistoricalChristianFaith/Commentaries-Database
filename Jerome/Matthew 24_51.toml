“The Lord of that servant shall come in a day when he looketh not for Him,” isto rouse the stewards to watchfulness and carefulness. “He shall cut him in sunder,” is not to be understood of execution by the sword, but that he shall sever him from the company of the saints.
“And shall appoint him his portion with the hypocrites,” with those, namely, that were in the field, and grinding at the mill, and were nevertheless left. For as we often say that the hypocrite is one who is one thing, and passes himself for another; so in the field and at the mill he seemed to be doing the same as others, but the event proved that his purpose was different.
