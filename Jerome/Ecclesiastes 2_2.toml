"I said
of laughter, It is madness! And of joy, What does it accomplish?" Wherever we read "madness"
the Hebrew text has "molal", which
Aquila took to be "planesin", that is
'delusion' [Hier.. "error"],
Symmachus has "thorubon", 'commotions' [Hier.. "tumultus".]. But the Septuagint and Theodotion as in many
places, so too in this, also agree and translate it as "periphoran", which we, expressing word for word, can call
'revolution'. [Hier.. "circumlationem".] Those men therefore, who are carried around
on the 'breeze' of all doctrines, are unstable and fluctuate between
interpretations. Thus those who guffaw
with that laugh, which the Lord says must be muted in holy weeping, are seized
by the delusion of time and its whirlwind, not understanding the disaster that
their sins will cause, nor bewailing their former faults, but thinking that
brief joys are going to be perpetual. 
Then they exult in these, which are more worthy of lamentation than joy. Heretics also believe this, who agree with
false doctrines and promise themselves happiness and prosperity.
