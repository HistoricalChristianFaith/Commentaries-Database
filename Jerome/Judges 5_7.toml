(Judges 5:7) However, the strong ones in Israel ceased, they paused until Deborah, a mother in Israel, arose. These strong ones are the learned teachers and preachers of the law, who are said to have paused, that is, to not have been present, until she arose to teach Israel through preaching, exhortation, and counsel, and to deliver them from their enemies. Deborah also provokes these strong ones in the previous verses to bless the Lord together with her, saying: 'You who willingly offered your lives for the peril of Israel, bless the Lord!' (Verse 2). Hi, strong men, that is to say, the learned ones, are said to have offered their souls to danger, that is, to have submitted themselves to the law of God and his service, and to have sacrificed their body and soul in meditations on the law day and night.
