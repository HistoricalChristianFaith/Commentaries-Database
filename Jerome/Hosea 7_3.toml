"In their malice, they made the king rejoice, and in their lies, the princes." LXX: "In their wickedness, the kings rejoiced, and in their lies, the princes." It explains what they did before Him: In their wickedness, they made King Jeroboam rejoice, and in their lies, the princes who led the people under Jeroboam. Heretics also rejoiced the devil as their king in the wickedness of their deeds, and the princes of perverse doctrines in their lies, without a doubt, of this world, whose false wisdom God destroys. We can call a king among the heretics, who first discovered the heresy, and those princes who, claiming a false priesthood for themselves, are placed over the people of the heretics. And at the same time, it should be noted that in our sins, the opposite strengths rejoice, and the leaders and princes of these darknesses.
