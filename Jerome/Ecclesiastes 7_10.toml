"Be not
hasty in your spirit to be angry: for anger rests in the lap of fools. "He does not grant here that anger should be tempered,
therefore he now says, "Be not hasty in your spirit to be angry"; but
that when anger is mad and new, it is more easily tempered because it is
dispersed easily and can be removed. And
since anger is linked to pride, and the desire for vengeance, he says it is
better and above suffering, than he who is exalted in his spirit, and now shows
the sign of foolishness, since however powerful or wise someone is esteemed, if
he is made angry he will seem foolish in his words: "for anger lies in the
lap of fools".
