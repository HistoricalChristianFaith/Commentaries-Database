(Verses 16 and following.) And he shall judge his people, as one of the tribes of Israel. Let Dan be a serpent by the way, an adder in the path, that biteth the horse heels, so that his rider shall fall backward: thy salvation, O Lord, I will wait for. Samson was a judge in Israel, from the tribe of Dan. This therefore he saith: Now seeing in the spirit Samson thy Nazarite nourish his hair, and triumph over his enemies being cut down; which in the likeness of a serpent and ruler obstructing the ways, he permitteth none to pass through the land of Israel: but also if anyone, presuming on his own strength, relying on the swiftness of a horse, shall wish to invade it like a spoiler, he shall not be able to escape. However, the whole thing is spoken metaphorically of a serpent and a knight. Therefore, seeing your mighty Nazarene, who himself died for the prostitute and, dying, killed our enemies, I thought, O God, that he was the Christ, your Son. But because he died and did not rise again, and was led captive to Israel, another Savior of the world must be awaited by me and my race, to whom the promise has been given, and he will be the expectation of the nations.
