(Verse 3) And it shall be in that day, when the Lord has given you rest from your labor, and from your turmoil, and from your hard service which you had to bear, that you shall recite this proverb against the king of Babylon and say, The speech is addressed to Israel, that after Jerusalem has been restored and the yoke of servitude has been cast off, they should remember the former power of Nebuchadnezzar and the height of Babylon, and lament him with a pitiful voice, because he has come to such great calamity that he seems worthy of even his own enemies' pity.
