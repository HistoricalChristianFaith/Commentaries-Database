You go astray, Peter, just as the other Evangelist attests: you do not know what you are saying. Do not seek three tabernacles. Seek only the tabernacle of the gospel in which the law and the prophets are to be recapitulated. By seeking three tabernacles you appear to be comparing incommensurably the two servants with the one Lord. Seek only the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, for in these there is one God, who is to be worshiped in the tabernacle of your heart.

(Verse 4.) But Peter, replying, said to Jesus: Lord, it is good for us to be here. He who had ascended to the mountains does not want to descend to earthly things; but always to persevere in the lofty things.

If you wish, let us make here three tabernacles: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah. You are mistaken, Peter, as another evangelist testifies. You do not know what you are saying. Do not seek three tabernacles, for there is one tabernacle of the Gospel, in which the Law and the Prophets are recapitulated. But if you seek three tabernacles, do not compare servants with the Lord, but make three tabernacles: indeed, one for the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit; so that, since they are one divinity, there may be one tabernacle in your heart as well.
