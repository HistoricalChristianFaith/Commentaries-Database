He comes, the wicked one, and snatches away what was sown in his heart; this is the one who was sown along the path. And as for the one sown on rocky ground, this is the one who hears the word and immediately receives it with joy, yet he has no root in himself, but endures for a while, and when tribulation or persecution arises on account of the word, immediately he falls away. The wicked one snatches away the good seed. And understand at the same time what was sown in the heart, and the diversity of the soil of the souls of believers.

But in fact, through tribulation and persecution, he is continuously stumbled because of the word. Pay attention to what has been said, he is continuously stumbled. Therefore, there is some distance between him who is compelled to deny Christ by many tribulations and punishments, and him who is immediately stumbled and falls at the first persecution.
