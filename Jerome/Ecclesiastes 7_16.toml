"I have
seen all things in the days of my vanity: there is a just man, that dies in his
righteousness, and there is a wicked man that remains alive in his
wickedness. "Similar to this is what the Saviour says in
the Gospel: "he who finds his soul will lose it, and he who loses it on
account of me, will find it" [Matth. 10. 39.]. The Maccabees are seen to die on account of
their justice by the law and justice of God, and martyrs too, who shed their
blood for Christ. On the other hand,
those who at that time ate the flesh of pigs and sacrificed to idols after the
arrival of the Lord, they are seen to live in this world and to live long lives
on account of their wickedness. But it
is the endurance of God in secret which causes suffering in those who are not
holy, so that they have wickedness in their life, and not to visit sinners for
their crimes, and it is as if he saves for the sacrifice so that he can give to
the former eternal goodness, and to the latter eternal wickedness. The Hebrews suspect the righteous, who die
for their righteousness, the sons of Aaron, since while they think they live
righteously, they worship a foreign fire. 
And they say Manasseh was impious and lived a long life on account of
his wickedness, for he then lived a long time in a long reign after having been
corrected in prison.
