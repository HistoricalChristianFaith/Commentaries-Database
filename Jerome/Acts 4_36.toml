Barnabas means, 'Son of a prophet', or 'son of one coming', or, as many think, son of consolation. All the derivations, as 'Bar' (son of) either 'Nabi' (a prophet), or a derivative from 'Bo' (to come) or from 'Bee' (to console), as by the Syriac interpreter it is also rendered, 'Son of consolation.'
