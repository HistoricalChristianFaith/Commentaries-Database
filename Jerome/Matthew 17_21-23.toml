(Ver. 21 seq.) While they were conversing in Galilee, Jesus said to them: The Son of Man is to be handed over to the hands of men, and they will kill him; and on the third day he will rise again. And they were greatly saddened. He always mixes sorrows with prosperity, so that when they come suddenly, they do not terrify the apostles; but they are carried by their prepared minds: For if they are saddened by his impending death, they should be joyful at the news of his resurrection on the third day. Furthermore, their grief and sorrow are not due to disbelief (otherwise they would have known that Peter was rebuked because he did not understand the things of God, but those of men), but rather because out of love for their master, they are willing to hear nothing negative or humiliating about him.
