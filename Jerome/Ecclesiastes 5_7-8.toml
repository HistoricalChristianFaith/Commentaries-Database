"If you
see oppression of the poor, and the suppression of justice and right of the
State, do not be astonished at the fact, for there is One higher than the high
Who watches and there are high ones above them. 
The advantage of land is supreme; even a king is indebted to the
soil." Christ's garment, woven on top, was not able to be torn
by those who crucified him; and the Saviour threw him from that demon, and
advised him to go away having put on the clothes of the apostles. So we believe that the clothes of our
Ecclesiastes are not to be torn, nor should we sew on here and there patches in
place of our free-will of opinion, but use the one text itself in dispute, and
follow the same meaning and arrangement all the way through. Above this he had said: "do not tell the
messenger that it was a madness, lest God become angry over your speech",
and regarding the remaining things, he had spoken against those, who do not
know that providence rules over human affairs. 
Since therefore the question arises many times about the precept, why
the righteous sustain disaster, and why the unjust become judges over all the
world, but God is not vengeful: now he introduces and finishes this argument,
saying, 'if you see the calamity of a pauper, who is said to be blessed in the
Gospel, and the situation is assessed according to his strength and not in
justice, do not be astonished or let anything seem new to you. God, who is highest above the high, sees
these things, He that placed His angels above the judges and kings of the
earth, to prevent injustice and they are more important on earth, than any of
man's potentates. But since he will be
the Saviour at the end of the judges, and in the end of the world when the
cornfield will be ripe, and the harvesters will come, he will be ordered that
the wheat be separated and the darnel thrown on the fire. Therefore he now awaits and differs in
opinion, although the field of the world is cultivated carefully more
fully. But since that field is
interpreted as the world, the Lord expounds about them in the parable of darnel
and wheat. [Cfr Matth. 13, 24-30.]
