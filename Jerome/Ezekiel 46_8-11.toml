(Verse 8 and following) When the prince enters, he shall enter through the gateway vestibule and exit through the same way. And when the people of the land enter in the presence of the Lord on the appointed festivals, the one who enters through the north gate to worship shall exit through the south gate, and the one who enters through the south gate shall exit through the north gate. They shall not return through the gate they entered, but rather shall exit opposite it. But the prince, in their midst, will enter when they enter, and will exit when they exit. And on market days and festivals there will be a sacrifice of one ephah of flour with a bull, and one ephah of flour with a ram. But the sacrifice of the lamb will be according to what his hand finds, and a hin of oil for each ephah. That prince, of whom it was said above, 'And the prince will enter through the way of the outer gate, and through the same gate he will enter and exit' (John 10), has free will and the power to lay down his life and take it up again. And when he comes to us or ascends to the heavens, he exercises the same authority of his majesty. Finally, he does not seek markets, nor solemnities, nor does he observe any difference in days: because every time is a celebration for him. But the people only enter and exit the markets and solemnities: and not through the same path, but through one and then another. For it is written: And when the people of the land enter before the Lord in solemnities: let the one who entered through the North gate to worship, exit through the way of the South gate, and let the one who entered through the South gate, exit through the way of the North gate: he shall not return through the gate by which he entered, but he shall exit opposite to it. This is not only commanded to those who depart from Sodom, and it is said to them: Do not look back (Gen. XIX, 17); nor to those who put their hand to the plow, so that they do not look at the things that are behind them: but even to those who are established in the house of the Lord, they are commanded not to look back and turn to the needy and weak elements, and being initiated in the spirit, to be consumed (or consumed) by the flesh ((Al. consumed)): but to proceed also from spiritual things to greater things, and to say with the Apostle: Forgetting the past, and extending myself towards the things that are before (Phil. III, 13): so that they may not know in part and prophesy in part, but may come to perfection according to the perfection that human nature can achieve, so that we understand that Gospel saying: So you also, when you have done everything you were commanded to do, should say, 'We are unworthy servants; we have only done our duty' (Luke XVII, 10). And the Apostle in the same Epistle speaks of two perfections: for he writes as if he were imperfect: Not as though I have already attained, or were already perfect: but I follow after, if that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus (Philippians 3:13). And immediately he speaks as if he were perfect: Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended: but this one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before, I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus. Therefore, let us understand this: however many of us are perfect, let us know this. For how can the statement stand, that the one who said, 'Not because I have already received, or because I am already perfect,' dare to say, 'However many of us are perfect, let us know this?' From this it is clear that every person and the whole creation, although they have come to perfection, still need the mercy of God and possess full perfection through grace, not through merit. Therefore, it is commanded to the people of the land, that if someone enters through the gate of the North to worship, they should exit through the way of the gate of the South. Who is this people to whom this is commanded? It is surely the pagans; those who, leaving the gate of the North, from where evils flare up upon the earth, have entered the temple, should not exit except through the way of the gate of the South, to the gate of light, to the gate of heat, to the gate where the bridegroom lies at noon (Jer. I). Finally, it is said in the same Song of Songs: Arise, O north wind, and come, O south wind (Song of Solomon IV, 16). But whoever enters through the south gate should exit through the north gate. Who is this people? It is the Jews, who, abandoning the gate of the way of light, go to the north gate, of whom it is said: The north wind, a very strong wind (Jeremiah I). For even the pot of Jeremiah is lit from the face of the north. Let us also say this: Through the north gate enters the one who forgives sins, and through the south gate exits the one who follows virtues. And on the contrary, if the righteous person falls into sin, he enters indeed through the southern gate, but he exits through the way of the northern gate. And the Prince, he says, will be in their midst, namely, of those who enter and those who exit, according to what is written: He stands in the midst of you, whom you do not know (John 1:26). And the Apostle says: Do you not know that Christ is in you (2 Corinthians 13:5)? But if it is said to those who do not know that Christ stands in their midst, how much more to those who know! But while Christ stood among the knowledgeable, then the dead body will become because of sin, and the living spirit because of righteousness. Indeed, the prince enters with those who enter, and exits with those who exit, witnessing the power and sin of both. Therefore, at the fairs and solemnities, namely the Sabbaths, Kalends, and all the festivals we have spoken about before, both a calf and a ram will be offered as sacrifices, each measuring an ephah. But in the offerings, there will not be a fixed number, nor a diminished will; but with strength, each person will offer according to their ability and with a clear conscience: offering as much as they can, not as much as they want, and above all, a hin of oil for each ephah of flour, so that it may be used for anointing and a lamp may be lit in the presence of the Lord. And those who use it may say: But I am like a fruitful olive tree in the house of the Lord (Ps. 51:10).
