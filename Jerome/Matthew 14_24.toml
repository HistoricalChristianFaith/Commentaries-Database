(Verse 24): However, the little boat was being tossed by the waves in the middle of the sea; for the wind was contrary. Rightly, as if unwillingly, and the apostles, drawing back, had departed from the Lord, lest they should suffer shipwrecks in His absence. Finally, while the Lord was staying on the mountain peak, immediately a contrary wind arises, and it stirs up the sea, and the apostles are in peril, and the impending shipwreck persists as long as Jesus does not come.
