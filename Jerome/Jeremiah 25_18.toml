(Verse 18) Jerusalem and the cities of Judah, and its kings, and its princes, to make them a desolation, and an astonishment, and a hissing, and a curse, as it is this day. 'I thought,' he says, 'that I would give this only to the nations, and therefore I gladly offered myself to this ministry; but among all the nations, indeed before all others, I have given it to Jerusalem and the cities of Judah, and its kings, and its princes, to make them a desolation, and an astonishment, and a hissing, and a curse, as is proven by the present example.' And as it is said above: You have seduced me, O Lord, and I have been seduced; you have been strong and have prevailed.
