(Verse 29.) At the sound of the horseman, and of him who sends forth the arrow (or bends the bow), every city (or region) flees. They have entered the heights and climbed the rocks. And what follows: They have entered the thickets, or caves, which the Seventy have added. But the divine word describes the raging army of Babylon, how at its trembling the entire people have abandoned the city, and have climbed the heights; and yet they could not escape the wrath of the Lord. But whatever, as we said above, is understood in history against Jerusalem, it refers to the Church, when it has offended God, and has been handed over to its adversaries, either in the time of persecution, or certainly because of vices and sins.
