(Versed 16 and following) Thus says the Lord: Stand on the roads and see, and inquire about the ancient paths, which is the good way, and walk in it, and you will find refreshment (or purification) for your souls. And they said: we will not walk (or we will not go). And I appointed watchmen over you, listen to the sound of the trumpet. And they said, we will not listen. Therefore hear (or they have heard) O nations: and know (or know) the congregation (or those who feed the flocks): or according to Symmachus, and know (the testimony that is in them) how much I will do to them. Listen, O earth. If the parable of the Gospel is understood, it will provide understanding of this place: in which a good merchant is said to sell all pearls, in order to buy the most precious pearl for its price (Matth. XIII); which, indeed, through the Patriarchs and Prophets, we come to him who says: I am the way (John XIV). Therefore, we must stand in the prophets, and contemplate and inquire diligently about the ancient or eternal paths, which have been trodden by many holy ones, which are more significantly called 'trails' in Greek, which is the good way in the Gospel (Matth. VII), and we must walk in it: and when this way is found, it provides refreshment or purification for the souls of believers. But they replied in opposition, we will not walk in the way of the Gospel: as the Prophet specifically says about the perfidy of the Jews. And immediately he brings forth: And I have set watchmen over you. No doubt that the chorus of the Apostles is indicated, according to Ezekiel: Son of man, I have made you a watchman for the house of Israel (Ezek. III, 17). And I have commanded you to listen to the sound of the trumpet, or the commandments of the Gospel, or the teachings of the Apostles, according to Isaiah: Go up to the high mountain, herald of good news to Zion; lift up your voice with strength, O Jerusalem, herald of good news (Isai. XL, 9). They said: We will not listen; and when invited to the dinner, they did not want to come: therefore it is said: Hear, O nations. This is what the Apostles followed, when they spoke in Lycaonia: It was necessary for you to speak the word of God first: but because you reject it, and judge yourselves unworthy of eternal life: behold, we turn to the nations (Acts 13:46). And know, congregation, not at all Jewish, but of all nations: whether you who shepherd the flocks, bishops and priests and all the ecclesiastical order: or you know the testimony that is in them. For the testimony of God is faithful, providing wisdom to the little ones (Psalm 18:8). To whom the Lord speaks: Do not be afraid, little flock (Luke 12:31). And: Behold, I and the children whom God has given me (Isaiah 8:18). Therefore, know the great things I will do for the unbelieving people. And it is added: Hear, O earth, the whole world is called to listen: just as we read in the beginning of Isaiah: Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth (ibid., 1); what the Lord will do for the people of Judah.
