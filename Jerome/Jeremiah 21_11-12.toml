(Verse 11, 12.) And to the house of the king of Judah, hear the word of the Lord, O house of David. Thus says the Lord, Judge in the morning, and deliver the oppressed from the hand of the oppressor, lest my indignation goes forth like fire and is kindled with none to quench it, because of the evil of your deeds. The phrase 'because of the evil of your deeds' is not found in the Septuagint. Because above (Al. already above) it had said, And to this people you shall say, Thus says the Lord, subsequently it now adds, and to the house of the king of Judah: so that it is understood, you shall say, thus says the Lord: for both the higher and the lower are connected; so that the meaning is: And to this people you shall say, Thus says the Lord. But a proper speech is made to the royal house, because of whose fault the city is besieged, so that it may correct the error through repentance, and obtain the mercy of the Lord. Judge, he says, justice in the morning, not in the darkness of iniquity, but in the light of justice. And deliver the one oppressed by force, from the hand of the slanderer, so that you do not show favoritism in judgment, but that the authority of God may prevail more among you than the power of the persecutor. And if, he says, you do this, the fire of my anger will not be kindled in you, nor will it find material to consume. In this place the incredible mercy of God is demonstrated, as concerning those of whom it was said before: For I have set my face against this city for evil, and not for good; it shall be given into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall burn it with fire, with the judgment of the Lord already approaching, so as to provoke them to seek salvation. Not that he is unaware that the city of Jerusalem is to be taken, but because the free will of man is preserved, so that they may seem to perish not by ignorance of the future, but by their own choice. How did the Savior know that the Apostle would deny him and that he himself would be crucified? Surely he had often foretold this to the Apostles and nevertheless reminded them, desiring to correct them for repentance, so that whatever they would subsequently endure, it would happen to them by their own fault, not because of the severity of the one threatening.
