“The glory of the God of Israel was there” not to delight the neighborhood but to annihilate the “idol of jealousy” and the temple by his very presence. Hence the destruction of the city and the temple followed shortly thereafter. It is also written in Isaiah that “a narrow bed cannot hold two persons, nor can a short blanket cover both,” prefiguring that saying of the apostle: “What does Christ have in common with Belial, or the temple of God with an idol?” - "Commentary on Ezekiel 3.8"
