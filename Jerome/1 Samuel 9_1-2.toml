The name Benjamin is a combination, then, of two words, son and right hand: ben means “son” and jamin means “right hand.”Let us remember once for all that the tribe of Benjamin was called Jemini. We read in the book of Kings [Samuel], where it speaks of Saul, the words “Now there was a man of Benjamin whose name was Saul, the son of Kish, the son of Abiel, son of Jethra, son of Jether, son of Gera, son of Jemini,” and immediately following, it says, a man of Jemini, that is, from the tribe of Jemini, or Benjamin. … Now why have I said all this? To show that the tribe of Jemini was the tribe of Benjamin.
