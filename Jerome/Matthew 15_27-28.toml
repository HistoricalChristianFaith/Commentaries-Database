(Verse 27, 28.) But she said: Even so, Lord. For even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters' table. Then Jesus, answering, said to her: O woman, great is your faith: be it done to you as you wish. And her daughter was healed from that hour. I know, she said, that I am not deserving of the bread of the children, nor am I able to receive the whole food; nor to sit at the table with the father; but I am content with the crumbs of the puppies; so through the humility of the crumbs, I may obtain the greatness of the whole bread. Oh, the wonderful change of things! Israel, once a son, now dogs. Because of the diversity of faith, the order of names is changed. Concerning them, it is later said: Many dogs have surrounded me (Ps. 21:17). And: See the dogs, see the evil workers, see the mutilation (Phil. 3). We have heard with the Syrophoenician woman and the woman who had a flow of blood: Your faith is great, let it be done to you as you wish. And: Daughter, your faith has made you well.
