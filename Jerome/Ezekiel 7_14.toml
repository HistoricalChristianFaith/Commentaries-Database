(Verse 14.) Blow the trumpet, let all be prepared.  LXX: Blow the trumpet, and judge all things. We read in many places about the sound and noise of trumpets, as in Isaiah: 'Lift up your voice like a trumpet' (Isa. LVIII, 1); and elsewhere: 'Blow the trumpet at the new moon, at the appointed time, on our solemn feast day' (Ps. LXXX, 3); and in the Apostle: 'For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trumpet of God' (I Thess. IV, 5). And in the Gospel: Do not sound the trumpet before you (Matthew 6:2). And the story of the trumpets, both golden and silver, is told in the book of Numbers (Numbers 10 and 31), which is compared to prophetic discourse and Apostolic doctrine. And now it is commanded that everyone be prepared for battle at the sound of the trumpet and the blowing of the trumpet. Moreover, what the Seventy said, "Judge all things," there is no doubt that it agrees with the authority of the apostles. After the trumpet of the angels has sounded, they will judge on twelve thrones the twelve tribes of Israel. Of whom Paul spoke: We will judge angels (I Cor. VI, 3); and elsewhere: The world will be judged in you (Ibid., 2). But according to the present sense, those who are entrusted with this office are commanded ironically to blow the trumpet, so that all may be prepared against the army of Babylon.

And there is no one who goes to battle. For my anger is over his whole multitude. And these are not found in the Septuagint. God had commanded (Num. X) that the trumpet should sound to prepare the army, which could resist the strength of the Babylonians; but it was of no use to command, since there is no one in the people who dares to proceed to war. Therefore, the people are weak and lacking in fighting strength, because all of God's anger is over his whole multitude, understood as the city of Jerusalem or the land of Judea. But both in our land and in Jerusalem, when either public persecution or the many enticements of vices try to overcome us, the teachers sing in vain, and hurry to prepare us for battles, even though there is no strength in the people, which has been taken away because the sins deserve the present anger of God.
