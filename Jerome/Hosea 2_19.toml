"And I will espouse thee to me forever: and I will espouse thee to me in justice, and judgment, and in mercy, and in compassion. And I will espouse thee to me in faith: and thou shalt know that I am the Lord." Similarly in the Septuagint. Oh, what great mercy of God! The prostitute who has fornicated with many lovers, and was handed over to the beasts because of her crime; after she returns to her husband, though she is not reconciled to him, she is betrothed. And see what is between the conjunction of God and men: when a man accepts a wife, he makes a woman from a virgin, that is, not a virgin; Moreover, God, united with harlots, changes them into virgins, according to what is said through Jeremiah regarding adulteresses: "Not as thou hast called me, acknowledging me for thy master, and truly, he that is the protector of thy virginity" (Jer. III, 4). So the apostle, after fornication and idol worship, speaks to the Corinthians who believe: "For I have espoused you to one man, that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ." (II Cor. XI, 2). We ask why he repeated the name of betrothal for the third time. For he says first: "I will betroth you to me forever." Second: "I will betroth you to me in righteousness and judgment, and in mercy and compassion." And not content with this, he adds the third: "I will betroth you to me in faith, and you shall know that I am the Lord." He betrothed her first in Abraham, or in Egypt, in order to have an eternal wife. Second on Mount Sinai, giving her the justice and judgment of the Law as a dowry, and joined to the Law mercy if when she sins, she should be delivered into captivity, when she has repented, she shall be recalled unto her country and obtain mercy. Concerning these betrothals in various places the psalmist sings: "I will sing of mercy and judgment to you, O Lord" (Psalm 102:2). And: "Mercy and truth have met together; righteousness and peace have kissed each other" (Psalm 85:10). We read of these two cups in the seventy-fourth psalm: "The cup in the Lord's hand, full of mixed wine, he inclined from this to that" - of the cup of justice into the cup of mercy, and again of the cup of mercy into the cup of justice. "If you, O Lord, will mark iniquities, Lord, who shall endure it? For with you there is merciful forgiveness." Therefore, this harlot, who had been first united in eternal embrace by the vow of her spouse, so as never to depart from the marital bond, because she departed and committed fornication in Egypt, is again received by the Law. And because he passed by this, after killing the prophets as if they were companions of her spouse (who had been sent to her), finally the Son of God, the Lord Jesus, came. With this crucified one, rising from the dead, she is betrothed not in the justice of the Law but in the faith and grace of the Gospel, so that when she knows the only-begotten, she may also know the Father. For he himself said to Philip: 'I am with you for so long a time, and you have not known me?' 'Philip, he who sees me, sees also my Father; how do you say, show us the Father? Do you not believe that I am in the Father, and the Father in me?' (John 14:10-11). He who is espoused in faith and believes in the Gospel, will immediately know that he himself is a God, believing in him whom he had previously denied.
