"The sun
rises and the sun sets, then it rushes to its place, where it rises again." The
sun itself, which is given as light for mankind, shows the orbit of the world
by its rising and it setting every day. 
After the sun has soaked its burning orb in the ocean, it returns by
routes unknown to me to that place whence it had come; and when the period of
night is over, it again bursts out quickly from its bed. In place of "rushes to its place"
though, because we are following the Vulgate version, the Hebrew reads ""soeph"" which Aquila interpreted as "eispnei" in Greek, that is "pants [Hier.. "aspirat"]";
Symmachus and Theodotion write '"returns"'
because the sun clearly turns around to its original place and it aspires to
return there, from whence it had come earlier. 
But all of this is explained so that he can teach that with the passage
of time and the rising and the setting of the stars man's age slips away and
perishes, yet he does not know this for certain. Another meaning of this is: the sun of
righteousness, in whose wings lies reason, rises from those who fear and sets
midday in the false prophets. But when
it has risen it takes us to its place. 
Where is that? Evidently it means
to the Lord himself, for it happens that he raises us from the earth to heaven,
saying, "when the son of man is lifted up, he will lift up all things to
him". [John 12, 32.] Nor is it surprising that the son lifts up
men to himself, when even the Lord himself lifts up to his son: "for no
one", he says "comes to me except the Father, who sent me, draw
him". [John 6, 44.] That sun therefore, which we have said sets
for some and rises for other, and once set for Jacob the patriarch as he was
leaving the Holy Land, rose again for him when he entered the promised land
from Syria. When Lot too left Sodom and
came to the city, which he was commanded to hasten to, he climbed a mountain
and the sun came out above Segor [Cfr. Gen. 28, 11; 32, 31.].
