Whatever was said at that time to the people of Israel now applies to the church. The holy prophets are apostles and apostolic people, but the lying and raging prophets are all heretics, whose leaders invent things from their own heart; the people are led astray by them and acquiesce in the falsehoods of others.

The Ishmaelites represent those who are a law unto themselves, who yield to their own capricious hearts and evil desires. Ezekiel expresses the same thought: “Son of man, prophesy against the prophets that prophesy their own thought and do whatever their spirit impels.” We, however, must not follow our own inclinations and be labeled Ishmaelites, “obedient to themselves,” but rather be called Ishmael, “obedient to God.”
