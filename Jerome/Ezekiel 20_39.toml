(Verse 39.) And you, house of Israel, thus says the Lord God: each one of you after your idols walk, and serve them. But if you will not listen to me even in this, and you will further defile my holy name in your gifts and in your idols. LXX: And you, house of Israel, thus says the Lord God: Each one of you take away your inventions, and after this, if you will listen to me, and you will no longer defile my holy name in your gifts and in your pursuits. Symmachus has interpreted this passage more clearly: Each of you, going after your own idols, serve them, because you do not want to listen to me. But do not further pollute my holy name with your offerings and statues. On my holy mountain, on the high mountain of Israel, says the Lord God, there the whole house of Israel will serve me. The translation by Symmachus has this meaning: Because you do not want to serve me, go and serve the idols, and trample the footsteps of your own statues. For you do not want to hear me, so that you do not sacrifice offerings to me, nor burn incense, nor call yourselves my people. For my worshippers do not serve me in the places of light, temples, and idols, like you do, but on my holy mountain, on the high mountain of Israel. Moreover, the Septuagint explains the true meaning. Abandon your former thoughts and remove the sins of evil inventions; and if after this you listen to me and do not defile my name in your gifts and idols, then you shall offer sacrifices to me on my holy mountain and all the house of Israel shall serve me. But Aquila, on Symmachus' side, agrees in part and disagrees in part: 'Go,' he says, 'after your idols, and serve them, because you are unworthy of my reign, and your worship does not please me. But if you do not even hear me on this matter, but defile my holy name, pretending to offer to me what you offer to idols, and you blaspheme my name alone, so that, as worshipers of idols, you call yourselves my own; know this, that on my holy mountain, on the high mountain of Israel, there all the house of Israel will serve me, not you who serve idols, but all the house of Israel that will believe later.'
