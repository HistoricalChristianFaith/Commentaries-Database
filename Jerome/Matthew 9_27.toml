(Verse 27) And as Jesus passed on from there, two blind men followed him, crying out and saying, 'Have mercy on us, Son of David.' As Jesus passed through the house of the ruler and was going to his own house, as we read above: Getting into a boat, he crossed over and came to his own city. The two blind men cried out, saying, 'Have mercy on us, Son of David.' And yet they were not healed on the way, as they thought; but after he came to his own house, they approached him and entered: and their faith is first tested, so that they may receive the light of true faith. Earlier we presented a sign regarding the prince's daughter and the hemorrhaging (or sick) woman, now this is added: that as there was death and weakness there, here blindness is shown. Both peoples were blind when the Lord passed through this world, and desired to return to their homes. But unless they confess and say, 'Have mercy on us, Son of David,' and when Jesus asks, 'Do you believe that I am able to do this?' He responds: Indeed, Lord, he does not receive his former sight. In another Gospel, one blind man is written about, with torn clothes, sitting in Jericho, who is forbidden by the apostles to cry out; but through impudence, he receives healing (Mark 10). This passage properly pertains to the people of the Gentiles and should be explained in its own volume.
