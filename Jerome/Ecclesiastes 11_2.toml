"Give a portion to seven, and also to eight;
for you do not know what evil shall be upon the earth. "And in Ezekiel there are found seven or eight steps
leading up to the temple. [Ez. 40, 26.31.] And after the 'ethical' Psalm, that is one
hundred and eighteen, all the psalms are of fifteen steps by which we are first
taught the law, and when the seventh is finished, we then climb to the Gospel
through the 'eight steps' [Ier. 'ogdoadem']. Therefore it is taught that we should believe
with equal respect in each, the same for the old as for the new. The Jews dedicated their seventh part,
believing in the Sabbath, but did not dedicate that eighth, denying the
resurrection on the day of the Lord. On
the other hand, heretics, Marcion and Manichaeus and all who rip up the ancient
law with their savage mouths, dedicate their eighth part, taking up the
Gospel. But they do not save as holy the
seventh, spurning the old law. For we
are not able to understand the worthy crucifixions, the worthy punishments
already in mind, which are reserved for those who are moved to wickedness on
earth, that is for the Jews and the heretics, and for those denying the other
of the two. The Hebrews understand this
passage in this way: keep both the Sabbath and the rite of circumcision, for if
you do not adhere to these wickedness will come over you unexpectedly. " "
