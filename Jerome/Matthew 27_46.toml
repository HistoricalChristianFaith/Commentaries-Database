Jesus appropriated the beginning of the twentyfirst psalm. That which is read in the middle of the verse, “Look at me,” is superfluous. For in the Hebrew it reads, “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?” They are impious therefore who say that the psalm is written in the person of David or Esther or Mordecai, since the Evangelists understand that other testimony taken from the same psalm is to be applied to the Savior, as for example, “they divided my garments and cast lots for my clothing” and “they pierced my hands and my feet.”

(Verse 46.) And about the ninth hour, Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying: Eli, Eli, lammasabacthani, which means: My God, My God, why have you forsaken me? He made use of the beginning of the twenty-first psalm, and that which is read in the middle of the verse: Look upon me, for it is useless. For it is read in Hebrew: My God, My God, why have you forsaken me? Therefore, those who think that this psalm is spoken from the perspective of David, Esther, or Mordecai are wicked, since the evangelists also understand the testimonies taken from it concerning the Savior, as in: They divided my garments among themselves, and for my clothing they cast lots. And another thing: They pierced my hands and my feet. Do not be surprised at the lowly words and the complaints of one who is forsaken, when you see the form of a servant and the scandal of the cross.
