Let us examine those remaining matters whose meaning remains hidden. They tore their garments because they heard the Rabshakeh speaking blasphemy. The king also tore his clothing because he believed that it was due to his sins and the sins of the people that the Rabshakeh came to the gate of Jerusalem and spoke such things against the Lord. Hence, the high priest, because he believed the Savior to have been blasphemed, also cut his garments. Paul and Barnabas, moreover, when the Lycaonians offered to them the worship of God, cut their clothes.
