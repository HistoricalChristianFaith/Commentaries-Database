After this example of the Saviour, whosoever is filled and is drunken upon the bread and cup of Christ, may praise God and ascend the Mount of Olives, whereis refreshment after toil, solace of grief, and knowledge of the true light.
And He adds emphatically, “this night,” because as “they that are drunken are drunken by night,” so they that are scandalized are scandalized by night, and in the dark.
This is found in Zacharias in words different; it is said to God in the person of the Prophet, “Smite the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered abroad.” The good Shepherd is smitten, that He may lay down His life for His sheep, and that of many flocks of divers errors should be made one flock, andone Shepherd.
It is not wilfulness, not falsehood, but the Apostle’s faith, and ardent attachment towards the Lord his Saviour.
