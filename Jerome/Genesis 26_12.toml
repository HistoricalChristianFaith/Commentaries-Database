(Chapter 26, verse 12) And Isaac sowed in that land, and in that year he reaped a hundredfold. Although Isaac sowed in a foreign land, I do not think that such fertility of barley would have been to him. Therefore, I think the Hebrew version is better, and even Aquila translated it: And he reaped in that year a hundredfold estimated, that is, ἑκατὸν εἰκασμένον. Although the same letters are used for both estimation and barley, the estimations are read as Saarim (), and the barleys as Sorim. But Scripture, however, seems to me to have shown in it the multiplication of all virtues, in that it has increased a hundredfold the type of fruits.
