For it is not the spirit (which is incorporeal) but the flesh that is eaten, suffering the bites of savage beasts. And then let Zion learn that it is indeed all flesh that will see the salvation of God, that its Redeemer and Savior is he who wrestled with Jacob or was the helper to Jacobâ€™s strength as Christ, though overwhelmed by his crucifiers, blessed them in his suffering.
