(Verse 9) The Scripture of King Hezekiah of Judah when he became ill and recovered from his illness. LXX. The Prayer of King Hezekiah of Judah when he was sick and rose from his sickness. I wonder why only the Seventy have included this prayer in the scripture, since the prayer is called Thephellath (), not Machthar (). which is written in the current place; otherwise the prayer would be said subsequently, if it were about the present time and not the past. For it is evident that, after he had regained his health, he wrote this, as a testimony not of speech, but of thanksgiving for the favor he had received.
