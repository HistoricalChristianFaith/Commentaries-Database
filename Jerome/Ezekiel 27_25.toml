(Verse 25) And you were filled, and greatly glorified (or burdened) in the heart of the sea. Nothing, he says, was lacking to you concerning the riches of the islands. However, this glorification was a burden for the possessor, for you cannot bear riches in moderation, even though poverty often serves as a temptation (Prov. 30). Thus, Solomon asks for only what is necessary; he equally detests wealth and poverty, so that pride does not creep in with the former and impatience and falsehood with the latter.
