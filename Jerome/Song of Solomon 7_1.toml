[[commentary]]
quote='''
The virgin bridegroom, having been praised by the virgin bride, in turn praises the virgin bride and says to her, “How beautiful are your feet in sandals, O daughter of Aminadab,” which is, being interpreted, a people that offers itself willingly. For virginity is voluntary, and therefore the steps of the church in the beauty of chastity are praised. This is not the time for me like a commentator to explain all the mysteries of virginity from the Song of Songs. I have no doubt that the fastidious reader will turn up his nose at what has already been said.
