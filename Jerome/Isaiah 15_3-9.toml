(Verse 3 and following) Over Nebo and over Medeba, Moab will wail; on every head there is baldness, every beard is shaved off. In its streets they are dressed in sackcloth; on its rooftops and in its squares everyone wails and goes down in weeping. Heshbon and Elealeh cry out; their voices are heard as far as Jahaz; therefore the armed men of Moab cry aloud; his soul trembles. My heart cries out for Moab; its bars are dragged away, to Luhith and to Heshbon they come, crying; on the way to Horonaim they raise a cry of destruction; the waters of Nimrim are a desolation; the grass is withered, the vegetation fails, the greenery is no more. According to the magnitude of their work and their visitation, they shall be led to the torrent of the willows; because a cry hath gone round the border of Moab unto Eglaim, the howling thereof unto Beer Elim. For the waters of Dimon have been filled with blood: for I will bring more upon Dimon, lions upon them that shall flee out of Moab, and upon the remnant of the land. Therefore, since every teaching contrary to the truth, which is born without the inspiration of God from human understanding in the darkness of error, has been laid waste by the night, and its arguments, which are understood as walls, have been destroyed by the words of Ecclesiastes; so that they fall into eternal silence, to such an extent that their entire faction turns to repentance and tears, over Nabo, that is, over prophecy and authority, that is, over their leaders, and over Medaba, where there are no fruitful trees, but barren thickets, in which beasts dwell, as it is written in the twenty-eighth psalm: And he will reveal the hidden things of the forest: there will be wailing and lamentation, and all the ornaments of eloquence will be taken away from their heads, so that they remain naked and deformed. And if anything seemed to have masculinity in a beard, when shaved by a Ecclesiastical man, it is considered effeminate and weak. In their crossroads, that is, the byways of errors, while each one fabricates according to his own will, he is equipped with the sack of penance, and over the roofs and tamed places, in which they first believed themselves to be lofty; and in the streets (because they do not enter by the narrow way, which leads to life, but by the broad way, which leads to death) there will be wailing. And they shall by no means ascend into pride, but descend into weeping. Then they shall understand all their vain thoughts, which are interpreted as Esbon, and the futile ascent of pride, which sounds like Eleale, so that the voice of their deeds may be heard, and the commandment they thought was from God, condemning themselves by their own confession. Therefore, the bars, that is, those who were strong in Moab and understood their error, shall howl, and they who had hopes will begin to have regrets when their soul howls to itself. Where the Prophet speaks with compassionate affection to those whose souls cried out to him, and says: My heart will cry out to Moab, that I may provoke them to repentance. But their beams and all the foundations, which seemed to have support in their heresies, will reach as far as Segor, that is, to the little one: and it will be shown that they are not strong, but fragile. And this Segor, that is, the small repentance, if it perseveres, will lead them to perfect salvation: which is signified by the three-year-old heifer, as we read in Genesis, where Abraham is commanded to offer a calf, a ram, and a three-year-old goat, a perfect sacrifice, that he may deservedly be the heir of the Lord (Genesis 15). And when they have repented, through tears of sorrow, that is, the tears of their cheeks, they will ascend to higher things. And through this as if through a hole and entrance of sorrow, they will raise the cry of contrition to the Lord, so that they may say: Sacrifice to God is a contrite spirit: a contrite and humble heart God will not despise (Ps. 50:19). And this will happen because the waters of Nemrim, that is, the teachings of heretics, which are compared to leopards and transgressors, will be deserted and brought to nothing. They are stubborn, whose variations and blemishes are not changed (Jeremiah XIII), and apostates, of whom we read in the Psalms, I have regarded all the sinners of the earth as transgressors (Psalm CXVIII, 119). Also, every plant and sprout, and everything that seemed green in their speech, withered. And they were visited by God according to the magnitude of their sins, so that those whom they had not felt through blessings, they would come to know through afflictions. Finally, they will be led to the valley or torrent of willows, so that no fruit remains in them. For they say that this is the nature of the seeds of these trees, that whoever drinks it in a cup will be barren. Hence the holy ones who, because of their sins, began to be in the confusion of this world, hang their organs in the willows of the Babylonian rivers (Ps. CXXXVI). The cry of the Moabites goes around all the borders, either calling for repentance or mourning for the error, so that they can offer through their wailing the calves of their lips and reach the spring of the Lord's rams, or the mighty ones, because Elim signifies both. But the waters of Dimon, which is interpreted as sufficient pain or sorrow, which had polluted many with its sprinkling, will be accused by deceived peoples of not being for their salvation, but for their bloodshed. Hence the prophetic speech promises that over flowing tears, which is interpreted as Dibon, they will accumulate not just one sorrow, but multiple additions of sorrow: so that after they have fully repented and fled from the Moabite lion, they may have God as their leader, whom the Septuagint called Ariel, which is interpreted as lion of God: I will refrain from discussing their translation in this place, because it disagrees with the Hebrew truth in many places, and from what we have interpreted, the sense of that can also be understood.
