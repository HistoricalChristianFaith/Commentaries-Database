The prophet says that he was deceived by the Lord because, when he heard the Lord say in the beginning, “I gave you as a prophet to the nations,” and, again, “Behold, I establish you today over nations and over kingdoms, that you may uproot and destroy and overthrow and dissolve and build and plant,” he believed that none of this was spoken against the people of Judea, but only against the various nations surrounding them, thus leading him to accept his prophetic mission willingly. To the contrary, however, as it turns out, he found himself preaching to a captive Jerusalem that suffered persecution and imprisonment. He also adds, “I have become an object of derision all the day; everyone mocks me,” because they all judged him to be a liar and everything that he had prophesied to them to be a lie. For, as the prophet thought that the future that the Lord predicted was to be realized immediately, the people also expected nothing further to be coming that did not arrive at once. And he continues, in effect, “I announce destruction at the hands of Babylon and the iniquity of the army through which my people are to be oppressed.” Yet, if we follow the Septuagint, which reads, “I will laugh with my bitter message, I will invoke falsehood and misery,” this is the meaning: “I know that the present sorrow is to be exchanged for future joy, according to what is written, ‘Blessed are those who weep now, for they will laugh.’ ” For this reason, I willingly endure misery and iniquity and affliction now, so that I can invoke and even desire them and the brevity of their injury in exchange for eternal happiness.
