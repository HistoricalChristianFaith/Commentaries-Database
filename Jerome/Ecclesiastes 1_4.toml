"A
generation goes, a generation comes, but the earth remains forever." 
While some men die, others are born, and those you had seen, are not
seen anymore, and you then see those who have not been before. What is more vain than this vanity, than that
the earth remains, which was made on account of mankind? And that man himself, the master of the earth,
should be suddenly returned to the dust? 
Another meaning of this is: the first generation of Jews dies and a
generation formed from all peoples takes its place; but the earth however will
remain for so long as the Synagogue's influence slips away, and the Church
becomes more powerful. For when it was
predicted that the Gospel would be known all around the world, then, it was
said, would be the end. When the end is
approaching, it is true, the sky and the earth will pass away. Solomon very precisely does not say the earth
remains "through the ages" [Hier.. "in saeculis"]
but "through that age" [Hier.. "in saeculo"]. More precisely we praise the Lord not in one
age, but throughout the ages.
