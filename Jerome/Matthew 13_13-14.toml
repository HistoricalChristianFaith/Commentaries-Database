(Verse 13, 14.) Therefore, I speak to them in parables, because seeing, they do not see, and hearing, they do not hear, nor do they understand; so that the prophecy of Isaiah may be fulfilled in them, which says: You will indeed hear but never understand, and you will indeed see but never perceive. This applies to those who stand on the shore and are separated from Jesus, and despite the loud noise of the waves, they do not hear what is being said clearly; and the prophecy of Isaiah is fulfilled in them: You will indeed hear but never understand, and you will indeed see but never perceive (Isaiah 6:9). These things are prophesied about the crowds, which stand on the shore, and do not deserve to hear the word of God. Let us therefore approach with the disciples to Jesus, and let us ask him for the explanation of the parable, lest we seem to have ears and eyes in vain with the crowds.
