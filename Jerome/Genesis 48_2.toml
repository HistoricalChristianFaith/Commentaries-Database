(Version 2.) And Israel, strengthened, sat upon the bed. The reason why the Seventy Interpreters have rendered the same word differently, I do not know; but I boldly say this one thing, that the word itself, Meta, which they translated here as bed, in the place where we have said above that Jacob worshipped on it, they have rather called a rod than a bed.
