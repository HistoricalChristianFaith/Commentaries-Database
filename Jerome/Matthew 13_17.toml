It seems that what he said elsewhere runs counter to this point: “Abraham desired to see my day. He saw it and rejoiced.” He did not say all the prophets and righteous people desired to see what you see, but many. Among many it may be that some see and some do not see, although in our interpretation we seem to be making a distinction between the merits of the saints. Therefore Abraham saw dimly as though in a mirror, but you now have and hold your Lord and question him freely and eat with him. .

We must enquire how they could come to Him at that time when Jesus was sitting in the ship; we may understand that they had at the first entered into the ship, and standing there, made this enquiry of Him.
Or, To the Apostles who believe in Christ there is given, but from the Jews who believed not on the Son of God there is taken away, even whatever good they might seem to have by nature. For they cannot understand any thing with wisdom, seeing they have not the head of wisdom.
This He says of those who were standing on the shore, and separated from Jesus, and who because of the dashing of the waves, heard not distinctly what wassaid.
If we had not read above that invitation to his hearers to understand, when the Saviour said, “He that hath ears to hear let him hear,” we might here suppose that the eyes and ears which are now blessed are those of the body. But I think that those eyes are blessed which can discern Christ’s sacraments, and those ears of which Isaiah speaks, “The Lord hath given me an ear.” .
This place seems to be contradicted by what is said elsewhere. “Abraham rejoiced to see my day, and he saw it, and was glad.”
