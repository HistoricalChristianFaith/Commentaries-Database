It seems that what he said elsewhere runs counter to this point: “Abraham desired to see my day. He saw it and rejoiced.” He did not say all the prophets and righteous people desired to see what you see, but many. Among many it may be that some see and some do not see, although in our interpretation we seem to be making a distinction between the merits of the saints. Therefore Abraham saw dimly as though in a mirror, but you now have and hold your Lord and question him freely and eat with him.
