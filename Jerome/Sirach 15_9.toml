What did the Savior say to the devil? "And Jesus ordered him, "Be silent, and come out of this man." " Truth does not need false confirmation. "I have not come to be recognized by your testimony but to cast you out of one of my creatures. "A compliment from a sinner is unseemly." I have no need of the testimony of one to whom I wish every kind of suffering. Be quiet. Your silence itself praises me. I do not want your voice to praise me, but your torment. Your every suffering honors me. Should I be happy that you praise me? No, I am happy that you go. "Be silent, and come out of this man." " It is as though he said, "Get out of my house. What are you doing in my dwelling? I want to enter. You, be silent and leave this man, this rational being. Come out of this man: leave to me this dwelling prepared for me. The Lord wants his own dwelling: leave this man, therefore, this rational being." - "Homilies on Mark 2"
