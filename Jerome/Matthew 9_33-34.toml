(Verse 33, 34.) And the crowds marveled, saying: Never has it appeared like this in Israel. But the Pharisees said: By the prince of demons he casts out demons. The crowd confesses the works of God, and says: Never has it appeared like this in Israel. In the crowd, there is a confession of the nations. But because the Pharisees could not deny the power of God, they slandered his works and said: By the prince of demons he casts out demons, thus demonstrating the unbelief of the Jews through their slander even today.
