Paul, the chosen vessel, chastised his body and brought it into subjection, lest after preaching to others he himself should be found a reprobate. He relates that there was given to him “a thorn in the flesh, a messenger of Satan to buffet him.” And to the Corinthians he writes: “But I am afraid that as the serpent deceived Eve by his cunning, your thoughts will be led astray from a sincere and pure devotion to Christ.” And elsewhere he says, “Any one whom you forgive, I also forgive. What I have forgiven, if I have forgiven anything, has been for your sake in the presence of Christ, to keep Satan from gaining the advantage over us, for we are not ignorant of his designs.” And again, “No temptation has overtaken you that is not common to man, but God is faithful, and he will not let you be tempted beyond your strength; but with the temptation will also provide the way of escape, that you may be able to endure it.” And “Let anyone who thinks that he stands take heed lest he fall.” And to the Galatians, “You were running well; who hindered you from obeying the truth?” And elsewhere: “We greatly desired to have come unto you, I Paul once and again; and Satan hindered us.”
