When Moses fought against Amalek, it was not with the sword but with prayer that he prevailed. Therefore, if we wish to be lifted up, we must first prostrate ourselves.… We do not understand the prophet’s words: “One thousand shall flee at the rebuke of one.” We do not cut away the causes of the disease, as we must do to remove the disease itself. Else we should soon see the enemies’ arrows give way to our javelins, their caps to our helmets, their saddle horses to our chargers.

(Verse 17.) Until you are left like a bad ship on the top of a mountain, and like a signal on a hill. Jeremiah also writes that after those who had taken refuge in Egypt had been killed by the sword and famine, few remained who returned to Judah (Jeremiah 46). And just as if a ship is broken and its structure is dissolved, only a tree, which is called a mast, remains, and is set as a signal on the top of the mountain or on a high hill, so as a sign and a trace, hardly one or two remain, to demonstrate the power of God. And then, he says, all the remnants of Judah, who are now entering the land of Egypt to dwell there, when they return to the land of Judah, will know whether my word or theirs shall be fulfilled.
