(Verse 34.) And they gave him vinegar to drink mixed with gall, and when he had tasted it, he would not drink. God speaks to Jerusalem: I have planted you as a true vine, how have you become bitter like a foreign vine (Jeremiah II, 21)? A bitter vine makes bitter wine, which they gave to the Lord Jesus, so that what is written may be fulfilled: They gave me gall for my food, and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink (Psalm LXVIII, 22). But when it is said, 'And when he had tasted, he did not want to drink,' this indicates that he did indeed taste the bitterness of death for us, but on the third day he rose again.
