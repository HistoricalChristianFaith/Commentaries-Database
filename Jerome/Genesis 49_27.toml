(Verse 27.) Benjamin the ravenous wolf, in the morning he will still eat, and in the evening he will give food.

How clear is the prophecy about the Apostle Paul, it is evident to all that in his youth he persecuted the Church, but in his old age he preached the Gospel. However, it is written in Hebrew as follows: Benjamin, a ravenous wolf, in the morning he will devour the prey, and in the evening he will divide the spoils. The Hebrews interpret this as referring to the altar where sacrifices were offered and the blood of the victims was poured out at its base, which was located in the territory of the tribe of Benjamin. They say, therefore, that this signifies that the priests in the morning sacrifice the victims, and in the evening divide those things which have been conferred upon them by the people according to the Law, placing the bloody wolf, the voracious wolf, as an interpretation upon the altar, and the division of spoils upon the priests, who serve the altar and live off the altar.
