Paul uses the term fruits in the case of the Spirit, works in the case of the sin nature. … In the present case he indeed is saying that the works of darkness are unfruitful. Those who do these works share an association with darkness.

No one is prepared to admonish sinners except one who does not deserve to be called a hypocrite [as with the account in Lk 6:42].… Only those prophets who were themselves unpolluted by any stain of sin were in a position to upbraid others for their wrongdoing. From this we learn that the one who is in the best position to reprimand is the one who cannot himself rightly be reprimanded in turn.
