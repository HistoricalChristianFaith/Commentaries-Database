(Verse 53, 54.) Do you think that I cannot appeal to my Father, and he will at once send me more than twelve legions of angels? But how then would the Scriptures be fulfilled, that it must happen this way? I do not need the help of twelve apostles, even if they all defended me. I could have twelve legions of angelic armies. In ancient times, one legion consisted of six thousand men. In order to keep this brief, I will not go into the exact number for now. Just know that seventy-two thousand angels, divided into twelve legions, is the approximate count for the number of nations divided by language. The following sentence demonstrates a ready mind to suffer, because the prophets sang in vain unless the Lord truly affirmed their words by his own suffering.
