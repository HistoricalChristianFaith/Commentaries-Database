(Chapter 60â€”Verse 1 and following) Arise, shine; for your light has come, and the glory of the Lord has risen upon you. For behold, darkness shall cover the earth, and thick darkness the peoples; but the Lord will arise upon you, and his glory will be seen upon you. And nations shall come to your light, and kings to the brightness of your rising. 70: Arise, arise, O Jerusalem, for your light has come, and the glory of the Lord has risen upon you. Behold, darkness shall cover the earth, and thick darkness the peoples. But the Lord will appear great upon you, and His glory will be seen in you. And nations will walk in your light, and kings in the splendor of your light. Regarding what we think about the restoration of Zion and Jerusalem, and all that is promised to it by prophetic prediction, we have spoken more fully at the end of the previous book, where we have interpreted what that verse meant: Zion's Redeemer will come, and to those who turn away from wickedness in Jacob. Now we must briefly examine what most people think about this place, so that after understanding the mistake, we can more easily accept the truth. The Jews and our half-Jews, who expect a golden and gem-studded Jerusalem to descend from heaven, argue that these things will happen in the thousand-year reign, when all nations will be subject to Israel, and the camels of Midian and Ephah, coming from Sheba, will bring gold and frankincense, and all the flocks of Kedar will be gathered, and the rams of Nebaioth will come to be sacrificed on the altar of the Temple, which will have been built. Also, the daughters of that land, especially the ships of Tarshish, will fly like doves, bringing treasures of gold and silver. And the walls of Jerusalem will be built by foreigners, who will be ruled by kings from foreign nations. The gates of the city will always be open, day and night, to allow the wealth of Jerusalem and the offerings to be brought in. And everything that was once desolate will be rebuilt with cypress, pine, and cedar from Lebanon. The Temple of the Lord, in particular, will be constructed, where there will be eternal joy. It will draw in the milk of nations and consume the treasures of kings. There will be such abundance of all things that bronze will be valued like gold, iron like silver, and wood like bronze, and even stones like iron. Moreover, the princes will enjoy eternal peace, and the bishops will lead the people in righteousness, and the gates will be future symbols. And what is greater than this, the Lord Himself will shine with eternal light, replacing the sun and the moon. And for one man, it will be equal to a thousand mighty warriors, and for the little ones, it will be possessed by the strongest nations. These are the words of those who desire earthly pleasures and seek the beauty of wives and the number of children, for whom God is their belly, and their glory is in their shame (Philippians 3). Those who follow their error confess themselves to be similar to the Jews under the name of Christians. Others, however, assert that all these things were promised to the Jews in a carnal manner, if they had received him who says in the Gospel: I am the light of the world (John 8:12), which enlightens every person coming into the world, so that just as the sacrifices were granted to the people of Israel, not because they were good in themselves, but so that they would not be offered to demons, in the same way the Lord promises these things to the gluttonous Jews, who seek nothing else but bodily pleasures, so that at least for their carnal desires and their abundance of wealth, they would receive the Son of God. Because they did not receive him, the promises also became void. Finally, to the Canaanite woman begging for her daughter: 'I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel' (Matthew 15:24). And to his disciples: 'Do not go into the road of the Gentiles, and do not enter the cities of the Samaritans; instead, go to the lost sheep of the house of Israel' (Matthew 10:5, 6). For this reason, the Apostles first preached the Lord in the synagogues, but when the people did not receive the Gospel, they said to them: 'It was necessary to preach the word to you, but since you did not accept salvation, behold, we turn to the Gentiles' (Acts 13:46). For the light indeed came into the world, but the Jews loved darkness more. Therefore, when the Lord wept over Jerusalem, He added: If you had known, even you, the things that are for your peace (Luke 19:42). Because they did not receive this, He brought upon them: But now the days will come upon you, and your enemies will surround you with a rampart, and hem you in on every side, and will level you to the ground, and your children within you (Ibid., 43). However, according to the previous meaning, let us believe that all these things are said about the Church, which was first gathered from the Jewish people, and the light that had risen upon her was transmitted to the Gentiles through the Apostles. To whom it is said: Rise, shine; so that what has fallen among the unbelievers may rise among the Faithful: what has fallen in the synagogues may rise in the Churches: and once it has risen, may it be illuminated, so that they may have no darkness of error. For behold, your light comes, which all the Prophets promised, which you have awaited continually. And the glory of the Lord, which once was upon his tabernacle and his Temple, has risen upon you: of which it is said: Glorious things are spoken of you, City of God (Ps. 86:2). For behold, darkness shall cover the earth, and a mist the people: but the Lord shall arise upon thee, and his glory shall be seen upon thee. And the Gentiles shall come to thy light, and kings to the brightness of thy rising. Lift up thine eyes round about, and see: all they gather themselves together, they come to thee: thy sons shall come from far, and thy daughters shall be nursed at thy side. Then thou shalt see, and flow together, and thine heart shall fear, and be enlarged; because the abundance of the sea shall be converted unto thee, the forces of the Gentiles shall come unto thee. The multitude of camels shall cover thee, the dromedaries of Midian and Ephah; all they from Sheba shall come: they shall bring gold and incense; and they shall shew forth the praises of the LORD. And the nations will walk in your light. We all will walk in the light of the Apostles, which shines in the world, and the darkness did not comprehend it. And the kings, he says, in the splendor of your birth: when you were first born in Christ. This is fulfilled both spiritually and carnally, as kings whose heart is in the hand of the Lord, and in whom sin does not reign in the mortal body (Prov. 21:1), walk in the splendor of the nascent Church, or in him who has risen in the Church, and submit to the yoke of the true king, the faith of Christ (Rom. 6:14). What we see fulfilled every day when the error of idolatry is removed, and the rage of persecution, Roman leaders pass to the faith and tranquility of Christ. There are those who await these things that we remember from the first coming of the Savior until the consummation of the world, both in part completed and fully to be fulfilled in the future, when the fullness of the Gentiles enters and all Israel will be saved (Rom. 11). The opinion of no one should be condemned, as long as it is spiritually fulfilled and not known carnally. Furthermore, the name Jerusalem and the nations, which are placed here by the Septuagint, are not found in Hebrew, and it should be noted with an obelus, against those who claim that everything that is said is said about Jerusalem.
