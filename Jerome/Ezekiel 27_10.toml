(Verse 10) The Persians, Lydians (commonly known as Lydia), and Libyans were in your army, your mighty warriors. They hung their shields and helmets on you for your adornment (or they themselves hung up their shields and helmets, giving glory to you). The Persians were the bravest, of whom Cyrus, their king, as prophesied by Isaiah (Isa. XLV), conquered Babylon after overthrowing Astyages, the king of the Medes. This is narrated in both sacred and secular history. Moreover, at that time, they were considered among the strongest nations, of whom King Croesus was captured by Cyrus himself, as Xenophon writes in great detail. And we read in the book of Chronicles (2 Chronicles 12) that Libya, along with the Troglodytes and Ethiopians, came against Jerusalem: because they were flourishing in those times, they are remembered as famous warriors, defenders of the city of Tyre, and they hung shields and helmets on the defenses of the walls to terrify the enemies. But spiritual understanding signifies that the Persians, who are interpreted as 'those who try' or 'those who have been tried'; and the Lydians, whom we understand to be 'those who are born'; and the Libyans, who are called Phut in Hebrew, and are translated as 'from the mouth' (from speech, not from bone); in vain they strive to defend Tyre with temptation, and are overcome, and serve the generation and lust, and only multiply empty words, not having the helmet of salvation, nor the shield of faith (Ephesians 6); but they only pretend glory and noise of words to adorn it.
