(Verse 17, 18.) The treacherous have dealt treacherously; indeed, they have dealt treacherously with treachery. Fear, the pit, and the snare are upon you, O inhabitant of the earth. And it shall be that he who flees from the noise of fear shall fall into the pit, and he who comes up from the midst of the pit shall be caught in the snare. LXX: woe to the treacherous who deal treacherously! Fear, the pit, and the snare are upon you, O inhabitants of the earth. And it shall come to pass that he who flees from the noise of fear shall fall into the pit, and he who comes up from the midst of the pit shall be caught in the snare. This is the cause of my grieving and crying out, for which I have said again and again, my secret to myself, my secret to myself: because all have transgressed God's law, and the punishment of the Lord is not delayed, nor is it foretold, but it is imminent and holds captive the inhabitants of the earth. And when they think they have escaped, they will fall from one thing to another, and wherever they turn, they will not escape the impending anger of the Lord.
