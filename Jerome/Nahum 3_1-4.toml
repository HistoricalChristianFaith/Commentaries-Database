(Chapter 3, verses 1 and following) Woe to the city of blood, full of deceit and torn apart. The plunder will not cease. The sound of the whip, the sound of the rattling wheel, the galloping horses and the blazing chariots, the ascending knight and the flashing sword, the gleaming spear and the multitude of the slain, and the weighty destruction. There is no end to the corpses. They will stumble over their own bodies because of the multitude of the prostitute's charming and enticing acts of fornication, and her sorceries which she sold to the nations through her acts of fornication, and her enchantments which she used to deceive the families. LXX: O city of blood, completely deceitful, full of wickedness, the hunting will not touch you: the sound of scourges, and the sound of turning wheels, and of pursuing horses, and of a blazing chariot, of a rider ascending, and a gleaming sword, and of shining armor, and of a multitude of wounded, and of a heavy downfall, and there will be no end to its nations, and they will be weakened in their bodies by the multitude of their fornication. A beautiful and pleasing harlot, leader of wickedness, who sells nations in her fornication, and tribes in her wickedness. Where we have been placed, full of laceration, is called Pherec Malea in Hebrew, which Aquila interpreted as 'full of decapitation', that is, full of excision. Symmachus, on the other hand, interpreted it as 'full of amputation', which we can say is full of cruelty or severity. In another edition of his work, I found 'full of dismemberment', that is, with the sections of flesh and pieces torn through the limbs: finally, he immediately added, where there is uninterrupted prey. The Hebrew scholar Pherec does not interpret it as 'exervicationem', which we find in the edition of Aquila, but as 'gubernaculum', that is, 'governance': to show that the city was royal, and as if it held the governance of all nations like a ship. Its power, that is, Nineveh, is described, and it is condemned under the lamentation of cruelty. Woe, city of blood, in which there is no truth, but all falsehood, full of plunder and tearing of prey. The voice of a cruel whip always and of a raging empire, and the voice of the wheel's momentum. Let us understand the voice as a sound: the roaring wheel, racing through different places, and the snorting horses, and the fiery chariot, are heard in all. However, the description of an army preparing for battle, so beautiful and resembling the Hebrew and the pictures, is worthy of all my speech being considered cheap. For what is said: And heavy is the downfall, and there is no end to the corpses, let us understand it as referring to the adversaries who were killed by them. And they will fall in their own bodies, or they will fall from their multitude, while they crowd themselves together: or they will fall on the corpses of the slain; for it signifies both their own and others'. Because of the multitude, he says, of the harlot's fornications: because she has fornicated with many nations and has cultivated idols of the whole world, which she had subjected to herself. It signifies the beautiful and pleasing, and those having evil deeds, the magicians: who have sold nations in their own fornications, and families in their own evil deeds, that is, those whom she had power over all nations. These things about Nineveh are said simply. But if we understand the name 'world' in a rational manner, because of its beauty, rightly the world, which is situated in evil, is called the city of blood because of the multitude of archers and those who kill people with their tongues like swords. Therefore, consequently, the whole world is a liar, which pertains to the perversity of teachings, not having the word of God, where it should find its foundation, when all perverse doctrines possess it. There is none that understandeth, or seeketh after God: they are all gone out of the way; they are together become unprofitable; there is none that doeth good, no, not one. (Psalm 14:2-3). Although these things are partly done even now, they will be more completely fulfilled in the end, when charity of many shall cool because of the multiplied iniquity. (Matthew 24). How many are caught by the giant Nimrod, the most cruel hunter, who, being proud against God, has ensnared many with the snare of his own vices, of whom many will not touch as prey or game. For he has many followers, and likewise hunters who delight in his hunt, and they stand around him like captives. But the sound of whips is also heard in the world, for there are many tribulations of the just (Psalms 33), to which those who are whipped cry out and testify to the magnitude of their pain with a mournful voice: when one is seized by a demon, another by anger, which is similar to madness, another by desire, hatred, envy, and pride, the whip of the king of Assyria sound in them. But even in bodily ailments, we understand the whip of the devil, concerning which it is said to the just: And the whip will not approach your tent (Ps. XC, 10); when we see this royal disease decay, and its corpse still remaining: one cut open from water, and the body floating while swollen, with the limbs growing, the form of the former man diminishing, which we recently saw in the dissecting room: him expelling certain purulences and the wounds suffered by the damaged lung: him experiencing the dryness of the moisture turned to stones, the bitterness of the urine, and the torments of the bladder, let us not hesitate to say that the voice of the whips is in Nineveh: although some suspect that these things happen either from the corrupted air or from the variety of food and bodies. Let us who read and tremble at the feverishness (Luke IV), and the woman who had been bound by the devil for eighteen years (Ibid., XIII), healed by the Lord, know that all these are scourges for Nineveh. Hence it follows: And the voice of the wheels; while here and there the human race is carried away, uncertainly wandering in all directions, where there is danger, where there is safety, we do not know; concerning which wheel it is also written at the beginning of Ezekiel (Ezek. I): in the seventy-sixth psalm we read: The voice of your thunder is in the wheel (Psalm LXXVI, 19). But Nineveh also has a pursuing horse, whose neighing and hooves digging into the ground and chest boiling, always desires war, while the Lord speaks against the devil. From afar, war can be smelled: it does not spare those who flee with a leap and a cry; it does not allow those who turn their backs to escape; but it pursues in order to overthrow, kill, trample, and crush them. There is also in Nineveh the sound of a steaming chariot, like I imagine Pharaoh had, which were submerged by the Lord (Exodus 14). To this team are harnessed four horses, namely the four disturbances, about which both philosophers argue and Virgil does not remain silent, saying (Virg., VI Aeneid.):

They desire, fear, grieve, and rejoice... With these horses and this chariot, he disturbs all of Nineveh. But also the voice of the mounting knight resounds in it, who, prepared by a certain skill and a circuit, advances to battle not without danger against the one fighting against himself. This knight has a sword of speech, sharpened with the blade of dialectic and smoothed with the oil of rhetorical art: he has shining weapons, Satan transforming himself into an angel of light (II Cor. XI), which are contrary to the arms of apostolic armor. It is not surprising if there is a multitude of wounded in Nineveh, since there is a multitude of arrows. And just as we have four shields with which we fight and protect ourselves, they are the virtues of wisdom, justice, temperance, and courage; similarly, there are four vices: foolishness, injustice, luxury, and fear, with which we are struck by the enemy. Each of these vices contains numerous kinds of arrows that cause wounds. If these wounds are not immediately healed by medicine, they become a heavy burden and, I wish, as heavy as they are in Nineveh, falling lightly and being lightly wounded, they are so great in their weight of ruin that they sink down to the depths of hell. And there is no end to their nations' groaning: their wickedness has no end. As there are so many forms of sins, there are as many nations as Nineveh, which will be weakened in their bodies by the multitude of fornication. Although it can also be understood about those who, due to sexual desires, are also weakened in their bodies, and with the destruction of their soul, they also break the flesh they serve: nevertheless, these nations, of which we have spoken, do not fall, according to the Hebrew, except in their bodies, and do not offend (as Symmachus interpreted) except in the corpses of the dead, which are laid low by the multiplication of fornication. In this place, the 70 interpreters, when we have followed the Hebrew, because of the multitude of the harlot's fornications, wanted there to be another beginning, so that they would say: Before the multitude of fornication; and up to this point is the end of the sentence, afterwards they would begin, a beautiful and pleasing harlot, leader of evils. Aquila and Symmachus translated leader of evils, having evils. And it will not be surprising if Nineveh is now the most pleasing of harlots, who has seen such a great multitude of people fornicate with her, and is almost able to lead everyone to love her through her evils and certain enchantments. These sell nations in their fornications, which take away the members of Christ, and make them the members of a harlot; and they delight in their evil deeds. For they make themselves love those that they ought to hate, and hate those that they ought to love, so that when they are deceived, according to what is written: 'Evil communications corrupt good manners' (1 Corinthians 15:33), they may also overthrow others by their wicked arts. I have read in the Holy Scriptures that even malefactors can be taken in a good sense: 'The wise malefactor enchants' (Psalm 57). But this sorcerer uses such incantations that he can bring back those captivated by the love of a harlot of Nineveh to their right mind.
