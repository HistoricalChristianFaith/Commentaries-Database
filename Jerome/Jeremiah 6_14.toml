Idol temples had fallen before the standard of the cross and the severity of the gospel. Now, on the contrary, lust and gluttony endeavor to overthrow the solid structure of the cross. And so God says by Isaiah, “O my people, they who bless you cause you to wander and trouble the paths of your feet.” Also by Jeremiah, “Flee out of the midst of Babylon, and save everyone his life, and believe not the false prophets who say, ‘Peace, peace,’ and there is no peace.” Who are always repeating, “The temple of the Lord, the temple of the Lord.” “Your prophets have seen for you false and foolish things. They have not laid bare your iniquity that they might call you to repentance. They devour God’s people like bread. They have not called on God.” Jeremiah announced the captivity and was stoned by the people. Hananiah, the son of Azzur, broke the bars of wood for the present but was preparing bars of iron for the future. False prophets always promise pleasant things and please for a time.
