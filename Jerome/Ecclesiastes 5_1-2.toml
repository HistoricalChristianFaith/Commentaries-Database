"Be not
rash with your mouth, and let not your heart be hasty to utter a word before
God; for God is in heaven and you are on earth, so let your words be few. For a dream comes from much concern, and
foolish talk from many words." Several men think that this teaches here
that we should not promise something too quickly in the presence of God, and
without due consideration of our strengths we vow things, which we cannot then
fulfil. God though is present in heaven,
but we seem to be on earth, yet he hears what we say and accuses that our
foolishness comes from our love of speech. 
But some men understand this better, affirming that this teaches that,
either speaking or thinking more about God than we are able, we hold to our opinions;
but we know our stupidity, since, as much as the heavens differ from the earth,
so our thoughts are separated from His character. And therefore our words ought to be
checked. Just as he that is much in
thought frequently dreams about those things about which he thinks during the
day; thus he, who wanted to teach more from divinity, falls into
foolishness. Or indeed it could mean
this: our words ought to be few therefore, since even those things, which we
think we know, we see through a mirror and in mystery, and as we understand a
dream, which we think we can grasp. 
Although we have done many things, as it appears to us, the end of our
argument is foolishness. For we do not
escape sin by too much speaking [Cfr Prov. 10, 19.].
