(Verse 30, 31.) What have we to do with you, Jesus, Son of God? Have you come here before the time to torment us? Now there was a herd of many pigs feeding not far off from them. And the demons begged him, saying, 'This confession is not of free will, which is followed by the reward of the confessor, but of forced necessity, which compels unwillingly, as if fugitive slaves see their master after a long time: they only beg to be spared from the beatings.' So, demons, seeing the Lord suddenly present on earth, believed that they had come to judge. The presence of the Savior is torment for demons. And some people foolishly think that demons know the Son of God, but are ignorant of the devil, because these demons are of lesser evil than the one whose servants they are. Since all knowledge of the disciples must be referred to the teacher, demons as well as the devil are more suspect of understanding the Son of God than knowing Him. No one knows the Father, except the Son, and whoever the Son chooses to reveal him to. (Matthew 11:27)
