(Verse 23 onwards) And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: Son of man, those who dwell in these ruined places in the land of Israel speak, saying: Abraham was one, and he possessed the land; but we are many, the land has been given to us as a possession. Therefore, you shall say to them: Thus says the Lord God: You who eat with blood and lift up your eyes to your idols, and shed blood, shall you inherit the land? You have stood with your swords, you have committed abominations, and each of you has defiled his neighbor's wife, and you will possess the land by inheritance? This you shall say to them: Thus says the Lord God: As I live, surely those who dwell in the ruins shall fall by the sword, and the one who is in the open field I will give to the beasts to be devoured, and those who are in strongholds and caves shall die by pestilence. And I will make the land a desolation and a waste, and the pride of its strength shall cease, and the mountains of Israel shall be desolate, so that no one will pass through. And they shall know that I am the Lord when I make their land a desolation and a waste because of all their abominations that they have committed. And you, son of man, the children of your people speak of you beside the walls and in the doors of the houses, and they say to one another, each to his brother, 'Come, and hear what is the word that comes forth from the Lord.' And they come to you as the people usually come, and they sit before you as my people, and they hear your words, but they do not do them, for they show my words of their mouth in song, and their heart follows their covetousness. Indeed, you are to them like a very lovely song that is sung with a beautiful and sweet sound, and they hear your words but do not do them. And when this comes to pass, behold, it comes; they shall know that a prophet has been among them. Firstly, it must be understood that approximately eight verses prior to the place which we have established: Those who partake in blood, and lift up your eyes to your impurities, until the place where it is written: These things you shall say to them, thus says the Lord God, are not found in the Septuagint, which, along with many others, have neglected these things, or as they have been interpreted by them, gradually removed from the writings due to error. And our Latin, or rather, envious Christians, or to say it more plainly, heirs of the Grunnian faction, bark against us, because we discourse according to the Hebrew: as if food were being imposed unwillingly, and not feasts being prepared for those who receive them with thanksgiving. Certainly, if they don't trust me, let them read other editions, Aquila's, Symmachus's, and Theodotion's; let them interrogate the Hebrews from different provinces, not just one place, so they don't boast that they have been bought by me; and when they see that all agree with my error or ignorance, then let them understand that they are too wise and desire to sleep rather than to learn; and let them live in the seventy cells of the Alexandrian lighthouse, so they don't lose their sails from the ships and don't sigh for damages to the ropes. Now let us discuss what we have proposed. After Jerusalem was captured and the temple destroyed, the poor of the land, of whom Jeremiah writes, were left alone in Jerusalem to cultivate vineyards and fields and to dwell in the ruins of the burned city. And although they should have repented for the reasons for their captivity, they deceived themselves with empty hope, saying: Our father Abraham was one, and yet he possessed this land as an inheritance, not because he himself possessed it, but because his descendants received the land of promise. If, therefore, he alone was multiplied into so many peoples, we who are left behind in the land of Judea, and dwell in desolate and ruined cities, will certainly be multiplied much more, so that we may possess more than he possessed alone. To this the Lord responded: Abraham possessed the land of promise by faith. For Abraham believed in God, and it was reckoned to him as righteousness (Genesis 15:8). However, these people, who are occupied with disbelief and wickedness, even if they are many, will not be able to possess. At the same time he lists the six kinds of sins that offend God, namely, those who eat in blood, and lift up your eyes to uncleanness, that is, to your idols, and pour out blood, that is, perpetrate murder: Could you, doing these things, be able to hold the land by inheritance? Nor are you content with this end of wickedness, but you stand daily in your swords, ready for killing, and imitating Esau, who stood, and lived in his sword, you do incredible abominations, namely, the shameful lusts of indecency, and each one defiles the wife of his neighbor; that you may be more wicked in that, that you have defiled the wife of your friend and neighbor. And when you do these things, do you think you will inherit the land? Therefore, answer them, O prophet, and reveal this sentence about them from my words. I swear by myself that those who dwell in ruins and walls will fall by the sword, and those who are in the fields or the plain will be devoured by beasts, and those who are in fortified places or caves cannot escape the wrath of God but will die of hunger and pestilence. And I will make the land of Judah into a desert, and its proud strength will fail, which once was its strength. But God resists the proud, and gives grace to the humble (James 4:6). Even the mountains and everything will be deserted, and it will become such a great solitude that no one will pass through them, and then those who remained will no longer trust in their multitude, but will realize the magnitude of the solitude and know that I am the Lord, who made the land a desert because of all the abominations they have done. Let these words be spoken against those who, after Jerusalem was captured and the entire region of the Jews devastated, dwelt in ruins and in deserted cities and villages. Now let us turn to tropology, and according to our custom, let us engage in a broad discussion rather than a mere dissertation. Every heretic dwells in walls and deserts, and believes himself to possess the land of Israel, and says: If Abraham, by his faith alone, came into such great blessedness that his descendants were multiplied like the sand of the sea and like the stars of heaven, how much more will we, who are many, possess the land of Israel, that is, those who see God, and the confession of the Lord's Day? To whom the Lord replied: He deservedly possessed the land of faith; but your infidelity, or rather blasphemy, will not be able to possess the land of Israel, that is, the Church. For first you eat in blood, shedding their blood whom you scandalize. Then you lift your eyes to your impurities or abominations, which you have fixed in your mind: when you ought to imitate the ecclesiastical man, and say: To you I lift up my eyes, you who dwell in heaven (Ps. CXXII, 1). Thirdly, you shed blood, not giving life to those whom you have deceived, but killing them. It is not enough for you to have done these three things, but you stand with your swords, that is, you persevere in the wickedness of your opinions, and you are ready for murder, and you commit abominations, doing those things in your beds which are shameful to speak of, and you defile the wife of your neighbor, namely, the ecclesiastical conversation, eagerly snatching away those who are daily deceived from the embrace of Christ. And when you have done these things, do you think you will possess the land of Israel as an inheritance? To whom God speaks, that whoever dwells in the ruinous assemblies of heretics will fall by the sword of Ecclesiasticus, concerning which it is written: 'Double-edged swords are in their hands' (Ps. 149:6). And in the Gospel: 'I did not come to bring peace, but a sword' (Matthew 10). And the servant who indulges in luxury and idleness will be divided, that is, he will be struck with a sword, and his portion will be placed with the unbelievers' (Luke 12). And whoever is in the field or in the countryside, will be handed over to beasts for devouring, which the prophet, desiring to avoid them, prays: Do not hand over to beasts the soul confessing to you (Ps. LXXIII, 19). But whoever is in strongholds and fortified places, of which it is written: The righteous ascends strong cities, and destroys their fortifications, in which the wicked trusted (Prov. XXI, 22); and he resides in caves, of which it is said: It is written, My Father's house will be called a house of prayer, but you have made it a den of thieves (Matt. XXI, 33): this person will die of the hunger of the word of the Lord, and of pestilence, and all the land of heretics will be turned into a desert, so that their pride is broken and the mountains are turned into a desert, which promised themselves the height of knowledge. Those mountains are called Israel, for under the name of Christ they deceive and overthrow everyone; no one will be able to pass through them, nor will anyone be able to say what Moses said: 'When I pass by, I will see this great vision' (Exodus 3:1). For the inhabitants of these perverse mountains are not strangers or visitors, but rather residents. And when they have suffered these things, then they will know that He is the Lord who has made their land a desert because of the abominations they have committed. It follows: On the same day and at the same time, that is, in the twelfth year, the tenth month, on the fifth day of the month, when he who had fled from Jerusalem came and when the prophet spoke to those who were in the land of Judah, and they promised themselves the hope of eternal possession, and the prophet commands him to say to the people who reside in Babylon and live with him, and to accuse them of deceitful plots who desire to hear the words of the prophet, not for the salvation of their souls, but for the pleasure of their ears. These people were sitting near the walls and at the doorways of houses, not at all desiring to enter into the understanding of the prophets; but they encourage one another and say: Come, let us hear what word is coming forth from the Lord; and thus they come as a people who enter the Church of God, and sit before you, my people, who claim to be mine, and do not want to do what they have heard. They seem to me to be like those who are entertained by theatrical songs: they listen to either tragedies or comedies, and there they revel with delight: so that when they have gone out from you, they repeat and sing them, and deceive themselves with sweet sounds. And they will listen, he says, to your words and not do them. Such are many in the Churches today, who say: Come let us hear him and him, rolling his words with marvelous eloquence of his preaching: they stir up applause, and shout, and wave their hands, and those things which they had neglected in their actions, once they realize that he has come (for it is necessary that what the prophet of God pronounces in his word should come to pass), then they will begin to approve and know that all the things they had heard were not the words of a man, but of the Lord, who spoke through the prophet and the man of the church.
