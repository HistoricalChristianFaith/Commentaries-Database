(Ver. 22.) Is there no balm in Gilead? Is there no physician there? Why then is there no healing for the wound of my people? Not only in this place, but also in many other passages of the Scriptures, we find the balm of Gilead being used as a symbol of repentance and healing. And now we wonder, why have the wounds of Jerusalem not been healed, and why have they not yet covered their skin with scars? This is because there are no prophets or priests to administer the healing balm.
