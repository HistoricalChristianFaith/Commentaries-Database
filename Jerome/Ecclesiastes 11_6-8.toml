"In the morning sow your seed, and in the
evening withhold not your hand: for you know not whether shall prosper, either
this or that, or whether they both shall be alike good. Truly the light is sweet, and a pleasant
thing it is for the eyes to behold the sun: 
But if a man lives many years, and rejoices in them all; yet let him
remember the days of darkness; for they shall be many. All that which comes is
vanity. "Do not choose which good deeds you do, but once you
have started doing good, never stop. The
evening will reveal the justice of the morning, and the sunrise will collect
the mercy of the evening. For it is
uncertain which work pleases God more, and by what means you will obtain the
fruit of righteousness. But it can
happen that not one but each one will please God. Another meaning could be that both in
childhood and in old-age you will have equal work. Do not say therefore, "I worked while I
was able, I ought to rest in old-age", for you do not know whether you
please God more in youth or in age. And
the thrift of youth too is of no use if old-age is taken up by indulgence. For the righteous has erred, not even his
former virtues can free him from death. 
And if you always do well according to each interpretation and work
equal amounts in each age, you will see God the Father, the sweetest light; you
will see Christ, the sun of righteousness. 
More precisely if you live for many years and always have good things or
do good deeds, you will still know that you are going to die, and the coming of
darkness will continually surround you: you will despise the present things as
if they were transient, frail and failing. 
Symmachus has interpreted the end of this idea in this way: if a man
lives for many years and if he has been happy in all this he ought to remember
the days of darkness, since they will be many, in which all will cease. Differently: in another place in the
Scripture God promises, saying, "I will give you timely rain and rain that
is late" [Deut. 11, 14.]. I will irrigate you with rain: the Old and
the New Testament. He warns about this
here so that we may read about the ancient law, lest we hate the Gospel, and in
this way ask about the spiritual understanding in the old text; lest we think
that what we read in the Gospels and apostles is only to be taken at face
value. For we do not know when more
knowledge and grace is divested to us by God, and he who is happy, who joined
both together to make it like one. For
he who has followed this will see the light, will see Christ, the light of justice. And if he lives for several years and with
knowledge of the Scriptures he will know the greatest happiness and enjoyment,
and he is forced more to this toil by the memory of his future judgement. Since the time of eternal darkness will come,
and perpetual punishments will be in stone for those who have not sown in the
morning and in the evening, and joined both in vain; they have not seen the
light or the sun, whence the light itself comes.
