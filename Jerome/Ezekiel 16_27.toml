(Verse 27.) Behold, I will stretch forth my hand over you and will take away your righteousness, and I will give you over to the souls of those who hate you, the daughters of the Philistines, who are ashamed of your wicked way. LXX: But if I stretch out my hand against you and take away your lawful possession and give you over to the souls of those who hate you, the daughters of foreigners who led you astray from your path. And what follows, 'ἠσέβησας,' that is, 'you acted impiously,' is connected with the following chapter according to the Septuagint, but according to the other translations, it is the end of the previous chapter. However, the Lord stretched out his hand over Jerusalem to correct the wrongdoer and take away its rightful possessions, which, as long as he observed God's commandments, were called the rightful possessions of the Lord. But when he worshiped idols and changed his religion into impiety, they are by no means called his rightful possessions. Which not only in the law and ceremonies, but also in the Sabbaths and feast days and new moons, must be observed. For in the law, it is said: My Sabbaths and my feast days. But when they turned away from God, it is said to them: I will not receive your new moons, and Sabbaths, and great day: my soul hates your fasting and rest, and your solemnities (Exodus 31; Deuteronomy 5; Isaiah 1:14). This is also written about the people (Deuteronomy 7). For when the people, who were previously called the people of God, turned away from the Lord, it is said of them concerning Moses: 'Your people, whom you brought out of the land of Egypt, has sinned' (Exodus XXXII, 7). The stretching out of the hand is here called elsewhere as lifting up or visiting. For when God does not correct the sinner, He withdraws His hand. But if the sinner sins and begins to be sick in God's law, a visitation is sent to him; according to what is sung in the psalm: 'If his children forsake my law and do not walk in my judgements, I will visit their iniquities with the rod' (Psalm LXXXIX, 31, 32). And in this the prophet has written: If the earth sins against me to commit a crime, I will stretch out my hand against it and break its bread supply, and so on. In this we are questioning what the difference is between the stretching out of the hand and its emission. However, the devil speaks to the Lord: Stretch out your hand and touch all that he has, unless he blesses you to your face (Job 2:5). And it seems to me that the hand is sent, for the testing of those to whom it is sent; but it is stretched out, for the punishment of those who deserve torment. Not only extension and outreach, but also the stretching out of God's hands is called expansion, as Isaiah proclaims from the perspective of the Lord: 'All day long I have held out my hands to a disobedient and contrary people' (Isa. 65:2). It is also narrated that the holy hands are lifted up, as Scripture says: 'Let my prayer be counted as incense before you, and the lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice' (Ps. 141:2). But since the legitimate practices of God have been taken away from the people of the Jews, let us ask them what observance of the law they have. The victims, with the temple being destroyed and overturned, cannot be offered; nor can the stoning of adulterers and the execution of other crimes permitted by law be carried out, nor can the year of release of the land and other similar things. However, it is given to the souls of the haters of the daughters of Palestine, when they are delivered to the Palestinians, whom the Seventy indiscriminately call foreigners: which we can understand as the cities or towns of Palestine. Our Jerusalem too, if we neglect the ceremonies of God, and his hand is stretched out against us, and the observance of the entire law is taken away, will be delivered to the daughters of Palestine and not to the sons. For we are not first consigned to more severe punishments, but according to the quality of sins, to lesser ones, so that being corrected in the lesser, we may avoid the greater torments. The Philistines, that is, the Palestinians, with the first part of the word changed, interpret it as falling by drinking, or breaking ((perhaps breaking)). By which it is signified that we are to be handed over to adversarial powers, who have drunk from the cup of Babylon and have fallen, and whose works are perverse. And so great will be the correction and disgrace of wretched Jerusalem, that even the opposing powers themselves will be ashamed at the magnitude of our sins. This we have interpreted according to Symmachus, 'scelerata': Theodotion placed the Hebrew word itself 'Zemma ()'. But with the ceremonies of God removed from the people of the Jews, it has passed to us along with the priesthood and the legislation, with the Scripture saying, 'Establish, O Lord, a legislator over them' (Psalm 9:21). And in another place: Set a law for me, O Lord, in your way (Psalm 26:11).
