"I acted
in grand style: I built myself houses, I planted vineyards; "and others such until the point where he says: "The
wise man has his eyes in his head, whereas the fool walks in darkness. "Before I discuss each of these in
turn it seems useful to me to encompass all of them in a short paragraph, and
to reduce their meanings to just one explanation, so that it is easier to
understand what is being said. I had all
things that have been considered good through the ages. I built myself a palace on high, and covered
the hills and mountains with vines. And
lest anything be lacking from my excess I planted gardens and orchards of
different kinds of trees, which were watered from above by water stored in
pools, so that the growth was fed for longer periods with continual
moisture. I also had an uncountable
number of slaves, buyers and natives, and many flocks of animals, cows of
course, and sheep- no king before me in Jerusalem had such a number. I also amassed a huge number of treasure
houses of gold and of silver, which I obtained as gifts from various kings and
as tributes from conquered races. And
because of this it happened that I was prompted by having too much wealth to
even more pleasures, and they called to me in choirs of music, flutes, lyres
and in songs, and each sex served in entertainment. Those temptations grew in such quantity as I
was lacking in wisdom. For desire had
dragged me to each and every pleasure and I was being carried along unbridled
and headlong, and I thought that that was the fruit of my labours, if I myself
was consumed with lust and luxury. 
Having then at last returned to my senses, and as if waking from a deep
sleep, I looked at my hands and saw that my work was full of vanity, full of
squalor, and full of the character of my folly. 
For I found nothing to be good that was considered good in the
world. Considering therefore those
things which were good for wisdom and which were bad for foolishness I rushed
to praise any man, who then refrained from his sins and was able to pursue true
virtues. Certainly there is a great
diversity between wisdom and foolishness, and virtues are as much separated
from vices as day differs from night. It
seems to me then that he that follows that path of wisdom always lifts his eyes
to heaven and raises his face aloft, and considers those things which are above
his head; but he that gives in to foolishness and vices fumbles in the darkness
and flounders in his ignorance of the world.  "I acted in grand style: I built houses for myself, I planted
vineyards. " He, who is raised up equal to the face of God
in the heavens, makes his work great; and he builds houses so that the Father
and the Son will come, and will live in them. 
And he plants vineyards to which Jesus will tie up his ass.
