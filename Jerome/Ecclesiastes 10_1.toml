"Dead
flies putrefy the perfumer's oil; a little folly outweighs wisdom and
honour. "Here he gives an example to illustrate the idea
expressed above, in which he says that many good things can be outweighed by
one fool, since one evil mixed with good in this way will pollute the greater
part of it, just as flies if they die in oil, make it lose its colour and
smell. And since wisdom is often mixed
with cleverness and prudence has wickedness, he teaches that we must search out
wisdom alone, or that it be mixed with the innocence of doves. Let us then be prudent to the good, and
simple in the face of the wicked. And
this is the meaning: let the righteous man have little simplicity on account of
his having too much suffering, and while he keeps his retribution for God, he
seems foolish, and does wickedness at once in vindication under the guise of
prudence. Another meaning could be those
flies that according to Isaiah inhabit a part of the river of Egypt, and
destroy the sweetness of oil and according to one source leave the smell of
their uncleanness [Cfr. Is. 7, 18.]. The chief of these flies is called Beelzebub
of the demons, and is interpreted as either 'the idol of flies' or 'the man of
the flies', or 'he who has flies' [Cfr. Matth. 12, 24.].
