(Verse 13.) And you are adorned with gold and silver. We have often said that gold pertains to the mind, and silver to eloquence. May the Lord grant us to receive divine understanding and wisdom, and to bring forth with eloquence what we conceive in our minds, and by no means to make an idol out of them as heretics do, of whom it is written: 'I gave them silver and gold, but they made a Baal out of silver and gold' (Hosea 2:8). And this, according to spiritual understanding, is more suited to the adornment of women. Otherwise, silver, a cheaper material, is suitable for the adornment of rustic and poor maidservants, which does not befit Jerusalem, which is said to have advanced to being a queen.

And you are dressed in fine linen and embroidered cloth and many colors, 70: And your clothing is made of fine linen, embroidered with multicolored thread. The Hebrew word "Mesi" here, Theodotion has translated as "bysso" above, Aquila has translated it as "ἄνθιμον," Symmachus as "polymitum." But we have said above that "polymitum" is similar to Symmachus' translation, meaning fine linen. The LXX has translated it as "trichapta," preserving the previous interpretation, in order to show a similarity to fine hair in the clothing. But all the adornment of women is described, such as bathing, cleaning, anointing with oil, and dressing in colorful garments, wearing hyacinth on their feet, girding themselves with fine linen, wearing fine and delicate clothes, wearing bracelets and a golden necklace, hanging circles on their ears, and small wheels, wearing a diadem on their head, decorated with gold and silver. Even though silver is a cheaper material and is brought in last. You are dressed in fine linen and multicolored clothes; or, as the Septuagint translated, with a cloak and a mantle, for these things signify not only that she was adorned in her physical appearance and had all the jewelry of women, but also that she was attentive to her bed and couch with marital diligence, so that after fulfilling these things, she would come to the delights of food, and not allow anything to be lacking even in these things. We will adapt all these things according to the higher explanation of spiritual intelligence: so that they may be covered with a fine fabric and delicate, so as not to burden the delicate limbs of the spouse with a heavy load of garments, but also to provide both utility and beauty.

You have eaten both honey and oil, and you have become exceedingly beautiful. After clothing, she takes care of food, so that she may eat the honey and oil, or in parts, as many believe, or in a mixture of the three, sweeter bread, which is the bread that descended from heaven (John 6); and under three names, as some think, it indicates the sacrament of the Trinity: not that there is a different substance for each; but so that through the different names of honey, oil, and flour, the unity of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit may be shown. And it should be noted that in many sacrifices, fine flour is offered, the purest part of the wheat, as it is written: And he fed them with the fat of wheat (Psalm 80:17): not barley or bran, which are only offered when the husband is moved by a spirit of jealousy. In the Book of Judges we read about Deborah (Judges 4), who is interpreted as a bee, whose prophecies are the sweetest honey, and she is related to the Holy Spirit, who is called by the Hebrews in the feminine gender, Rua. In the Gospel of the Hebrews, which the Nazarenes read, the Savior is presented speaking: 'My mother, the Holy Spirit, has taken me just now.' Furthermore, the wheat that is made into dough is related to the Lord, who says about himself, 'Unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains alone. But if it dies, it yields much fruit' (John 12:24). And the oil, which sustains and refreshes the limbs of the weary, and is the nourishment of light, and with which the constant light of the lamp is kindled in the tabernacle of God, is said to symbolize the Father. All of these bestow grace on those who believe, as the Apostle says: There are varieties of gifts, but the same Spirit; and there are varieties of service, but the same Lord; and there are varieties of activities, but it is the same God who empowers them all (1 Corinthians 12:4-5). Whoever eats this food, and that most sweet and delightful bread, and is nourished and fed by the splendor of the oil, will be transformed into beauty and become exceedingly beautiful, not once, but repeatedly, excessively, exceedingly. For indeed, the repeated adverb adds weight to the speech: so much so that nothing can be added beyond the greatness of beauty.

And you have succeeded in the kingdom. This is not found in the Septuagint, which perhaps those in Alexandria who were translating the Scriptures from Hebrew to Greek out of fear of offending the king of Egypt did not include, while they were stating that Jerusalem was the rightful kingdom from God. Although learned men attest that they have translated only the five books of Moses (See above, chapter V). After an abundant display of ornaments, after a crown, after an abundance of gold and silver, after beautiful garments and robes, after incredible splendor, he advances to be queen, because she is the city of a great king, of whom it is written: Give your judgment to the king, and your justice to the king's son (Psalm 17:1). And in the Apocalypse of John, Jerusalem is described as a bride adorned and prepared for her husband (Rev. 21). In the Psalms also, it is said of the same: The queen stood at your right hand in a golden robe, adorned with various decorations (Ps. 44:10). But everything we say about Jerusalem, so as not to dwell on individual details and not to make the size of the books tedious for readers, let us refer to the Church. For if Jerusalem, according to the Apostle (Gal. 4), is our mother; and our mother is the Church: therefore, Jerusalem is the Church, the mother of the primitive ones who are described in heaven.
