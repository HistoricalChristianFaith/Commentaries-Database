(V. 7) Before she was in labor, she gave birth; before her pain came, she delivered a male child. Who has heard of such a thing? Who has seen such things? Can a land be born in one day? Can a nation be brought forth all at once? For as soon as Zion was in labor, she gave birth to her sons. Shall I bring to the point of birth and not give delivery? says the Lord. Or shall I who gives delivery shut the womb? says your God. LXX: Before she who is in labor gives birth, before the pains of childbirth come upon her, she escapes and gives birth to a male. Who has heard such a thing? Who has seen such things? Shall a land be born in one day? Shall a nation be brought forth at once? For as soon as Zion was in labor, she gave birth to her children. But I have given this expectation, and you have not remembered me, says the Lord. Have I not made the barren woman give birth, says your God? With a noise as of a woman in labor, with a cry of distress from Jerusalem and her Temple, when she was besieged and destroyed, and with the enemies of Christ, who refused to receive God as their king, receiving eternal punishment for their impiety and blasphemies, the Church, gathered in the name of the Lord, of which it is said in the psalm: "A man is born in her"; and the Most High himself has founded her before she gives birth, she has given birth, before her labor pains come, she has given birth to a male. For it was not long, as the people of the Jews through Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and the twelve Patriarchs, and again through their children and grandchildren, grew in size, but at the preaching of the Gospel the whole world immediately conceived, and brought forth, and gave birth to a male, whom Pharaoh and Herod were trying to kill, who was also saved in Egypt both in Moses and in Christ. Finally, Abraham and Isaac had male children, and Jacob was the father of many sons, and he begot one daughter, for whom he endured hardship. But if the daughters of Zelophehad, according to the will of God, inherit their father's property (Num. 27), it should be considered that their father died in his sin, having no sons, and Moses did not dare to judge them, but referred the matter to the Lord, who commanded them to marry their kinsmen so that they would not be left destitute. The book of Genesis (Ch. 6) also tells us that after people began to multiply, a great number of them engaged in wickedness, and the daughters born to them were taken by the sons of God, not angels, from whom the giants were born; or as it is written in Hebrew, ἐπιπίπτοντες, that is, 'falling upon' or 'descending upon.' In contrast to the holy, it is said: 'Your wife will be like a fruitful vine within your house; your children will be like olive shoots around your table' (Psalm 128:3). And again: 'May you see your children's children' (ibid., 128:6). Therefore, Zion gave birth, that is, the remnant of Israel and the faith of believing Apostles, to the male Lord and Savior, who was generated in the whole world at the same time, which no one heard, which no history or teaching narrates, so that all nations would believe in a short time. And of all nations, one nation became Christian, of which Paul also speaks: If any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new (II Cor. V, 17): in accordance with what is written elsewhere: And they shall worship before him, all the families of the nations: for the kingdom is the Lord's, and he shall have dominion over the nations. For, says he, all nations whom thou hast made shall come and worship before thee, and shall glorify thy name (Psal. XXI, 28 et seqq.). About whom Jacob says: He is the expectation of the nations (Gen. XLIX, 10). And the Psalmist: The hope of all the ends of the earth (Ps. LXIV, 6). And the same Isaiah whom we will now explain: There shall be a root of Jesse, and he that shall rise up to rule the nations, in him the Gentiles shall hope (Isai. XI, 10); the Apostles fulfilling what was commanded: Teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit (Matth. XXVIII, 19), so that a new people may be born, of whom the twenty-first psalm also sings: The heavens shall declare his justice, to a people that shall be born, which the Lord hath made (Psal. XXI, 32). And again: The people that shall be created shall praise the Lord (Ps. 101:19). But this people was created in one day, which the sun of justice illuminates, as the Scripture says: The Lord shall be unto thee an everlasting light (Isa. 60:19). We can understand this that is said: A nation shall be born together, because Zion has brought forth and borne her children, and refer it to that time when, in one day, three thousand and five thousand of the Jewish people believed (Acts 2). It is also said in the same book of the Acts of the Apostles that people from all the nations under heaven were in Jerusalem, hearing them speak in various languages about the great deeds of God (Ibid.). And what follows according to the Septuagint, 'But I have given this expectation, and you have not remembered me,' says the Lord. 'Did I not make the barren woman give birth?' your God says, and it is more clearly stated in Hebrew, which all other interpreters agree with: 'Did I not, who make others give birth, not give birth myself?' says the Lord. If I, who give birth to others, am sterile, says the Lord your God, according to what is said elsewhere: 'He who planted the ear, does he not hear? He who formed the eye, does he not see?' (Psalm 39:9). That is to say, the one who created all men out of nothing, can make one part of all nations into the Church of believers. Finally, in the twenty-eighth psalm, where we read: 'The voice of the Lord shakes the desert' (Psalm 29:8), in Hebrew it is written: 'The voice of the Lord makes the desert give birth' (According to the Hebrew), so that the desert may first give birth to the Church, and the stags may be completed in open and broken places. Furthermore, according to the Septuagint, here the meaning is that at one time the preaching of the Gospels will arise from one nation of the whole world. This has been promised many times by the prophets, and you have not remembered my promise, O city that is full of cries: O Temple that has been abandoned by the Lord: O people, to whom I have restored their fortunes. Did I not, it is said, make the barren woman give birth; she who was once barren, later gave birth and brought forth? About which it is written in the psalm: He maketh the barren woman to keep house and to be a joyful mother of children (Psalm 113:9). Or certainly, the order of things has been reversed: the one who was bearing children has become barren, and the one who was once barren has borne many, for this is the sentence of the Lord.
