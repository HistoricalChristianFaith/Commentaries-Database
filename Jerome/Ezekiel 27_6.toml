(Vers. 6.) They have fashioned oars for your ship from the oak trees of Bashan: they have made your benches out of Indian ivory, and your decks out of the islands of Italy. LXX: They have made your oars and your temples out of the oak trees of Bashan, and they have made for you wild houses out of ivory from the islands of the Kittim. What a beautiful ship it is, and its furnishings, that it has cedar oars, not just any, but from Bashan, and ivory benches, and precious goods are stored in the cellars or warehouses, from the islands of the Kittim, which we refer to as Italy: from that region which is closer to Greece, understanding all the parts of the Western islands. Let us therefore say, according to the spiritual interpretation, that the oars of the Tyrian ship are made from Bazan, of which it is also written in the Psalms: 'The Lord said, I will turn Bazan from the depths of the sea' (Ps. 68:23). Bazan in our language is interpreted as ignominy. Therefore, God converts those who were in the depths of the sea, and the ignominy of sins, and converts them into oars, so that they may navigate with the Apostles and reach the land and the shores; and they become benches of ivory when they mortify their bodies, or when they use their teeth for the praises of God, and storerooms or cellars of the islands of Kittim, which, according to the etymology of the Hebrew language, is translated as 'struck,' so that it may not be so much killed by the blows of the devil as approved. We can speak about the ivory and wild houses of the islands of the Chettiim, which the heretics try to build not in the house of God, but on a Tyrian ship. And they, having their own ivory of language, build temples of God that are contrary to the temple, and wild houses, dwellings of beasts, even though the Scripture says that groves, and woods, and forests should not be planted in the house of God (Deut. XII).
