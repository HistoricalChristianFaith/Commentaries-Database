(Verse 5) And he said to me: Son of man, lift up your eyes toward the north. So I lifted up my eyes toward the north, and behold, north of the altar gate was the idol of jealousy in the entrance. Because we have set up the idol of jealousy north of the altar gate, the seventy translators have translated it as: From the north to the east gate, which is not found in Hebrew; leaving out the rest of what is written there. He said, he said to me, either the glory of God, which I had seen in the field, or the spirit that lifted me up between heaven and earth. And he spoke to me, after he had transported me to Jerusalem, and made me see either the city or the temple, and commanded me to lift up my eyes towards the way of the North. For there a statue of Baal was placed, which he calls the idol of Zeal, at the very entrance of the gate. But those who attribute the idol of Zeal, either to the possession or to the glory of God or the spirit, do impious things, by changing the persona of the idol, altering the majesty of God.
