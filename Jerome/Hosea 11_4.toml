And as the lover of humankind I will draw them to believing in cords of love, just as that which is written in the Gospel: “No one comes to me unless the Father who sent me will have drawn him.” But they thought that my light yoke was very heavy; and I bent toward them, leaving the kingdom of heaven so that I may eat with them, having assumed the human form. Or rather, I gave them my body as food; I was both food and table companion.
