She counsels them and says, “Wait here for three days.” Not one day does she specify, nor two days, but definitely three days. Notice what she says: “Wait three days.” She does not designate three nights but three days, for hers was an enlightened heart. Then she says, and after three days—but what does she say? “Do not go through the open plains,” she warns, “but go up the mountain way.” The faith of the church is not laid in the valleys but is established on the mountains. Later, indeed, Jericho is overthrown, but this harlot alone is preserved untouched; hence, the Lord says, “I will be mindful of Rahab”; that is, on the day of judgment, I will be mindful of her who welcomes my messengers.
