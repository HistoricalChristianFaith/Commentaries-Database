"So I
said: wisdom is better than might, although a poor man's wisdom is despised and
his words go unheeded. "Although no one remembers a poor wise man,
and everyone is happy, and admires power and riches; I however admire this
despised wisdom according to all of the interpretations given above, and the
words which none thinks worthy to be heard.
