John says in the book of Revelation, “He who has the key of David, he who opens and no one shuts, and who shuts and no one opens.” The scribes and Pharisees held this key in the law. The Lord warns them in the Gospel, “Woe to you lawyers, who hold the key of the kingdom of heaven.” O you Pharisees, who hold the keys of the kingdom and do not believe in Christ who is the gate of the kingdom and the door. The promise is made to you, but it is granted to us. You have the flesh, but we have the spirit. Since you deny the spirit, you have lost the flesh with the spirit.
