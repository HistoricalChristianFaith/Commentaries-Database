You cannot deny that the prisoner and the jailers were of unequal merit. And what were the circumstances of that shipwreck involving the apostle and the soldiers? The apostle Paul described a vision afterwards and said that those who were on the ship had been given to him by the Lord. Are we to suppose that he to whom they were given and they who were given to him were of the same merit? Ten righteous people can save a sinful city. Lot together with his daughters was delivered from the fire. His son-in-laws would also have been saved, had they been willing to leave the city. Now, there was surely a great difference between Lot and his son-in-laws. One city out of the five was savedâ€”Zoar, a place that lay under the same sentence as Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah and Zeboiim, but was preserved by the prayers of a holy man. Lot and Zoar were of different merit, but both of them escaped the fire.
