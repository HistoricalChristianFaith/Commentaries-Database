“To sit at my right and at my left is not mine to grant to you, but to those for whom it has been prepared by my Father” must be understood as follows: the kingdom of heaven does not belong to the one giving but to the one receiving. “For there is no respecting of persons with God.” But whoever has proven himself in such a way that he is made worthy of the kingdom of heaven will receive what has been prepared, not for a person but for a life. If therefore you are such that you pursue the kingdom of heaven which my Father has prepared for the triumphant and victorious, you also will receive it. Others wish that it was spoken about Moses and Elijah, whom they had seen speaking with him a little earlier on the mountain, but this view does not seem at all plausible to me. The names of those sitting in the kingdom of heaven are not spoken, lest the rest be considered excluded by the few who are named. .

It is asked how the sons of Zebedee, namely, James and John, drank the cup of martyrdom when Scripture says that such an apostle as James was beheaded by Herod, but John ended life with a natural death. But if we read the ecclesiastical histories, we see it related that even John himself for the sake of martyrdom was sent into a vat of boiling oil and from there proceeded as an athlete to win the crown of Christ. Immediately he was sent away to the island of Patmos. So we shall see that the spirit of martyrdom was not lacking and that John drank the cup of confession, which even the three boys in the furnace of fire drank, although their persecutor did not shed blood. .

The Lord having concluded by saying, “And shall rise again the third day;” the woman thought that after His resurrection He should forthwith reign, and with womanish eagerness grasps at what is present, forgetful of the future. Except any will say that between the time of the Apostle’s calling, and the suffering of Christ, Zebedee was dead, and that thus hersex helpless, her age advanced, she was following Christ’s steps; for faith never grows old, and religion feels never weary. Her maternal affection made her bold to ask, whence it is said, “She worshipped Him, and desired a certain thing of Him;” i. e. she did Him reverence, requesting that what she should ask, should be granted her. It follows, “He said unto her, whatwouldest thou?” He asks not because He knows not, but that by its very statement, the unreasonableness of her petition might be shewn; “She saith unto him, Grant that these my two sons may sit.”.
And no wonder, if she is convicted of inexperience, seeing it is said of Peter, "Not knowing what he said.” .
But to me this seems not so. Rather the names of them that shall sit in the kingdom of heaven are not named, lest that, if some few were named, the rest should think themselves shut out; for the kingdom of heaven is not of him that gives it, but of him that receives it.Not that there is respect of persons with God, but whosoever shall show himself such as to be worthy of the kingdom of heaven, shall receive it, for it is prepared not for condition, but forconduct.Therefore if you shall be found to be such as to be fit for that kingdom of heaven which My Father has made ready for the conquerors, ye shall receive the same. He said not, Ye shall not sit there, that He might not discourage the two brethren; while He said not, Ye shall sit there, that He might not stir the others to envy.
