It is asked how the sons of Zebedee, namely, James and John, drank the cup of martyrdom when Scripture says that such an apostle as James was beheaded by Herod, but John ended life with a natural death. But if we read the ecclesiastical histories, we see it related that even John himself for the sake of martyrdom was sent into a vat of boiling oil and from there proceeded as an athlete to win the crown of Christ. Immediately he was sent away to the island of Patmos. So we shall see that the spirit of martyrdom was not lacking and that John drank the cup of confession, which even the three boys in the furnace of fire drank, although their persecutor did not shed blood.

“To sit at my right and at my left is not mine to grant to you, but to those for whom it has been prepared by my Father” must be understood as follows: the kingdom of heaven does not belong to the one giving but to the one receiving. “For there is no respecting of persons with God.” But whoever has proven himself in such a way that he is made worthy of the kingdom of heaven will receive what has been prepared, not for a person but for a life. If therefore you are such that you pursue the kingdom of heaven which my Father has prepared for the triumphant and victorious, you also will receive it. Others wish that it was spoken about Moses and Elijah, whom they had seen speaking with him a little earlier on the mountain, but this view does not seem at all plausible to me. The names of those sitting in the kingdom of heaven are not spoken, lest the rest be considered excluded by the few who are named.

(Ver. 23.) He said to them: 'You will indeed drink my cup. But to sit at my right hand and at my left is not mine to give you, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared by my Father.' It is questioned how James and John, the sons of Zebedee, drank the cup of martyrdom, when the Scripture narrates that only James the Apostle was beheaded by Herod (Acts XII): but John ended his life by his own death. But if we read the ecclesiastical histories, in which it is reported that he himself, on account of martyrdom, was sent into a vat of boiling oil, and from there as an athlete proceeded to receive the crown of Christ, and was immediately banished to the island of Patmos, we will see that the spirit for martyrdom was not lacking, and that John drank the cup of confession: which three young men also drank in the fiery furnace (Dan. III), although the persecutor did not shed blood. But what he says: to sit at my right hand and my left, is not mine to give to you, but to those for whom it has been prepared by my Father, it is to be understood as follows: The kingdom of heaven is not about giving, but about receiving. For there is no partiality with God (Acts 10:34): but whoever presents themselves in such a way as to become worthy of the kingdom of heaven, will receive what has been prepared not for individuals, but for life. Therefore, if you are among those who will attain the kingdom of heaven, which my Father has prepared for the triumphant and victorious, you will also receive it. Others want to interpret the saying about Moses and Elijah, whom they had seen talking with him on the mountain a little while ago, but it does not seem so to me. For the names of those who are seated in the kingdom of heaven are not spoken; lest, with a few being named, the others are thought to be excluded.
