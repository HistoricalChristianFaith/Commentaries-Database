(Verse 15 and following) Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep's clothing but inwardly are ravenous wolves. You will recognize them by their fruits. Are grapes gathered from thornbushes, or figs from thistles? So, every healthy tree bears good fruit, but the diseased tree bears bad fruit. And by their fruits you will know them. It is possible to understand all things, as those who promise one thing in appearance and speech but show another thing in action. But especially, this should be understood about heretics, who seem to clothe themselves in the appearance of piety through continence, chastity, and fasting, but inwardly they have a poisoned heart and deceive the minds of the simple brothers. Therefore, from the fruits of the soul, which drag innocence to ruin, they are compared to ravenous wolves.
