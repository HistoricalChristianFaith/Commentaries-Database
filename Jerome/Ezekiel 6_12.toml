(Verse 12.) Whoever is far away will die from the plague; whoever is near will fall by the sword, and whoever is left and surrounded by famine will die, and I will fulfill my wrath upon them. Whoever escapes the siege of the city and migrates to the desert will die from the plague; whoever is near will fall by the enemy's sword. And whoever is surrounded by the enemy's army will perish from famine and lack: in all of these, the wrath of God will be fulfilled, so that those who remain may know that He is the Lord. Whoever departs from the Church will immediately die of the plague. Whoever considers themselves free and diligent, unless they take caution, will be struck by the sword of their enemies. Whoever is content with simple faith, like dumb animals, indeed belongs to the Church, but does not make any progress in good works; nor is he an imitator of the ant, which prepares and gathers food in the harvest, he will die of hunger, and the anger of the Lord will be fulfilled in all these things.
