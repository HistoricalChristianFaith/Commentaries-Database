Because Peter had asked imprudently, he does not merit the Lord’s answer. But the Father answered for the Son so that the word of the Lord might be fulfilled: “I do not bear witness for myself, but the Father who sent me, he bears witness for me.” The cloud appears bright and shades them, so that those who were looking for a material booth made from boughs or tents might be protected with the shade of a shining cloud. The voice of the Father speaking from heaven is also heard. It provides testimony and teaches Peter the truth with error removed, and in fact through Peter teaches all the apostles: “This is my beloved Son.” It is for him that you must build the tabernacle, him you must obey. “My Son” is distinguished from his servants, Moses and Elijah. They, along with you, are to prepare a tabernacle for the Lord in the inner sanctum of their heart.

(Verse 5) While he was still speaking, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them. And behold, a voice from the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased; listen to him. Because he had asked foolishly, he does not deserve an answer from the Lord, but the Father speaks for the Son, so that the word of the Lord may be fulfilled: I do not testify of myself, but the Father who sent me, he testifies of me (John 5:37 and 8:18). But the cloud is seen as both bright and shadowed: like those who sought the tabernacle from the fleshly leaves or tents, they would be covered by the shadow of the bright cloud. Moreover, the voice of the Father speaking from heaven is heard, which also testifies to the Son; and through Peter, with error removed, teaches the truth: even through Peter to the other apostles. This is, he says, my beloved Son: to him the tabernacle must be affixed, to him obedience must be given. Here is the son, those slaves are: Moses and Elias themselves must prepare a tabernacle for the Lord with you in the innermost depths of their heart.
