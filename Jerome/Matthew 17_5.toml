Because Peter had asked imprudently, he does not merit the Lord’s answer. But the Father answered for the Son so that the word of the Lord might be fulfilled: “I do not bear witness for myself, but the Father who sent me, he bears witness for me.” The cloud appears bright and shades them, so that those who were looking for a material booth made from boughs or tents might be protected with the shade of a shining cloud. The voice of the Father speaking from heaven is also heard. It provides testimony and teaches Peter the truth with error removed, and in fact through Peter teaches all the apostles: “This is my beloved Son.” It is for him that you must build the tabernacle, him you must obey. “My Son” is distinguished from his servants, Moses and Elijah. They, along with you, are to prepare a tabernacle for the Lord in the inner sanctum of their heart. .
