They came, then, to Bethsaida, into the village of Andrew and Peter, James and John. Bethsaida means “house of fishers,” and, in truth, from this house, hunters and fishermen are sent into the whole world. Ponder the text. The historical facts are clear, the literal sense is obvious. But we must now search into its spiritual message. That he came to Bethsaida, that there was a blind man there, that he departed, what is there remarkable about all that? Nothing, but what he did there is great; striking, however, only if it should take place today, for we have ceased to wonder about such things.

Watch this very carefully. Note exactly what is said. In the home village of the apostles, there is a blind man. In the very place where the apostles were born there is blindness. Do you grasp what I am saying? This blind man in the very home of the apostles is like the lost covenant people of Israel.
