(Verse 25.) And all the kings of Elam, and all the kings of the Medes. From this, since Zamri follows Elam and the kings of the Medes, we conclude that Zamri is the region of Persia, unless perhaps because Arabia came before, and these kings should be understood as the kings of the wilderness. Elam, however, is a region of Persia beyond Babylon, from which also the Elamites. Likewise, the Medes and the Persians, by whom Babylon was captured and destroyed. And they themselves were able to drink from the mixed cup, with Alexander, the king of the Macedonians, offering it.


And all the kings of the North ((or of Babylon)) from nearby and far away. Because he had listed the regions of Persia and Babylon, Elam and the Medes; now he generally includes all the kings of the North, those who are nearby and those who are far away. For the North, which is called Saphon in Hebrew (), the Septuagint translates it as 'the furthest', which we can call 'Subsolanum'.
