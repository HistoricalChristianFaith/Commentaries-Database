"What
has been, already exists, and what is still to be, has already been, and God
seeks him that suffers persecution." All things we perceive in the past, present
or future, they themselves have been, are, and will be. That same sun which now rises, existed before
we were in this world, and after we die, it will rise again. But we have mentioned the sun, so that we
understand other things to be the same as they have been before. Because if they are seen to die by what we
call death, they do not really die, but grow again given a second life, and
nothing dies forever but is reborn and relives as if with a certain new
seed. For this is what he says:
"and God seeks him that suffers persecution", which is said better in
Greek "kai ho theos zetesei to diokomenon "that
is what dies, what has perished, and has ceased to be. But if that speaks about all that are in the
world there is no doubt about man, that having died he will be reborn. But if anyone likes to choose a beginning as
if his own, "and God seeks him that suffers persecution", he uses
this evidence in the persecution of certain people: to comfort him, who had
persevered in martyrdom. And since all
in this world, who want to live religiously, follow the apostle, they suffer
persecution and take consolation in the fact that God seeks him that suffers
persecution, just as he seeks out the blood of a man who has been murdered, and
comes to seek what has perished, and carry the wandering sheep back to the
flock on his shoulders. [Cfr Luc. 19, 10 ; 15, 4-7.]
