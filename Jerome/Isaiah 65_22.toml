If, however, as in the Septuagint, we read “the days of the tree of life,” which makes more sense than the Hebrew text, we should understand that it refers to the tree of life that was located in paradise, from which place Adam was expelled so that he would be unable to extend his hand to the tree and thus live. Paradise was then put under the custody of the cherubim, that is, “abundance of knowledge,” and a flaming sword was established to guard the way to the tree of life, lest sinful Adam, not yet recognizing his sin, eat of the tree and die the ultimate death in a desperate state of impenitence. Solomon offered an especially lucid interpretation of this tree of life when, speaking from the wisdom of God, he said, “The tree of life is for all who approach it and rely on it as upon the sure foundation who is the Lord.” Neither is there any doubt whom the Word of God signifies, who is Life and Wisdom himself, as he said: “I am the Life.” …And does it not seem to you that their works daily grow old who press ahead into the future while forgetting the past? For this reason, both the Old and the New Testaments say that it is not the old that perishes but that on which nothing new succeeds.
