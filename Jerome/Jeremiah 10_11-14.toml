The psalmist writes, “Such knowledge is too wonderful for me. It is high; I cannot attain unto it.” In another: “When I thought how I might know this, it was too painful for me until I went into the sanctuary of God and considered their latter end.” And later in the same psalm, “I was as a beast before you; nevertheless I am continually with you.” And Jeremiah says, “Every person is become brutish and without knowledge.”
