(Judges 5:4-5) Lord, when you went out from Seir and passed through the regions of Edom, the earth trembled, the heavens and clouds poured down with water. It is said that the Lord went out from Seir and passed through Edom because the Edomites refused to receive his law, so he gave the law of Israel on Mount Sinai. The earth trembled, the heavens and clouds poured down with water. The earthquake of Mount Sinai is described. And when it says, 'The heavens and clouds poured down with water,' it means that in the presence of the Lord, the heavens, as if in fear, emitted sweat, which is said to have dripped down like water. Similarly, the mountains flowed from the presence of the Lord. And what follows, 'Sinai from the presence of the Lord God of Israel,' must be understood: it trembled and smoked.
