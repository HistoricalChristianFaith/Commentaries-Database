(Vers. 6, 7.) In the land of trouble and distress there will be a lioness and a lion: there will also be venomous snakes and flying serpents. They will carry their riches on the backs of donkeys and their treasures on the humps of camels to a people who cannot help them. Egypt will be useless and in vain for assistance. LXX: In trouble and distress there will be a lion and a lion's cub: then there will be asps and flying snake offspring. They will carry their riches on donkeys and camels to a nation that will not help them. The Egyptians will be empty and useless for your benefit. For the lion, in Hebrew it is written Leis () (also Lehis), and for the flying ruler, which the Seventy translated as flying asps, in Hebrew it is called ἐμπρηστὴς and flying, which we can call the burner, and in Hebrew it is called Saraph (). Again, in that place where we have translated, carrying on the shoulders of the beasts, they have uniformly translated all the animals as foals, that is, the young of donkeys. But the land of tribulation and anguish signifies the very wide desert, through which the remnants of Jerusalem, along with John the son of Careah and the daughters of King Zedekiah, having taken away all they could have, fled to Egypt. Likewise, understand metaphorically the lioness and the lion cub as Jerusalem and its people, as Balaam says in Numbers: Behold the people shall rise up as a lioness, and shall lift itself up as a lion; it shall not rest until it devour the prey, and drink the blood of the slain (Num. XXIII, 24). In Ezekiel it is also written: Take up a lamentation for the prince of Israel, and say: Why has your mother the lioness lain down among lions, and reared her whelps in the midst of young lions? (Ezek. 19:1-2). And lest we think that Holy Scripture truly speaks of the lioness and the lion contrary to the nature of things, that a viper and a flying basilisk should be born of a lioness and a lion, that is, that worse offspring should be generated from evil parents, of whom the Gospel also spoke: Brood of vipers, who has shown you to flee from the wrath to come? (Matt. 3:7). And to the land of Israel it is said: You are a land where it does not rain, nor does the rain come upon you in the day of anger, whose rulers are in its midst, like roaring lions, seizing prey, devouring souls by their power (Above, V). These offspring of vipers, or flying asps, that is, the rulers of the people and the whole crowd of the wicked, went to the people who could not help them, as Jeremiah says (Jer. LVI), that the Lord delivered Pharaoh, the crafty king of Egypt, into the hands of his enemies, and into the hands of those seeking his life, and all the men of Judah, who were in the land of Egypt, were consumed by sword and famine, to the point that the Hebrews delivered Jeremiah and Baruch, before Nebuchadnezzar captured Egypt, from the imminent captivity, avoiding death. A certain lioness and her lion cub, a celestial lion, were deceived by Jerusalem and exposed the people. And a flying king, and vipers, and offspring of asps, of whom we read above (Above. XIV and XXVII), a twisted serpent, and of whom the Savior spoke in the Gospel: I saw Satan, like lightning falling from heaven (Luke X, 19): who is called the dragon in the Apocalypse (Rev. XII), he drew with him a third part of the stars to the earth, who, by the perversity of their judgement, lost their former riches, abandoning them to the Egypt of this age.


Therefore I cried out concerning this: it is only pride: be silent. For this reason, I do not know what the Seventy Interpreters intended: Proclaim these things, because your consolation is in vain. Furthermore, Symmachus interpreted it as 'turbulence is to dwell', that is, they are tumultuous in their habitation. The Hebrew word Reeb, or Reheb according to some, is translated by Aquila as 'impetus and pride', by Symmachus as 'disturbance', by the LXX as 'vanity', and by Theodotion as 'latitudinarianism'; which is written with three letters, Res (ר), He (ה), and Beth (ב), and it is the same as what is read in the Psalms: 'I will be mindful of Rahab and Babylon, those who know me' (Ps. XXVI, 3). And the meaning is: Since the Egyptians offer empty help, I commanded him, that is, Jerusalem, or I exclaimed, that the Egyptians only have the name of a kingdom, and without power they boast; and Israel should sit or dwell in their own land, and not seek help in vain from the weak.
