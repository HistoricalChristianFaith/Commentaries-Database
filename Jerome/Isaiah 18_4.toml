(Verse 4) Because this is what the Lord said to me: I will rest, and I will consider in my place. What is it that the Lord said to the Prophet? This is what follows: until what I have commanded comes, I will rest in my seat: as the Jews believe, in the Temple; as we believe, in heaven. And I will consider, he says, the coming of the end of things.

Just as the midday light is bright, and just as the morning mist is in the day of harvest. Just as in the whole day nothing is brighter than midday, when the sun shines from the middle of the sky, and equally illuminates the whole world, and just as in the heat and hot air, when the naked harvester is scorched, and the magnitude of the labor tests his breath, the temperate dew is most pleasing, if the morning moisture makes the dry stalks cuttable: in the same way, my speech, which I will consider in my place, will come gratefully to all who believe in me.
