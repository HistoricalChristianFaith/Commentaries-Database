"  In the day when the keepers of the house shall tremble, and the
strong men shall bow themselves; "The keepers of the house can be interpreted as either
the sun and the moon, and the remaining choir of stars, or the angels who keep
watch over this world. The men of great
strength though, or the brave, as Symmachus has interpreted it, are those who
die, or as Aquila has translated it, those who err, and are felt to be demons,
for they are called those chosen by the powerful devil. The Lord overpowered him, and joining him,
according to the parable of the Gospel [Luc. 11, 14-26.],
destroys his house. Differently: the
keepers of the house, who relate all things, which are written to the body of
man, think that it means ribs, because the intestines are hemmed in by them,
and all of the fleshy parts of the stomach are protected in this way. They think that the strong men are to be
interpreted as legs; the sun and moon and stars therefore pertain to the eyes,
nose and ears, and receive all the sensations of the head. But they do not interpret this to such an
extent, because they are forced deeper by necessity, not by demons, or the sun,
moon, or stars, but to understand what follows according to the limbs of man. "And
the grinders cease because they are few, and those that look out of the windows
be darkened. "In the beginning of
the world when the charity of most was cold and the spirits of teachers were
few, who were able to offer the food of heaven to believers, and they were
carried to the heaves; then those who in part see the light of knowledge in
this world began to be darkened. For it
is said to Moses: "sit yourself in this hole in the rock, and you will see
me pass" [Ex. 33, 22.]. Oh how much more one spirit saw the truth
through that opening and those dark caves! 
Differently: there are two grinders, from whom one is taken, the other
is left, the Gospel is not silent in this matter [Cfr. Matth. 24, 41.]. And when they are few, and have ceased, it is
necessary that every light of knowledge is removed from our eyes. Differently: they think the grinders have
ceased because they are few, and that it is talking about teeth. And when at last old-age comes even teeth are
worn away, or they fall out, which usually grind down food to be sent to the
stomach. But seeing it grow dark in the
caves, they think it means eyes because sight darkens with old-age, and sight
is made difficult.
