(Chapter 4, Verse 1) And the angel who spoke to me came back and woke me up like a man who is awakened from his sleep. LXX: And the angel who spoke to me came back and woke me up as a man is usually awakened from his sleep. For wherever he had gone, in order to return he had to be with the prophet who was speaking to him, and without him he could not exist. But whenever human frailty is left to its weakness, we must believe that the help of God and his angels departs from us. Therefore, the prophet, astonished by the wonder of a great vision, was bewildered in his whole mind and could not see the clear light of truth. Thus, he is awakened from a past vision and brought to another vision as if waking from sleep, in order to see what he could not see with closed eyes. Let us say it differently. The proverb of Solomon testifies: If you sit, you will be without fear; but if you sleep, you will sleep sweetly and you will not fear the terror that comes upon you, nor the attacks of the wicked (Prov. III, 23 et seqq.) . Let us, therefore, see for what things, as if rising from sleep, the prophet may contemplate.
