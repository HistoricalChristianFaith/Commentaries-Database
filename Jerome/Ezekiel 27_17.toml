(Verse 17.) Judah and the land of Israel themselves, your merchants, offered to you in your markets, as the first fruits: balsam and honey, and oil, and resin. LXX: Judah and the sons of Israel, these are your merchants in the wheat trade and in ointments: they gave you first honey and oil, and resin in your markets. The Hebrew word 'Phanag' (פַּנַּג) was translated by Aquila, Symmachus, and Theodotion in the way that it is written in Hebrew: for which the LXX translated 'ointment', we translate 'balsam'. It is said, however, that the land of Judaea, which is now called Palestine, abounds in provisions, such as grain, balsam, honey, oil, and resin, which are carried from Judaea and Israel to the market of Tyre. And when the literal meaning is clear, according to the spiritual sense, we say that the land of confession, and the understanding of God that pertains to the Church, should not carry to Tyre the first wheat, which, when it falls to the ground, multiplies and is taken as the word of God: For man does not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of God (Deut. 8:3). Then the balsam that grows in the vineyards of En-gedi, or the ointment, of which it is written: 'Like the ointment on the head, that ran down upon the beard, the beard of Aaron.' (Psalm 133:2). And the honey about which Solomon speaks: 'Thou hast found honey, eat what is sufficient for thee; lest thou be filled therewith and vomit it.' (Proverbs 25:16), for excessive satisfaction turns honey into wormwood. Also the oil with which the lamp in the tabernacle of God is lit, lest that prophetic saying be applied to us: 'Thou didst sell the oil in Egypt.' (Hosea 12:1). But if it is in Egypt and in Tyre, it will turn to the opposite, and it will be said of it, 'The oil of the sinner will not anoint my head' (Ps. CXL, 5). But resin is also gentle, suitable for bodies, and is taken as medicine. Hence it is written in Jeremiah: Is there not resin in Gilead? Is there no physician there? Why then has the healing of the daughter of my people not gone up? (Jer. VIII, 22). Jacob also had this resin, which he sent to his son Joseph with honey, balm, nuts, and frankincense (Gen. XLIII). The Ishmaelites who bought Joseph from the land of Israel were carrying these things to Egypt: resin, balm, honey, and oil, as well as frankincense from Gilead (Genesis 37). To better understand what wheat, balsam, honey, and oil, as well as resin, were used for in the market of Tyre, let us listen to the words of the Lord, who said: Do not give what is holy to the dogs; do not cast your pearls before swine (Matthew 7:6). And to the Canaanite woman who was praying for her daughter, saying: My daughter is cruelly tormented by a demon, the Lord replied: It is not right to take the children's bread and throw it to the dogs (Matthew 15:22, 26). But because it had gone out from the borders of Tyre and Sidon, and was approaching the land of Israel, that which she had requested was obtained.
