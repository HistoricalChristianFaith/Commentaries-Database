(Verse 23.) Therefore, the kingdom of heaven is likened to a king who wanted to settle accounts with his servants. It is customary for the Syrians and especially the Palestinians to connect all their speech with parables, so that what cannot be understood by the listeners through a simple commandment may be understood through similarity and examples. Therefore, he instructed Peter using the comparison of a king and master, and servants. The servant, who owed ten thousand talents, begged the master for forgiveness and obtained it; so he also should forgive his fellow servants for their lesser sins. That king and lord forgave the servant debtors ten thousand talents as easily as he did. How much more should servants forgive their fellow servants lesser debts? To make it more clear, let's say it with an example: If one of us commits adultery, murder, sacrilege, greater crimes worth ten thousand talents, they are forgiven when asked, so should we forgive lesser sins of others. But if we, because of an insult, remain unforgiving and perpetuate discord because of a bitter word, don't we seem to be rightly sent to prison? And using our own work as an example, shouldn't we act in such a way that we don't receive forgiveness for greater offenses?
