(Verse 10.) But while they were going to buy, the bridegroom came. Indeed, they give a wise counsel, that they should not meet the bridegroom without oil for their lamps: but because the time for buying had already passed, and on the day of judgement- being imminent- there was no place for repentance, as the Psalmist says: In hell, who will confess to you? (Psalm 6:6). They are not compelled to perform new deeds, but rather to give an account of their past actions.

And those who were invited came in with him to the wedding feast, and the door was shut. After the day of judgment, the opportunity for good works and justice will not be left (or abandoned).
