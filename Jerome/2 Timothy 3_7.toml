It is a good thing … to defer to one’s betters, to obey those set over one, to learn not only from the Scriptures but from the example of others how one ought to order one’s life, and not to follow that worst of teachers, one’s own self-confidence. Of women who are thus presumptuous the apostle says that they “are carried about with every wind of doctrine,” “ever learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.”
