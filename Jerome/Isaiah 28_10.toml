We read in the book of Job how, while the first messenger of evil was yet speaking, there came also another; and in the same book it is written, “Is there not a temptation”—or as the Hebrew better gives it—“a warfare to man upon earth?” It is for this end that we labor, it is for this end that we risk our lives in the warfare of this world, that we may be crowned in the world to come. That we should believe this to be true of people is nothing wonderful, for even the Lord was tempted, and of Abraham the Scripture bears witness that God tested him. It is for this reason also that the apostle says, “We glory in tribulations … knowing that tribulation works perseverance; and perseverance, character; and character, hope. Now hope does not disappoint.” And in another passage [we read], “Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation or distress or persecution or family or nakedness or peril or sword? As it is written, ‘for your sake we are killed all the day long; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.’ ” The prophet Isaiah comforts those in a similar case in these words: “You who are weaned from the milk, you who are drawn from the breasts, look for tribulation upon tribulation, but also for hope upon hope.” For, as the apostle puts it, “The sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us.” - "Letter 130.7"

“My conscience is at rest, and I know that it is not from any fault of mine that I am suffering; moreover affliction in this world is a ground for expecting a reward hereafter.” When the enemy was more than usually forward and ventured to reproach her to her face, she used to chant the words of the Psalter.… When she felt herself tempted, she dwelt upon the words of Deuteronomy.… In tribulations and afflictions she turned to the splendid language of Isaiah: “You that are weaned from the milk and drawn from the breasts, look for tribulation upon tribulation, for hope also upon hope. Yet a little while must these things be by reason of the malice of the lips and by reason of a spiteful tongue.” This passage of Scripture she explained for her own consolation as meaning that the weaned, that is, those who have come to full age, must endure tribulation upon tribulation that they may be accounted worthy to receive hope upon hope. - "Letter 108.18"
