(Verse 25.) If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by the Spirit. Let us use this testimony against those who do not want to understand the Scriptures spiritually. But who is the one who lives by the Spirit, if not our hidden self, who sometimes tends to live according to the flesh? But when he lives by the Spirit, he walks by the Spirit. When he desires to walk in the flesh, he is alive but dead. The perfect man in Christ always lives in the Spirit: he obeys the Spirit, he never lives in the flesh. And on the contrary: He who gives himself entirely to the flesh and devotes himself to passions never lives in the spirit. Among these there are those whom we cannot call spiritual or carnal; but those who fluctuate between virtues and vices, sometimes being drawn back to better things and being spiritual, sometimes being tripped up by the slippery slope of the flesh and being carnal.
