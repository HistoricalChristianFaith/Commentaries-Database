LXX: 'but I will sacrifice to you with the voice of praise and the action of thanksgiving. I will pay all that I have vowed to you, Lord, in salutation.' Those who keep their vanities have abandoned their mercy. But I who have been eaten for the sake of the safety of the multitude, will offer you sacrifices with the voice of praise and thanksgiving, offering myself. For "Christ, our Easter, has been sacrificed". A as a true Pope and lamb he offers himself for us. And I will give thanks to you, saying, "I bless you Father, lord of heaven and earth", and I will keep those vows to the Lord that I made for the safety of others, so that all that " you have given me never dies". We see what the Lord promised in his suffering for our safety: let us not make Jesus a liar, and let us be pure, delivered from all the uncleanness of sins so that he offers us to God the Father as the victims he had promised.
