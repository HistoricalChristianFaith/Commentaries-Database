"If the
snake bites because it has not been charmed, then there is no advantage to the
charmer's art. "The meaning of this is very apparent: the
serpent and the disparager are of the same ilk. 
For just as the hidden snake bites and injects its poison, so too the
other disparages in private, and he pours out the poison of his heart against
his brother, and there will be nothing between him and the serpent. For although the tongue of man was created
for benediction and encouragement of others, the disparager makes it equal to
that of the serpent, while he uses his virtues to bad purposes. Another meaning of this is, that if the
serpent devil should bite anyone secretly, and he doesn't know it, he infects
him with the poison of sin; and if he who has been struck keeps silent, and
does not repent, and does not want to confess his wound to his teacher and
brother, they who want to encourage him and see to it that he gets better, are
not able to be of any use to him. For if
an ill man is ashamed to confess his wound to a doctor, the doctor will not be
able to cure what he does not know exists.
