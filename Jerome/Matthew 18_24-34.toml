(Verse 24 onwards) And when he began to settle accounts, one was brought to him who owed ten thousand talents. But since he could not pay, his master ordered him to be sold, along with his wife and children and all that he had, and payment to be made. So the servant fell on his knees, imploring him, 'Have patience with me, and I will repay you everything.' And out of pity for him, the master of that servant released him and forgave him the debt. But when that same servant went out, he found one of his fellow servants who owed him a hundred denarii, and seizing him, he began to choke him, saying, 'Pay what you owe.' And his fellow servant falling down, besought him, saying: Have patience with me, and I will render thee all. And he would not: but went and cast him into prison, till he should pay the debt. Now his fellow servants seeing what was done, were very much grieved, and they came and told their lord all that was done. Then his lord called him; and said to him: Thou wicked servant, I forgave thee all the debt, because thou besoughtest me. Therefore, should you not also have had mercy on your fellow servant, just as I had mercy on you? And his master, being angry, delivered him to the torturers until he should pay back all the debt. I know certain individuals who owed ten thousand talents, interpreting the devil, whose wife and children they wanted to sell while he persisted in wickedness, to represent foolishness and evil thoughts. For just as the wife of the righteous is said to be wisdom, so the wife of the unjust and sinner is called foolishness. But how will the master forgive him ten thousand talents; and he did not forgive us, his servants, one hundred denarii, neither is it of Ecclesiastical interpretation, nor should it be accepted by prudent men.
