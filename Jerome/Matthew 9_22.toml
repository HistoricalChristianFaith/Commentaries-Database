This woman that had the flux came to the Lord not in the house, nor in the town, for she was excluded from them by the Law, but by the way as He walked; thus as He goes to heal one woman, another is cured.
He said not, Thy faith shall make thee whole, but, “hath made thee whole;” forin that thou hast believed, thou art already made whole.
