(Verse 3) Therefore, son of man, prepare for yourself the vessels of exile, and you shall go into exile during the day in their presence. You shall go from your place to another place in their sight, in case they might look upon it, for it is a rebellious house. LXX: And you, son of man, prepare for yourself the vessels of captivity, and you shall be held captive during the day in their presence. You shall be held captive from your place to another place in their sight, so that they may see that it is a rebellious house. There is no doubt that the entire extent of this place indicates the future captivity of King Zedekiah of the tribe of Judah, who was captured with Jerusalem. But since some desire to precede the captivity of Zedekiah, which is interpreted as the just Lord, as a type of the Savior who descends from the heavens to earth and assumes a human body, and these things are said to be vessels of captivity: therefore, I think it is necessary to warn the wise and cautious reader and to present these things, so that we may not seem to leave anything unmentioned, but not to prove them. For an impious king cannot surpass the example of piety shown by him who is the epitome of all piety. However, it is narrated in the history of Jeremiah the prophet and the Kings that Zedekiah was captured by the Babylonians and Chaldeans and was taken from place to place (Jeremiah 39 and 2 Kings 25), that is, from Jerusalem to Babylon, and other things that Ezekiel speaks of in the following passages. But those who refer to the Lord Jesus Christ believe that his captivity and migration from place to place signify his descent from heavenly to earthly realms.
