(Chapter 9, verses 1 and following) In the first time, the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali were relieved, and in the last time the way of the sea beyond the Jordan of the Galilee of the Gentiles was made heavy. The people who walked in darkness have seen a great light; those who dwelt in the land of the shadow of death, upon them a light has shone. LXX: Drink this first, quickly make it for the region of Zebulun, the land of Naphtali, and the rest of you who are near the sea beyond the Jordan of the Galilee of the Gentiles. The people who walked in darkness have seen a great light; those who dwelt in a land of deep darkness, on them has light shone. We have made two editions, because the testimony has been spread and used by the evangelist Matthew, so that either the diversity of interpretation or the similarity may be known. First, it should be noted that the evangelist Matthew placed this testimony not according to the Septuagint, but according to the Hebrews. For the Gospel narration says: When Jesus heard that John had been arrested, he withdrew to Galilee. He left Nazareth and went to live in Capernaum by the sea, in the region of Zebulun and Naphtali, to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah: 'Land of Zebulun and land of Naphtali, the Way of the Sea, beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles: the people dwelling in darkness have seen a great light, and for those dwelling in the region and shadow of death, upon them a light has dawned.' From that time Jesus began to preach and say: 'The kingdom of heaven is at hand' (Matt. 4:13 et seqq.). And John the Evangelist reports that Jesus, with his disciples, was invited to a wedding in Cana of Galilee, and there he performed his first sign by turning water into wine. This Jesus did, the beginning of his signs in Cana of Galilee, and he manifested his glory, and his disciples believed in him (John 2:11). And in the Septuagint it is said: Drink this first, do it quickly, for the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali will see the first miracles of Christ, so that they may be the first to drink the potion of faith, which they first saw the Lord performing signs. And, according to the Hebrew, it is said to have been relieved of the burden of sins in the first time: because in the regions of the two tribes, the Savior first preached the Gospel. Therefore, in the sixty-seventh Psalm it is said: Bless the Lord from the fountains of Israel. There Benjamin, the youngest (Psalm 67:27-28; Acts 9); Paul the Apostle, in the excess of his mind, who also elsewhere speaks: or when we are out of our minds, we are out of our minds for God (2 Corinthians 5:13): the princes of Zebulun, the princes of Naphtali, their leaders; because in these tribes there were villages, from which our Apostles believed their leaders. And they believed quickly according to Symmachus when they heard: Come, follow me, and I will make you fishers of men (Matthew 4:19), and immediately they left their father and the boat behind. But in the most recent times their faith was worsened by many Jews who remained in error. This sea is called the Sea of Galilee, which is formed by the flow of the Jordan River; on its shores are located Capernaum, Tiberias, Bethsaida, and Chorazin: in this particular region the Lord stayed the most, so that the people who were sitting or walking in darkness could see a great light, not small like the other prophets, but great like the one who speaks in the Gospel: I am the light of the world (John 8:12). And those who dwelt in the region of the shadow of death, a light has arisen for them. Between death and the shadow of death, I believe this refers to the death of those who have descended to the underworld with dead works: For the soul that sins shall die (Ezek. XVIII, 20); but the shadow of death belongs to those who sin, yet have not yet departed from this life: for they can, if they wish, repent. For Galilee of the Gentiles, Aquila understands the borders of the Gentiles, Symmachus interprets as the borders of the Gentiles; we understand "tumulos arenarum" to mean the hills of sand, which are either on the shores or on the banks. The Hebrews who believed in Christ explained this passage as follows. In the first place, during the time of Elia, two tribes, Zabulon and Nephthali, were captured by the Assyrians and taken to a hostile land; and Galilee became desolate (2 Kings 15), which the prophet now says has been restored, because it bore the sins of the people. But afterwards, not only two tribes, but also the remaining tribes, which lived beyond the Jordan and in Samaria, were taken into captivity (2 Kings 17 and 18). And this, they say, Scripture now declares, that the region whose people were first led into captivity and began to serve the Babylonians, and which previously was in the darkness of error, saw for the first time the light of Christ proclaiming, and from there the Gospel was sown into all nations. The Nazarenes, whose opinion I have presented above, attempt to explain this passage in the following way: When Christ came and his preaching shone forth, the first land to be freed from the errors of the Scribes and Pharisees was the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, and it shook off the heaviest yoke of Jewish traditions from its neck. Afterwards, through the Gospel of the Apostle Paul, who was the last of all the Apostles, the preaching became heavier, that is, multiplied: and the Gospel of Christ shone forth unto the ends of the earth and the way of the whole sea. Finally, the whole world, which had previously walked or sat in darkness and was held bound by idolatry and the chains of death, beheld the clear light of the Gospel.
