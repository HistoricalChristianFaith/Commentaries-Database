(Verse 20, 21.) Lift up your eyes and see those who come from the north: where is the flock that was given to you, your splendid flock? What will you say when they visit you? You have taught them and trained them against you, and it will come upon your own head. The inhabitants of Jerusalem are commanded to lift up their eyes and see the Chaldeans coming from the north: the city itself is questioned and asked: Where is the flock that was given to you, your splendid flock? Where is your people, whom you received from God? Where is that great and illustrious multitude, that you believed the entire province was gathered in one place? What will you say when the Lord visits you with His rod, and hands you over to the enemies of Babylon, whom you, against yourself, either on your own head, or from the very beginning, taught to flee to their help and follow their idols; who, under the pretense of friendship with you, learned by what route they should come to you. Let the Church heed this, that she herself may teach her adversaries how they can capture her in spiritual captivity and tear her flock apart with the cruelty of beasts.
