Christ himself is a virgin, and his mother is also a virgin; yes, though she is his mother, she is a virgin still. For Jesus has entered in through the closed doors, and in his sepulcher—a new one hewn out of the hardest rock—no man is laid either before him or after him. Mary is “a garden enclosed … a fountain sealed,” and from that fountain flows, according to Joel, the river that waters the torrent bed either of cords or of thorns. The cords [are] those of the sins by which we were beforetime bound, the thorns those which choked the seed the good man of the house had sown.
