(v. 23 seqq.) 'When you have completed cleansing it, you shall offer an unblemished calf from the herd and an unblemished ram from the flock. You shall present them before the Lord, and the priests shall sprinkle salt on them and offer them as a burnt offering to the Lord. For seven days you shall make atonement for the altar and consecrate it; then the altar shall be most holy, and whatever touches the altar shall become holy.' On the eighth day and beyond, the priests shall offer your burnt offerings and peace offerings on the altar, and I will be appeased with you, says the Lord God. LXX: And when you have completed the purgation, you shall offer a calf from the herd without blemish, and a ram from the flock without blemish, and you shall offer them before the Lord, and the priests shall sprinkle salt upon them; and they shall offer them as burnt offerings to the Lord. For seven days you shall make atonement with a goat for sin daily, and a calf from the herd, and a ram from the flock without blemish shall be offered for seven days. And they shall purify the altar, and cleanse it, and fill their hands, and accomplish the days. And from the eighth day and beyond, the priests shall offer your burnt offerings upon the altar, for your salvation. And I will receive you, says the Lord God. After the altar and its measurements were shown on the top of the mountain, and the purification and consecration of it were demonstrated to the prophets, through one unblemished calf and a male goat, or two young goats, the first of which we refer to the Lord and Savior, and the two that followed to the apostles and ministers, so that in the consecration of the spiritual altar and specifically  pertaining to the Church, it may not seem that the law and the prophets were excluded. Therefore, after the altar had been consecrated, an unblemished calf and a ram are taken and offered in the sight of the Lord; and the sons of Zadok, that is, the righteous priests, sprinkle salt upon their heads, so that both the law and the prophets may be seasoned with the taste of the Gospel. And there is no sacrifice (according to the command of the law and the interpretation of the Apostle, who says (Col. IV, 6): Let your speech be seasoned with salt) that is lacking in salt. Both, however, are offered as a burnt offering to the Lord, like the fat of the letter, which is signified in the Law, and the prophecy, like a cloud of fire of the Lord, that is, the Holy Spirit, of whom Paul says, fervent in spirit (Rom. XII, 11), are transformed into a spiritual and thin substance. We want to know more clearly what the calf of the unblemished herd is, and the ram with the purest fleece from the sheep, let us understand Moses and Elijah (Num. XII, III Reg. XIX); the former of whom was the gentlest among all men who dwelt on the earth; the latter was similar to Moses in fervor of faith. Hence he dared to say: I am left alone. But what is written in Hebrew as 'You shall offer a calf', in the Septuagint it is written as 'the priests shall offer', there is no question about it. And indeed Ezekiel himself, to whom these things are said, is from the number of priests, full of age and perfect; and the grace of prophecy increased the priestly rank in him. And Moses and Elijah appear on the mountain with the Lord, that is, the law and the prophets, who announced to him what he would suffer in Jerusalem. But after the altar is cleansed, for seven days a goat or a young goat is offered for sin daily, and a bull from the herd, and an unblemished ram from the flock, so that through these sacrifices the altar may be cleansed for seven days and made perfect. In seven days the Sabbath is observed, which according to the Apostle (Hebrews IV) is reserved for the people of God: in which we hope for eternal and true rest, and do no servile work of sin. However, in the goat, and the calf, and the ram, three general sins are demonstrated, to which all human beings are subject. For we sin either in thoughts, or in speech, or in action. Thoughts are referred to the ram, which is the first of all sins, and from which the other two sins arise. But the goat, or rather the male goat, is known for its eloquence or discourse, always engaging in higher-level discussions. However, it is specifically designated for agricultural work, being bound to the plow and toil and earthly labor. Therefore, we must offer these blameless things for the true Sabbath, which lasts for seven days, and cleanse the altar, so that our prayer may reach God in purity. The phrase that follows, 'And they shall cleanse it, and fill his hand,' as translated by both the Hebrew and other interpreters, signifies that the offerings for the expiation of the altar itself should also be fulfilled, just as offerings are made for the priests, the people, and the high priest, so that nothing may appear empty in the sight of the Lord. For what reason they set aside the Septuagint: both will clean it, and they will fill their hands, so that the priests may be heard, who when they are full of good works, for this reason their hands are full, after the Sabbath has passed, they may come to the eighth day of resurrection, and may say with the Apostle: We have risen with Christ (Rom. VI, Coloss. III); and beyond the eighth day, they may strive for heavenly things, and may offer burnt offerings for us, or those which are for the peace of our sins and our salvation: so that through the fire of the Holy Spirit, everything that we think, speak, and do, may be transformed into spiritual substance: and the Lord, pleased with such sacrifices, may be appeased towards us.
