Nothing can give us such trust in God and purity of conscience … as the Word, the truth, the wisdom and the righteousness received in Christ.… One who thinks in an orderly manner now has the Word and reason as the content of his faith. One who can comprehend wisdom has wisdom as the content of his faith. One who understands truth has truth as the content of his faith. One who lives righteously now has righteousness as the content of his faith.
