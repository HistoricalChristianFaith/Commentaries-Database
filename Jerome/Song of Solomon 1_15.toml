“Ah, you are beautiful, my beloved, ah, you are beautiful: your eyes are doves!” You who are beautiful and strong, because you resemble him of whom it is sung, “In your beauty and your splendor,” will hear from your spouse, “Forget your people and your father’s house. So shall the king desire your beauty.” - "Homilies on the Psalms, Alternate Series 61 (Psalm 15)"
