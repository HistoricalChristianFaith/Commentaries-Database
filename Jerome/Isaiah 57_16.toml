We certainly ought not to agree, after the Jewish custom, that God is enclosed in any place and dwells only in heaven. For God, by whom all things are held together, is present everywhere. Instead, we should understand correctly the meaning of heights and heavens and saints and virtues.…Because I strike in order to correct, therefore do I kill in order to bring to life. For I have mercy on my creatures, nor will I allow those whom I have established to perish eternally. And my Spirit that proceeds from me, or, according to the Hebrew of Aquila and Symmachus and Theodotion, that “encompasses all things” (for this is what the Greek words perieilēthēsetai and periballei signify), is the animator of all that exists. I also created the breath, or plural breaths (this is what “nasamoth” indicates), about which it is written elsewhere: “May every breath, or everything that breathes, praise the Lord.” … Some among us say that this is the Spirit8 whereby all the world is inspired and ruled.… But others understand it to be the Holy Spirit who was borne above the waters in the beginning and vivified everything, the Spirit who proceeds from the Father and, because of the union10 of natures, is sent by the Son, on account of which he said: “It is expedient for you that I go away, for unless I depart, the Paraclete will not come to you. If I go, however, I will send him to you.” … Let no one be scandalized, though, if the Spirit is said to proceed from the Father, for the Son also says this about himself: “I proceeded and came from the Father; I did not come on my own, but he sent me.”
