Thus does He ever mix the joyful and the grievous; if it grieves them that Heis to be put to death, they ought to be gladdened when they hear, “And shall rise again, the third day.”.
That they were thus made exceeding sorrowful, came not of their lack of faith; but out of their love of their Master they could not endure to hear of any hurtor indignity for Him.
