(Chapter 11, verses 1-3) The word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord saying: Hear the words of this covenant (or testament), and speak to the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and say to them: Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel. It is not indeed stated in the title under which time, or under which king, and in which year of his, this prophecy was made: but we understand that either this is to be connected with the previous prophecy and time, or certainly after some interval of time the word of the Lord was made to the Prophet in this message. However, it should be noted that the word Berith, in Aquila and Symmachus, is always translated as pact, while in the Septuagint and Theodotion it is translated as testament. Specifically, it now refers to Jerusalem and the men of the tribe of Judah.
