What does the psalm have to say of the Savior? “As the beloved Son of unicorns.” Our beloved Lord and Savior is the Son of the unicorns, the Son of the cross, of whom Habakkuk sings, “Rays shine forth from beside him, where his power is concealed.” After this beloved Son was crucified, then, was fulfilled the prophecy of the psalm: “The voice of the Lord strikes fiery flames.” For when Christ had been baptized and the entire universe had been purified in his cleansing, the fire of hell was extinguished.
