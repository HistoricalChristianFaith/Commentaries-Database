(Verse 11.) And opening their treasures, they offered him gifts, gold, frankincense, and myrrh. The presbyter Juvencus beautifully captures the significance of the gifts in one verse.

Thus, they bring gifts of gold, myrrh, and incense to the king, the people, and the God.

And having received an answer in a dream, they returned to their own country by another way, so as not to go back to Herod. Those who had presented gifts to the Lord subsequently received a response. However, the response (which is called χρηματισθέντες in Greek) was not made through an angel, but through the Lord Himself, in order to demonstrate the privilege of Joseph's merits. They returned by another way because they were not to mix with the unfaithfulness and treachery of the Jews.
