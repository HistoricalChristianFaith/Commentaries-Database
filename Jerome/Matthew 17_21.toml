This is what the Lord says in another place, “Whatsoever ye shall ask in my name believing, ye shall receive.” Therefore when we receive not, it is not the weakness of Him that gives, but the fault of them that ask.
Some think that the faith that is compared to a grain of mustard-seed is alittle faith, whereas the Apostle says, “If I shall have such faith that I could remove mountains.” The faith therefore which is compared toa grain of mustard-seed is a great faith.
Or; the mountain is not said of that which we see with the eyes of the body, but signified that spirit which was removed by the Lord out of the lunatic, whois said by the Prophet to be the corrupter of the whole earth
