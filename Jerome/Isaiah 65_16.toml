For “abundance,” which is sabaa in Hebrew, others translate “oath.” But the word has many meanings, which vary in accordance with where the accent is placed, for it can be understood as “oath” or “abundance” or “sufficiency” or “plurality” or “seven,” concerning which we already indicated that in the book of Genesis, as well as in the current book, seven women take one man. Again, for that which the Septuagint translates as “true” and the Hebrew as “amen,” Aquila renders pepistōmenōs, that is, “faithfully.” But this is what it says: “Your name will be a curse for the benefit of my chosen who will follow in your place, that they may have you as an example of evil consequences and may detest enduring such things, and, therefore, swear this oath: ‘I will not suffer what the Jewish people suffered.’ ” Or, perhaps your name will be “abundant,” in as much as it will be spoken so frequently that the memory or mention of it will become odious to them and engorge them on it, such that they will grow nauseated.…And there will be blessing, insofar as whoever is called by that name will be blessed by the Lord and will receive a sign of true circumcision: “amen,” which the Lord often uses to indicate approval in the Gospel: “Amen, amen, I say to you.” But neither this new name nor another name is anything unless derived from the name of Christ, so that the people of God would never be called Jacob, Judas, Israel, Ephraim or Joseph, but “Christian.” For “whoever swears in the land” does so not by idols or by false gods but by God, as is confirmed by the “amen” at the end of the sentence. Furthermore, the Septuagint translates “true God” in place of “amen,” so that the true God may be blessed and that those “who swear in the land” would swear by the true God. But we do not follow the error of the Arians in referring this “true God” to the person of God the Father alone, of whom it is written, “that they may know you the one true God and Jesus Christ whom you have sent.” But we refer also to the Son, who is himself the true God, as John the Evangelist testifies: “The Son of God came to give us understanding, that we would know the true one and exist in his true Son, Jesus Christ. This is the true God and eternal life.”
