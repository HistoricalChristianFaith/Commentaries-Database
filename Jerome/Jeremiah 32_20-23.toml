(Vers. 20 seqq.) You have set signs and wonders in the land of Egypt until this day, both in Israel and among mankind (or among earthlings), and have made a name for yourself, as it is this day. You brought your people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs and wonders, with a strong hand and an outstretched arm, and with great terror. And you gave them this land, which you swore to their fathers to give them, a land flowing with milk and honey. And they entered and took possession of it, but they did not obey your voice and did not walk in your law. Everything that you commanded them to do, they did not do, and all these disasters happened to them. From a general overview, it then focuses on what specifically Israel has accomplished. It says, 'You have set signs and wonders in the land of Egypt, which have afflicted Egypt until this day, and in Israel and among mankind, whether native-born or foreign.' This that is said, up to this day, must be connected to what follows, so that we may read and understand that your signs are fulfilled both in Israel and in all mortals daily. Alternatively, you not only performed signs and wonders in Egypt, but your power of mercy has also saved your people even until today, and you assist the whole human race as the Creator with your power. And it should be noted that Israel is separated from men and earthborn beings, as it is written: 'My firstborn son is Israel.' And you have made for yourself a name as it is to this day (Exodus IV, 22). Your praises, he says, are celebrated in the language of the whole world. And you have brought your people Israel out of the land of Egypt. It is well said, your people, for at that time when they were brought out, they served under the Lord's command. And you brought them out with signs and wonders, by which Egypt was struck, and with a strong hand, and with an outstretched arm, and with great terror: when the Red Sea provided a way for the people of Israel to cross over, and it obliterated the Egyptian army: And you have given them this land, which you swore to their fathers to give to them: namely, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Therefore, not by their own merit, but by the virtues of their fathers, they received the land flowing with milk and honey. For they were not yet able to consume solid food, but were nourished with milk and honey in their infancy. Indeed, with the abundance and plenty of all things, milk and honey. And they entered and possessed it. And immediately there was no middle ground between possession and disobedience. For abundance produces security, security produces negligence, negligence produces contempt. And they did not obey, he says, your voice, and they did not walk in your law. Therefore, they promised in vain in the wilderness, saying: We will do everything that the Lord has commanded (Exodus 19:8). For the reward is not in the promise, but in the action: to refute the impudence of those who think that a man can fulfill everything that he has promised. They did not do everything that you commanded them to do, and they certainly promised to do so. And all these evils happened to them. Evils for those who are patient, but according to the judgement of the Lord, good things that give to each person according to their ways.
