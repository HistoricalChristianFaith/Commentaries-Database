"Remember now your Creator in the days of
your youth, while the evil days come not, nor the years draw nigh, when you
shall say, I have no pleasure in them; "In this chapter there were many explanations
of all things and almost as many opinions as men themselves. It would take too long however to recount all
the opinions of everyone and their arguments in which they want to prove their
opinions, the matter would require a volume to itself. But it is enough for wise men to have shown
what they feel, and like in a small picture, to have depicted the thirst of the
earth, the waste of the whole earth, and the belt of the ocean, and to have
shown them in such a small collection. 
The Hebrews believe the imperative here refers to Israel, to whom it is
taught that she should enjoy her riches, and before the time of bondage comes
should change youth to old-age. She should enjoy whatever is pleasant or fun,
just as it seems to the heart so it seems to the eyes; at that time while she
still has them to hand. She knows
however that she will be judged in all things that she has done. And just as from bad thoughts she flees from
desires, knowing that foolishness is joined to youth, and will remember always
her Creator, and before the days of Babylonian and Roman captivity come, in
which she will no longer be free. And
all of this passage from the point which says, "before the sun, moon, and
stars become dark" [Eccl. 12, 2.],
until the place where the Scripture reminds us, "and dust will be swirled
on earth just as it used to be and the soul returned to God who gave it" [Eccl. 12, 7.],
they explain their condition. And since
as I have said above these things are tiresome and favourable, they should be
touched by us but briefly and superficially. 
Therefore enjoy your youth O Israel, and do this or that, that has
already been mentioned before your time of bondage comes; and your glory will
leave you and pride, and judges, and your holy men who want to be interpreted
as the sun, moon, and stars, and are taken away. Before Nebuchadnezzar comes, or Titus,
Vespasian's son, before the call of the prophets and their prophecies are
fulfilled. In that day when the angels
that protect the temple leave, and the strongest men in your army are thrown in
confusion, and the speeches of the judges will be slow to come, and the
prophets, who are accustomed to receiving the light of their visions from
heaven, they all will become dark. When
the doors of the temple are closed Jerusalem will be made humble and the
Chaldeans will come as if by the song of a bird, called thus in the words of
Jeremiah, and the singing girls with the lute in the temple choir will become
silent [Cfr Ier. 9.]. At that time, when they will come to
Jerusalem, the enemies too will fear the greatness of God, and in the way of
doubt, they will fear the death of Sennacherib. 
For they also believe the saying, "and from up high they will fear
and tremble in the road" [Cfr Is. 37.]. In those days "the almond tree will
flourish", that stick and staff which Jeremiah saw in his prophecy in the
beginning, "and the grasshopper will be a burden" [Cfr Ier. 1, 11.]. Nebuchadnezzar with his army, "and
desire shall fail ", the friendship between Israel and God. But what desire wants for itself, although we
have begun to speak about them individually will be explained more fully. But all this will happen to Israel, because
man will go out into the house of his eternity, and having returned from the
protection of God to the heavens, going to his tabernacle, the weeping and
crying will wander in the street and will be hemmed in by the enemy's
siege. Be happy therefore Israel in your
youth, before the silver cord is broken, (this is until your glory is with
you), before the golden ribbon breaks off, (that is before the arc of the
tabernacle is taken away); before the pitcher is worn away to the fountain, and
the wheel is turned around over the pool. 
That is until you read the most sacred teachings, for the spirit of a
holy man is grace, and before you return to Babylon, from whence you left the
loins of Abraham, and you will begin to be worn away in Mesopotamia, which once
breathed life into you, and all is returned to He who gave it. The Jews have always taught these things and
have understood this chapter to pertain to themselves. But I prefer to return to the previous argument,
and try to explain each thing individually: "rejoice O youth, in your
adolescence, and let your heart be good in the days of your youth, and walk in
the way of your heart and in the sight of your eyes; and know above all these
things, since God will lead you into judgement". He has said that the light of this world is
the sweetest and that man ought to rejoice in the days of his life, and grasp
desire with all enthusiasm. For the
eternal night of death will fall when it's not permitted to enjoy ones amassed
wealth and like a shadow, all things that we possess, will die. Now therefore he encourages man and says,
"O youth, before old-age and death fall upon you, enjoy your youth, and
whatever you feel is good, and seems joyful to see, take it and enjoy as it
please you the things of this world." 
Again so that he does not think these things say to provoke men to
indulgence, and thus fall into the doctrines of Epicurus, he takes this
suspicion, saying, "and know, since above all these God will lead you to
judgement". Thus, he says, take
advantage of the things of the world, so that you know you will be judged in
the end. "And force anger from your
heart and take wickedness from your flesh, since youth and foolishness are
vanity". In anger he sees all the
problems of the spirit. In the
wickedness of the flesh he sees every desire of the body. In this way therefore, he says, enjoy the
goodness of this world, lest you leave pleasure or flesh. Leave off your former vices, which you did in
your youth of vanity and foolishness, since youth is joined to
foolishness. "And remember in the
day of your youth Him, who created you, before the days of wickedness come and
the years approach, in which you will say, 'I have no will'". Always remember your Creator and walk the
route of your youth, so that you remember your end is death, before your time
comes, in which sad things will happen.
