(Vers. 3, 4.) Behold, I will cast the branch to you, and I will scatter the refuse of your solemnities upon your faces, and it shall take you away with it. And you shall know that I have sent this commandment to you, that my covenant might be with Levi, says the Lord of hosts. LXX: Behold, I will separate for you the shoulder, and I will scatter the belly upon your faces, the belly of your solemnities, and I will take you together: and you shall know that I have sent this commandment to you, that my testament may be with the Levites, says the Lord Almighty. Because he speaks to the priests, he says: I will cast in your faces those things which you consider holier in the Law, and which have been forgiven to you by God as a gift of virtues from sacrifices: The arm, which the Seventy translated as shoulder, that is, the right arm of the animal. And I will scatter, he says, the dung, that is, the abdomen; or according to the Hebrews, excrement, that is, Phares, metaphorically using the term to refer to what contains, calling that which is contained, for the priests received both the arm and the chest, as well as the tongue and the abdomen, and those things which are described in Leviticus (Lev. VII and IX) from sacrifices. He testifies that all these things are cast away for their sins, and that they are sent upon the faces of the priests (Num. 18; Deut. 18), so that those who offer may be such as those things that are offered. And He says that He will take you with Him, that is, the dung of your solemnities, so that the filthy faces may be defiled by the mixture of foul dung, and from that which I cast away from you, you may understand that I am He who once chose your father Levi, and through Levi Aaron, and granted you the glory of the priesthood, so that it might be My covenant or testament with Levi, and he might minister to Me in an eternal priesthood. Note that 'Brit' in Hebrew is translated as 'pact' or 'covenant' by Aquila, 'testament' by the LXX, and in many places in Scripture, 'testament' does not mean the will of the deceased, but a covenant of the living. God desired that all people, especially priests, not have any blemish and adorn their shoulder or arm with good works. A good conscience is signified by the heart, holy confession by the tongue, so that what we believe in our hearts for righteousness, we confess with our mouths for salvation (Romans 10). In the stomach, there is nothing deadly; but rather that which sustains and nourishes our life: for if food is not digested in the stomach and its juice irrigates the body, it becomes weak and leads to death. However, we turn everything the opposite way, so that the Lord may reject us or separate our works from the works of the saints, and it is prescribed for us to anoint our heads (Matt. VI) and to wash our faces from the filth of sins while fasting, and to contemplate the glory of the Lord with unveiled face (III Cor. III). Now we say: Confusion covers my face (Ps. XLIII, 16) and like Cain, our face falls (Gen. IV), and we cannot fulfill what is commanded: Lift up your eyes and see (Jer. XIII, 20); but we have faces covered with the filth of vices and we say: My wounds have putrefied and have become corrupt, because of my foolishness (Ps. XXXVII, 6). Wherefore all these things are turned into dung, as the Scripture saith: And he shall take you with him as dung, even the faces of our sacrifices which ought to have come full and clean to the solemnities of God, and to eat the flesh of the lamb shod with shoes (Exod. XII), or after seven weeks, to offer the fruits of our works to God (Lev. XXIII), or to live passing through in the tabernacles of this world, and to say: I am a stranger and a pilgrim, as were all my fathers (Ps. XXXVIII). And because for this reason we translate: He will take you with himself to the dung, the Septuagint translated it as: I will take you together, intelligence is added, that after the priests have been covered with disgrace and ignominy, and have recognized their sin and repented, then they shall be taken by the Lord, and it is fitting for this meaning what follows: And you shall know that I have sent this commandment to you. But the interpretation that seems true to me is superior, lest between the words of threat, he may have inserted words of flattery, especially since even the things that follow sound like God's indignation.
