(Verse 13) And so the Son of Man will suffer at their hands. Then the disciples understood that he was speaking to them about John the Baptist. Now, as Herod and Herodias are said to have killed John, how can they also say that they crucified Jesus, when we read that he was killed by the scribes and Pharisees? The answer is that both the Pharisees were in agreement with the death of John, and Herod willingly participated in the killing of the Lord. He sent him, mocked and despised, to Pilate to be crucified.
