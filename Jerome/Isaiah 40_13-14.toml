Symmachus translated, “Who has prepared the Spirit of the Lord and who has shown to him the man of his counsel? With whom has he entered into counsel and has given him understanding and has taught him the path of justice and instructed him in knowledge and has shown the way of wisdom to him?” In this translation it appears more clearly that the one whom the Spirit prepared or founded is he about whom the apostle says, “The Lord is the Spirit” and “On him the Spirit rested, the Spirit of wisdom and understanding.” And further on, “The Spirit of the Lord is on me, wherefore he has anointed me.” For the same Spirit of the Lord is “the man of his counsel,” in whom “dwelled all richness of divinity in bodily manner.” With that one he entered into counsel about whom we said above, “wonderful counselor,” and in Proverbs it is written, “God founded the earth with wisdom; he prepared the heavens with foresight.” Moreover, the Septuagint said, “Who has known the mind of the Lord and who has been his counselor,” meaning it to be understood that the mind and reason and sense of God through which all things were made and without whom nothing was made is he about whom it is sung in the Psalms, “The heavens were prepared by the Word of the Lord, and all their power by the Spirit of his mouth.”
