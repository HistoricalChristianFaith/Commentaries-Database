“The seed sown among the thorns is the person who listens to the word, but the anxiety of the world and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word, and it is made fruitless.” This reminds us of the words spoken to Adam: “You shall eat your bread among thorns and thistles.” This mystically signifies that those who give themselves over to the pleasures and cares of this world eat the heavenly bread and true food among thorns. Hence the Lord fittingly added, “The deceitfulness of riches chokes the word.” Riches are enticing indeed, promising one thing and doing another. The possession of riches is uncertain. They are borne from place to place. Unpredictably they either desert the haves or gorge the have-nots. The Lord also states that it is difficult for the rich to enter the kingdom of heaven, for riches choke the word of God and weaken the force of the virtues.

(Verse 22) But he who was sown among thorns, this is the one who hears the word, and the anxiety of this world and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful. It seems to me that even that which is said literally to Adam, 'Among thorns and thistles you shall eat bread' (Gen. III, 18), signifies mystically that whoever devotes themselves to the pleasures and concerns of this world, shall eat heavenly bread and true food among thorns. And he elegantly added: the fallacy of wealth suffocates the word. For wealth is beguiling, promising one thing and doing another. Its possession is slippery, as it is carried here and there, and those who have it, either with an unsteady step, abandon it, or those who do not have it, seek to obtain it. Hence, the Lord declares it difficult for the rich to enter the kingdom of heaven, as wealth suffocates the word of God and softens the rigor of virtues.
