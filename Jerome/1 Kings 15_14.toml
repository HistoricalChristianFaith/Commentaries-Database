Regarding many kings of the line of David, we read that they were saved not through their own merit but through the virtues of their father, David, who did that which was pleasing in the sight of God. And we come to Asa, the king of Judah, of whom it is written: “Asa did that which was right in the sight of the Lord, as did David, his father.” And after a lengthy account of his many virtues, the story is concluded with these words: “But the high places he did not take away. Nevertheless, the heart of Asa was perfect with God all the days of his life.” You see that he, too, is referred to as just, and his heart, indeed, was perfect with God, and yet he erred in that he did not take away the high places, as, we read, Hezekiah and Josiah had done.
