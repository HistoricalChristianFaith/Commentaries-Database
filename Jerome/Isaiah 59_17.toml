He is referring here, without doubt, to those Jews who continued in their blasphemies and to the change effected by their enemies when the Roman army surrounded them. By their victory, the Lord is shown to have done the fighting. Indeed, this testimony was used by Paul in his letter to the Ephesians, urging us to be clothed in the armor of Christ whereby we would be enabled to repel the flaming arrows of the devil. … The author of this blessing4 is he who will come “like a rushing river that the Spirit of the Lord drives,” or, as Aquila translates it, “like a narrow river that is a sign of the Spirit of the Lord,” or, as Theodotion has it, “like a warring river that the Spirit of the Lord has inscribed.” Of that testimony, therefore, that the Septuagint translates as “like a violent river, the wrath of the Lord will come with fury,” the last portion is not included in the Hebrew. For wrath and fury are not to be placed into the promises of God, since in the other promises that follow, blessing belongs to the future and warnings and punishments to sinners. But according to Aquila and Theodotion, it is in Christ that the Spirit of the Lord is signified, confirming what was first read in John the Evangelist: “for God the Father has set his seal on the Son of man.”
