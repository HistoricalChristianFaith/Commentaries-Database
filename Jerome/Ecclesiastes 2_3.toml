"I
thought to stimulate my body with wine while my heart is involved with wisdom,
and to grasp folly, until I can discern which is best for mankind to do under
the heavens during the brief span of their lives. " I wanted to
stimulate my life with enjoyment, and to lull my body, as if freed from all
worries by wine, in the same way with desire; but my deep consideration and
inborn reasoning, which God the creator mingled even into my sins, drew me away
from the idea and led me back to seek wisdom and to spurn foolishness, so that
I was able to see what was good, that men can do in the span of their
lives. But he has compared desire
eloquently with intoxication. Since he
intoxicates and destroys the vitality of his spirit, which he was able to
change into wisdom and obtains spiritual happiness, (as it is written in
certain manuscripts), he is able to discern which things ought to be sought out
in this life, and which avoided.
