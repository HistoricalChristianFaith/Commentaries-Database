(Verse 5 and following) And behold, there was a wall surrounding the house on all sides, and in the hand of the man was a measuring reed of six cubits and a handbreadth, and he measured the width of the building with the reed, one reed wide, and the height with the reed, one reed high. And he came to the gate that faced the eastern road, and he went up its steps, and he measured the threshold of the gate with the reed, one reed wide, that is, one reed wide, and the vestibule one reed long, and one reed wide, and between the vestibules five cubits, and the threshold of the gate next to the entrance of the gate inside, one reed wide. And the vestibule of the gate was eight cubits, and the front of it two cubits: but the gate itself was inward. And the chambers of the gate towards the east, three on this side, and three on that side; they measured one against another: and the fronts of the gate on both sides were of one measure. And he measured the length of the porch of the gate, ten cubits: and the breadth of the gate, thirteen cubits. And there was also a space before the chambers, one cubit on this side, and one cubit on that side: and the chambers six cubits on this side, and six cubits on that side. And he measured the gate from the roof of the chamber to its roof, a width of twenty-five cubits, door against door. Seventy: And behold, a wall on the outside of the house all around, and in the man's hand a measuring reed of six cubits and a handbreadth. So he measured the thickness of the wall, one reed; and the height, one reed. Then he went inside the gateway which faced toward the east, went up its stairs and measured the threshold of the gateway, which was one reed wide, and the other threshold was one reed wide. Each gate chamber was one reed long and one reed wide; between the gate chambers were five cubits. The threshold of the gateway by the vestibule of the inside gate was one reed. And three equal in width for the stem, and equal in length for the stem, and one gate next to the gate of eight cubits, and one of two cubits, and one gate on the inside, and three gates on each side, and one measurement: one measurement for the gate on both sides. The width of the entrance of the gate was ten cubits, and the width of the gate was thirteen cubits, and one cubit was equivalent to the sight of one finger, and the end of one cubit on both sides, and three cubits here, and three cubits there. And the gate was measured from wall to wall, a width of twenty-five cubits. This gate is opposite the gate.» When I was a boy in Rome, and was being educated in the liberal arts, I used to go with others of the same age and purpose, on Sundays, to visit the tombs of the apostles and martyrs; and I would often enter the crypts, which are dug deep in the earth, and on both sides of those who enter, the bodies of the buried are held in the walls, and everything is so dark that almost the prophetic saying is fulfilled: 'Let the living descend into hell' (Psalm 55:16): and rarely is light admitted from above to temper the horror of the darkness, so that you would think it is not a window, but a hole of light descending: and again, one approaches slowly, and in the blind night that Virgilian phrase is set forth (Aeneid, Book II):

Everywhere horror seizes the souls, and the very silence terrifies. Let this statement be for me, so that the wise reader may understand the sentiment I have concerning the explanation of the temple of God in Ezekiel, about which it is written: Clouds and darkness are under His feet (Ps. 96:2). And again: Darkness is His hiding place (Ps. 18:12): Hence Moses also entered into a cloud and darkness, so that he could contemplate the mysteries of the Lord, which the people, being far away and remaining below, could not see (Exod. 24 and 34). After forty days, the common people were unable to see the face of Moses because it was glorified, or as it is written in Hebrew, Moses had horns on his face. Similarly, while reading the description of the mystical temple (which the Jews believe should be built literally upon the coming of their own Christ, whom we believe to be the Antichrist, but we refer to the Church of Christ, which we see being built daily in his saints), whenever the eye of the heart opens, it happens to me that I think I see and possess the bridegroom and joyfully say: 'I have found him whom my soul loves; I will hold him, and not let him go.' (Song of Solomon 3:4). Then again, the divine word deserts me, the bridegroom flees from my hands, and my eyes are blinded by darkness, so that I am compelled to say: 'O the depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of God!' How inscrutable are His judgments, and His ways past finding out! (Rom. 11:33) And what is written elsewhere: The judgments of the Lord are a great abyss. (Ps. 36:7) And: Out of the depths I have cried to You, O Lord; Lord, hear my voice. (Ps. 129:1) And that of Elisha, who followed with his eyes his master being taken up, saying: My father, my father, the chariot of Israel and its horsemen! (2 Kings 2:12) Therefore, it must be simply confessed that the temple of the blessed Ezekiel, which all ages have been silent about, I do not wish to discuss rashly, but to demonstrate the conjecture of my mind to the readers with faith and fear of God; so that if I should offer in the tabernacle of God the skins of goats and hairs, by which the thorns and thistles of sins may be protected, and rains and storms may be kept out: let another, who is rich, according to the quality of his merits, offer iron, or bronze, or silver, and gold and precious stones, and not despise our offerings, because they are lesser, but rejoice in his own wealth. For if the lower parts are not present, the upper parts cannot exist. And in order for the greater things to be praised, they increase in comparison to the smaller things. Let us therefore see what Ezekiel, upon entering the building of the city facing south, first saw and then heard: 'And behold,' he says, 'there was a wall on the outside surrounding the house on all sides.' Regarding the wall, which Aquila and Theodotion interpreted as 'περίβολον', Symmachus and the Seventy translated it as 'περίβολος'. Therefore, the wall, or 'περίβολος', surrounded the house, that is, the temple of the Lord on all sides, and it had a man whose appearance was like the appearance of bronze, who not only held a geometric string and a mason's trowel, but also held a measuring rod in his hand, the measurement of which is not explicitly stated, but is now given as six cubits and a palm, which is more accurately called 'παλαιστή' in Greek and is the sixth part of a cubit. Moreover, the word 'spithamen' is used to mean 'palm,' as some use 'palm' to distinguish it. Furthermore, they are accustomed to call a wrestler a 'palm'. Therefore, with a measuring rod, he measured the width and height of the wall, and both, that is, the width and height, were six cubits and one palm. And since there were many gates, he did not want to enter through the other gates, but through the one that faced the eastern region. And because the place was not level, and the wall went around, and the house of God itself was built on higher ground, therefore he entered, or rather, ascended through steps. These are referred to as 'LXX seven' alone, when in Hebrew and in other translations we read only the word 'steps' without a number. Having entered the gate, he immediately measured the threshold of the gate, which the Greeks call LXX θεὸς: for which it is written in Hebrew Seph. And I think the diligent and studious reader should be reminded: if, however, he is led by the knowledge of the Scriptures and not by the empty declamations of orators, so that he knows nearly all the Hebrew words and names, which have been greatly corrupted by age in the Greek and Latin translations, distorted by the fault of the scribes, and while they are written about in their uncorrected form, made even more uncorrected, having turned into Sarmatian instead of Hebrew, nay of no nation at all, since they have ceased to be Hebrew and have not yet begun to be foreign. The LXX also translated the word aelam (αἰλὰμ) as itself, which Symmachus interpreted as anteliminare in the following passages. There were two bedchambers, or cubicles, and παραστάδαs which were five cubits long, and another threshold of the gate next to the vestibule on the inside with a single reed. The third vestibule of the gate also had eight cubits, and in front of it, or on its borders, two cubits. In order to prevent anyone from confusing this vestibule with the previous one, he added: This vestibule is the inner vestibule of the gate, for which the LXX translated first, second, and third vestibule. But the chambers, that is, the bedrooms, which were built after the Eastern gate in the vestibules, faced the Eastern road. And so that we may know how many chambers there were, it is joined, three on this side and three on that: namely, facing North and South, and facing the Eastern road: and the measurements of the fronts were the same on both sides. Also, the measurement of the width of the gate threshold was taken, and it was found to be ten cubits, and in length thirteen cubits, and the ends of the chambers were narrowed down to one cubit, or as Symmachus translated, "παραστάδων", and each front had one cubit. But the chambers, or παραστάδες, and as the LXX have rendered it θεηλὰθ, had on each side six cubits. And he measured the door of the chamber, or παραστάδος, from the roof of the one chamber to the roof of the other, and it was twenty-five cubits wide. So there was only space from the door to the door, or from the gate to the gate. This we have briefly spoken to suggest more the divine presence than to explain, desiring to outline the picture according to the obscure and almost unseen letter. Furthermore, we will set down a few things that we can suspect narrowly and with doubts. The Apostle Paul, desiring the Ephesians to understand more sacred things, prays that they may be filled with the wisdom and love of the Lord, so that rooted and founded, they may be able to know and comprehend the breadth, and length, and depth, and height, and the profound riches of Him. And he speaks to them: Therefore, you are by no means strangers but fellow citizens of the saints and domestics of God, built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, with Jesus Christ Himself as the cornerstone, in whom the whole structure grows together to form a holy temple in the Lord. In Him, you also are built together to be a dwelling place of God in the Holy Spirit. Peter the Apostle also speaks in almost the same words, because of the same spirit, in his Epistle: For if you have believed that the Lord is good, approaching him as to a living stone, rejected indeed by men but chosen, and honorable before God, and be yourselves built up as living stones into a spiritual house, a holy priesthood, offering up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ (1 Peter 2, 3-5). From this it is clear that the Lord and Savior, who is the true architect, tests the stones that can be placed in the foundations of the temple, both in the middle and in the higher places, and whether they are of a less solid strength in the wall and whether they can be placed outside the temple in the circuit of the enclosure. For it is not of little strength or of minimal firmness to support the stones placed on top. Hence the Apostle writes to the believers: Bear one another's burdens (Galatians 6:2). And in another place it is written: we should not take on a burden that we cannot bear. But the reed of measurement, which had six cubits and one palm, signifies our conversation with God, which is contained in the six days in which the world was made, and signifies the reason for each work, so that one thing belongs to the work, another to the mind. Hence, the width is equal to the height: the width refers to the works, as we said; the height refers to the soul, which hastens to lofty things. But let it suffice to have warned once: to know me by name, and to be called by a neutral gender, but for the sake of simplicity and ease of understanding, and the common usage, to use the masculine gender. For our concern is not to avoid grammatical errors, but to explain the obscurity of the Holy Scripture with whatever words. Therefore, a man enters, whose name is East, through the Eastern gate, to enlighten those whom he finds in the first part of the entrance hall, whether in the entrance itself: not through one, but through several steps, whose number is kept silent, so that the difficulty of ascent may be apparent, and for whatever number of steps you propose, you may know that it is less than the doubt that is left behind. I consider this to be the gate, of which it is sung in the Psalms: This is the gate of the Lord, the righteous shall enter through it (Ps. 118:20). And the threshold of the gate is measured, so that we may know that all the knowledge of God is open. This threshold is said to be one reed in width, and it is silent about height and length. For it is both the way and the entrance, and through it one must proceed to the inner parts (although in this place the Septuagint unnecessarily speaks of length, or, as is contained in most manuscripts, height); but the chambers, that is, the bedrooms and alcoves, have individual reeds in both length and width, but there are five cubits between each chamber, so that the inner chambers have the full measure of a reed, that is, six cubits and one palm, as the works and calculations agree. Those things which are external, that is, between chamber and chamber, are five cubits; for the secrets of Christ have not yet been penetrated, and they cannot say: The king has brought me into his chamber (Song of Songs 1:3). And elsewhere: All the glory of the king's daughter is within (Psalm 44:14). But while the disciples were staying at home with Christ, they could not hear his mysteries, and they desired to go outside to hear the word of God; and therefore a measurement of five cubits is placed in them, so that they may be taught to refer everything to the five senses. The threshold of the other gate, as it is contained in the Septuagint, of the second vestibule and third, is of the same size as one reed. After this vestibule, that is, the threshold of the gate, eight cubits are placed at the entrance, so that the inner parts of the vestibule do not hold a number of seven, but of eight, which pertain to the sacrament of the resurrection and the Lord's Day. And in front, he says, of the same vestibule, there were two cubits, which pertain either to both Testaments, or to the letter and the spirit, or to the mystery of the pair of tongs, which is included in Isaiah about the altar of coal, and is brought to cleanse the lips of the prophet. And so that we may know what this vestibule is, which is terminated by eight and two cubits, he explains it more clearly: The vestibule of the gate was inside, through which we came to the temple of God. There were also chambers and rooms which were on the way to the eastern gate, for which the Septuagint write 'Elau', there were three on one side and three on the other, each measuring one, that is, a reed which had six cubits and one palm, as mentioned above: And one reed for length, and one reed for width, and between the chambers five cubits. Therefore, we should not think that there are only two bedchambers, but rather six on each side, to indicate the number six, which is also shown in the water pots of the Gospel (John 2), in which water was turned into wine, and the Jewish water is daily turned into wine, which gladdens the heart of man, and becomes sweeter with the blood of Christ. He also measured the width of the threshold of the ten-cubit gate, which is a perfect number and is contained either in the Decalogue or in the sacraments of the four Gospels. Whoever begins with one, reaches four in such a way as to fill the number ten. Its length was thirteen cubits: for which the width is again placed at seventy, which seems to me to have been corrupted by the carelessness of scribes. For the Scripture would not have said the width in one place and again the width of ten or thirteen cubits. However, it can be understood as the gate of the threshold, in which the number of the Old and New Testament is consecrated, or the Lord himself, who says: I am the gate (John 10:9); or certainly all the saints through whom we enter into the knowledge of God, to whom the Apostle Paul spoke: My mouth is open to you, Corinthians; and: Enlarge yourselves also (2 Corinthians 6:11). But thirteen cubits after the number eighteen, they contain the sacrament of the books of Moses, which are also shown in the five loaves (Matthew 14), and in the Samaritan woman of the Gospel (John 4), who is accused of having had five husbands, and the sixth one she thought she had, she did not have: and yet the number eight, and the number five, is completed by one cubit, that is, the fourteenth ((or thirteenth)): because in Christ all things are recapitulated. It is said: 'And one cubit at each end: for the old and new Testaments together make up one measurement of Christ, and one cubit contains the height of the ark of Noah, which is thirty cubits. However, the rooms, as the Septuagint has it, either as 'thau' or 'thee', changing and altering the names in each place as they wished, were six cubits on either side, which is called 'here and there', and they did not have a span or additional measure placed on top, which would have signified the present life leading to future blessedness, but only six cubits.' And it is measured from the roof of the chamber to the roof or wall of it, and it is found to be twenty-five cubits in width; which number, though multiplied four times, still relates to sense. For if you arrange five cubits against it five times, you will produce the number twenty-five, which is between the roof of the chambers and the roof; and yet both, when placed opposite each other, have a doorway facing the doorway. Let these things not seem frivolous to the reader, although they may displease even myself who speak, feeling like I am knocking on a closed door; but they are to be read with permission: otherwise, I could simply confess my ignorance and remove every desire of the students. For just as we are far from perfect knowledge, we consider a minor fault at least somewhat lighter than saying absolutely nothing.
