"So I
praised enjoyment, for man has no other aim under the sun but to eat, drink,
and be joyful; and this will accompany him in his toil during the days of his
life which God has given him beneath the sun. 
"I have interpreted
this more fully above, and now I shall just speak cursorily. He is allowed to prefer to eat and drink,
which is the enjoyment (and must be short and end quickly) in the dire-straits
of his life, and in light of those things, which are seen to happen unfairly in
the world, (since man seems to have only this in return for his toil), he
enjoys only modest recompense. But if
the interpretation is read in the way it has been written, it reproves the
wretched, the fasting and the hungry, the thirsty and the mourners, whom the
Lord calls blessed in the Gospel [Cfr. Matth. 5, 5.6.]. And we regard food and drink spiritually and
above this happiness, which we are scarcely able to find in the toil of our
life. But because these things are
expressed in this way, as I have said, the following verse shows this too,
which says, "I dedicated my heart to seeing wisdom and work", since
clearly men work on earth, and consider deeply the Scriptures day and night in
this way so that sleep flees from their eyes, in return for their study.
