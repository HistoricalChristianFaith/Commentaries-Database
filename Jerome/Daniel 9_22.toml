Verse 22. "And He instructed me and spoke to me, saying..." The vision was so obscure that the prophet needed the angel's teaching.

"'...Now, 0 Daniel, I have come forth that I may instruct thee and that thou mayest understand.'" That is, I have been sent to thee and have come forth, not from the presence of God in the sense of departing from Him, but only in the sense of coming unto thee.
