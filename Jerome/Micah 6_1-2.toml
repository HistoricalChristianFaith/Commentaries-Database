(Chapter VI—Verses 1, 2.) Listen to what the Lord is saying: Rise up, contend with the mountains, and let the hills hear your voice. Listen, O mountains, to the Lord's judgment, and you mighty foundations of the earth, for the Lord will judge with his people and with Israel. Septuagint: Listen to what the Lord has spoken: Rise up, judge among the mountains, and let the hills hear your voice. Listen, O mountains, to the Lord's judgment, and you valleys, foundations of the earth, for the Lord will judge his people and with Israel. For the firm foundations of the earth, which are interpreted as the seventy valleys and foundations of the earth, Symmachus and Theodotion translated it, and the ancient foundations of the earth: but the fifth edition presented the Hebrew itself, Ethanim, the foundations of the earth. Therefore, the first voice of the prophet is: Hear what the Lord is saying. Then God speaks to the prophet: Rise up, contend with judgment against the mountains, and let the hills hear your voice. Again, the prophet, as he had been commanded, speaks to the mountains, and not only to the mountains, but also to the strong foundations of the earth, and says, Hear, O mountains, the judgment of the Lord, and you strong foundations of the earth. He gives the reason why he compels them to hear. Because the judgment of the Lord will be pronounced upon his people, and with Israel it will be judged. They have transferred hills and valleys to the mountains to which the prophet speaks and to the strong foundations of the earth, understanding this, as it seems to me, that the people have done nothing worthy to be heard from the mountains, either from the hills that are inferior to the height of the mountains, or from the valleys submerged in the deepest part. Arise, he says, contend in judgment before the mountains, and let the hills hear your voice. He commands those who are sitting, lying, sleeping, or dead to arise, according to what the Apostle says: Awake, you who sleep, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give you light (Ephesians 5:14). Arise from the dead, so that you may walk in newness of life, that you may leave the earth and strive for higher things. And contend in judgment against the mountains, which I believe to signify no one other than the Angels, to whom the care of human matters is entrusted, as the Song of Deuteronomy concords with the same: When the Most High divided the nations, when he scattered the sons of Adam, he set the bounds of the nations according to the number of the angels of God (Deuteronomy 32:8). Hello, we are the administrators of the spirit, sent to minister to those who will inherit salvation. And strive for justice, so that whether mountains or hills ((or valleys)) are found, it may not be considered unworthy of the people whom I have appointed, or that the blame be removed from the people and referred to the leaders. Let us read the Apocalypse of John the Apostle, in which the Angels of the Churches are praised and accused for their virtues and vices, for which they are said to preside. For just as sometimes the fault lies with the bishops, sometimes with the people; and often the teacher sins, often the student; sometimes it is the fault of the father, sometimes of the son, so that they may be taught either well or poorly: in this way, in the judgment of God, either a charge will be brought against the angels, if they do not carry out everything that pertains to their duty, or against the people, if they have disregarded those who do everything themselves. There are those who interpret the mountains and hills and the strong foundations of the earth as Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, and the other patriarchs, to whom it is as if they were listeners and authors, and who are summoned to judgment, for the cause of the people of Israel may be investigated. Others believe that mountains, hills, and valleys are inhabited by angels, as we said above, either serving God in the heavens, or governing over humans on this earth, or being stationed below, among those who have become earthly due to their own fault, they are said to be the foundations of the earth: concerning which foundations and elsewhere we find it written: A fire is kindled in my wrath, it shall burn unto the lowest hell, and shall consume the earth with her increase, and set on fire the foundations of the mountains (Deut. 32:22). The strong and ancient foundations of the earth (whose cause the earth has not passed until now, and hanging over the void, remains balanced) are the merits of the righteous, of whom the Apostle speaks: Built upon the foundations of the apostles and prophets (Ephesians 2:20). Therefore, just as the apostles, prophets, and the entire chorus of martyrs are the strong foundations of the earth, so according to the Septuagint, the valleys and cliffs, which are more significantly called φάραγγες in Greek, are their foundations, who have received the image of the dwelling place (Mss. choici). Therefore, the judgment of the Lord will be with His people, and with Israel it will be judged. He who could, as it were, inflict punishments like God for the sins of a sinful people, does not want to appear mighty, but just, and calls sinners to judgment, according to the prophecy: Come, let us argue it out, says the Lord (Isaiah 43:26), even now He calls the people of Israel, with the presence of Angels and all creatures, if there is anything to be answered, so that God may be justified in His words and prevail when He is judged (Psalm 50).
