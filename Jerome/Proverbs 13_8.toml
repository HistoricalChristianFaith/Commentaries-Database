The Lord yearns for believers’ souls more than for their riches. We read in the Proverbs, “The ransom of a man’s soul are his own riches.” We may, indeed, take a person’s own riches to be those which do not come from someone else or from plunder; according to the precept, “honor God with your just labors.” But the sense is better if we understand a person’s “own riches” to be those hidden treasures which no thief can steal and no robber wrest from him.
