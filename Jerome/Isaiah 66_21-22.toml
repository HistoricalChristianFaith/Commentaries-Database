“ ‘And I will take from them priests and Levites,’ says the Lord,” so that those who will be saved can preach to the Gentiles.” Concerning this, one author said, “Thus a person should regard us as ministers of Christ and dispensers of the mysteries of God,” and the Evangelist Luke wrote, “just as they delivered to us, who saw from the beginning and were ministers of the word.” We, too, read above about this very matter: “But you will be for me priests of the Lord.” For just as he who is circumcised by the Spirit is a Jew in hiding, of whom it is written “we are the circumcision who serve the Spirit of God and offer spiritual sacrifices pleasing to God and sing psalms with the Spirit and with the mind,” so also they are priests and Levites in hiding who follow not a genealogy but the order of faith. It is certain, at least, that this does not speak of the apostles or of apostolic men, who were the princes of the church from the people of the Jews, but it speaks instead of those Gentiles enumerated above, from the sea, from Africa, from Lybia, from Cappadocia, from Italy, from Greece, and from all the islands, the inhabitants of which have not yet had an opportunity to hear the Lord for the first time or to see his glory and afterward to be made priests, such that those who were the tail may become the head and those who were the head may become the tail.“For, like the new heaven and the new earth that I will cause to stand before me,” says the Lord, “so shall your seed and your name stand. From month to month and from sabbath to sabbath, all flesh will come to adore the Lord in my presence in Jerusalem.”
When the Lord says, “I will take from them priests and Levites,” he shows the old priesthood to have passed away, which was bound to the tribe of Levi, where there was no choice but only a succession by the order of nature in family posterity. For “when there is a change in the priesthood, it is necessary that there be a change in the law as well” and that election to the priesthood be conferred by no means according to blood lineage but according to merits and virtues, choosing people who will come from the islands of the Gentiles and proclaim the glory of the Lord.
