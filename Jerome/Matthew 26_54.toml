In another Gospel , Peter is represented as having done this, and with his usual hastiness; and that the servant’s name was Malchus,and that the ear was the right ear. In passing we may say, that Malchus, i.e.one who should have been king of the Jews, was made the slave of the ungodliness and the greediness of the Priests, and lost his right ear so that he might hear only the worthlessness of the letter in his left.
