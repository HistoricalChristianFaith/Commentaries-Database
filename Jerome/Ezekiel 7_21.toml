(Verse 21) Therefore I gave them over to uncleanness: and I will give them into the hands of foreigners to plunder them, and to the wicked of the earth as prey, and they will defile it. LXX: Therefore I gave them over to uncleanness: and I will give them into the hands of foreigners to plunder them, and to the pestilential ones of the earth as prey, and they will pollute it. Because they made for themselves images of their abominations and idols from the gold and silver and ornaments of their necklaces, which I had given them, therefore I gave them into uncleanness and into excrement. For which Symmachus interpreted, expressing disgust, wanting to cleanse the filth of the idols. And he said, 'I will deliver these into the hands of the enemy, so that they may plunder everything, and not only defile them, but also demonstrate that they, which previously seemed most sacred, are contaminated.' We too are delivered into the hands of our enemies and strangers to God when we make our ornaments into images of demons, and all our glory is possessed by the impious or the plagues of the earth, so that they may subject us to their power.
