He who sounds a trumpet before him when he does alms is a hypocrite. Whence headds, “as the hypocrites do.”Isid., Etym. x. ex Aug. Serm.: The name ‘hypocrite’ is derived from the appearance of those who in the shows are disguised in masks, variously coloured according to the character they represent, sometimes male, sometimes female, to impose on the spectators while they act in the games.
A reward not of God, but of themselves, for they receive praise of men, for the sake of which it was that they practised their virtues.
