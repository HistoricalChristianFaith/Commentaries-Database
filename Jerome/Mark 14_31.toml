For by a hymn he means the praise of the Lord, as is said in the Psalms , “The poor shall eat and be satisfied; they that seek after the Lord shall praise Him.” And again, “All such as be fat upon earth have eaten and worshipped.”.
Jesus also is held captive on the mount of Olives, whence He ascended to Heaven, that we may know, that we ascend into Heaven from that place in which we watch and pray; there we arebound and do not tend back again to earth.
All indeed fall, but all donot remain fallen. For shall not he who sleeps also rise up again? Itis a carnal thing to fall, but devilish to remain lying when fallen.
For the Prophet prays forthe Passion of the Lord, and the Father answers, I will smite the shepherd according to the prayers of those below. The Son is sent and smitten by the Father, that is, He is made Incarnate and suffers.
In which the true Resurrection is promised, that their hope may not be extinguished. There follows: “But Peter said unto Him, Although all shall be offended, yet will notI.” Lo a bird unfledged strives to raise itself on high; but the body weighs down the soul, so that the fear of the Lord is overcome by the fear of human death.
Who is the cock, the harbinger of day, but the Holy Spirit? by whose voice in prophecy, and in the Apostles, we are roused from our threefold denial, to most bitter tears after our fall, for we have thought evil of God, spoken evil of our neighbours, and done evil to ourselves. For it goes on: “But he spake the more vehemently, If I should die with Thee, I will not deny Thee in any wise.”

One of twelve deserted; eleven remained loyal. The cross came; they fled; one remained—Peter, one with One. This one himself fled, and would that he had! He denied Christ. We may say, then, that the entire human race was lost. Because it had perished, the complaint of the Lord crucified is: “The wine press I have trodden alone, and of my people there was no one with me.” Then was the Psalm fulfilled: “Help, O Lord! For no one now is dutiful.” “There is none who does good, no not even one.” He who has promised: “Even if I should have to die with thee, or be imprisoned, I will not deny thee,” denied him.
