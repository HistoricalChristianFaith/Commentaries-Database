One of twelve deserted; eleven remained loyal. The cross came; they fled; one remained—Peter, one with One. This one himself fled, and would that he had! He denied Christ. We may say, then, that the entire human race was lost. Because it had perished, the complaint of the Lord crucified is: “The wine press I have trodden alone, and of my people there was no one with me.” Then was the Psalm fulfilled: “Help, O Lord! For no one now is dutiful.” “There is none who does good, no not even one.” He who has promised: “Even if I should have to die with thee, or be imprisoned, I will not deny thee,” denied him.
