(Verse 28, 29.) But Peter, responding, said: Lord, if it is you, command me to come to you on the water. And he said: Come. In all places, Peter is found to have the most fervent faith. When the disciples were asked who they said Jesus, the Son of God, confesses. He prevents him from going to his passion, and although he may be mistaken in understanding, he is not mistaken in his feelings: not wanting him to die, whom he had confessed as the Son of God just a little while before. He is the first among the first to ascend the mountain with the Savior, and in his passion he alone follows, washing away with bitter tears the sin of denial that had descended from sudden fear. After the passion, when they were in the lake of Genesareth, fishing, and the Lord was standing on the shore, as others were slowly sailing, he did not allow any delays, but girding himself with his own girdle, he immediately threw himself into the waves. Therefore, with the same ardor of faith as always, now also, while others are silent, he believes that he can do by the will of the master what he could do by nature. Command me to come to you over the waters. You give the order, and immediately the waves will be still, and the body which is naturally heavy will become light.

And when Peter descended from the boat, he walked on the water to come to Jesus. Those who think that the body of the Lord was not true, because he walked on soft waters, let them explain how Peter walked, whom they certainly will not deny to be a real human being.
