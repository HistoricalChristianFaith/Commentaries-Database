(Verse 14 and following) He made fronts for sixty cubits, and the courtyard of the gate had a surrounding circuit. And before the face of the gate, which reached up to the face of the interior vestibule gate, there were fifty cubits, and oblique windows in the chambers, and in their fronts which were inside the gate all around. Similarly, there were windows in the vestibules all around inside: and before the fronts, there was a depiction of palms. LXX: And under the sky was the court of the gate sixty cubits, and the threshold of the court of the gate all round. And under the sky of the court outside was the gate of the inner court fifty cubits, and windows screened with palm trees, and also the threshold of the gate within the court round about. And similarly the gate chambers, and windows all around inside, and the thresholds of the gates were palm trees on both sides.\" Symmachus interpreted this passage as follows: And he made circuits, which we can call surroundings: for which in Hebrew he has Elim (), which Aquila interpreted as κρίωμα, and we translate as frontiers. Again, where the Seventy placed the entrance of the atrium, in Hebrew it has El () in the singular number, which Symmachus translated as near the entrance, Aquila as κρίωμα, that is, the front of the atrium. Also, under the open sky, Aquila, before the face of the gate's posts; Symmachus, opposite the face of the gate's vestibule, translated. The hidden windows called Atemoth in Hebrew, Symmachus translated as τοξικὰς. And where the Seventy said above the entrance and above the gate's post, Symmachus placed the posts and the surroundings; Aquila, the chambers, and their fronts: for which it is written in Hebrew Theim and Ele. Moreover, Elamoth, which Septuagint and Theodotion also translated similarly; Symmachus translated circumstantias [circumstances], Aquila translated frontes [fronts]. But Aelam, for which it is written El in Hebrew ((Mss. Ul)), is called ostium [door] or porticus [porch]. Also, for palmis [palms], it is written in Hebrew as Thamarim [plural number]: because in the singular number, it calls palmam [palm], Thamar. I know that these things will be annoying to a fastidious reader: but I wanted to show briefly how much the ancient translation differs from the Hebrew truth due to the length of time, or rather the fault of the scribes, and, to speak more openly, our lack of knowledge of Hebrew: especially in Hebrew names, which we have translated from other editions into the Latin language, indicating not so much an explanation of the words as our simple suspicion. However, I think that around the wall of the temple on the outside, and the temple itself in the courtyard, that is, in the middle, there were certain things placed for decoration, which Symmachus interprets as surroundings, that is, certain standing structures, raised high from the ground, and these occupied a space of sixty cubits. And again, as one went out from the inner gate to the front of the vestibule, which faced the outer gate, there were fifty cubits of space, in which there were oblique windows, which Seventy called 'toxicas'. And in these windows were in the chambers, that is, in each room, and in the porticoes that extended before the rooms, measuring fifty cubits. These windows were slanted or arched, therefore they were called 'sagittae', which means 'arrows', because they allow a narrow light to enter the house, like arrows, and expand inward: and all around they were full of such windows. And in front of the facades of the porticoes, he says, there were paintings or carvings of palm trees, through which it is shown at the entrance of the gate, and immediately upon entering, a wall measuring sixty cubits with various ornaments meets, which refer to the condition of the world, so that the Creator may be understood through His creations: and everything in order and with reason, show the variety of the world, which among the Greeks is called 'kosmos', derived from adornment: and it was made in six days, so that each day, ten decades are reckoned, which we have mentioned above as the perfect number. After this, as we enter the inner atrium, we come across before us the vestibule of the inner gate of the bedroom, with oblique windows, occupying a space of fifty cubits, which itself is a sacred number. And after seven full weeks of festivity and joy, the first day of the Octave begins, which is the Day of Resurrection, and it brings us close to the temple. For when we have done all things, repenting for our previous errors, then we become neighbors and close to God, so that in the outer atrium, the order of creatures teaches us knowledge of the Creator with constancy, and in the inner [atrium] true jubilation, in which all our debts are forgiven, instructs us in the theology, and introduces us to the Holy of Holies. It is also worth noting that the inner courtyard has several windows, which are not direct and equal, but rather oblique and narrow on the outside, and widening inward, so that we can penetrate the interior through small openings and reach the fullness of the brightest light, which is present in the temple. Finally, after sixty and fifty cubits, and chambers, and porticoes, and the facades of the porticoes, and numerous windows all around, the carving or painting of palm trees is shown to us, so that as victors of the world, we may become worthy to see the palm trees of virtues.
