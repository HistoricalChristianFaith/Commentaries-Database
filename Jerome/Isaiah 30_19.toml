(Verse 19) For the people of Zion will dwell in Jerusalem. The Jews refer these things to the time of Cyrus, when the people returned from Babylon to Judaea under Zerubbabel and the high priest Joshua. But we, as we have often said already, refer all the promises that surpass the mediocrity of that time to the coming of Christ, in which the once captive people, freed by the passion of the Lord, dwelled in Zion and Jerusalem, namely, in the watchtower and vision of peace, that is, in the Church. Furthermore, that which is added in the Septuagint as a word of sanctity, they said: 'For a holy people dwells in Zion' (alternative: will dwell), we can interpret it to mean that no one dwells in Zion unless they are holy and hear the Lord saying, 'Be holy, for I am holy' (Leviticus 11:44).
