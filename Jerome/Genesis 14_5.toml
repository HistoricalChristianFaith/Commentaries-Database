(Verse 5.) And the giants settled in Astaroth Carnaim, and strong nations along with them: and Ominaeos in the city of Save, before they came to Sodom. Four kings who came from Babylon killed the giants, that is, the strong ones of Arabia, and the Zozim in Hom, and the Emim in the city of Save, which is still called by that name today. But the Zuzim and the Emim are interpreted as terrifying and horrifying: for this reason, the Seventy [translators], conveying the sense rather than word for word, translated them as the strongest nations. Furthermore, Baem, for which they said, 'with them', they thought it was written with He (), guided by the similarity of the elements, while it is written with Heth. Baem () is written with three letters: if it has the middle He, it is interpreted as 'in them'; but if it has Heth, as in the present case, it signifies a place, that is, 'in Hom ()'.
