(Verse 6.) And we will raise up against him seven shepherds and eight principal men, and they will shepherd the land of Assyria with the sword, and the land of Nimrod with their spears; and he will deliver from Assyria when it comes into our land and when it treads within our borders. LXX: And seven shepherds will rise against him, and eight bites of men, and they will shepherd Assyria with the sword, and the land of Nimrod with their pitfall; and he will deliver from Assyria, when it comes upon your land, and when it ascends upon your borders. Where we have placed the first human beings, and it is written in Hebrew Nesiche Adam, Symmachus interprets it as Christos hominum; Theodotion and the fifth edition, prinipces hominum; Aquila, heavy, or established men, that is, καθισταμένους. Again, in the place where I and Aquila have translated it, in his spears, so that it is understood, the land of Nimrod, Symmachus renders it as ἐντὸς πυλῶν αὐτῆς, that is, within its gates; Theodotion, within their gates; the fifth edition, ἐν παραξίφησιν αὐτῶν, which we can say, in their marshes: but in Hebrew it is written Baphethee. So then there will be peace, when the remnants of the brothers of Christ are converted to the sons of Israel, and the Assyrian comes into our land, and with the help of the Lord, we will quickly crush him who desired to trample on our houses under our feet. For the Lord himself says: We will raise up seven shepherds against him, and eight leaders of men, or human bites. But I and my Son and the Holy Spirit will raise up, according to what is written in Genesis: Let us make man in our image and likeness (Gen. 1:26). And in the beginning of Abdiel: Rise up and let us ascend against her in battle. I believe the seven shepherds, all the patriarchs and prophets and holy men, served in the week, that is, in the old Instrument. But the eight bites of men, or rather the eight chief men, as Symmachus interpreted, are the Christs, all of the New Testament, who from the apostles to this age have bitten the Assyrian and torn him with their teeth. And it is commanded in Ecclesiastes: Let us give seven parts, let us also give eight (Eccl. XI). And in the temple of Ezekiel, which is interpreted as the Church and the heavenly Jerusalem, one ascends by seven and eight steps (Ezek. XL). And in the Psalter there are fifteen steps by which we ascend through the week and the octave to sing praises to God. On the eighth day, the spiritual circumcision is celebrated, and in the temple of the Jews, the Sabbath is destroyed, and certain psalms are inscribed for the Octave. Therefore, these seven shepherds and eight offenses of men will feed Assyria with the sword. For the living and effective word of God, sharper than every two-edged sword (Heb. IV, 12), was sent by Him who came to send a sword upon the earth, so that two might be divided into three (Matth. X). And they will feed the land of Nimrod (which means 'descending temptation') in its pit; for the land of the giant and hunter and one who proudly opposes the Lord is not in the mountains, but in the pits. He has fallen like lightning from heaven, and he always dwells among beasts; and because he is a hunter, he roams through unfruitful woods and forests. As far as I can recall from my memory, I have never read favorably about a hunter. Ishmael and Esau were hunters (Gen. XVI and XXVII), and they foreshadowed the people of Judah, of whom one is a son of Egypt, walking according to the flesh and living according to the flesh: the other lost the birthright for a lentil soup, and envious of his brother's blessings, he sends him away to Mesopotamia. Therefore, let the earth swallow up Nimrod in its pits: For he who digs a pit will fall into it (Prov. XXVI, 7): and he who opens a well and digs it, will fall into the pit he made, and his pain will turn upon his head, and his wickedness will descend upon his own skull (Ps. VII, 16, 17). And Christ freed us from the hand of Assyria, the Assyrian who came upon our land, and desired to trample the boundaries of Israel, confessing to the seven shepherds and to eight princes. But what Symmachus says: And Assur will feed the land with the sword, and the region of Nemrod within its gates, this should be understood, that the strong will be bound in his own house, and the adversary will be wounded. And according to the Eagle and the fifth edition, let the seven shepherds be pierced with dryness and the eight men of Christ with spears.
