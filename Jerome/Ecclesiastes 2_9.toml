"Thus I
grew and surpassed any of my predecessors in Jerusalem; still, my wisdom stayed
with me." It seems to me that Ecclesiastes, acting
grandly, agrees less with the Lord, unless by chance we adapt this to him:
"He [Jesus] increased in wisdom and age and grace" [Luc. 2, 52.]. And, "on account of which God took him
on high [Phil. 2, 9.]". He also says "those who were before me
in Jerusalem" and is referring to those who, before he arrived, steered
the congregation of holy men and the Church. 
If we explain the text in a spiritual way then Christ is richer than all
men; and he only perceives the Synagogue better in bodily form than the
Church. Therefore he wears a veil,
because it was placed over the face of Moses and he let us see his face in
daylight. [Cfr Ex. 34,33. ; II Cor. 3, 13.] More precisely "wisdom has stayed with
me", means even in respect to the temptations of the body wisdom stayed
with him. For he who receives a profit
from his wisdom will not keep wisdom long, but he who does not receive a gain,
nor grows through change, but always has plenty- he is able to say, "and
wisdom has stayed with me".
