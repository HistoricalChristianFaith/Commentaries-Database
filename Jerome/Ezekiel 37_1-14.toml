(Chapter 37, verses 1 onwards) The hand of the Lord was upon me, and He brought me out in the Spirit of the Lord and set me down in the middle of a valley; it was full of bones. And He led me around among them, and behold, there were very many on the surface of the valley, and behold, they were very dry. And He said to me, 'Son of man, can these bones live?' And I answered, 'O Lord God, you know.' Then He said to me, 'Prophesy over these bones, and say to them, 'O dry bones, hear the word of the Lord. Thus says the Lord God to these bones: Behold, I will cause breath to enter you, and you shall live. And I will lay sinews upon you, and will cause flesh to come upon you, and cover you with skin, and put breath in you, and you shall live, and you shall know that I am the Lord.' And I prophesied as he had commanded me: and the noise came, and behold a commotion: and the bones came together, each one to its joint. And I saw, and behold there were sinews upon them, and flesh came up, and skin was stretched out over them, but there was no spirit in them. And he said to me: Prophesy to the spirit, prophesy, son of man, and say to the spirit: Thus saith the Lord God: Come, spirit, from the four winds, and blow upon these slain, and let them live again. And I prophesied as He commanded me, and the spirit entered into them and they came to life: a vast army. Then he said to me: Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel. They say: Our bones are dried up and our hope is gone; we are cut off. Therefore, prophesy and say to them: This is what the Sovereign Lord says: I am going to open your graves and bring you up from them, my people; I will bring you back to the land of Israel. Then you, my people, will know that I am the Lord, when I open your graves and bring you up from them. I will put my Spirit in you and you will live, and I will settle you in your own land. Then you will know that I am the Lord; I have spoken and I will do it, declares the Lord God. LXX: And the hand of the Lord came upon me, and he brought me in the Spirit of the Lord, and set me down in the midst of the plain, and it was full of human bones, and he led me round about them, on every side: and behold there were very many upon the face of the plain, and they were very dry. And he said to me: Son of man, dost thou think these bones shall live? And I answered: O Lord God, thou knowest. And he said to me: Prophesy concerning these bones; and say to them: Ye dry bones, hear the word of the Lord. Thus saith the Lord God to these bones: Behold, I will send spirit into you, and you shall live. And I will lay sinews upon you, and will cause flesh to grow over you, and will cover you with skin: and I will give you spirit, and you shall live, and you shall know that I am the Lord. And I prophesied as he commanded me: and the voice came to pass, while I prophesied, that behold a commotion, and the bones came together, each one to its joint. And I saw, and behold sinews came upon them, and flesh grew and skin covered them above, but there was no spirit in them. And he said to me: Prophesy, son of man, prophesy upon the spirit, and say to the spirit: Thus says the Lord God: Come from the four winds, O spirit, and breathe upon these slain, that they may live. And I prophesied as I had been commanded, and the spirit entered into them, and they lived and stood on their feet, a very great assembly. Then the Lord spoke to me, saying: Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel. They say: Our bones are dried up, and our hope is lost; we are completely cut off. Therefore, prophesy and say to them: Thus says the Lord God: Behold, I will open your graves, and bring you up from your graves, O my people, and I will bring you into the land of Israel. And you shall know that I am the Lord, when I open your graves, and bring you up from your graves, O my people. I will put my Spirit within you, and you shall live, and I will place you in your own land. Then you shall know that I am the Lord; I have spoken, and I will do it, declares the Lord God. The vision is famous and celebrated by the reading of all the Church of Christ: for this reason, I have included both editions in their entirety, lest any slander against us be made by the Hebrews, if at least in words there may be some discrepancy. For they are accustomed to laugh at us, raise their eyebrows, and belch forth their knowledge of the Scriptures, if I may not say the disagreement of meanings (which, if it exists, is rightly condemned), if they can demonstrate any dissonance of words in our codices. Therefore, those who believe in the resurrection, which is believed by both Jews and Christians to be the word of God, often say the following: 'The hand of the Lord has come upon the prophet,' meaning the Lord, who is also the Savior, through whom the Father has done all things. For everything was made by him, and without him was made nothing that was made.' And he said, 'The spirit of the Lord took me, and the hand of the Lord was upon me.' And he was taken in the spirit, not in the body, but outside the body, and he was placed, or sent, in the midst of a field that was full of human bones. And he did not have rest there, but he caused all the bones, which were not covered by the earth but were lying on the field, to circle around. And there were not only many bones, but many bones excessively dry and parched due to the old age of time, and they did not have any moisture in them. And when the divine speaker asked him whether he thought these bones could live, he responded: Lord God, you know, who have full knowledge of the future. And the Lord said to him: Prophesy over the bones, whether over these bones, and you shall say to them: Dry bones, hear the word of the Lord. It is remarkable how he spoke to dry bones, which before nerves, flesh, and skin, and the life-giving spirit of God, could hear his word. And first, the bones are bound together with the ligaments of the nerves, then they are filled with flesh, and the skin is stretched over them for beauty, which covers the ugliness of the exposed flesh; and then they receive breath, which makes them alive, and after they have lived, then they know that He is the Lord. So, as the prophet had commanded, there was immediately a commotion, and the bones were joined together in their proper framework, bound with nerves, filled with flesh, covered with skin: and there lay human bodies without breath. Therefore, the prophet prophesies to the spirit, and says: Thus says the Lord God: Come, O spirit, from the four winds; come, that is, from the four corners of the world, so that just as in the first creation of man God breathed into his face and he became a living soul (Genesis 2:7), so in the second creation, that is, the resurrection of the dead, being breathed upon by the spirit, they may be brought to life again; for when the spirit entered the human bodies, immediately they lived, and stood upon their feet. Therefore, the resurrection of the dead is also called a gathering, or the Church, many (Psalms CIII, 30), and as it is said in Hebrew, a great army; and it is fulfilled at a certain time: 'Send forth your spirit, and they shall be created, and you shall renew the face of the earth.' But when it is said: 'And he said unto me, Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel,' it seems to raise a question, because it is not speaking of the general resurrection, but specifically of the resurrection of the house of Israel, which says: 'Our bones are dried up, and our hope is lost, and we are cut off from our own land,' or we have completely despaired. In response to those saying these things, Ezekiel is compelled to prophesy for the third time, and he says to the dry bones: 'Thus says the Lord God: Behold, I will open your graves.' In which it is asked: If he opens the tombs, how did he say above: There were indeed very many on the face of the plain, and very dry. And I will bring you up from your tombs, my people, according to that which is written in the Gospel: The hour is coming; when those who are in the tombs will hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who have done good will come forth unto the resurrection of life (John 5:28-29). And again: Those who hear will live (ibid.). And if, as some think, the divine discourse speaks of the general resurrection, why was it necessary to say specifically: And I will bring you into the land of Israel, when the dead in every corner of the earth must rise from the places where they were buried? And when, he says, I shall bring you out of your graves and give you my spirit, and you shall live, then I will make you rest upon your own land, so that after you have rested in the land of Israel, then you may know that I am the Lord, who has fulfilled my promises with deeds. Therefore, when they understand these things about the general resurrection, that which seems to raise the question: 'These bones are the whole house of Israel,' they refer to the resurrection of the saints, about which the Apostle John also speaks in the Apocalypse: 'Blessed and holy is he who has part in the first resurrection; over such the second death has no power' (Rev. 20:6): that is to say, there is a different resurrection for the saints and for the sinners. And in the first Psalm it says: The wicked will not rise in judgment, nor sinners in the council of the righteous. But the land of Israel, which the Lord promises to those who rise, they confirm to be the same, as it is written: Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth. (Matthew 5:4) And: I will please the Lord in the land of the living. (Psalm 116:9) These things are spoken by those who think that Ezekiel wrote about the general resurrection, as we have said. But those who interpret them in this way should not envy us, because by interpreting this passage differently, we seem to deny the resurrection. For we know that much stronger testimonies, in which there is no doubt, are found in the holy Scriptures, such as that of Job: 'You will raise up my flesh, which supports these things' (Job 19). And in Daniel: 'Many of those who sleep in the dust of the earth will awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt' (Dan. 12:2). And in the Gospel: Fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell (Matthew 10:28). And the Apostle Paul: But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you (Romans 8:11), and many others. From which it is clear that we do not deny the resurrection, but we do not contend for these unwritten things about the resurrection. And through the parable of the resurrection, it is prophesied about the restoration of Israel, which was captive in Babylon at that time. We will not immediately give occasion to the heretics if we deny that these things are understood about the common resurrection. For the likeness of the resurrection would never be set forth to signify the restoration of the Israelite people unless the resurrection itself stood, and the future was believed: because no one confirms uncertain things about things that do not exist. And our whole assertion tends toward that, which seems incredulous, that a future resurrection is promised to dry bones and those worn down by much antiquity; and yet what is promised will indeed happen; in the same way, the restoration of the Israelite people, who were led into captivity and dispersed throughout the whole world, seems indeed incredible to those who do not know the power of God, but it is, however, future: for I, says the Lord, have spoken, and I will do as I have promised. And in the previous prophecy, in which the ancient state of the mountains of Israel is promised, the Lord says to them: And I will turn to you, and you shall be plowed and sown, and you shall receive seed, and I will multiply men in you, and all the house of Israel (above verse 9, 10); and again, that the house of Israel will dwell in their own land, which was once uncultivated, and will become like a garden of delight, and the deserted and destitute cities will be fortified; and the house of Israel will multiply in them, like a flock of sheep, and the other things that follow pertain to the same meaning, which is now expressed figuratively and metaphorically as dry bones, having no moisture of life, with the fulfillment of what is written in the Gospel: The things that are impossible with men, are possible with God (Matthew 19:26). But all these things confirm the Jews, either under Zerubbabel, as I said before, when a great commotion took place; and the kingdom of the Chaldeans was translated into the Medes and the Persians: or at the coming of their Christ, whom they suppose is to come. But we spiritually commemorate the completion after the cross of the Lord and Savior; and this happens daily, especially to those who, like Lazarus, bound by the bands of their sins, are raised up at the voice of the Lord (John 11); and truly they are the house of Israel, once desolate and without hope of salvation: but as the spirit of grace enters into them and the Lord stretches out his hand, they are liberated from the depths of Hell: and those who previously said, 'Lord God, you know these things,' afterwards hear, being freed: 'O you of little faith, why did you doubt?' (Matthew 14:31).
