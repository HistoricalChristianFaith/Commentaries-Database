"And
wisdom is better than weapons, but a single rogue can ruin a great deal of
good. "Now he also takes wisdom
in preference to strength and says that it is worth more in battle than
weapons. But if there is one fool,
however small and worthless, he will repeatedly destroy riches and great wealth
by his stupidity. But because the Hebrew
can also be read as: 'and he who sins once, will lose much goodness', much
righteousness will be lost in return and virtues will follow in turn, and he
who has one, has all [Cfr. Cic de Offic. II, 35.];
and he who sins at one time, leaves himself open to all vices [Cfr. Iac. 2, 10.].
