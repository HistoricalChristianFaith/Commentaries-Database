If these [vessels] were approved by the Lord it was at a time when the priests had to offer victims and when the blood of sheep was the redemption of sins. They were figures typifying things still future and were “written for our admonitions upon whom the ends of the world are come.” But now our Lord by his poverty has consecrated the poverty of his house. Let us, therefore, think of his cross and count riches to be but dirt. Why do we admire what Christ calls “the mammon of unrighteousness”? Why do we cherish and love what it is Peter’s boast not to possess? Or if we insist on keeping to the letter and find the mention of gold and wealth so pleasing, let us keep to everything else as well as the gold. Let the bishops of Christ be bound to marry wives, who must be virgins. Let the best-intentioned priest be deprived of his office if he bears a scar and is disfigured. Let bodily leprosy be counted worse than spots on the soul. Let us be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth, but let us slay no lamb and celebrate no mystic Passover, for where there is no temple, the law forbids these acts. Let us pitch tents in the seventh month25 and noise abroad a solemn fast with the sound of a horn.
