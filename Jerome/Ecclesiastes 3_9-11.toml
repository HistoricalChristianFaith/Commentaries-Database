"What
gain, then, has the worker in exchange for all his toil? I have observed the task which God has given
the sons of man to be concerned with: He made everything beautiful in its time;
He has also put an enigma into their minds so that man cannot comprehend what
God has done from the beginning to end."  The
opinion of many other scholars on this passage does not escape me, because in
this world God conceded to the teachers of perverse doctrines their true
occupation, lest man's idle mind should become slow and while thinking that
God's creations are good, yet nonetheless not be able to see them as the
natural knowledge of the world. But the
Hebrew who taught me the Scriptures explained it in this way: when all things
are placed in their own time and there is a time for destroying or building,
weeping and laughing, silence and speaking, and others things which are said
about time, why do we try to survive in vain and believe the labours of this
short life to be perpetual? And
according to the Gospel we are not even happy, and it is called wickedness
since we think nothing of tomorrow. [Cfr Matth. 6, 34.] For what more are we able to have in this
world than continual striving in that toil, which God has given to man, so that
one man may gain more by following others, in a situation where he is able to
learn and exercise himself? For all that
God does is good, but good in his world. 
It is good to wake and to sleep, but it is not good to be always awake
or asleep, since in turn each and every thing can be considered good, when
there is need, according to God's plan. 
Moreover God also created the world to be inhabited by men, so that they
should enjoy the variation of time, and not seek the causes nature, how all
things are made, why He made this or that grow or change from the beginning of
the world until now.
