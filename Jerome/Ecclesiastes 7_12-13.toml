"Wisdom
is good with an inheritance: and by it there is profit to them that see the
sun. For wisdom is a defence, and money
is a defence: but the advantage of knowledge is, that wisdom gives life to
those that have it. "A wise man with riches has more glory than
just a wise man alone. For some men need
wisdom, some wealth, but he who is both wise and not rich is able to teach what
is good, but meanwhile he can't show what is to be sought. Therefore he says, since the protection of
wisdom is the protection of money, then just as wisdom protects, so too money
also protects. And lest he seem to
detract from wisdom, while he adds to it by good fortune, (for it is not in our
power to obtain riches, which often the unrighteous own in greater quantity),
he therefore shows wisdom to be greater, saying "but the advantage of
knowledge is, that wisdom gives life to those that have it." In that respect, he says, wisdom is greater
than riches, because without any wealth it preserves those who think themselves
rich. Certain scholars see this passage
in a different way: they say that he places heredity in place of good
association, by which we are the heirs of God, and co-heirs of Christ. Therefore Ecclesiastes wants to teach how
much of a difference there is between those who merit seeing the sun (of
justice), and have wisdom by their good association, and those in contrast, who
without wisdom have only enthusiasm for vice and association. Since even David shows this, saying "the
intelligent shine out by their speech, as the shining bodies of the sky" [Dan. 12. 3.],
or as Theodotion interpreted this, "just as the brightness of the
firmament. Indeed those who wrote my
speeches are as the stars of the sky". 
But we ought to take that protection of silver (or money) according to "anagoge [See footnote 50.]
"from which talents and coins are collected in the parables of the Gospels [Cfr Matth. 25,
14-23; Luc. 19. 12-25.],
just as when we were under the protection of wisdom and under the protection of
such money: "the sun does not burn us by day, nor the moon by night". [Ps. 120, 6.] But this can even be said to be true since
protection is our life on the earth: "the breath of our nostrils, the
anointed Christ our Lord of whom we said: under His shadow we should live among
the heathen". [Thren. 4, 20.] All of our protection in this life is like a
shade, or like wisdom, or as is said about money, until the day moves on and
the shadows move away. Symmachus
interprets this more clearly in his usual manner, saying, "just as wisdom
protects, so too money protects in a similar fashion". But the following verse openly encourages the
enthusiasm for knowledge.
