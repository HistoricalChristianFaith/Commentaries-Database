(Verse 14) Then the disciples of John came to him, saying: Why do we and the Pharisees fast often, but your disciples do not fast? Proud question, and full of the arrogance of the Pharisees. Certainly, to say nothing else, the boasting of fasting should be reprehended. And the disciples of John could not be blameless, who were slandering him, whom they knew had been proclaimed by their master's words, and were joining themselves to the Pharisees, whom they knew had been condemned by John, saying: O generation of vipers, who has shown you to flee from the coming wrath?
