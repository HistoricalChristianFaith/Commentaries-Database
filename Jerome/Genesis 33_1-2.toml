(Chapter 33, verses 1 and 2.) And he divided the children over Leah and over Rachel, and over the two maidservants, and he placed the maidservants and their firstborn sons: but Leah and her youngest sons, and Rachel and Joseph the youngest. And he himself went before them. No, as most people think, he did not make three groups, but two. In conclusion, where we have it, he divided, Aquila placed, halfed, that is, halved: so that he would make one group of maidservants with their little ones, and another of Leah and Rachel, who were free, with their sons: and he made the maidservants go first and the free women second: but he himself went before both groups, to meet his brother and pay homage.
