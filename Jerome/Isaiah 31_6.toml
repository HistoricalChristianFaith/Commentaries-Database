In place of the last clause [“But you have played the harlot with many lovers; yet return again to me, says the Lord.”] the true Hebrew text (which is not preserved in the Greek and Latin versions) gives the following: “you have forsaken me, yet return, and I will receive you, says the Lord.” Isaiah also speaking in the same sense uses almost the same words: “Return,” he cries, “O children of Israel, you who devise a deep and sinful counsel. Return to me, and I will redeem you. I am God, and there is no God else beside me; a just God and a Savior; there is nothing beside me. Look to me, and be saved, all the ends of the earth.” Remember this and show yourselves men: bring it again to mind, O you transgressors. Return in heart and remember the former things of old: for I am God and there is none else.” - "Letter 122.2"
