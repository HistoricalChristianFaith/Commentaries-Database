The Greek word here (κωφὸς) is more frequent in common speech in the sense of 'deaf,' but it is the manner of Scripture to use it indifferently as either.

As the blind receive light, so the tongue of the dumb is loosed, that he may confess Him whom before he denied. The wonder of the multitude is the confession of the nations. The scoff of the Pharisees is the unbelief of the Jews, which is to this day.
