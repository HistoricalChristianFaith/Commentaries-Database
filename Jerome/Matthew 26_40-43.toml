“Watch and pray that you may not enter into temptation.” It is impossible for the human soul to avoid temptation. Hence we say in the Lord’s Prayer, “Lead us not into temptation,” which we are unable to withstand. We do not refuse to face temptation entirely but pray for the strength to bear up under it. Therefore he does not say, “Watch and pray that you may not be tempted” but “that you may not enter into temptation,” that is, that temptation may not overwhelm you and hold you in its grip. For example, a martyr who has shed blood by professing faith in the Lord was certainly tempted but was not ensnared in the net of temptation. One who denies the faith, however, has fallen into the snares of temptation.“The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.” This is aimed at those rash people who think that whatever they believe, they can obtain. Therefore, as much as we trust in the ardor of our spirit, so too should we fear the weakness of the flesh. And yet, according to the apostle, the works of the flesh are mortified by the Spirit.
