(Vers. 3, 4.) But while he was sitting on the Mount of Olives,    the disciples came to him privately, saying: Tell us, when will these things be,    and what will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the age? And Jesus    answered them, saying: See that no one deceives you. He sits on the Mount of    Olives, where the true light of knowledge was born, and the disciples come to    him privately, who desired to know the mysteries and revelations of the future,    and they ask three things: When will Jerusalem be destroyed; when will Christ    come; when will the end of the age be.
