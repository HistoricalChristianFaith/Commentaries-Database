(Chapter 47, verses 1 and following) And he brought me back to the door of the house, and behold, water was coming out from under the threshold of the house eastward. For the face of the house was toward the east, and the water was flowing down from the right side of the temple, south of the altar. Then he led me out by way of the north gate and led me around on the outside to the outer gate that faces toward the east; and behold, water was trickling from the right side. When the man went out toward the east with a line in his hand, he measured a thousand cubits, and he led me through the water, water reaching the ankles (or passed through water of remission). And he measured again a thousand, and he led me through the water up to the knees (or he passed in the water unto the thighs). And he measured a thousand, and he led me through the water up to the loins (or he passed in the water unto the waist). And he measured a thousand of a deep, which I could not pass over, because the waters were risen, waters of a deep river, which could not be passed over. For which LXX have translated: And he measured a thousand, and could not pass over: because the water was bearing a stream like the rapid stream, which cannot be passed over. These waters which were flowing out from beneath the threshold of the house, that is, the temple, did not flow towards the North and the West, but also towards the East, and on the right side of the temple, that is, towards the South, and towards the very South not of any place, but of the altar. From this it becomes clear that the waters are sacred, and they signify the doctrine of our Savior, according to that which is written: 'For out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem' (Isaiah 2:3). And in another place: The knowledge of the Lord fills everything, like water covering the sea (Isai. XI, 9). Concerning these waters, the Prophet Zacharias also predicted, saying: In that day, living water will flow out from Jerusalem, half of it toward the eastern sea and half of it toward the western sea (Zach. XIV, 8). Concerning these waters, the Lord spoke to the Samaritan woman: If you knew who it is that asks you for a drink, you would have asked Him, and He would have given you living water (John IV, 10). And again: Everyone who drinks from this water will be thirsty again; but whoever drinks from the water that I will give him will never be thirsty again (John 4:13). And in the temple he cried out and said: If anyone thirsts, let him come to me and drink. Whoever believes in me (as the scripture says), out of his belly will flow rivers of living water. But this he said of the Spirit, which those who believed in him were to receive (John 7:37-38). These are the waters that the prophet spoke of in the psalm: He led me beside still waters (Psalm 23:3). And Ezekiel: I will take you from the nations, and gather you from all the countries, and I will sprinkle clean water upon you, and you shall be clean from all your uncleannesses. (Ezek. XXXVI, 24, 25). For water fountains appeared. And in the ninety-second Psalm it is sung: The rivers have lifted up, O Lord, the rivers have lifted up their voices from the voices of many waters. Wonderful are the elevations of the sea. (Ps. XCII, 2, 3). These are the waters of Siloam, which flow with silence, of which Isaiah speaks: You shall draw waters with joy from the fountains of salvation. (Isaiah XII, 3). And the Psalmist says: Bless the Lord from the fountains of Israel (Ps. 67). Likewise, Isaiah speaks of the Lord as Savior: He, it is said, shall dwell in the high cave of the strongest rock. Bread shall be given to him, and his water shall be faithful (Isa. 33:16). For water burst forth in the desert, and a valley in a thirsty land. And it is said to the believers: Do not fear, for I have redeemed you; you are mine, and if you pass through water, I am with you (Isa. 43:1, 2). And again: 'All you who are thirsty, come to the water' (Isaiah 55:1). And through Jeremiah, God speaks: 'My people have committed two evils: they have forsaken me, the fountain of living waters, and hewed out cisterns for themselves, broken cisterns that can hold no water' (Jeremiah 2:13). Therefore, just as we read in a good sense the waters that flow from the threshold of the temple and are returned to the teaching of the Church, so are bitter waters and the worst waters to which the prophet Jeremiah forbids us to approach, saying: 'What have you to do with the way of Egypt, to drink from the waters of the Nile?' (ibid). The Hebrew term for 'turbid and muddy' is Sior. Regarding these, God speaks angrily about the heretics: Behold, I will feed them with bitterness and give them poisonous water to drink (Jeremiah 9:15), in which the Egyptian dragon reigns, saying: The rivers are mine, and I made them; he who sees all that is high, and he himself is the king of those who are in the waters. Therefore, the man from Sirach prays to the Lord and says: Save me, O Lord, for the waters have come up to my neck. I am stuck in the mud of the deep, and there is no substance, and the storm has engulfed me (Ps. 68:1-2). And again; Deliver me from those who hate me, and from the depths of the waters: let not the water storm overwhelm me, nor let the depths swallow me up, nor let the pit close its mouth over me (Ps. 15:16). And in another psalm: If it had not been the Lord who was on our side, let Israel now say: If it had not been the Lord who was on our side. When men rose up against us, then they might have swallowed us up alive. When their fury was raging against us, perhaps the water would have swallowed us up (Psalm 123:1-3). And the Bride in the Song of Songs: Many waters cannot quench love, nor can rivers drown it (Song of Songs 8:7). This is the water of which Hosea speaks: The city of Galaad has scorned me, a city that works in vanities, disturbing the water, and the strength of its men are pirates (Hosea 6:7-8). This water is called by another name, Mara, which means bitterness; into it the wood of the Cross is placed, and the bitter is turned into sweet. Consider the law of Moses, if understood according to the carnal sense of the Jews, how bitter it is, 'an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth' (Exodus XXI); see the fornication of Thamar (II Kings XIII), and the joining of the prostitute by Hosea (Hosea I, Jeremiah XIII), Moses' Ethiopian wife, and the killing of the Egyptian, and a thousand other things, which if understood according to the literal sense, and not according to the life-giving spirit, are bitter, and do not edify the reader as much as they destroy (Numbers XII, Exodus II). Therefore, those waters which flow out from the temple of the Lord, and proceed to the East, and descend to the right side of the Temple, to the South of the altar, where the bridegroom feeds his guests, and reclines. But what follows: And he led me by the way of the North gate, and turned to the way outside the outer gate, the way that looked towards the East, he covertly shows that we cannot immediately reach the Eastern gate, unless we go around it through the way of the North gate. For unless we conquer the most extreme cold by the heat of faith, and trample on its regions, that may be fulfilled in us what is in the Apostle: But the God of peace shall crush Satan under your feet speedily. (Rom. 16:20), we will not be able to enter the gate through which the waters flow out, which are on the right side. And note that those waters that enter through the gate of the East flee so much towards the left side, that they are described as going from the right side of the altar to the South. But the man, he said, who had a rope in his hand, when he had led me through the gate on the outer side to the road that looked towards the East, and he himself was also in the same place, measured the same water a thousand cubits; and he led me through the water up to the ankles, which Aquila and Symmachus, and Theodotio rendered as 'ankles', for which the LXX rendered: and he passed into the water, the water of forgiveness: which we can understand as signifying the first sins of men, which are forgiven for us when we enter the waters of the Lord, and they show the saving grace of baptism and are the beginnings of progress, yet they themselves are sublime. Finally, they reach the ankles, which are close to the heel and exposed to the bites of snakes, as the Lord says: You will watch out for its head, and it will watch out for your heel (Gen. III, 15, according to the Septuagint). And in the Psalms about Judas the betrayer, it is said: He who ate my bread has magnified treachery against me (Ps. XL, 10), or rather the heel, for the Greek word πτέρνη (or πτέρνα in some manuscripts) means heel. But after one thousand cubits, which bring us to the ankle, he measures another thousand cubits in water and leads me up to the knees. After the forgiveness of sins, and during the journey of progress, when we attempt to ascend even a little from earthly things to higher ones, we bend our knees to the Lord, with the Apostle saying: So that every knee shall bow, in heaven, on earth, and under the earth, and every tongue confess that the Lord Jesus Christ is in the glory of God the Father (Philippians 2:10). He measures another three thousand cubits, and leads me through the water up to my waist, he says. For we climb to lofty heights by degrees: but those very heights descend to the loins and kidneys, so that every base desire within us is cut off; and we possess the sanctification of the body, without which no one sees God. Hence in the same Prophet it is written: 'From His feet to His loins He is a fiery God' (Ezekiel 8:2). For the loins need fire and purgation, as the just man says, 'For my loins are filled with illusions' (Psalm 38:8), through which the enemy deludes us both in the day and in the night time. But from the loins to the head and neck, it shines with the glitter of precious electrum, so that it has nothing filthy in itself, nothing of cheapness. Hence it is now said in the fourth (book): And he measured a thousand, with the addition of cubits, of a torrent (which the Septuagint did not translate), which I could not go through: much better than the Seventy who said, and he could not go through. For the prophet and all human nature, after the loins of the torrent of thoughts, and the incentives of vices in the heart, cannot go through. But that man, who was clothed with Baddim and was the leader of the prophets, passed through easily; who did not commit sin, nor was guile found in his mouth (Isaiah 56). And he gives the reasons why the prophet could not pass through a thousand cubits: because, he says, the deep waters of the torrent had swelled, which could not be crossed. And as it is written, with the prophet boasting: Our soul has passed through the torrent (Psalm 124, 5). But it is easily resolved if we know that this is written in Hebrew: A torrent passed through my soul. Concerning this torrent, Isaiah says: Behold, I will extend peace over them like a river, and the glory like a overflowing torrent (Isa. LXVI, 12). And in the thirty-fifth psalm, it is said about the saints: They will hope in the protection of your wings. They will be intoxicated with the abundance of your house, and you will give them to drink from the river of your delights; for with you is the fountain of life (Psal. XXXV, 8, 9). And on the hundred and twenty-fifth: Convert, O Lord, our captivity, like a stream in the South (Psalm 125:5). And about the Savior: He shall drink from the brook by the wayside (Psalm 110:7). For who among men can boast of having a pure heart? (Proverbs 20). Or whose mind, through the windows of the eyes, shall not be entered by the death of desire (Jeremiah 9), and, dare I say, the tickling of the soul? For the world is placed in the evil one (1 John 5:19), and from childhood the heart of man is inclined to evil, so that from the very beginning of his birth, not even for one day, is human condition without sin (Job 15). And David confesses in the psalm: Behold, I was conceived in iniquities, and in sins my mother conceived me (Ps. 50:7). Not in the iniquities of my mother, or certainly mine, but in the iniquities of human condition. Hence the Apostle says: Death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over those who did not sin in the likeness of Adam's transgression (Rom. 5:14). We use the term cubits, in the masculine gender and not neutral, according to the rule of grammarians, as I have taught in previous passages. We do this not out of ignorance, but out of custom for the sake of the simple and uneducated, among whom the majority is in the congregation of the Church.
