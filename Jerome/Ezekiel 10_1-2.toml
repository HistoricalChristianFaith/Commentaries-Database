(Chapter 10, Verses 1, 2) And I saw, and behold, in the firmament that was above the heads of the cherubim was as a sapphire stone: and the likeness of a throne appeared upon it. And he spoke to the man clothed with linen, and said: Enter between the wheels that are under the cherubim, and fill your hands with burning coals, which are between the cherubim, and scatter them over the city. Let it suffice to have said of the firmament that was above the cherubim, and of the sapphire stone that had the likeness of a throne, and of the wheels that accompanied the living creatures. Now concerning what is commanded to the man clothed with linen, for whom the Septuagint in this place have interpreted as a robe, to take the burning coals from among the cherubim and scatter or sprinkle them over the city, it seems to me that it signifies, after the slaughter and killing of many, and the corpses of the dead on the streets, the taking up of burning coals to punish or cleanse Jerusalem, according to what is written in Isaiah: He has made him holy in a burning fire, and it will consume like dry grass (Isa. 10:17). These are the coals which the Prophet, desiring to remedy the burning of his tongue, asks: What shall be given to you, and what shall be added for your deceitful tongue? Sharp arrows with desolating coals (Psalm 120:3, 4). And many similar passages we can find in the Holy Scriptures, of which we have often spoken. It is important to note only that in Isaiah, who had sinned so much in speech and claimed to have unclean lips, a coal is taken up with tongs for cleansing. But here, because the city was full of wickedness, and after punishments with the corpses of the dead, many coals of fire are taken up, and not with one hand, but with both, so that all of Jerusalem may be cleansed. Although it should also be understood that the taking up of burning coals is not for cleansing, but for punishment and torment, which are poured out over Jerusalem.
