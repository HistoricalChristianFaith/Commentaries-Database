(Verse 22 onward) So you will not fear, says the Lord, and you will not be in pain before me? (or will you fear?) I have set the sand as a boundary for the sea, an eternal decree that will not pass. And the waves of the sea will be disturbed, and they will not be able to pass through it. This people has become stubborn and rebellious in their heart: they have turned away and gone, and they have not said in their heart: Let us fear the Lord our God, who gives us rain in its season, both the early and the late rains, preserving the harvest for us. He narrates the benefits to accuse the ungrateful. 'Will you not fear me,' he says, 'who have bestowed such great favors upon you? I do not desire the love of the perfect, but the fear of beginners, who have set the shore as a boundary to the sea; who, by my command, have restrained the powerful element and the immense masses of waves, according to what is written: 'He has placed a boundary, and it shall not pass.' (Ps. 148:6) They hear and perceive me, who do not possess the capacity to hear; and my foolish people, having become foolish by their own fault, not only despise me, but also provoke the gentle God. They turned away from me, he said, and they turned their backs on me, and they left quickly; and their conscience did not withhold them, to say in their hearts: Let us fear him, who gives us temporary and late rain. Through all these things it shows the good abundance of the annual harvest, for which the first edition of the Aquila, and Symmachus, have interpreted as weeks. In Hebrew, it is written Sabaoth, which signifies both weeks and abundance due to the ambiguity of the word.
