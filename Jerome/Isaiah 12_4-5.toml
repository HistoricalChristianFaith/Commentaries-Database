(Verses 4, 5.) And you shall say on that day, confess the Lord and invoke His name: make His inventions known among the peoples: remember, for His name is exalted. Sing to the Lord, for He has done great things: announce this in all the earth. These things are commanded by the Apostles and the rest of Israel to those who believed from the Gentiles: that they alone confess the Lord, and forsaking idols, invoke His name: and proclaim all His works to the unbelievers; that they may know that He alone is exalted: to whom it is to be sung for His great deeds, and in all the earth His mercy is to be proclaimed.
