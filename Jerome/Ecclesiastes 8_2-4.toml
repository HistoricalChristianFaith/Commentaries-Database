"I
counsel you: Obey the king's command, and that in the manner of an oath of
God. Do not hasten to leave his
presence, do not persist in an evil thing; for he can do whatever he
pleases. Since a king's word is law, who
dare say to him, 'what are you doing?' "Here he seems to teach the same as the
apostle - that we should obey kings and rulers, which is set out in the
Septuagint as a command: "guard the command of the king"; but
personally I think he is now talking about that king about whom David says,
"Lord, the king will be happy in your virtue" [Ps. 20, 1.]. And in another passage, where it means the
one reign of the Father and of the Son, the text reads, "God, give your
judgement to the king, and your righteousness to the son of the king". [Tob. 12,7.] For the Father does not judge each one, but
gives each judgement to the Son. 
Moreover, that king who is the Son of God, is the son of the Father who
is the King. Therefore His precepts
should be kept, His will done. And this
is exactly what is written in the book of Tobit: "it is good to hide the
secret of the king" [Tob. 12,7]. He warns in particular why we should not ask
why God has taught every single thing, but see that teaching as a commandment,
and this is what an impious man hastens to fulfil. Then let his will be the same as that of
God's law. But because the Septuagint translates
this differently, saying, "do not hasten to run away from God's presence",
nor his judgement or his word, you must know that God's judgement is written in
the divine will. Therefore we ought not
to recount to anyone or make public this judgement, which is taken to be sacred
and secret from the word of God, nor should we form rash opinions from it. We should not, too, hasten like Moses, to see
the face of God, but rather wait a while until He Himself passes by and then we
will only see Him passing. Nor too
should we do what follows: do not persist in an evil thing, and so on,
especially as we understand, like one who has already come into the madness of
heresy, or as he, who although having faith in the Church, is still overcome by
sins, so that he is unfaithful. Do not
persevere in what is wrong, or in swearing, indulgence, greed, or lust. For if you do the king of vices and devil of
sins will fashion in you your end, and he will be able to do whatever he wants
with you.
