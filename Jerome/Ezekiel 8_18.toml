(Verse 18.) Therefore, I will also act in fury: My eye will not spare, nor will I have compassion. And when they cry out to my ears with a loud voice, I will not listen to them. Moreover, the following phrase, 'And when they cry out to my ears with a loud voice, I will not listen to them,' is not found in the Septuagint. For all the things they have done, I will act in fury and my eye will not spare, nor will I have compassion,' says the Lord. When the ancient heretics heard this, they falsely accused the Creator of being cruel and bloodthirsty; and they did not consider the Apostle Paul, who is certainly an apostle of the good God (as they claim), writing to the Corinthians, 'If I come again, I will not spare' (2 Corinthians 12:2), in order to discipline the wrongdoers with a rod and bring the wanderers back to salvation. For those who do not understand what is beneficial for themselves, and frequently pray for the opposite, it is expedient that they are not heard by the Lord. Hence, in the Lord's Prayer, we say: Thy will be done (Matt. VI, 10). Not our own will, which is accustomed to err: but Thy will, which knows the future. And sometimes it is of great happiness to not deserve mercy in the present. Therefore, the Lord will not spare those who are from the house of Judah and have departed from the confession of the Church. And when they cry out with a loud voice, about which the Lord has said: Their cry has come to me (Genesis XVIII): yet the Lord will not hear them, so that, being compelled by their evils, they may understand what they have done.
