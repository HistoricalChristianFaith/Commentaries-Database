And again: “I will reestablish my covenant with you, and you shall know that I am Lord, that you may remember and be confounded and may no more open your mouth because of your confusion, when I shall be pacified toward you for all that you have done, says the Lord God.” Thus it is clearly indicated by these divine words what was meant in another place by the statement “And though cleansing you he shall not make you innocent.” Even the just, being restored to their former state after committing sin, do not dare open their mouth but say with the apostle, “I am not worthy to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.”
