(Verse 9) And I will bring them upon this land and upon its inhabitants and upon all the nations around it. And I will destroy them and make them a horror, and a hissing, and an everlasting desolation. These are the rewards of those who despise and refuse to listen to the words of God. Therefore, whatever evil comes upon us, it is because of our sins. And all the nations were brought against Jerusalem in that way, just as they are brought against the negligent Church today, to destroy them and make them a horror, and a hissing, and an everlasting desolation, so that they may serve as an example and a wonder to all. But the hissing is a sign of a miracle and wonder; and eternal loneliness is found in those who do not have God as their guide.
