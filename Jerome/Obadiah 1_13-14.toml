(Verse 13, 14.) And you shall not despise them in their adversities on the day of their destruction, and you shall not send forth your army against them on the day of their destruction. And you shall not stand at the exits to kill those who flee, and you shall not capture the survivors on the day of their distress. LXX: And you shall not despise even their assembly on the day of their ruin, and you shall not put your strength against them on the day of their ruin. And you shall not stand at their retreats to kill those who have been saved from them, and you shall not capture their fugitives on the day of their trouble. When you yourself have been captured and destroyed by the Babylonian, among the other things that you have done, do not do the following: Do not despise or scorn your brother Jacob on the day of his devastation; do not join the army of the Babylonians or fail to send against the army of Judah when it has been defeated by the enemy and turns its back. And when they start fleeing along their familiar paths, detours, and roads leading to the wilderness, do not stand at the crossroads or wait for them at the intersections to kill those who have been set free and to release the others who have been captured; and either you yourself will be captured or you will keep watch over the captives of the enemy. We have said these things according to history: for we must briefly grasp the clearer things, and proceed to those which are obscure. Who despises the ecclesiastics of heretics? Who does not rejoice in their misfortunes, if at any time they are handed over to persecution due to the sins of the people, and many, either weak in faith or sown on stony ground, fall into denial? You may see them rejoicing, finding pleasure, considering our downfall as their own victory: to such an extent that they join with the nations, and a more furious persecution arises, either from the Jews or from those who pretend to be our brothers and are considered by the same name. And when someone, whether by flight or by repentance, has escaped, they stand in the byways and propose sophisms and testimonies, as if they were presenting them from the Scriptures: so that, worn out and exhausted, they offer stitched pillows and place them under every elbow. And thus it happens that those who perhaps have overcome persecution either by strength or by fear, deceived by false teachings, are held again in the prison of errors, and this tribulation becomes much worse than that which was from the Gentiles; for it is easier to free someone captured by pagans than one entrapped by the tricks of heretics.
