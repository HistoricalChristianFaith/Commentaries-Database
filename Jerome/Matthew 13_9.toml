For it must be considered, that the multitude could not enter into the house to Jesus, nor be there where the Apostles heard mysteries; therefore the Lord in mercy to them departed out of the house, and sat near the sea of this world, that great numbers might be gathered to Him, and that they might hear on thesea shore what they were not worthy to hear within; “And great multitudes were gathered unto him, so that he went into a ship, and sat down, and all the people stood on the shore.”.
And it is to be noted, that He spake not all things to them in parables, but "many things,” for had He spoken all things in parables, the people would have departed without benefit. He mingles things plain with things dark, that by those things which they understand they may be incited to get knowledge of the things they understand not. The multitude also is not of one opinion, but of divers wills in divers matters, whence He speaks to them in many parables, that each according to their several dispositions may receive some portion of His teaching.
By this sower is typified the Son of God, who sows among the people the word of the Father.
This parable Valentinus lays hold of to establish his heresy, bringing in three different natures; the spiritual, the natural or the animal, and the earthly. But there are here four named, one by the wayside, one stony, one thorny, and afourth the good ground.
And we are excited to the understanding of His words, by the advice which follows, “He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.”
