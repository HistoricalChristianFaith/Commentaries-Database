Holy writ warns us to partake of the feast prudently when we have been invited to dine at the table of a rich man. I might say that a rich manâ€™s table of Scripture has been laid before us. We enter a meadow filled with flowers; here the rose blushes; there the lilies glisten white; everywhere flowers abound in all varieties.
