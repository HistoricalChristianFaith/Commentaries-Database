(Verse 13) And Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel heard, and Joshua son of Jehozadak the high priest, and all the remnant of the people, the voice of their God (the Vulgate adds 'the Lord') and the words of the prophet Haggai, as the Lord their God had sent him to them. And the people feared before the Lord's presence. Pay close attention, because of the two understandings of the Savior in Zerubbabel as leader and Joshua as priest (for he is both king and priest), that it did not say Zerubbabel and Joshua feared, but when Zerubbabel and Joshua and the people heard the words of the prophet Haggai, which are the words of the Lord, only the people feared before the Lord's presence, that is, only the multitude, which had not yet come together into one complete man, nor deserved to be united to the Spirit what the Spirit is. But the people were afraid of the face of the Lord, knowing that the face of the Lord is against those who do evil, to cut off their memory from the earth (Psalm 34).

(Verse 13.) And the messenger of the Lord, Haggai, said to the people: I am with you, says the Lord. Some believe that both John the Baptist and Malachi, who is interpreted as the Angel of the Lord, and Haggai, whom we now have in our hands, were angels and that by the dispensation and command of God they assumed human bodies and lived among men. It is not surprising that this is believed about angels, since for our salvation even the Son of God assumed a human body. And for this reason, they also provide testimony from the apocrypha, where it is said: Jacob, who was later called Israel, was an angel and therefore he supplanted his brother in the womb of his mother (Gen. 25 and 32). And also John, at the voice of Mary the mother of the Lord, leaped for joy in the womb of Elizabeth (Luke 1); and that there is one nature of all rational beings; and for this reason, men who have pleased God become equal to angels. Let them feel this. However, let us receive simply what the announcer of the Lord, that is, the angel, who is called Malachi in Hebrew, has said as a prophet, because he has announced the will of God to the people, either because in many places our Lord and Savior is called the angel of God, as in this passage: The Angel of Great Counsel (Isaiah 9:6), we say has prefigured the Savior in Haggai. Furthermore, what he says, the messenger of the Lord, concerning the messages of the Lord, is like he was saying, a prophet about prophets. What he says, the messenger of the Lord speaking to the people, saying: 'I am with you,' says the Lord, does not speak to Zerubbabel and Joshua, with whom and in whom the Lord always was (for once we said that they should be understood according to various interpretations as the person of the Savior), but to the people who had feared the face of the Lord. For the people were not yet close to the love of God, which casts out fear. Therefore, the people receive reward for the fear of God, so that the Lord may be with them, and there is the understanding: I will be your helper, build my house, which is destroyed in you: I will place myself in your midst, no one will be able to hinder your construction.
