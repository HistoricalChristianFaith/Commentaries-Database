"The fool
folds his hands and eats his own flesh." This is the man that is described as slow to
comprehend in Proverbs [Cfr Prov. 19, 24.],
holding his chest in his hands. For
poverty, although he is a fast runner, catches up with him and he eats his own
flesh because of the extent of his hunger, but this is said in
exaggeration. He is the sort of man who
thinks that having one fist of corn and living idly and in a stupor is better
than filling each hand by working. But
he sows everything so that he can show that he that both works and acquires
possessions leaves himself open in the world to envy. Conversely he that desires to live a simple
life is oppressed by poverty and because of this both of these two is poor:
while the one runs a risk on account of his wealth, the other is consumed by
want because of his poverty. Or indeed
perhaps it is to be understood in this way: he who envies the happiness of
another man is seized as if by the fury of the spirit, and takes envy into his
lap, and nourishes it in his heart: thus it is he eats his soul and his
flesh. For as much as he sees that man
whom he envies as happier, he himself more so wastes away and perishes, and
little by little becomes more full of envy and jealousy. Another way of reading this is: his hands are
taken on many occasions to lead him to work, just as the passage which states,
"the act of the Lord which is done in the hand of Haggai" [Hagg. 1, 1.],
or of Ecclesiastes, or of his prophet, because he has done such work, that he
appears to be worthy, in whose work is the speech of the Lord. And the man, who corresponds to this man is
David, "who leads my hands in battle" [Ps. 143, 1.]. Therefore the fool embraces his hands, that
is he draws them together and doesn't want to open them, and so does not eat
the toil of his hands, which he does not have, but his flesh, living by the
wisdom of his flesh and eating the toil of his flesh.
