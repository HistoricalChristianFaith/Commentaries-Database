(Verse 21.) Arabia and all the princes of Kedar, they themselves the merchants of your hand, came to you with lambs and rams and goats. For the lambs, rams, and goats, they interpreted seventy camels and rams and lambs. But Arabia and the princes of Kedar (which today is the land of the Saracens, as is fully proven in the words of Jeremiah, who writes against Kedar) abound in these animals, namely lambs and rams and goats, and they increase the commerce of Tyre with this importation (Jeremiah 49). But also a very fertile region of the camels is due to the breadth of pastures, and the temperate air which this animal enjoys. Arabia is interpreted as 'evening', and Cedar as 'darkness'. Concerning which regions, it is said in the Psalms: 'I have dwelt with them that hate peace: when I spake unto them, they fought against me without a cause.' (Psalm 120:7). These regions supply the city of Tyre with camels, burdened with the weight of heavy sins, either lambs or rams or goats, which they sacrifice on their altars, which they have fashioned from a wicked and rebellious heart. But even in this same passage, we read in the vision of the shepherds that rams disturb the purest waters, and push the sheep with their sides, and fight with their horns (Ezekiel 34); also goats, which are accustomed to stand on the left, and lambs that pretend to be a lamb (Matthew 25); of whom it is written: Behold the Lamb of God, behold him who takes away the sins of the world (John 1:29). But Isaiah writes favorably about camels (Isaiah 60), from Midian, which is interpreted as the judgement of the Lord, coming to Jerusalem, and Ephah, and rams from Nebaioth, and Sheba bringing gold and frankincense: the last two of which are also offered to the Lord by the Magi (Matthew 2). And so, camels with the burden of sins can enter the narrow and tight path that leads to life (Matthew VII and XIX).
