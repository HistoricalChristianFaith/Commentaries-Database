"Ephraim likes to tread his grain, as a trained cow; and I passed over his beauty in the hill and climbed over Ephraim: Judah will plow; Jacob will break up the land for himself." LXX: "Ephraim is a cow" (or "heifer:" for what is called Egla in Hebrew means both a calf and heifer), so "Ephraim is a trained cow that loves to thresh; but I will come over his beautiful hill; I will set upon Ephraim, and Judah will be silent. Jacob will again be strengthened." This passage, indeed, all that follows in this chapter, is involved in great obscurity. Therefore, both we who strive to explain, and the wise reader who pays attention, so that we may be able to investigate not the truth, which is very difficult, but at least the suspicion of what is probable. Divine language has this custom of expressing truth through allegory and metaphor in history. Therefore, Ephraim is like a cow or a young cow that learned from its youth to tread the area, and to pull iron wheels over heaps of crops, so that chaff could be separated from the grain; and not only did he learn, but began to love excessively what he was taught. And I," he said, "passed over the beauty of its hill. The Hebrew word Abarthi, that is, "I passed over," especially when said by God, always signifies wounds and adversity. Finally even the destroyer in Egypt is said to have passed over. Therefore, because Ephraim loves to graze in the area like a cow or calf, "I," he said, "passed over the beauty of its hill," and tamed the swelling necks with a yoke imposed. Why should I mention the yoke of the Law? I myself ascended upon it, and while I was working, Judas, that is, two tribes began to cleave the fields with a plow and recline the earth into furrows. However, carrying the yoke of Ephraim, and tilling, he broke the furrows for Jacob. Here we understand by the distinction of Israel and Judah that there were twelve tribes: they began to break the clods with plows ("Al." harrows), and to break apart the earth so that, softened, it may receive seeds and that, after a short time, fertile crops may sprout. For 'threshing floor' or 'area of contention,' the Septuagint translated, and the sense is: Because Ephraim does not want to receive the yoke of the Law, I will cross over and ascend on the beauty of his hill; for the contentious cow and the lustful labor which she does not want to do. But Judah will plow his own land willingly, because he has the temple and remains in the Law, so that all twelve tribes will eagerly prepare fields for planting. And what follows alongside the same Septuagint; 'I will place Ephraim on top and Judah will be silenced, Jacob will be strengthened for himself,' the sense here may be: I will impose captivity on Ephraim, who is contentious and does not want to bear the burden of the Law. But I shall momentarily leave Judah and say nothing more about him: whoever keeps my commands as well in Ephraim as in Judah, he shall be strengthened, and shall be called Jacob. According to interpretation, it can be said that Ephraim, who was learned in the law of God, to plough the field of Scripture, and to meditate in it day and night, began to love contention and to cast off the yoke of the Law, and to contend against the ecclesiastics in the subversion of those who hear. Therefore the Lord shall press upon him who raises his head and promises himself great things, either by the yoke or by passing by and treading underfoot, and shall ascend over him, so that he may know that he has the Lord. But Judas, that is, the Ecclesiasticus, will plow, persevering in the work begun. Whether he says, "I will retain Judas," for it is not those who are healthy who require a physician, but those who are ill. (Luke 5) But Jacob, who is interpreted as "supplanter," and daily supplants vices and sins, and receives his brother's birthright, and is heir to his father's possession, and sleeps in Bethel, which is interpreted as "house of God," will break up furrows and clods, so that the soft soil may receive the thrown seed, and make one hundred measures of barley, or, as it is held in Hebrew, a hundredfold. For it is unbelievable that the patriarch Isaac strove for barley and not wheat. Even today, the holy man Jacob breaks the clods of history and the hardness of letters into parts and divides them spiritually so that they may produce spiritual fruits. Indeed, we read that the Lord Himself did this, that he broke the five loaves of bread from the Law into fragments, which the people could not eat whole, in order to give them to the believers to eat by the hands of the apostles (Luke 9). But he says according to the Septuagint, "Jacob shall be strengthened to himself," showing that he who labors labors for himself, that he may obtain eternal fruits.
