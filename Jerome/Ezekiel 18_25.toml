(Verse 25.) And you said: The way of the Lord is not fair. Hear, O house of Israel: Is not my way fair? Are not your ways unfair? Give reasons why the judgment of the Lord is just. Do you think, he says, that I am unfair, that I will render the sins of the fathers to the children (Deut. 24); and while others eat sour grapes, will the teeth of others be set on edge (Jerem. 31)? Behold, each person dies in their own sin, and is made alive in their own righteousness. In both cases, judgment is not based on the past, but on the present. Rather, your unjust opinion is that you think a parable is not a parable, but you understand it in such a way that the sins of others are punished in others as if it were the truth of a story.
