(Chapter XXXIII, Verse 1 and following) And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: Son of man, speak to the children of your people and say to them: When I bring a sword upon a land and the people of the land take one man from among them and make him their watchman, and he sees the sword coming upon the land and blows the trumpet and warns the people, then whoever hears the sound of the trumpet and does not take warning, if the sword comes and takes him away, his blood shall be upon his own head. He heard the sound (or voice) of the trumpet, and did not pay attention, his blood shall be upon himself: but if he takes heed, he shall save his soul. But if the watchman sees the sword coming, and does not blow the trumpet; and the people are not warned, and the sword comes and takes any person from among them, he is taken away in his iniquity; but his blood I will require at the watchman's hand. And you, son of man, I have made you a watchman for the house of Israel. Therefore hear from my mouth the word, and proclaim it to them from me. If I say to the wicked, wicked one, you shall surely die, and you do not speak to warn the wicked to turn from his way, that wicked person shall die in his iniquity, but his blood I will require at your hand. But if you warn the wicked to turn from his way, and he does not turn from his way, he shall die in his iniquity, but you will have delivered your soul. Once again, the word of the Lord came to the prophet, who had been silent for some time because neither the prophet nor human frailty can bear a constant and continuous prophecy. And he speaks the same things that are contained in the previous verses. Son of man, I have made you a watchman for the house of Israel, and you will hear a word from my mouth, and you will warn them from me. If I say to the wicked, 'You shall surely die,' and you have not warned him, nor spoken to warn the wicked to turn from his wicked way and live, the wicked shall die in his iniquity; but his blood I will require at your hand. And even if you warn the wicked, and he does not turn from his wickedness and his evil ways, he will die in his iniquity, but you have delivered your soul. If you carefully consider, you will understand that they are indeed similar, but not the same, as they disagree in many things. And in all Holy Scriptures we must observe this, where there seems to be a similarity in the sentiment, not all things are said in the same way: but many things are either subtracted or added, and there is a reason for the discrepancy between the words of individuals. And meanwhile, before we come to deeper matters, a brief statement must be explained. If a watchman is appointed among the people to announce the coming sword of the Lord's wrath, and if, when he announces it, the people refuse to listen, the watchman will be free, and the one who is oppressed by the sword will bear the guilt of his own blood: but if he hears and saves himself. But if the watchman does not blow the trumpet, and the ignorant people do not observe the approaching sword, the people will indeed die in their iniquity, but I will require the blood of the dying from the hand of the watchman. And in order for the prophet Ezekiel to know that the general dispute concerned him in particular, He said to him, 'And you, son of man, have not been appointed as a watchman for the land and the people of the land, as I have already said, but you have been appointed as a watchman for the house of Israel. Therefore, if when I say to the wicked, 'You shall surely die,' you do not speak to warn him, that he may turn from his wicked way to save his life, his blood shall be upon you. But if you warn the wicked, and he does not turn from his wickedness, or from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity, but you have delivered your soul.' But if you announce and command the wicked to turn away from their worst ways, and they refuse to do so: they will indeed die in their iniquity; but you will deliver your soul from the death brought on by negligence. From these words we learn that a person, no matter how wicked and impious, can be saved from their wickedness if they hear the words of the teacher and repent. The teacher also faces a danger if they refuse to teach, either out of fear or despair of the sinner's fate. The teacher is guilty of shedding the blood of the one who could have been saved and rescued from death if the teacher had not remained silent, and in both cases the free will of the person is preserved, as it is up to the teacher to choose whether to speak or remain silent, and up to the listener to choose whether to listen, act and be saved, or to ignore and perish through their own disdain. And immediately it does not follow that because the prophet predicts, what he predicted will come. For he does not predict so that it may come, but so that it may not come. And because God speaks, it is not necessary for what he threatens to happen, but he threatens so that the one to whom he threatens may be converted to repentance, and what is future does not happen if the words of the Lord are despised. However, we can discuss this passage in three ways: as the land that appoints a watchman for itself, either according to the literal sense, that is, the land of Judea, or according to the spiritual interpretation, the Church, which often chooses a watchman for the last things of its people, namely the one whom the Apostle, writing to the Corinthians, takes as a judge (1 Corinthians 15), or certainly the soul of the believer, which sets its mind and reason above the people and crowd of its thoughts, so that it does not accept all the incentives of thoughts, but judges and discerns what should be followed by itself and what should be avoided. A watchman of the land of Judea, either a king, or a prophet: a watchman of the Church, either a bishop, or a presbyter, because he is chosen by the people, and knowing the reading of the Scriptures, and foreseeing what is to come, he announces to the people and corrects the wrongdoer. Therefore, it is greatly to be feared that we approach this office unworthy and chosen by the people, giving ourselves to neglect and idleness: and what is worse, serving pleasures, the belly, and laziness, we think that we have received honor, not ministry. For indeed the Son of Man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister (Matthew 20:28); and he washed the disciples' feet (John 13), to show that all filth and vices must be washed and purged from the masters in the disciples. Let us not immediately answer what profit is it to teach, if the hearer is unwilling to do what you have taught? For each one is judged according to his own mind and duty. If you have not spoken, he, if he has disregarded listening. Salomon speaks about negligent magistrates: Hidden wisdom and hidden treasure, what is the use for both? What does this signify in the Gospel (Mark 9) as well, that whoever scandalizes one of the least of the Church, it is expedient for him to be tied around his neck with a millstone of a donkey and be cast into the deep, rather than being placed on a high watchtower where he can harm many.
