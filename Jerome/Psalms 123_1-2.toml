What does he mean then by saying, “for he must reign until he has put all enemies under his feet”? Is the Lord to reign only until his enemies begin to be under his feet, and once they are under his feet will he cease to reign? Of course his reign will then commence in its fullness when his enemies begin to be under his feet. David also in the fourth Song of Ascents speaks thus, “Behold, as the eyes of servants look to the hand of their master, as the eyes of a maiden unto the hand of her mistress, so our eyes look to the Lord our God, until he has mercy on us.” Will the prophet, then, look to the Lord until he obtains mercy, and when mercy is obtained will he turn his eyes down to the ground, although elsewhere he says, “My eyes fail, looking for your salvation, and for your righteous promise”? I could accumulate countless instances of this usage and cover the verbosity of our assailant12 with a cloud of proofs; I shall, however, add only a few and leave the reader to find similar ones for himself.
