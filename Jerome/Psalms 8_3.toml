The psalmist is speaking here of the frailty of the body and of human weakness, and what does he say? If you consider his flesh, what is a person? If you consider his spirit, he is noble. Let us by no means scorn the flesh, but let us reject its works. Let us not despise the body that will reign in heaven with Christ. “Flesh and blood can obtain no part in the kingdom of God”; no, not flesh and blood of themselves, but the works of the flesh. “Flesh and blood can obtain no part in the kingdom of God.” How, then, are they going to reign together with Christ; how shall we be seated together in heaven in Christ?
