In mount Zion, there will be salvation, and it will be holy and possess the house of Jacob, those who possess it. And the house of Jacob will be a fire, and the house of Joseph a flame, and the house of Esau straw. They will set them on fire and consume them, and there will be no survivors in the house of Esau, for the Lord has spoken. The Septuagint version: In mount Zion there will be salvation, and it will be holy, and possess the house of Jacob, those who possess it. And the house of Jacob will be a fire, and the house of Joseph a flame, but the house of Esau will be stubble; they will set them on fire and consume them. There will be no survivor for the house of Esau, for the LORD has spoken. The land of Edom will be a devastation; every ally will plunder it and there will be no survivors from it, for the LORD has spoken. The survivors of the house of Jacob will possess the land of Mount Zion. There will be deliverance and holiness, and the house of Jacob will possess their inheritance. The LORD Himself will return to the temple, which He had previously forsaken because of their sins, or it will be completely holy, that is, the Holy of Holies. And the house of Jacob shall possess Zorobabel, and Esdras, and Nehemiah, those who have inherited. And the house of Jacob, that is, Judah, shall be fire, and the house of Joseph, that is, the ten tribes, shall be flame. For from Joseph was born Ephraim, from which tribe the kingdom of Samaria arose; but the house of Esau, that is, the Edomites, who were so fierce and cruel against their brother, shall be turned into stubble. And just as fire and flame quickly devour stubble, so the two kingdoms under the rod of one alliance, according to the book of Ezekiel (Ezek. XVII), shall lay waste to Edom and consume it, and there shall be no remnant of the people who can announce the overthrow of their adversaries to neighboring nations. This is indeed what the LXX translated as πυροφόρον, which we render as Frumentarium, according to the language of ancient discourse; for they called those who are now called Agentes in rebus or Veredarios, the Ancient Frumentarios. But it is better to follow the Hebrew itself, that is, Sarid (), which means either remaining, according to Aquila, or escaping, according to Symmachus, or according to Theodotion and the fifth edition, residue. But all these things will be done because the Lord has spoken, and what He has commanded, He has done. Otherwise: With the works of the flesh destroyed, and the earthly rule laid waste, there will be salvation in the Church for those who have not come forth from their mother. And in her will dwell the holy one, of whom it is said in Isaiah: Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God of hosts (Isaiah 6:3), for both the one who sanctifies and those who are sanctified are from one. And the house of the supplanter Jacob will possess those who had possessed themselves as heirs, making Christians out of the persecutors, and receiving even the Edomites into the faith of the Church. But the house of Esau will be turned into stubble. And just as fire cannot sustain the proximity of straw, so the argument of Jacob, which is inflamed by the word of the Lord, cannot be sustained: for the words of the Lord are tested by fire (Ps. 17:31), and the flame of Joseph, who is interpreted as 'increase' (Gen. 37), because he was sold to his brothers and fed the people in Egypt, will not be able to sustain the house of Esau: but at the first encounter, their sophisms will be turned to nothing. And they will be devoured for their own salvation, according to what is said in the blessing of Isaac to Esau: 'But I have made him your lord, and have subjected all his brothers to him as his servants: and with grain also will you serve your brother' (Gen. 27:37). And there shall be no remnant of the house of Esau, when all things shall bow to Christ, of those in heaven and on earth, and under the earth (Philippians 2), and all things shall be subjected to him, so that God may be all in all. But because Esau had built upon the foundation of Christ with hay, wood, and straw (1 Corinthians 3): therefore the house of Jacob and Joseph shall be turned into fire and flame, imitating their Lord who says: I am a consuming fire (Deuteronomy 4:24), so that the pure wheat may be gathered into the barns after the chaff of sinners is consumed. All the things we have said, and all the things we are about to say, the Jews promise for themselves in the future, when they will accept the Antichrist instead of Christ, fulfilling the prophecy of the Lord Savior: 'I came in the name of my Father, and you did not receive me: if another comes in his own name, you will receive him' (John 5:43). And whatever we have interpreted against Edom, they dream against the Roman kingdom: what we say is either already fulfilled according to history under Zorobabel, or certainly according to prophecy, and mystical understandings happen daily in the Church, and are fulfilled in the kingdom of the soul against the flesh, in each individual. But we say that the frumentarium, according to the allegory, ceases among heretics when there is no one among them who boasts of having the grain of wheat, which is dead in the earth, and the bread from heaven. There are those who think that it is not πυρφόρον, that is, frumentarium, but πυρφόρον, that is, one who can carry a little fire, as translated by the Seventy. Therefore, agreeing with the various interpretations, we will say according to the allegory that not only the frumentarium will cease among heretics, but also the one who pretends to have the light of Christ. For even Satan disguises himself as an angel of light (2 Corinthians 11).
