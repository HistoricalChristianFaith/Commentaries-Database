(v. 20) And to all the kings of the land of the Philistines, and to Ascalon, Gaza, Accaron, and the rest of Azotus. He generally placed the Philistines, that is, the land of the Palestinians, and specifically their cities Ascalon, Gaza, Accaron, and Azotus; he only remained silent about Gath, which is included in the rest. For this is what is written: And the rest of Azotus: for it is near and adjacent to Azotus, which in Hebrew is called Esdod, the region of the city of Gath. But Isaiah writes that the Palestinians were captured and devastated by the Babylonians.
