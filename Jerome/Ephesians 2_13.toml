quote='''
God in his entirety is everywhere. Who can be separated from him when all things are in him?… He is, however, said to be far away from the unrighteous, according to Proverbs [15:29].… Just as far as the unrighteous are away from him, so close is he to the saints. Just when God seemed to be furthest from the Ephesians, he was coming close to them by the blood of Jesus.
