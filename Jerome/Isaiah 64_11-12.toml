We can correlate this “temple of our sanctification and our glory, in which our ancestors praised you,” with the church or to the soul of a holy person, which can rightly be called beautiful or a vision of peace, when the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit dwell within it.

If, however, Zion is abandoned by the Lord due to wickedness, either ours or the people’s, a conflagration of the devil’s fiery arrows will appear immediately. For all are adulterers, with hearts like burning ovens. With the frigidity of shame expelled, the flame of desire will rage in the temple of God, such that whatever within us that was once glorious and brilliant will corrupt, be destroyed and perish. Then what was said in the Psalms will be fulfilled: “They consumed your sanctuary with fire, they profaned the tabernacle of your name to the ground.” And this fire can be extinguished only by him from whose heart flows rivers of living water.
