(Ver. 29.) And behold, his brother came out, and said, why is the wall divided because of you? And he called his name Phares. Concerning the wall, Aquila and Symmachus translated it as division, which in Hebrew is called Phares (). Therefore, he received the name of division because he divided the curtain of the second (also called placenta). Hence the Pharisees, who had separated themselves as if they were righteous from the people, were called the divided ones.
