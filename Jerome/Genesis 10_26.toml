(Verse 26.) Jectan begat Helmodad, and Saleph, and Asermoth, and Jare, and Aduram, and Uzal, and Decla, Ebal, Abimael, Seba, Ophir, Evila, and Jobab. I could not find the names of the twelve other nations; but up to the present time, because they are far from us, or because they are called by different names, or because they have been changed, they are unknown. However, they possessed the whole region of India, which is called Hieria, from the river Cophene.
