(Verse 31.) In my fury and indignation, this city has become a ruin from the day it was built until this day when it is taken away from my sight. From the time when the foundations of the city were laid until this day, when it was captured, burned, and taken away from the Lord's presence, it has always been in fault and has provoked the Lord's indignation against itself. Where is the peace of sinners (as we have often said)?
