Elijah lived a virgin life; so also did Elisha and many of the sons of the prophets. To Jeremiah the command came: “You will not take a wife.” He had been sanctified in his mother’s womb, and now he was forbidden to take a wife because the captivity was near. The apostle gives the same counsel in different words: “I think, therefore, that this is good by reason of the present distress, namely, that it is good for a person to be as he is.” What is this distress that does away with the joys of wedlock? The apostle tells us, in a later verse: “The time is short. It remains that those who have wives be as though they had none.” - "Letter 22.21"
