(Verse 25.) However, during the fourth watch of the night, he came to them, walking on the sea. Military stations and night watches are divided into three-hour intervals. Therefore, when he says that the Lord came to them during the fourth watch of the night, it indicates that they were in danger throughout the entire night, and in the last part of the night, and at the end of the world, he will provide them with help.
