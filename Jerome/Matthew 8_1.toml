(Chapter 8, Verse 1) When Jesus had come down from the mountain, many crowds followed him, and behold, a leper came and knelt before him, saying, 'Lord, if you will, you can make me clean.' When the Lord came down from the mountain, crowds gathered, for they were unable to ascend to higher places. And the leper was the first to meet him. For he had not yet been able to hear the Savior's message about the leprosy while on the mountain. And it should be noted that he was the first to be cured, specifically: second, the centurion's servant; third, Peter's mother-in-law, who had a fever; and in the fourth place, those who were brought to him possessed by demons, whose spirits he cast out with a word, when he healed all who were ill. And behold, a leper came and knelt before him, saying, 'Lord, if you will, you can make me clean.'
