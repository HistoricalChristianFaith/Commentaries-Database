"In the
day of prosperity be joyful, but in the day of adversity consider: God also has
set the one over against the other, to the end that man should find nothing
after him. "I have heard from a certain man in the
Church, who was thought to have a knowledge of the Scriptures, that these
verses are to be explained in this way: while you remain in the present world,
and while you are able to do good work, work hard so that afterwards you may be
without worry in the day of wickedness, that is the day of judgement, when you
will see others to be tormented.  For
just as God made the present world, in which we can obtain for ourselves the
benefits of good work; so too he made the future age, in which no opportunity
will be given for us to do good work. 
This man of the Church even seemed to convince those he was preaching
to, but to me there seems a different meaning to this, which Symmachus has
translated, saying, 'in the good day, be good; but be wary of the day of
wickedness'. All the same, God made this
world similar to the next, so that man should not be able to find that which he
complains against Him. Suffer both the
good things, he says, and the bad, as they happen to you in your life. And do not think that there is only the
nature of good or bad alone in the world, especially when the world itself consists
of opposites: hot and cold, dry and wet, hard and soft, dark and light, bad and
good.  [Cfr Ovid, Meta. I.19-20.] But God made this ambivalence so that wisdom
might have a place, and it is found by choosing good and avoiding bad: man is
given free will, lest he argue that he has been made unfeeling, and stupid by
God. But God has made man so diverse
that man is unable to complain of his manner of being. At the same time this argument is to be taken
with the previous verses, in which he says 'who is able to correct what God has
done?'.
