(Verse 11.) Blessed are you when people revile you and persecute you and utter all kinds of evil against you falsely on my account. That curse should be despised which brings about blessedness, which is uttered falsely by the mouth of the reviler. Hence, it specially defined what blessed cursing is: every curse uttered against you falsely on my account. Therefore, where Christ is the cause, there also the desired cursing is.
