Now the fig tree withered from the roots is the synagogue withered from Cain, and the rest, from whom allthe blood from Abel up to Zechariah is required.
Peter perceives the dry root, which is cut off, and has been replaced by the beautiful and fruitful olive, called by the Lord. Wherefore it goes on: “And Peter calling to remembrance saith unto Him, Master, behold, the fig tree which Thou cursedst is withered away.”.
Christ then who is the mountain, which grew from the stone, cut out without hands, is taken up and cast into the sea, when the Apostles with justice say, Let us turn ourselves toother nations, since ye judged yourselves unworthy of hearing the word of God.
Mark has, as he is wont,expressed seven verses of the Lord’s prayer in one prayer. But what can he, whose sins are all forgiven, require more, save that he may persevere in what has been granted unto him.
