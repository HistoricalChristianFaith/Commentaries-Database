(Chapter 45, verses 10 and following) 'A fair balance and a fair ephah and a fair bath shall be for you. The ephah and the bath shall be of the same measure, so that the bath may contain a tenth part of a homer, and the ephah a tenth part of a homer: their measure shall be according to the homer. Now a shekel has twenty obols. Furthermore, twenty shekels, and twenty-five shekels, and fifteen shekels make a mina.' LXX: A just balance, a just measure, and a just dry measure shall you have: the dry measure shall be a choenix, and a choenix shall be the same as a homer. The tenth part of a homer shall be a choenix, and the tenth part of a homer shall be an ephah. A homer shall be equal to twenty obols in weight. Twenty shekels, twenty-five shekels, and fifteen shekels shall be a mina for you.» This passage in the LXX does not cohere, and cannot be entirely understood, since not only have they changed the numbers of the measures, but also the names. For they have interpreted pro ephi as a measure, a general term for a specific one, and for bato choenica: for homer also Hebrew, which is called κόρος in Greek, they translated as gomor: and again for bato choenica. Let us therefore speak according to the Hebrew and the letter, and let us explain more clearly what seems to us, individually. The balance, which is called Mozene in Hebrew (), is understood as those which are attached. The ephah, which is corruptly called Ἔφι in the Greek language, pertains to the measure of various grains, for example, wheat, barley, legumes. Furthermore, a batus, which in Hebrew is called Bath, is the same measure as the ephi, and is used only for liquids, such as wine and oil, and the like. It holds thirty modios, both in the dry and liquid measure. The tenth part of a cor in those things which are measured by the modius is called epha, that is, three modii; and the tenth part of a cor in liquid measures is called Batus or Vadus, so that epha and batus are of the same measure. Furthermore, the coin called στατὴρ in Greek has twenty obols. But the weight called mna has sixty siclos, which makes twelve hundred obols. However, it should not confuse the reader that there are twenty siclos, twenty-five siclos, and fifteen siclos in a mina. For the difficulty lies in the numbers, to focus the attention of the listener. Hence, many things are said in parables and riddles, so that those who have ears to hear may hear. And all prophecy contains truth in obscurity, so that the disciples may hear from within: the common and lowly people, positioned outside, may not know what is said. Therefore, divine Scripture commands that the weights be just, saying: You shall not have in your bag two kinds of weights, a large one and a small one: a true and just balance shall be yours, and a true and just measure shall be yours (Leviticus 19:36). And in Proverbs it is said: Both a large and a small weight are an abomination in the sight of God (Proverbs 11:1). Indeed, this should be observed not only in commerce and in the use of everyday life, but in all things justice must be preserved, as the Scripture says: 'You shall make a balance and weights for your words' (Eccl. 28:23), so that in both words and deeds and thoughts, we may do everything with proper measure and reason. However, we read in another place that 'to him who is faithful, the whole world of riches belongs', and for him who is unfaithful, not even an obolus remains (Prov. 17:6 LXX). In other words, he said: The unbeliever possesses nothing in the world: but even the smallest portion is needed. Regarding this, in other words, it is said in the Gospel: He shall not depart from there until he pays the last farthing (Matt. 5:26), that is, even the last and least coin. We read of ten minas given to each servant to trade with (Luke 19); and in another parable, talents divided among servants; and a debtor of five hundred denarii, and fifty (Matt. 25); and the vineyard workers who each receive a denarius (Luke 7); and the widow who had lost a drachma and found it only by lighting a lamp (Matt. 20, Luke 15). To discuss all of these things and their meaning is not of this time.
