What is the gate that is always closed, through which only the Lord God of Israel enters? Surely it is that about which the Savior spoke in the Gospel: “Woe to you scribes and Pharisees, woe to you teachers of the law, woe to you who hold the key of knowledge. You do not enter yourselves, and you prevent those who would from entering.” Isaiah wrote about the same thing, using the metaphor of a book: “The words of this book are like sealed words; when you give them to a man who cannot read and tell him to read, he will respond: ‘I don’t know how to read.’ And they will give it to a man who is able to read and tell him to read and he will say: ‘I cannot read because it is sealed.’ ” This is the same book whose seal no one can break and open either in heaven or on earth or under the earth, except the one about whom John said in the Apocalypse: “Behold, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the root and race of David, has conquered so that he can open the book and break its seal.” Before the Savior assumed a human body and humbled himself, taking the form of a servant, the law was closed, the prophets were closed, all knowledge of the Scriptures was closed, and paradise was closed. After he had hung on the cross, however, and said to the thief, “Today you will be with me in paradise,” immediately the veil of the temple was cut and everything was opened. And once the veil has been removed, we will say, “But we all contemplate the glory of the Lord with unveiled face and are being transformed into his very image from glory to glory.”

He who had revealed manifold truth to Daniel now signifies that the things he has said are matters of secrecy. And he orders him to roll up the scroll containing his words and set a seal upon the book, with the result that many shall read it and inquire as to its fulfillment in history, differing in their opinions because of its great obscurity. And as for the statement, “Many shall pass over” or “go through,” this indicates that it will be read by many people. For it is a familiar expression to say, “I have gone through a book,” or “I have passed through an historical account.” Indeed this is the idea that Isaiah also expressed in regard to the obscurity of his own book: “And the sayings of that book shall be like the words of a book that is sealed.”

In the Apocalypse a book is shown sealed with seven seals, which if you deliver to one that is learned saying, “Read this,” he will answer you, “I cannot, for it is sealed.” How many there are today who fancy themselves learned, yet the Scriptures are a sealed book to them, and one which they cannot open save through him who has the key of David, “he that opens and no man shuts; and shuts and no man opens.” In the Acts of the Apostles the holy eunuch when reading Isaiah is asked by Philip, “Do you understand what you are reading?” The man answered, “How can I, except some man should guide me?” To digress for a moment to myself, I am neither holier nor more diligent than this eunuch, who came from Ethiopia … and was so great a lover of the law and of divine knowledge that he read the holy Scriptures even in his chariot. Yet although he had the book in his hand and took into his mind the words of the Lord, no, even had them on his tongue and uttered them with his lips, he still did not know him, who—not knowing—he worshiped in the book. Then Philip came and showed him Jesus, who was concealed beneath the letter. Wondrous excellence of the teacher! In the same hour the eunuch believed and was baptized; he became one of the faithful and a saint. He was no longer a pupil but a master; and he found more in the church’s font there in the wilderness than he had ever done in the gilded temple of the synagogue. These instances have been just touched upon by me (the limits of a letter forbid a more discursive treatment of them) to convince you that in the Holy Scriptures you can make no progress unless you have a guide to show you the way.
