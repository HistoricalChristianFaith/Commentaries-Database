Through Isaiah the prophet the person of the Father states this: “I shall put my Spirit upon him.” The Spirit is not placed upon the Word of God nor upon the only begotten Son who proceeds from the Father but upon the One about whom it is said, “Here is my Son.”

(Verse 18.) Behold my servant, whom I have chosen; my beloved, in whom my soul is well pleased. I will put my spirit upon him, and he shall show judgment to the Gentiles. He shall not strive, nor cry out. Through the prophet Isaiah, this is spoken in the person of the Father: I will put my spirit upon him (Isaiah 42:1). The spirit is not placed upon the Word of God, nor upon the only begotten, who proceeded from the Father's bosom, but upon him of whom it is said: Behold my servant (ibidem).
