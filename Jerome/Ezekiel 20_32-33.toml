(Verse 32, 33.) And the thought of your minds shall not be, of those saying: We shall be like the nations, and like the kindreds of the earth, to worship wood and stones. As I live, saith the Lord God: With a strong hand, and with an outstretched arm, and with fury poured out, I will reign over you. This has this meaning: Do not think that your thoughts, with which you blaspheme against me, can be fulfilled. For I say: We do not want to be under the Lord, nor to be called His people. But as all nations are in the whole world, and each people lives according to its own will, to worship wood and stones, and to serve idols, even we shall be one people among many. To which God responds and swears by Himself, saying: I will not abandon you nor despise you, as negligent runaway servants often despise their masters, but I will draw you back to my reign, and with outstretched arm, striking and pouring out fury, I will restore you to your former slavery, and I will reign over you: whether you want it or not, you will have me as your king, and you will experience the wrath of a king, whose kindness you have neglected.
