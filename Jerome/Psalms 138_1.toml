“I will confess to you, Lord, with all my heart.” The nature of a wound determines the medication to be applied. Just as the body has wounds of various kinds, so also the soul has its passions and its wounds, and we must do penance in proportion to the nature of our sin. If a person makes confession of all his sins, he is acknowledging his sins to the Lord wholeheartedly. If, for example, someone has committed fornication and he confesses only that and is greedy, or quick-tempered, or a slanderer or blasphemer and is full of faults and vices, his confession is not sincere. The person who repents for all the sins and passions of his soul is the person who is able to say, I confess and give thanks to you, O Lord, with all my heart. “For you have heard the words of my mouth.” This verse is not found in the Hebrew text. Nonetheless, what it means is, In my confession I have poured out my whole heart, O Lord; I have confessed all my sins and faults, for I have not admitted merely one sin to you, and you have listened to me graciously.
