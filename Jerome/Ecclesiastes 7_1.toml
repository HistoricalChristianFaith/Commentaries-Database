"How does it benefit man? For who knows what is good for man in this
life, all the days of his vain life, which he spends as a shadow? For who can tell a man what will be after him
under the sun? "When he says" "that man is ignorant of
his condition, and does not actually know whatever he seems to know and
discern, as if the truth of the matter is not seen, he does see however the
shadow and image as if through a mirror, and he cannot know what will come, or
escape his sin by talkativeness. He
should silence his mouth and believe that He who is written has come, and not
ask by what means, how much, or what kind of man he is that has come.
