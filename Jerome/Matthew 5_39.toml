(Verse 39.) But if anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to him the other also. And if anyone wants to sue you and take your tunic, let him have your cloak as well. And if anyone forces you to go one mile, go with him two miles. The man described in Ecclesiasticus is an imitator of him who says: Learn from me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart (Matthew 11:29). And he confirms his promise by saying: If I have spoken wrongly, bear witness to the wrong; but if well, why do you strike me? (John 18:23). David says in the Psalm: 'If I have repaid those who did evil to me' (Ps. VII, 5). And Jeremiah in the Lamentations: 'It is good for a man to bear the yoke from his youth' (or sit by it, etc.). He will give his cheek to the one who strikes him; he will be filled with insults (Thren. III, 27,30). This is directed against those who think there is one God of the Law and another of the Gospel, which is taught both there and here. According to mystical understanding: our right hand, when struck, we are not commanded to offer the left, but the other, that is, the other right. For justice does not have a left hand. If a heretic strikes us in a dispute and wants to wound the right doctrine, let another testimony from the Scriptures be set against him, and let us continually offer him our right hands while he is weary with anger.
