In the beginning of Genesis, it is written: “And the Spirit was stirring above the waters.” You see, then, what it says in the beginning of Genesis. Now for its mystical meaning—“The Spirit was stirring above the waters”—already at that time baptism was being foreshadowed. It could not be true baptism, to be sure, without the Spirit.

(Verse 2.) And the spirit of God was moving over the waters. Because in our books it is written 'was moving', in Hebrew it has 'Merefeth', which we can call 'hovering' or 'brooding', in the likeness of a bird, warming the eggs with the heat of life. From which we understand that it is not said to be the spirit of the world, as some suppose, but the Holy Spirit, who is also said to be the giver of life to all things from the beginning. And if a giver of life, then also a creator. But if You are the creator and God. For, He says, send forth Your Spirit, and they shall be created (Psalm 103, 30).
