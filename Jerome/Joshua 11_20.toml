“There was no city which the Lord did not deliver to the children of Israel, except perhaps those who lived in Gibeon. Israel violently overthrew all of them because the Lord hardened their hearts that they would fight Israel and be killed and not be shown mercy and die, just as the Lord had commanded Moses.” If it happened by the will of the Lord that Israel not receive or accept peace, then let us say with the apostle, “Why, therefore, does he object? For who can resist the will of the Lord?”
