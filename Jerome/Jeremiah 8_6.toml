(Verse 6.) I listened and heard: no one speaks what is good. There is no one who repents for his sin, saying: what have I done? All have turned to their own course, like a horse rushing into battle. Called to repentance, they scornfully refuse to listen: and it is not enough for them to have sinned against the Lord and spoken blasphemy, but they all rush like horses, and with fervent speed into battle, not reflecting on their sin, nor saying, what have I done? By these things we understand that either these things are said about the whole human race, because it is prone to vices, or about the time of the Savior, when all together they became useless: there was no one who did good, there was not even one (Psalm 13). Therefore, he himself cries out mystically: Save me, Lord, for the holy one has failed (Psalm 11, 1). But if these things are so, where are those who say that we are free from sin by our own will? No one, he says, speaks what is good (Matt. XI): because we will also be held accountable for idle words on the day of judgment.
