By the reading of the prophet the eunuch of Candace, the queen of Ethiopia, is made ready for the baptism of Christ. Though it is against nature, the Ethiopian does change his skin, and the leopard his spots.

Then immediately quickening her pace, she began to move along the old road that leads to Gaza, that is, to the “power” or “wealth” of God, silently meditating on that type of the Gentiles, the Ethiopian eunuch, who, in spite of the prophet, changed his skin and, while he read the Old Testament, found the fountain of the gospel.

(Verse 23.) If an Ethiopian can change his skin, or a leopard its spots, then you can do good, once you have learned evil. They use this testimony against the Church, those who want to assert different natures; and they say that the darkness or diversity of sins is so great that they cannot pass into whiteness and the beauty of one color: not taking into account what follows: And you can do good, once you have learned evil. For whatever is learned, it is not of nature, but of study and one's own will: which by excessive habit and love is in a certain way turned into nature. But that which is impossible for humans is possible for God (Matthew 19 and Luke 18): so that the Ethiopian and the leopard do not seem to change their own nature; but He who works in the Ethiopian and the leopard, as the Apostle says: I can do all things in Him who strengthens me, Christ (Philippians 4:13). And in a foreign place: Moreover, he says, I have labored more than all of them: not I, but the grace of God which is in me (I Cor. XV, 10). And: I am not living anymore, but Christ is living in me (Galat. II, 20). And again we read: What do you have that you did not receive? And if you have received it, why do you boast as if you did not receive it (I Cor. IV, 7)? For these reasons, let not the wise man boast in his wisdom, nor the strong man in his strength, nor the rich man in his riches, nor the virtuous man in his virtue, knowing that in all these things there is the power of Christ, not of those who boast in their own virtues.
