Either it is a general prayer for the kingdom of the whole world that the reign of the Devil may cease; or for the kingdom in each of us that God may reign there, and that sin may not reign in our mortal body.

But be it noted, that it comes of high confidence, and of an unblemished conscience only, to pray for the kingdom of God, and not to fear the judgment.

Let them be put to shame by this text who falsely affirm that there are daily falls (ruinas) in Heavenb.

(Verse 10) Your kingdom come. This can mean either a general prayer for the kingdom of the whole world, that the devil may stop reigning in the world, or that God may reign in each individual, and sin may not reign in the mortal body of humankind (Rom. VI). At the same time, we must consider that it requires great courage and a pure conscience to ask for the kingdom of God and not fear judgment.

Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Just as the angels serve thee blamelessly in heaven, so may men serve thee on earth. Let those be ashamed of this opinion who daily lie about there being disturbances in heaven. For what benefit is the likeness of heaven to us, if there is also sin in heaven?
