(Verse 11, 12.) But he answered and said unto them, Elias indeed cometh first, and restoreth all things; and how it is written of the Son of man, that he must suffer many things, and be set at nought. But I say unto you, That Elias is indeed come, and they have done unto him whatsoever they listed, as it is written of him.

And they did not recognize him; but they did to him whatever they wanted: That is, they despised him, and beheaded him.
