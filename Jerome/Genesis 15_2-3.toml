(Chapter 15, Verses 2, 3.) Lord God, what will you give me? And I go without children: and the son of my household, this Damascus Eliezer. And Abram said: Behold to me you have not given seed: and the son of my household will be my heir. Whereby we have, and the son of my household: in Hebrew it is written, Uben Mesech Bethi: which Aquila translated, the son of the one who gives drink to my house: that is, the son who gives drink to my house. But Theodotius, and the son of my servant: that is, his son, who is in charge of my house. And as for what he says, this is it: I die without children, and the son of my steward, or overseer, who manages and distributes all the food of my household, is called Damascus Eliezer, and he will be my heir. Moreover, Eliezer means 'my God is my helper'. They say that Damascus was founded and named after him.
