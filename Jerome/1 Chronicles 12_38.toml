“O Lord, deliver me from lying lip, from treacherous tongue”: not from another’s tongue but from my own. Another’s tongue does not injure me; my own is my enemy. Deliver me; deliver me from my own tongue. My tongue is a sword, and it is slaying my soul. I think that I am harming my enemy; I do not realize that I am killing myself. My adversaries may contradict me when I speak to them, but I shall speak peace. Their spirit may be hostile, but let our spirit be that of peacemakers. It is written in Paralipomenon: “The sons of Israel came to fight with peaceful heart.”
