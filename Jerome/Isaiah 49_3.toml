With the Father saying these things to me which I have registered, I replied to him, “How are you glorified in me, Father, since I have worked in the void and have not been able to summon back to you the great part of the Jewish people?” Now this reveals a universal principle, in that it shows the free will of the human being—it is for God to call and for us to believe. And if we do not believe immediately, God is not powerless but leaves his power for our will so that the will fittingly gains the award.
