"Even in
your thoughts do not curse a king, and in your bed-chamber do not curse the
rich, for a bird of the skies may carry the sound, and some winged creature may
betray the matter. "This simple example teaches the listeners
that we should not be overpowered by anger and fury, and curse and blame kings
and leaders, since it seems to happen against one's wish, that what we curse is
made known. And we run into danger by
the inability to hold our tongue. He
also says, "a bird of the skies may carry the sound, and some winged
creature may betray the matter", this is to be understood as a
exaggeration, just as we are accustomed to saying, 'walls have ears to hear
those things, which we think are said in private'. But it is better to hear a teaching in this
way, so that we know that we have a commandment to follow, not only that
nothing should be spoken rashly against Christ, but also in the secret places
of our heart, however we are troubled by our many problems, nothing should be
blasphemed, nothing thought which is impious. 
And since we owe love, that we have for Christ, the next part says,
"love the Lord your God," and even " your nearest" and
"yourself". [Matth. 22, 37.40.] He even orders this, so that afterwards we do
not easily take the king away from the holy, and so that we do not slander by
the wickedness of our tongue those who are rich in knowledge, wisdom and
virtues, for they are the angels who fly around the earth and are
administrators of the spirit. They say
in Zechariah, "we have traversed the earth and look all the world is inhabited
and quiet" [Zach. 1, 11.]. And just like birds, our words and thoughts
are carried to heaven. And whatever we
think in secret, is not hidden from God's knowledge.
