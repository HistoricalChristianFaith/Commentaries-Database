(Verse 24 onwards) But Jesus, answering, said to them: I will also ask you one question, which if you tell me, I will also tell you by what authority I do these things. The baptism of John, whence was it? From heaven or from men? But they thought within themselves, saying: If we say, From heaven, he will say to us: Why then did you not believe him? But if we say, From men, we are afraid of the multitude: for all held John as a prophet. And answering Jesus, they said: We do not know. This is what is commonly said: A bad knot of a tree, a bad nail or wedge must be driven in. The Lord could have refuted the calumny of the tempters with an open response, but He wisely asks a question, so that they themselves, either by silence or by their answer, may be condemned. For if they had answered that the baptism of John was from heaven (as they cleverly handled in their malice), the consequent response would have been: Why then were you not baptized by John? If they had wanted to say that it was a human invention and had nothing divine, they feared the rebellion of the people. For all the crowds had received John's baptism in groups, and they held him as a prophet. Therefore, the most impious faction responded and, using the word of humility by which they claimed not to know, used it to plot deceit.
