Let us at this point consider the meaning of the words “therefore in judgment the wicked shall not stand.” They shall not rise to be judged because they have already been judged, for “he who does not believe in me is already judged,” Faller and Michaela Zelzer. CSEL 82 “nor shall sinners in the assembly of the just.” It does not say that sinners shall not rise again but that they shall not stand in the assembly of the just; they do not deserve to stand with those who are not to be judged. If they believed in me, says the Lord, they would rise up with those who do not have to be judged.
