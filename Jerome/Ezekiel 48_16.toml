(Verse 16) And the measurements of it, towards the North side, five hundred and four thousand: and towards the South side, five hundred and four thousand: and towards the East side, five hundred and four thousand: and towards the West side, five hundred and four thousand. What it says: And the measurements of it, it must be understood, of the city. For at the end of the previous chapter it is stated: And the city shall be in the midst of it, that is, the land. And first it begins from the North and extends towards the South. And again it matches like with like: so that it places the Western side opposite the Eastern side, that is, the sea: and each side of the city has four thousand and five hundred paces; which in total, approximately eleven thousand and eighty-five paces, so that the entire city, as it is written at the end of this volume, has a circumference of eighteen thousand paces, which is equivalent to forty-four thousand three hundred and forty. Also, the forty-fourth Psalm, which is titled 'For those who will be changed' and belongs to Idithun, that is, to the beloved of the Lord, or as Aquila has interpreted it, ‘For the lilies,’ and Symmachus, ‘For the flowers,’ contains the sacraments of the Church, which is the city of the Lord, about which it is written in the same psalm: At Your right hand stood the queen in a garment adorned with gold, surrounded with variety (Psalm 44:10). And again: All the glory of the daughter of the king is within (Ibid., 14): so that it may not be like the whitened sepulchers outside, but both inside and outside it may wash away all things with the perfume of myrrh (Matthew 23). And when we have moved away from the North, with a very cold wind, we pass to the South, and after the rising of the light of knowledge in us, we fear the setting of fortitudes, considering not the past but the future, neither possessing a certain possession of virtue, but daily saying in prayer: Lead us not into temptation, which we cannot endure (Matthew 86:13).
