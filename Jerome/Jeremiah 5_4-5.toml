(Vers. 4, 5.) But I said: Perhaps they are poor and foolish (or they were unable) and ignorant of the way of the Lord, the judgment of their God. Therefore, I will go to the noble ones, and I will speak to them: for they have known the way of the Lord, the judgment of their God. Here, the poor and the noble ones, he does not speak of poverty and wealth, but compares the people to the rulers. And the meaning is this: Seeing the stubbornness of the unfaithful people, and that with hardened face, he did not want to receive instruction, this is the reasoning I had with myself: Perhaps the common people, who are ignorant of God, cannot know the teachings, and therefore it is excusable, because due to their lack of knowledge of God, they are unable to know the commandments. Therefore, I will go to the priests and those who preside over the people, and I will speak to them. For they have known the will of the Lord and understand His judgment. However, this is said in the manner of one who is uncertain, according to the Gospel saying: 'I will send my son, perhaps they will respect him' (Matthew 21:37), so that through the ambiguity of the sentence and the suspension of words, the free will of man might be shown.
