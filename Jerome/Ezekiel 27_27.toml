(Verse 27). Your sailors (or rowers), and your pilots, who held your goods and led your people: and your warriors who were in you, with all your multitude that is in your midst, will fall in the heart of the sea on the day of your ruin. We read about the sailors or rowers of the city of Tyre, the Sidonians, and the Aradians, about whom it has already been said; and according to the Septuagint edition, the counselors of Byblos, which is called Gebal in Hebrew: and also its warriors, Persians, Lydians, and Libyans, who will all fall and be shown to be nothing, when Tyre falls and all its glory comes to an end in ruins. However, the multitude which the Seventy translated as 'commixtionis', except for the leaders, signifies the common people; who without the name of positions, are crushed with similar judgement. And the prophecy is mixed between the city and the ship, so that from one you may understand the other: and yet both pertain to the end of the age, and to a shipwreck.
