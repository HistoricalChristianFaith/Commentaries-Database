(Verses 12, 13.) But when you enter the house, greet it. And if the house is worthy, let your peace come upon it; but if it is not worthy, let your peace return to you. The hidden greeting is expressed in Hebrew and Syriac speech. For what is said in Greek, χαῖρε, and in Latin, ave, is called in the Hebrew Syriac language Salom Lach () or Salom Emmach (), which means peace be with you. And the instruction is as follows: When you enter a house, bless the guest with peace, and as much as you can, calm the strife and quarrels. But if a contradiction arises, you will receive a reward for the offered peace: they, who wish to have war, will possess it.
