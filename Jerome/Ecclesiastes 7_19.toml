"It is good
that you should take hold of this, and do not withdraw your hand; for he that
fears God shall come forth of them all. "It is good to do good to righteous men, but
also being kind to sinners is not wicked. 
It is good to keep slaves faithful to you, but it is advised to do this
only with those who seek your employment. 
Even he who fears God and copies his maker, who causes rain to fall over
both the righteous and the wicked, enjoys doing good to all without distinction. Another meaning of this is, because this life
changes daily with many wretched occurrences, as fortunate as unfortunate, the
spirit should be prepared for righteousness and should ask for the pity of God,
so that whatever happens, he suffers with a free conscience. For he who fears God is neither raised to
fortune, nor crushed by misfortune.
