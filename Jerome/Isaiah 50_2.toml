So that you might know that your mother was not rejected by me but deserted of her own will, after many benefits I put on human flesh and not through any prophets but actually present myself I spoke forth: “I have come, and there was not a man” or a person. For all people, abandoning the image of humans, adopted the images of beasts and serpents. Thus it was said to Herod on account of his wickedness, “Go and tell that fox,” or to the Pharisees, “brood of vipers.” … I have called them as if they were rational animals.… We can say that although he is the accomplisher of such great signs and he makes the sky and earth and sea to serve his uses, even he could not avoid the cross. - "Commentary on Isaiah 13.26"
