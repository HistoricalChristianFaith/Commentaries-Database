(Verse 17) And Jacob built a house there for himself, and he built shelters for his livestock; therefore he called the name of that place Tabernacles. Where we have tents, it is read in Hebrew as Sochoth. Furthermore, until today, there is a city beyond the Jordan with this name in the region of Scythopolis, about which we have written in the book of Joshua.
