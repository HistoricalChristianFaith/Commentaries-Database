This is the true Nebuchadnezzar, as we have said before, about whom Peter also said, “Our adversary, the devil, prowls about like a roaring lion.” He ascended from the depths to which he had been relegated and for fear that he is sent back, the plunderer or destroyer of the nations entreats and arises. He is whom it was said that “he will dominate all his enemies” and those who boast in the face of the Lord: “I have gone around the earth and trampled it.” For whom has the venom of the devil not affected except for he alone who is able to say “the prince of this world comes and finds that he has nothing over me”? He repeatedly makes all the territory of the church a wasteland, that those who have left the church might do battle against it, those about whom John the Evangelist also says, “They went forth from us, but they were not of us, for if they had been of us, they would have remained with us.” The cities of the land of Judah are devastated, and the councils of heretics flourish. It can be said, therefore, about every patron of the authors of perverse doctrine: “A lion ascended from his lair and a destroyer of nations has arisen,” and so on.

(Verse 7) The lion has come up from his den, and the destroyer of the nations has risen; he has left his lair to make your land a desolation. Your cities will be laid waste, with no inhabitant remaining. This is, as we have said, the true Nebuchadnezzar, of whom the blessed Apostle Peter speaks: 'Our adversary the devil prowls around like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour' (1 Peter 5:8). But he has also ascended from the abyss, from which he must be bound, and he pleads not to be cast out; and the plunderer or destroyer of the nations has risen, of whom it is said: 'You will rule over all your enemies' (Psalm 9:5), and 'He who boasts in the sight of the Lord: I have gone around and trampled on the whole earth' (Job 2:2). For who is it, indeed, whom the poisons of the devil do not touch, except for he alone who can say: Behold, the prince of this world is coming, and in me he has found nothing (John 14:30)? This person frequently puts the whole earth of the Church in solitude, so that those who have gone out of the Church fight against the Church. Concerning these, John the Evangelist speaks: They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would have remained with us (1 John 2:19). The cities of the land of Judea are being devastated, and the assemblies of heretics flourish. Therefore, if anyone is a supporter and author of perverse doctrines, it can be said: The lion has come up from his den, and the destroyer of nations has risen!
