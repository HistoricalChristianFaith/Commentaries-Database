(Verse 8, 9) For thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: Do not let your prophets who are among you and your diviners deceive you, nor give heed to your dreams which you dream. For they prophesy falsely to you in My name; I have not sent them, says the Lord. The prophet Ezekiel testifies that there were prophets, or rather false prophets, and diviners and dreamers in Babylon, among those whom Nebuchadnezzar had brought with Jehoiachin and his mother, as he writes against them, to whom Jeremiah also commands not to believe (Ezekiel 13). However, at the time when this Epistle was being directed, Ezechiel had not yet begun to prophesy in Babylon. For this speech is sent in the beginning of the reign of King Sedeciae. But Ezechiel, in the fifth year of the exile of Jechonias, began to prophesy, which was also the same year of the reign of Sedeciae. Furthermore, according to the allegory, we should consider as false prophets those who interpret the words of Scriptures differently than the Holy Spirit sounds. And we should consider as divine those who pronounce their own conjecture and uncertain future events as if they were true, without the authority of divine words. And also the dreamers, who do not heed that writing: Neither give sleep to thine eyes, nor slumber to thine eyelids (Prov. VI, 4); of whom the apostle Judas speaks: Likewise also these dreamers defile the flesh, despise dominion (Judae 8): whose mind is not awake, but is oppressed by the sleep of arrogance and error, and is surrounded by the horror of night, of whom the apostle Paul speaks: Awake, thou that sleepest? And arise from the dead, and Christ will enlighten you (Ephes. V, 14).
