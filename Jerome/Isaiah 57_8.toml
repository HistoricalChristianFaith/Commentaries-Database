First we will discuss the Hebrew, which differs greatly in this location from the Septuagint. As for what it said above [Is 57:7], “You have set your bed on a high and lofty mountain,” it also accuses her of behaving like a prostitute, standing behind the door to the entrance of houses and in other shadowy places, such that whoever wished to enter a room would have temptation before his eyes. Now, it blames and insults the same adulterous wife, who, while sleeping with her husband, will secretly receive an adulterer and uncover herself to him and extend her bed for him and forge an agreement with him, as though she were signing a contract.
