(Chapter 40, Verses 1 onwards) Console, console my people, says your God: Speak to the heart of Jerusalem, and call out to her; for her wickedness is complete, her iniquity is forgiven. She has received from the hand of the Lord double for all her sins. LXX: Console, console my people, says God. O priests, speak to the heart of Jerusalem; console her, for her humility is fulfilled. His sin has been forgiven, for he has received from the hand of the Lord double for all his sins. According to other interpreters, others are commanded to console the people of God and Jerusalem together. According to the Hebrew text, the people themselves are commanded to console, speak to the heart of Jerusalem, and advocate for her. Speaking to the heart of Jerusalem is the language of the Scriptures. For one who speaks to the mournful and soothes is called a consoler who speaks to the heart. Let us be taught by Sichem, the son of Hemor, who spoke corruptly to his heart about the defiled Dinah, and comforted her (Genesis XXXIV). And wherever you find something similar, it has this meaning. The reason for consolation is the forgiveness of sins, and the cause of forgiveness is that he received double from the hand of the Lord for all his sins. For whoever knows the will of his Lord and sins, will be beaten with many stripes (Luke XII). And everyone who has the indwelling of the Holy Spirit, whom the Savior promised to the Apostles, saying: I will ask my Father, and he will give you another Comforter, that he may be with you forever, the Spirit of truth (John XIV, 16); and again: But when the Comforter comes, whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of truth who comes forth from the Father, he will bear witness about me (John XV, 26); and: It is profitable for you that I go away: for if I do not go away, the Comforter will not come to you (John XVI, 7); the Comforter is the one now commanded to console the people of God. Wherefore also the Apostle Paul was speaking to believers: Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort, who comforts us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to comfort those who are in any trouble, by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God: for as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our consolation also aboundeth by Christ (2 Corinthians 1:1-6); and again: And our hope of you is steadfast, knowing that as ye are partakers of the sufferings, so shall ye be also of the consolation (2 Corinthians 1:7). But who is this people, who through the Apostles and Ecclesiastical men is consoled, not Israel, and Jacob and Juda, as the Scripture mentions in other places, but the people of God, as the Prophet Zacharias testifies saying: Rejoice and be glad, daughter of Zion, for I will come and dwell in your midst, says the Lord. And many nations will flee to the Lord in that day, and they will be His people, and they will dwell in your midst, and they will know that the Lord Almighty has sent me to you (Zach. II, 10, 11). By this testimony, it is clearly demonstrated that many nations are to be turned into the people of God. And this is what the Lord, sent by the Lord, whose name is Almighty, says. And it should be noted that our sins are not forgiven unless we receive them from the hand of the Lord. And it is not the same thing to have sins forgiven as to have them pardoned. For those to whom they are pardoned, there is no need for forgiveness, as it is written in the Gospel: Believe, my child, your sins are forgiven you (Matthew 9:2). But those who are released are released because they have been cleansed and freed through punishments. According to history, Jerusalem received its sins twice from the hands of the Babylonians and secondly from the Romans. And what is added by the Seventy, the Priests, must be noted.
