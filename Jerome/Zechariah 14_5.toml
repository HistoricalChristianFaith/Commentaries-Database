(Verse 5) And the middle of the mountain will be separated to the north, and its middle to the south. And you will flee to the valley of my mountains, for the valley of the mountains will reach to the next, and you will flee as you fled from the earthquake in the days of King Oshea of Judah, and the Lord my God will come, and all the holy ones with him. LXX: And the middle part of the mountain will incline to the north, and its middle part to the south. And the valley of my mountains will be closed off, and the valley of the mountains will reach Asael. And it will be filled as it was filled from the face of the earthquake in the days of King Oshea of Judah, and the Lord my God will come, and all the holy ones with him. Therefore, as we have said, you will flee, which the seventy and the other interpreters have translated as 'will be blocked' or 'will be filled'. And as we have stated, because the valley of the mountains will be joined up to the next one; for the next one, the seventy translators have rendered it as Asael. Aquila put the Hebrew word Asel, using the letter 'e' instead of 'i'. Theodotion used the extended form, Azel. Only Symmachus translated it as 'the next one', whom we have also followed. Let us say in a paraphrastic manner how the things that are written can come to pass: When the mountain of Olivet has been broken by a large chasm, so that one part of the chasm looks towards the East and the other towards the West, suddenly, in the very chasm itself, high cliffs on both sides will break away, and another chasm will be formed towards the North and another towards the South, and a square cliff will be made, so that the chasm stretches in four directions, towards the East and the West, the North and the South. And you will flee, he says, to the valley that is between the temple and Zion. For these two mountains, the temple and Zion, are called God's mountains; because that valley of the Mount of Olives, which is surrounded by steep mountains on both sides, will extend to the mountain of the temple, which is holy. However, the earthquake in the days of King Uzziah of Judah, is mentioned from that time, when Uzziah, who is also called Azariah in another name, attempted to claim the priesthood for himself and was struck with leprosy on his forehead (2 Chronicles 26), which we read about in the beginning of Amos (Amos 1): The words of Amos, who was among the shepherds of Tekoa, which he saw concerning Israel in the days of Uzziah king of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam son of Joash, king of Israel, two years before the earthquake (Isaiah 1). Finally, after this wicked king died, at whose impiety the whole world was shaken, Isaiah saw a great vision, which he interwove into his book. Let us now turn to the spiritual interpretation. After the Mount of Olives has been separated by the calling of the Gentiles to the East and the rejection of the Jews, there will again be another division of the North and the South. The North will join the West, the South to the Eastern regions; Circumcision will stand to the left, the Christian people to the right. The Church speaks of these two winds: 'Arise, O North wind, and come, O South wind' (Canticles 4:16), so that when the cold wind of the North, which represents the devil, retreats, the warm wind of the South, which the bride seeks, may come. She asks: 'Where do you feed, where do you rest at noon?' (Ibid. 1:16). Concerning this, Habakkuk speaks mystically: 'God will come from Teman' (Habakkuk 3:3), for which it is written in Hebrew: 'God from the South,' that is, from the fullest light. From which the Psalmist elsewhere exclaims: You illuminate wonderfully from the eternal mountains (Psalm 76). But when there is such a great division of two peoples in the whole world, that some are to the East and South, that is, to the right: others to the North and West, that is, to the left, then whoever is holy will flee to the valley of the mountains of God, of which we have spoken above, the temple and Zion, namely the two Testaments: because that whirlpool which before was of both mountains, extends up to Asael, that is, up to the house of God, which is near paradise, and heavenly Jerusalem, and the holy mountain, where the temple is situated. And just as at that time when under King Osias a violent earthquake terrified the hearts of mortals and scattered them in all directions, so the separation of the two peoples and again the society of believers in one faith will rest in a reconcilable place between two mountains: because both the old and the new Covenant are joined together. But what is said, 'up to Asael,' that is, 'up to the nearest,' signifies this, that indeed the two Instruments of the Law and the Gospel are joined together, but in such a way that they are more neighboring than united: for we have lost many things of the old Law, and have received the new grace. But when this has been accomplished by perfect reason, then the Lord my God will come, he says, and all the saints with him. But if we desire what we have said, you will flee, pursuing that which other interpreters have rendered, it will be closed off, or the valley of their mountains will be filled. We will say that the coming of the Savior Lord, separating two peoples, will close off and fill that chasm which divided the two peoples, so that they may walk on a level path towards each other.
