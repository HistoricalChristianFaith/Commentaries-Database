(Verse 19, 20.) The sun will no longer be your light by day, nor will the splendor of the moon shine on you; for the LORD will be your everlasting light, and your God will be your glory. Your sun will never set again, and your moon will not decrease; for the LORD will be your everlasting light, and the days of your mourning will be fulfilled. LXX: And there will be no more sun for you to shine by day, nor will the moon's light shine on you at night; but the LORD will be your everlasting light, and your God will be your glory. For the sun will not strike you by day, nor the moon by night. And the Lord will be an everlasting light, and your days of mourning will be ended. From this chapter, we are compelled to refer all that has been said and will be said, to the final time: when the sun and moon cease their function as they pass through heaven and earth. And the Lord Himself will be a perpetual light, so that what the carnal-minded assert to be fulfilled in a thousand years, we may believe will be fulfilled spiritually, in the quality of the promises, not differing in time. To these things it must be briefly answered that if the sun sets at noon for false prophets and sinners, and conversely, the sun of justice rises for those who fear the Lord: why then does the one who says, 'I am the light of the world' (John 8:12), who shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not comprehended him (John 1)? For indeed, the sun does not scorch us during the day, nor does the moon during the night (Psalm 121:6). Because we have the Lord as our perpetual light, and the days of our mourning will be fulfilled, not in the lamentation of the destruction of Jerusalem, but in the rejoicing of the instruction of the Church. Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted. Blessed are those who weep, for they will laugh. Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be satisfied (Matthew 5). After being satisfied with the flesh of the Lord, they will proclaim the word of the Lord and declare their works to the king (Psalm 44).
