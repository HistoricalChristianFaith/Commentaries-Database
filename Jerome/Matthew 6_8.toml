(V. 8.) For your Father knows what you need before you ask him. So you will pray like this. In this place, a certain heresy arises, as well as a perverse doctrine of philosophers, who say: If God knows what we pray for, and before we ask, he knows what we need, then we speak in vain to the one who knows. To these it must be briefly answered, we are not storytellers, but askers. For it is one thing to tell the ignorant, another to ask the one who knows. In that, there is evidence; here, there is obedience. There, we faithfully indicate; here, we miserably beseech.
