“For the lawgiver will give a blessing.” Somebody may ask, “Why in the valley of tears, in the place that God has set for the contest—or for the conflict—why has he placed us as athletes? Why has he willed us to fight?” The psalmist gives the answer: He has willed that this place be set for us as an arena that he may reward our victory with a crown. “For the lawgiver will give a blessing.” This Lawgiver, our president of the contest, has willed us to contend only that he may bless us. Just consider what the victory means! What are the blessings of this Master of the games? “They go from strength to strength”;6 they win the victory here that they may receive the crown there. If a person of courage gives evidence of strength here, there he becomes stronger. “They go from strength to strength”; hence, unless we are strong here, we cannot have greater strength there. The psalmist did not say, they shall go from weakness to strength, but from strength to strength. Do you want to be a person of fortitude there? Then be one here first. Do you want to be crowned there? Fight here.
