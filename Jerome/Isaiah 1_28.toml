Moreover, who can agree with the thesis that you [the Pelagians] set down as your next heading: “In the day of judgment, no leniency shall be shown to the ungodly and to sinners, but they shall be consumed in eternal fires,” for you prevent God from showing mercy, and you pass judgment on the sentence of the judge before judgment day, so that if he wanted to spare the unjust and the sinner, he could not, in view of your prescription? For, you say, it is written in Psalm 103, “Let sinners be consumed out of the earth, and the unjust, so that they be no more.” And in Isaiah: “The unjust and the sinners shall burn together, and they who abandon God shall be consumed.” And do you not know that a threat on the part of God at times hints at clemency? For he does not say that they shall be consumed in everlasting fires, but rather that they shall be consumed out of the earth and shall cease to be unjust. For it is one thing for them to avoid sin and injustice and quite another matter for them to perish forever and be consumed in eternal fires. Moreover, Isaiah, from whom you quote your testimony, says, “The unjust and the sinners shall burn together” (without adding the phrase “forever”), “and those who abandon God shall be consumed.” This judgment refers, specifically, to heretics who have abandoned the right way of faith and will be consumed, if they are unwilling to return to God whom they have abandoned.
