For three possible reasons they were petrified with fear: either because they knew they had sinned or because the bright cloud covered them or because they had heard the voice of God the Father speaking. Human weakness is not strong enough to bear the sight of such great glory but trembles with its whole heart and body and falls to earth …. “And Jesus came up and touched them.” Because they were lying down and could not rise, he mercifully came up and touched them so that through his touch he might put to flight their fear and strengthen their weakened limbs. “And he said to them, ‘Rise, and don’t be afraid.’ ” Those whom he had healed with his hand, he heals with his command, “Have no fear.” First fear is expelled so that afterwards doctrine may be imparted. .
