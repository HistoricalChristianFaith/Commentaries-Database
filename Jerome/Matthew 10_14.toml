(Verse 14.) And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear your words, when ye depart out of that house or city, shake off the dust of your feet. The dust is shaken off the feet as a testimony of their labor, that they have entered the city and the apostolic preaching has reached them. Whether the dust is shaken off so that they receive nothing from them, not even necessary food, those who have rejected the Gospel.
