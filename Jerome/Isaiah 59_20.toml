He continues, “The Redeemer will come to Zion and to those who return from iniquity in Jacob, says the Lord.” The Septuagint, however, translates this as follows: “He who will liberate shall come from Zion and avert impieties from Jacob.” If he who averts impieties from Jacob will come from Zion, therefore, we should understand that this man is born in Zion and that the Most High established him there who averts sins from Jacob. If, however, “the Redeemer will come to Zion and to those who return from iniquity in Jacob, says the Lord,” this means that Christ will redeem Zion with his own blood. Or it could be that he was begotten from the seed of Israel, for that is what “Goel” means (Anchisteus in Greek) according to the distinctively Hebrew, which neighbors Zion. And lest we think that all of Zion is redeemed and liberated from sin, which is flowing with the blood of the Lord, he adds significantly, “to those who return from iniquity,” that is, provided that they are willing to do penance, for which persons the prayer of the Lord is completed with “Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.”
