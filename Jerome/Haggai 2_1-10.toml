(Chapter 2, Verse 1 and following) In the seventh month, on the twenty-first day of the month, the word of the Lord came by the prophet Haggai, saying: Speak now to Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua, the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and to the remnant of the people, saying: Who among you is left who saw this temple in its former glory? And how do you see it now? In comparison with it, is this not in your eyes as nothing? And now, be strong, Zerubbabel, declares the Lord, be strong, Joshua son of Jehozadak, the high priest, be strong, all you people of the land, declares the Lord Almighty, and work; for I am with you, declares the Lord Almighty. This is what I covenanted with you when you came out of Egypt. And my Spirit remains among you. Do not fear. For thus says the Lord Almighty: In a little while, I will shake the heavens and the earth, the sea and the dry land, and I will shake all nations. And the desired one will come to all nations, and I will fill this house with glory, says the Lord of hosts. The silver is mine, and the gold is mine, says the Lord of hosts. The glory of this latter house shall be greater than that of the former, says the Lord of hosts. And in this place I will give peace, says the Lord of hosts. In the same year, but in the seventh month, on the first and twenty-first day of the month, after three weeks and the perfect rest of the mystery of the Trinity, the word of the Lord came to the prophet Haggai, who was constantly toiling to always have the word of God with him. Forgetting the past and reaching forward to the future (Phil. III), he worked daily as if he had nothing accomplished before. So it is said to him: Speak to Zerubbabel and to Joshua, and to the remnant of the people, who have seen the former house of God, and who are now part of its restoration. Is not this that is seen comparable to the previous one, as if it were not even there in a certain way? But do not despair and do not let your hands grow weary, but you, Zerubbabel, and you, Joshua, and all people, take courage and do the work in my house. For I am with you, and my word that I made with you when you came out of the land of Egypt. And my spirit will not leave you: do not be afraid, I am the one who commands, the Almighty Lord, whose word is done. When I first gave the testament, and on Mount Sinai I appeared, I shook the heavens and the earth, and the Red Sea, and the desert, so that I might establish the Testament with you; but now I promise you that once again I will shake the heavens and the earth, and the sea and the dry land, so that when they are shaken, all nations may be shaken, and they may come according to the seventy chosen ones of the Lord from all nations; but according to the Hebrew, the desired one will come to all nations, our Lord and Savior. Then I will fill this house with a greater glory than the former, and I will always add to you, says the Lord Almighty. And lest you think the sponsor is weak: the gold is mine, and the silver is mine, and all the riches are mine. I will give gold and silver as ornaments for the temple, so that the glory of this house may be greater than that of the former. And because what I promise seems difficult, and human unfaithfulness always hesitates at greater promises, therefore I say again, I am the Lord Almighty who promises. Furthermore, because I know that for the construction of this renowned house, and for the fact that it is a supernatural house, nothing can be done so that there may be peace, therefore I promise this. For I will give peace in this place, says the Lord of hosts, so that the peace which surpasses all understanding may guard my house and be a place of peace. Meanwhile, I have drawn these explanatory lines in a paraphrastic manner, so that from them, even while we remain silent, a discerning reader may ascend to a higher understanding. So the word of God fit well with those who had begun to work in the house of the Almighty Lord, now at rest, that is, in the seventh month, and in the fullest sacrament of the Trinity, on the twenty-first day of the month, and to Haggai celebrating the feast of God, who had once again prepared his hand to the word of the Lord, and he says to him: Speak to Zerubbabel from the tribe of Judah, and to Joshua the high priest, who deigned to become both man and Priest for us, and to the remnant of the people: for in comparison to the whole world, a small part was in the beginning of the believers. Therefore, let us listen to what he has spoken. Once there was a house of God in Israel, which is now so deserted that it is not believed to have ever existed. From being beloved, it has become unbeloved, and those who were not the people of God have begun to be the people of God. And that house, which was once glorious, now in the sight of Zerubbabel and Joshua and the remnant of the people, is as if it does not exist. But we should not only understand this to mean the temple buildings that we see have collapsed, but also everything that the Jews once held in high esteem. However, because the previous house was almost nonexistent, Zerubbabel the leader and Joshua the priest are called upon to establish the kingdom of Christ and priesthood and to enable the people, once the people of the land, to work in the house of the Lord and know that God is present with them. They should also fulfill the word that the Lord made with them when they departed from the land of Egypt. And I hope that we also depart from Egypt, so that we fulfill the word of the testament that we have received. The Lord God also promises his works to those who do them in his house, and fulfills his word to those who receive it, saying: 'And my spirit will be among you.' Behold the sacrament of the Trinity: I am with you, and my spirit, and the Word, in whom I made my covenant when you go forth from Egypt. But what he says 'among you' should be understood according to what is written in the Gospel: 'There stands among you, whom you do not know, one who comes after me' (John 1:26). Therefore, thus says the Lord of hosts to you who see the former house as it is now, 'It is as nothing in your eyes. For I am going to shake the heavens and the earth, when the voice of the Lord will be heard from heaven. I am going to shake the earth, when I gave the former people the covenant; and in my coming, darkness, storm, and darkness were seen. I moved the Red Sea, when I made a way for the people passing through. I moved the desert, or Egypt, through the plagues, emptying them of the worship of God, or through the wilderness where I led the people for forty years.' I will now move on to this. Which we see happen at the coming of the Lord and Savior. Indeed, at the time of his passion, with the sun setting, the sky was in motion and darkness occurred over the whole earth from the sixth hour until the ninth hour (Matt. XXVII and Luc. XXIII). The earth was moved, and rocks were split, and tombs were opened; the sea was stirred with the serpent that was in it being killed; the dry, once barren wilderness of the nations was also moved. But in this trembling of the whole world, all nations were also moved; for the sound of the apostles of the Lord went forth into all the earth, and their words reached to the ends of the world (Ps. 18). For this reason, all nations were moved, that from their movement a chosen multitude of nations might come forth, and those things which are illustrious wherever they may be. For example, chosen from Corinth, because there was a great multitude of God's people in it. Chosen from Macedonia, because the Church of God gathered in Thessalonica was great and did not need to be taught about charity (1 Thess. 14). Electa of Ephesus, so that they may know the mysteries of God and the sacraments never before revealed. What more? all the nations were stirred, to whom the Savior had sent the apostles, saying: Go, teach all the nations (Matt. XXVIII, 29), and from the many called, few chosen, built the Church of the first Christians. Therefore Peter the apostle also says: She who is in Babylon, elect, greets you, and so does my son Mark (I Pet. V, 15), and John: The elder, he says, to the elect lady; and then he mentions the children of the elect. Therefore, with these nations in turmoil, from which we can indeed receive opposing strengths, not being able to endure the splendor of the Lord, the chosen ones of all nations came, and the glory of the house of the Lord, which is the Church of the living God, was filled, the pillar and foundation of truth. This is according to the Septuagint. However, in Hebrew, it is held better and more significantly as we have mentioned before: And I will shake all nations, and the desired one will come to all nations. For truly, after he came, the glory of the house of the Lord was fulfilled. And as much as the Lord is distant from the servant, so much better is the house of the Lord, which the Lord presides over, than the previous house over which the servant presided. But when he says, 'The silver is mine, and the gold is mine,' the Lord of hosts says, I think no one believes that he is speaking of silver and gold, which are possessed by the rich and the kings. For in this manner, not only silver and gold are God's, as if of the Creator; but also the other metals, bronze, tin, lead, and the iron that tames all things. But I consider the silver with which the house of God is adorned to be the words of Scripture, of which it is said: The words of the Lord are pure words, as silver tried by fire, refined of earthly impurities seven times (Ps. 12:6); and the gold that is in the secret sense of the saints, and dwells in the hidden depths of the heart, and shines with the true light of God, which it is clear the Apostle understood when he speaks of those who build upon the foundation of Christ, as gold, silver, precious stones (1 Cor. 3); so that in gold there is hidden meaning, in silver there is appropriate speech, in precious stones there are works pleasing to God. The Church of the Savior becomes more illustrious with these metals, which once was a synagogue; with these living stones the house of Christ is built, and eternal peace is offered to it. Furthermore, what follows in the Septuagint: 'And peace of soul for the possession of every creature, that it may raise up this temple, as something superfluous and barely connected, since it is not reported by any Hebrew or any other interpreter, we have omitted.'
