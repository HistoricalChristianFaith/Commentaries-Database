Moreover, according to the anagogical sense, we can say that the people of God go down into the Egypt of this age, when they are lovers of pleasures more than of God and do not hear that prophetic voice, “Woe to you who descend to Egypt for help.” Whoever is softened with vices and lives in a place of lakes and rivers but does not have the dryness of chastity will be violently handed over to the Assyrians, and they will master him and try and convict him of sin.
