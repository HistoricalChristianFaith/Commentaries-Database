There is much to be said on this subject. In the case of sinners, the devil is standing at the right side, but that is another matter for discussion. Whoever is a sinner has the devil standing at his right hand. Someone is raising the objection: How, then, in Zechariah is the devil said to stand on the right of Jesus [Joshua], the son of Jehozadak? “And Satan stood at his right hand.” How in Zechariah is it written that the devil stands at the right hand of the Savior? You appreciate that this is a problem. At the time that the devil stood at the right hand of the Savior, “Jesus,” holy Writ says, “was clad in filthy garments.” He was wearing our sins; he was wrapped up in the folds of our vices; that is why the devil was standing at his right side.
