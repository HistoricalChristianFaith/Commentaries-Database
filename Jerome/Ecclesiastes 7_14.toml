"Consider
the work of God: for who can make that straight, which he has made
crooked? "Symmachus translates this passage in this
way: "learn the word of God, because no one can correct what He has
ruined". That is he supplies from
the Holy Scriptures, or from thinking of the elements, to know and understand
those things, which are done; but not to ask the causes and reasons why one
thing is done in this way, or why it ought to have been done differently from
the way in which it has been done. For
the sake of this passage, if anyone should ask why God spoke to Moses in this
way: "who makes the dumb and the deaf, the seeing and the blind, am I not
the Lord God?" [Ex. 4, 11.],
and if he should say, why are the blind, the deaf, the mute created in this
way, and others similar to these? This
passage must be seen in reference to 
Psalm 17, in which it is said to the Lord: "You will be Holy with
the holy man, and with the wicked You
will err" [Ps. 17, 26-27.]. And it must be added that the Holy Lord is
with him, who is holy; and the wicked are with him, who was previously wicked
by his own will. This is similar also to
that which is written in Leviticus: "if the wicked came to me I will go to
them, wicked in my madness". [Lev. 26-27.] Even this can explain why God hardened the
heart of Pharaoh. For just as one and
the same quality of the sun melts wax and dries clay, and on account of each
one's constitution, both wax melts and clay dries; [Cfr. Lucr. De Rerum Natura VI 962/965; Verg. Ecl. VIII 80.; Hier. Epist. 120,10
-12. CSEL 55, p504,10.]
so too the one quality of the portents of God in Egypt softened the heart of
those who believed, and hardened that of the incredulous, who just as their
hardness and impatient heart, began to store up for themselves anger for the
day of anger from those portents, which they didn't believe, though yet they
saw them happen.
