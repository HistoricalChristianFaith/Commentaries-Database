“His feet will not trod the path,” that is, he will not feel the labor of life or any fatigue from human weakness, but he “will drink from the torrent on the way, and therefore, will lift up his head.” … That which we interpreted as referring to the person of Christ, some refer to Cyrus, the king of the Persians, … while some of the Jews think this is said about Abraham. - "Commentary on Isaiah 12.3"
