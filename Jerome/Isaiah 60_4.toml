(Verse 4.) Lift up your eyes all around and see: all these gathered together have come to you. Your sons shall come from afar, and your daughters shall be carried at your side. LXX: Lift up your eyes all around and see: all your sons have gathered together. Your sons shall come from afar, and your daughters shall be carried on shoulders. It is said to the Church, which was first gathered in Zion by the Apostles, of whom we read in the Acts of the Apostles, that religious men from the whole world were in Jerusalem, who received the word of God in their own and foreign tongues, either hearing others speaking or speaking to others themselves (Acts II). And it is commanded that they lift up their eyes around: which the Lord also commanded the Apostles, saying: Lift up your eyes, and see, for the fields are already white for harvest (John 4:35). For out of Zion, and not out of Mount Sinai, shall the law come forth, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem. And it is commanded that with lifted eyes he see his gathered children, who come from afar. To whom it is also said in another place: Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion, proclaim, O daughter of Jerusalem: Behold, I come, and I will dwell in your midst, says the Lord (Zephaniah 3:17); and, Many nations shall come to the Lord: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God (Zechariah 2:11). But we are the sons who have come from afar to the Lord, once pilgrims from the Testament of God and His promises, having no hope and without God in the world. But what does the Apostle say? You who were once far away, have now been made near (Ephesians 2:13). And what follows: 'And your daughters shall be nursed at your side,' signifies that souls nurturing in Christ, and in the baptism of infants, of whom also the Apostle Peter speaks, 'As newborn babes, desire the genuine milk of the word, that you may grow thereby' (1 Peter 2:2), shall suckle the milk of the Apostles. He spoke to them as little children and infants, saying: My little children, for whom I am in labor again until Christ is formed in you (Galatians 4:19). And in another place: Just as a nursing mother cares for her children, so we were delighted to share with you not only the gospel of Christ but also our own lives (1 Thessalonians 2:7-8). It should be noted that the statement in the Septuagint, 'your daughters will be carried on their shoulders,' is especially important. For the sons, who are strong, they themselves come from afar and gather to the faith of the Lord. But the daughters, who are weaker, and because of the fragility of their sex, have not yet come to maturity as women, are carried on the shoulders of the Apostles, in order to be brought into the bosom of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
