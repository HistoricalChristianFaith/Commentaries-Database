(Verse 23.) And when he came into the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people approached him as he was teaching, saying, 'By what authority are you doing these things, and who gave you this authority?' In different words, they construct the same accusation as before, when they said, 'He casts out demons by Beelzebub, the prince of demons.' For when they say, 'By what authority are you doing these things?' they doubt the authority of God and want it to be understood that what he does is by the power of the devil. Moreover, they added: Who gave you this authority? They openly deny the Son of God, whom they consider to be not working by his own power, but by the power of others, to perform miracles.
