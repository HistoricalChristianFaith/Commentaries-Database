(Verse 26) But that we may not offend them: go to the sea, and cast in a hook, and that fish which shall first come up, take: and when thou hast opened its mouth, thou shalt find a stater: take that, and give it to them for me and thee. What I should first admire in this place, I know not, whether the foreknowledge, or the greatness of the Saviour. The foreknowledge that he knew the fish would have a stater in its mouth, and that he himself would be the first to be caught. The greatness and power, if at his word a stater was immediately created in the mouth of the fish, and that which was to come to pass he effected by his speaking. But it seems to me, according to a mystical understanding, that this is the fish that was first caught, which was in the depths of the sea and dwelled in salty and bitter waters, so that through the second Adam the first Adam might be freed; and that which was found in its mouth, that is, in its confession, would be given back to Peter and the Lord. And indeed, the same thing is given a beautiful price, but it is divided, because it was given as a price for Peter, as if for a sinner; but our Lord had not committed any sin, nor was deceit found in His mouth (Isaiah 53). The stater is called so because it has two didrachms, to show the likeness of the flesh, while both the slave and the Lord are redeemed at the same price. But it also builds up the understanding of the listener: that the Lord was of such great poverty that he had no means to pay taxes for himself and his apostle. If someone wants to object: how did Judas carry money in the purse? We will answer that he thought it would be wrong to convert the resources of the poor for his own use, and he gave us the same example.
