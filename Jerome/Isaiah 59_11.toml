And we coo like meditating doves who have no sense and no understanding of the Scriptures, contemplating only those words that they sing from memory. But just as it is written of doves that “Ephraim is like a dove with no sense,” and just as the innocence of doves is contrasted with the prudence of serpents in the Gospel, so also innocence without prudence, which is the neighbor of foolishness, is shown in the present passage to consist of meditating on words alone.
