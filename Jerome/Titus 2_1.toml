But you speak what befits sound doctrine. The speaking of sound doctrine is one thing, the teaching of those things that are fitting for sound doctrine is another; in the one there is only the simplicity of instruction, while in the other there is also the correction of life in those who teach. For whoever shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven; but he who shall do and teach, he shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven (Matthew 5:19). When the Lord commanded His disciples to labour not only in the meditation of the Scriptures, that they might repeat and lay them up in the treasure-house of their memory, but also that they should first do what was commanded, whoever shall do and teach shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.

For unless your justice surpasses that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will not enter the kingdom of heaven. (Matthew 5) Those who sit in the chair of Moses preach but do not practice. They burden the backs of others with loads that are heavy and difficult to carry, but they themselves will not lift a finger to lighten the load. Therefore, the Apostle now teaches his disciple Titus, a son in Christ, to speak the things that are in accord with sound doctrine, for then there will be spiritual health when the teaching of the doctor and his life agree.
