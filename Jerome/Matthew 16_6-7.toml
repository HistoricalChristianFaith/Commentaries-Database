(Verses 6, 7.) Watch out and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees. But they were discussing among themselves, saying, 'We did not bring any bread.' He who avoids the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees does not observe the precepts of the Law and the teachings of men, neglecting the traditions in order to fulfill God's commandment.
