When Solomon says, “She is a tree of life to those who grasp her,” he is speaking of Wisdom. Now, if wisdom is the tree of life, Wisdom itself, indeed, is Christ. You understand now that the one who is blessed and holy is compared with this tree, that is, with Wisdom.… He is, in other words, like Christ.

This tree bears twofold: it produces fruit, and it produces foliage. The fruit that it bears contains the meaning of Scripture; the leaves, only the words. The fruit is in the meaning; the leaves are in the words.… Whoever reads sacred Scripture … with true spiritual insight gathers the fruit.… The leaves of this tree are by no means useless [“and whose leaves never fade”]. Even if one understands holy Writ only as history, he has something useful for his soul.
