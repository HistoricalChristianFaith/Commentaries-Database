As the Lord Jesus was passing on from the ruler’s house and proceeding to his own (as we read above): “And getting into a boat he crossed over and came to his own city,” suddenly “two blind men cried out and said, ‘Have pity on us, Son of David!’ ” They are not healed along the route, as they might expect, but only after he reached his house. They approach him and go inside. First, their faith is discussed that they may receive the light of true faith. Another sign is added to the first sign we mentioned about the ruler’s daughter and the woman with a hemorrhage, so that what death and disability demonstrated in the one case, blindness demonstrated in the other. Both men were blind at the time the Lord was passing through this world on the way to his house. Unless they had exclaimed “Have pity on us, Son of David!” and in answer to Jesus’ question “Do you believe that I can do this to you?” affirmed “Yes, Lord,” they would not have received the pristine light.
