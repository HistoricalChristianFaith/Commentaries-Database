Isaiah offered this thought by the word of God: “Hear the word of the Lord of hosts: ‘A time will come when all this that is in your house, not you, but the goods acquired through the labor of your fathers, will be taken to Babylon, and some of your children will be made eunuchs in its royal court.’ ” From this the Hebrews want Daniel, Ananiah, Mishael, Hazariah (each of them belonging to the royal line, who were without doubt in the service of King Nebuchadnezzar) to be made eunuchs. This is why Hezekiah said, “The word of the Lord which was spoken is good,” a statement for which he is reproached by the Hebrews, who ask why he should not have imitated the goodness of Moses, who said to the Lord: “Either forgive them for this crime or, if you will not, then remove me from the book which you have written.” Thus also the apostle Paul wished to be anathema to Christ for his brethren who belong to Israel. Hezekiah, therefore, who subsequently said: “Comfort, comfort my people, says your God,” is not reproved by this address from God for not interceding that the people be consoled by the Lord’s mercy. - "Commentary on Isaiah 11.39.3–8"
