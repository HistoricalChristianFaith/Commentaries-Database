This seems to contradict the words above. … But one must see that he was there telling us, as sinners in the present life, to support one another and be a help to one another in the present age. Here he is speaking of the Lord’s judgment of us, which is not based on the sin of another or by comparison with others but according to one’s own work.

For each one will bear his own burden. It seems to contradict what was said before, where it says: Bear one another's burdens: for if each one bears his own burden, he will not be able to bear another's burdens. But it must be understood that there he commanded that we, as sinners in this life, bear one another's burdens and help each other in this present age. But here he is speaking about the judgment of the Lord upon us, which is not based on comparing one person's sin to another's, but rather according to our own work, whether we are judged as sinners or as saints, each one receiving according to his own work. Although we are being taught by this little saying, there is a new doctrine that is hidden: while we are in this present age, whether by prayers or by counsels, we are able to help one another. But when we come before the judgement seat of Christ, neither Job, nor Daniel, nor Noah will be able to pray for anyone, but each person will carry their own work (Ezekiel 14).
