(Verse 17, 18.) Thus says the Lord of hosts: Set your hearts upon your ways, go up to the mountain, bring wood, and build the house: and it shall be acceptable to me, and I will be glorified, says the Lord. LXX: Thus says the Lord Almighty: Set your hearts upon your ways, go up to the mountain, and cut wood (the rest is the same). Again, I command you, as I had done before, to set your hearts upon your ways, and consider all that you do, and leaving behind the desire for your humble dwellings, go up to the mountain where there are no wood to burn, but wood that will be useful for the work of my house. And know that I will be pleased with what you do, if you do this attentively. The Hebrews say that only the necessary wood for roofing was left standing after the walls of the temple were burned down. This is what they say. But for us, it is commanded that we do not place our hearts outside of our paths; but the things we had placed before, we are to place again on our paths, and after we have done this, we are to ascend from the hollow houses onto the mountain, so that when we reach the height of the mountain, where the necessary wood for building the temple of God is, we may cut it from the whole mountain of the holy Scripture, where various woods of virtues and paradise are planted, and we may build the temple of the Lord with good works and teachings of truth: and when it is built, may it please the Lord, and may he be glorified in it. Therefore, because these commands have been given to us to set our hearts on our ways, let us climb the reasonable mountain and, concerning each problem, seek suitable evidence from the testimonies of the Scriptures, cut it off, and build the house of wisdom within us; for after this has been constructed, the end of its building will be that the Lord may be glorified in us.
