(Verse 46, 47) Get up, let's go, behold the one who will betray me is approaching. While He was still speaking, behold Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great crowd with swords and clubs, sent by the chief priests and elders of the people. Let us not be found as if fearing and retreating, let us willingly go towards death, so that they may see the confidence and joy we will endure.
