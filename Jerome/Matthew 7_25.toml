(Verse 25.) And the rain descended, and the rivers came, and the winds blew, and they rushed upon that house, and it did not fall. This rain which seeks to overthrow the house is the devil. The rivers, all the Antichrists, who are against Christ. The spiritual winds of wickedness in heavenly places (Ephesians 6).
