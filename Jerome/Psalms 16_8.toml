Consider here that it is always in our power to set the Lord before us. The one who resembles the Savior in his integrity places God at his right side and says, he is at my right hand to keep me steadfast. The just person places the Lord at his right hand because he keeps his eyes on him whom he follows, but the sinner casts the word of the Lord behind him.… For the Lord Savior, or through the Lord Savior for his saints, God is always standing at the right side. The just person has, in fact, no left side, and in whatever directions he turns, “the angel of the Lord encamps round about those who fear him and delivers them.”
