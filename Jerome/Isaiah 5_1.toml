(Chapter 5, Verse 1.) I will sing now to my beloved the song of my cousin, of his vineyard. The prophet sings a lamentable song to the people of Israel, which he composed, about whom it is written in the Gospel: But when he saw it (no doubt Jerusalem), he wept over it, and said: If you also knew what is for your peace, for the days shall come upon you, and your enemies shall cast a trench about you, and compass you round, and straiten you, and cast you down to the ground, and your children with you (Luke 19:41 et seq.). And again: How often I have wanted to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, and you were unwilling? Behold, your house will be left to you desolate (Matthew 23:37, 38): to whom this which is now said in this song is similar: I will leave my vineyard. And that Christ is called beloved and most dear, which Aquila has interpreted as πατράδελφον, paternal uncle, or paternal cousin, the inscription of the forty-fourth psalm teaches us: A Song for the Beloved. And the voice of God the Father in the Gospel: This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased (Matthew 3:17). And in the sixty-seventh psalm we read: The Lord will give the word to those who preach with great power. The king of hosts, the beloved (Psalm 67:12, 13). Therefore, this beloved one composed a mournful song for his vineyard, which I will sing to my beloved and pitiable people. Or certainly it should be understood thus: I will sing to the Almighty God the Father a song of Christ, who is my cousin, that is, born from the same people as me. But when the vineyard of God is called the people of Israel, and at the end of this canticle we read: The vineyard of the Lord of hosts is the house of Israel, and the man of Judah is his pleasant plant. And in the seventy-ninth psalm (ver. 9): Thou hast brought a vineyard out of Egypt: thou hast cast out the Gentiles, and planted it. In the Gospel also, almost in the same words in which the Prophet now speaks, the Lord related a parable: There was a certain householder who planted a vineyard, and surrounded it with a hedge, and digged in it a press, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, etc. (Matth. XXXI, 33) . And in Jeremiah we read: I have planted you a fruitful vineyard, all true: how then have you turned into bitterness, a foreign vineyard (Jerem. II, 21)? Therefore Jerusalem, as we have said, laments: and in the prophetic speech, its ruin is sung. Moreover, a different song has been composed for the Church and the once-gentile people, of which we read in the Psalms: Sing to the Lord, all the earth, proclaim day after day his salvation. Declare his glory among the nations, his marvelous deeds among all peoples. He has shown his salvation, and revealed his righteousness in the sight of the nations. Sing to the Lord a new song, for he has done marvelous things.

A vineyard has been made for my beloved in the horn of the son of oil. This is translated by Theodotion and Aquila according to the Hebrew: but Symmachus, in his own way, more explicitly: A vineyard has been made for my beloved in the horn, in the midst of the olive trees. Moreover, the Seventy interpreted the meaning more than the word: A vineyard has been made for my beloved in the horn, in a fertile or rich place, for πίων signifies both. And truly, there is nothing more fertile than the Promised Land, if you consider all its width, from the river of Egypt to the great river Euphrates, against the east: and towards the northern region up to Mount Taurus and the Zephyrium of Cilicia, which overlooks the sea. But we often read that horn signifies kingdom and power, as it is written in the Gospel: He has raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David (Luke 1:69). And, In you we will scatter our enemies like chaff with a horn (Psalm 44:6). And in Zechariah, four horns represent four powerful kingdoms (Zechariah 1:18). The Hebrews explain this passage as follows: The vineyard planted in the horn is Christ, that is, in a strong and lofty place, which is called the son of oil, either because it needs God's mercy and is sustained by his help, or because it has shed the light of God's knowledge to all nations.
