(Verse 17 and onwards) 'And he led me to the outer court, and behold, treasuries, and a pavement laid with stone in the court all around: thirty treasuries around the pavement. And the pavement in front of the gateways, at the gateways, was lower. And he measured the width of the gateway from the front of the lower gate to the front of the inner court outside, one hundred cubits on the east side and on the north side. Seventy: And he brought me into the inner court, and behold, chambers, and the posts of the court all around, thirty chambers by the posts. And there was a porch in front of the gateways, and there were posts along the front of the gateways, below the columns.' And he measured the width of the atrium from the place that was under the outer gate to the inner gate: under the outer gate that faced the outside, one hundred cubits, and it turned towards the east. For the chambers, thirty, which were turned into seventy, or treasury rooms and cellars, as Aquila interpreted, Symmachus placed platforms. And for one hundred cubits of the outer space, which extended to the Eastern gate, the same number of cubits in Hebrew, and it is said to extend to the North: but in the Seventy, the name of the North has been removed. Therefore, that man who had in his hand a measuring line and a reed of measurement, and stood at the gate, among other things that the prophets showed to the sight, after the courtyard of sixty cubits, and another vestibule of the inner gate which measured fifty cubits, led the prophet to the outer courtyard, or as it is contained in the Septuagint, he brought him to the inner courtyard. And I marvel greatly, according to the literal and Septuagint text, how after the outer courts, which measure sixty and fifty cubits, there is an inner court which extends in width one hundred cubits: unless, of course, according to mystical understanding and the progress of those who enter, the inner things in teachings are broader. But upon entering the inner courtyard, or upon being led to the outer courtyard, as is stated in Hebrew, he immediately saw thirty chambers or treasuries, or as Symmachus interprets, exedras, which had been prepared for the dwelling of the Levites and priests, and a pavement adorned with living stones or intercolumnia, to show that the inner or outer courtyard had a row of columns in front of the entrance, and a pavement in front of the gates, or a portico behind the gates. In these colonnades, I believe that the columns were arranged in order, so that there were colonnades in front of the treasuries, and columns supporting the colonnades in front of the facades of the colonnades. The pavement, which was laid with stones, extended in front of the atrium’s colonnades, lower in elevation than the colonnades, and had the same length as the building of the chambers. And the same man, in whose hand there was a measuring line and a reed, measured from the face of the lower gate, or as the Seventy translate it, the outer gate, to the front of the atrium or the inner gate, one hundred cubits towards the east, and, as it is said in Hebrew, towards the north. From which we understand that Evangelical saying which is narrated by the Savior (Matthew 15), sowing in the field of the mind good seeds, which multiplies fruits according to the variety of virtues in thirtyfold, sixtyfold, and hundredfold, agree with the prophecy of this place. And here the thirtieth, sixtieth, and hundredth number are mentioned, so that by these steps we may be able to reach perfect knowledge; but only in such a way that the fiftieth number leads us to the inner parts of the Church, which, after the completion of the seven weeks of the Sabbath, broke forth into the day of the resurrection. But they are called gazophylacia, which are full of spiritual riches, of which it is written: The redemption of a man's soul, his own riches (Prov. XIII, 8). About which also the Apostle Paul congratulates his disciples, that they are full of every word and all knowledge (Philippians I). However, in the Persian language, gaza is the term for riches. Or certainly, the thalami, which in Greek are called παστοφόρια, show the prepared chambers for the arrival of the bridegroom, which were thirty in number, in order to demonstrate the perfect age of the inhabitants. And the pavement was laid with stone, so that the feet of the inhabitants, who were sinners, would not be polluted by mud, dirt, and the dust. But rather, the stones on which the temple of God is built, were walked upon. Whether the spaces between the columns were in front of the doors of the chambers, which supported the building placed on top. These are the columns, of which even the Apostle Paul writes: They gave me and Barnabas their right hands, Peter and John, who seemed to be columns (Gal. II, 9). And in another place: The pillar and foundation of truth (1 Timothy 3:15). And in the Book of Revelation we read: He who conquers, I will make him a pillar in the temple of my God, and he shall never go out of it (Revelation 3:12). Therefore, the pavement that was in front of the gates, which we have already mentioned, or the covered walkway behind the gates, which protected the inhabitants of the chambers from rain, was lower. For always those things which are lower are placed in higher places, so that we may be able to arrive at mystical and secret things, and those full of spiritual riches, through ascent and steps. And the number is full and perfect in the number of ten decades, which also multiplies the seed of Isaac by a hundred grains (Gen. XXVI). But because he was in the land, and still he could say: I am a stranger, and a sojourner like all my fathers (Psal. XXXVIII, 13), it is recounted that he sowed barley, and harvested a hundredth of the grain. For the grain of wheat had not yet died in the earth, which would make many grains (Matth. XIII, Joan. XII), and to satisfy the hunger of the Jewish people hearing the word of God, He fed them with the bread that descended from heaven (Amos VIII, Joan. VI). However, how one hundred cubits were not only towards the Eastern gate, but also towards the Northern gate, the following testimony will demonstrate.
