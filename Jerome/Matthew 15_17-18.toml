(Ver. 17, 18.) Do you not understand that everything that enters the mouth goes into the stomach and is expelled into the sewer? But the things that come out of the mouth come from the heart, and those defile a person. All the passages of the Gospels among heretics and evil-doers are full of scandals. And some people falsely accuse this statement, saying that the Lord, ignorant of physical processes, thinks that all foods go into the stomach and are digested there: whereas immediately after being ingested, the nourishment is distributed through the limbs and veins, as well as the marrow and nerves. And so, many people who suffer from a constant stomach disorder, immediately vomit what they have eaten after meals and snacks, and yet they are still corpulent: because at the first touch, more liquid food and drink are poured through the limbs. But while these people want to criticize the ignorance of others, they show their own. For although a thin and liquid food, when it has been cooked and digested in the veins and limbs, passes through the hidden passages of the body, which the Greeks call πόροι, and goes to the lower regions and into the intestines.
