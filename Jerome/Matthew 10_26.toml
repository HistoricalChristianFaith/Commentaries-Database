(Verse 26) For nothing is hidden that will not be revealed, and nothing secret that will not be known. And how in the present age the vices of many are not known? But about the future time it is written, when God will judge the secrets of men, and will illuminate the hiding places of darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of hearts. And the meaning is: Do not fear the cruelty of persecutors, and the rage of blasphemers, for the day of judgment will come, in which both your virtue and their wickedness will be demonstrated.
