(Verse 6) The voice (of the common people) cries out from the city, the voice from the Temple, the voice of the Lord giving retribution to his enemies. They put "LXX" in place of "cries out" and "clamor", and so on. We want to know what the confusion of the Jews is, who said: Let the Lord be glorified, so that we may see your joy and the triumphs of your king, not in vain through promises, but with our own eyes. The voice, he says, of the cry from the city: undoubtedly it signifies Jerusalem surrounded by the Roman army and divided internally into three factions, when one occupied the Temple and possessed all things previously sacred, fighting against external enemies and internally against fellow citizens. At that time, both in the city and in the Temple, the cries of priests and Levites, as well as the cries of the common people, women, and children, were heard when the Lord fulfilled His promise of vengeance against His enemies, fulfilling the prophecy: 'Your house shall be left to you desolate' (Luke 13:35), and that prophecy: 'I have left My house.' When the leaders of the temple, with voices harmonizing like angels, said: 'Let us depart from these seats.' About which not only Josephus, a writer of Jewish history, testifies but also many centuries before the Psalmist, saying: I have seen iniquity and contradiction in the city (Ps. 54:10), which surrounds its walls all day and all night, so that the city would be overturned (Mic. 3), and another prophecy would be fulfilled: Zion will be plowed like a field, and Jerusalem will be left like a hut in a cucumber field (Isa. 1:8).
