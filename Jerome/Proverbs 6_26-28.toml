We read in Proverbs, “The eyes of the harlot, the snare of the sinner.” “Anyone who even looks with lust at a woman has already committed adultery in his heart.” There are as many snares as there are sins; as many hunters as there are snares.

We must notice the apostle’s prudence. He did not say, it is good not to have a wife, but it is good not to touch a woman: as though there were danger even in the touch, as though he who touched her would not escape from her who “hunts for the precious life” and causes the young man’s understanding to fly away. Can a man take fire in his bosom, and his clothes not be burned? Or can one walk upon hot coals, and his feet not be scorched? As then he who touches fire is instantly burned, so by the mere touch the peculiar nature of man and woman is perceived, and the difference of sex is understood.
