"Enjoy
life with the wife you love through all the fleeting days of your life that He
has granted you under the sun, all of your futile existence; for that is your
compensation in life and in your toil which you exert under the sun. "Follow wisdom and knowledge of the Scriptures, while
you are joined in matrimony to your wife, as it is said in Proverbs: "love
her and she will serve you: embrace her and she will embrace you too" [Prov. 4, 8.]. But the day of vanity, the day of this world
means nothing. The apostle mentions this
too, and he says, "live life with the woman that you love", but this
is said in ambiguity, either live or contemplate life both you yourself and
your wife with you, for you will not be able to live life alone without such a
wife, or consider each one and live life, and consider the woman in the days of
your vanity. And he words this
carefully, so that we seek the true life with our wife and wisdom in the days
of our vanity. For this is our lot and
the fruit of our toil, if we, retired, are able to find this true life.
