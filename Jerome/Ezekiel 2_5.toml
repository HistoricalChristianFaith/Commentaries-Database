(Verse 5.) And you shall say to them: Thus says the Lord God: If perhaps they will listen, and if perhaps they will be quiet, for the house is provoking, and they will know that there was a prophet among them. Something similar is written in Jeremiah: If perhaps they will listen and do penance. (Jer. XXVI, 3). And in the Gospel: Perhaps they will fear my son. (Matth. XXI, 37). However, God speaks these things with a doubtful emotion, to demonstrate the free will of man, so that the foreknowledge of future evil or good does not make immutable what God knows will happen. For not because he knows what is about to happen, it is necessary for us to do what he predicted: but because we are going to do it of our own free will, he knows the future like God.
