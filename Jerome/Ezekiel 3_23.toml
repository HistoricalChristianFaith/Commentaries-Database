This is the meaning of the verse, “Because you have been strengthened by the sight of the majesty of the Lord, never fear anything and do not be frightened of anyone, and go back to your own house, whether it is for your bodily needs, as some people regard them, or as a sign of imminent danger.”

(Verse 23.) And I arose ((Vulg. arose)) and went out into the field, and behold there the glory of the Lord was standing, as the glory that I saw by the river Chobar. At the Lord's command, it enters and at the Lord's command, it goes out, and it sits among those who sit; for those who stand could not hear him. And going out into the width of the field, he saw the standing glory of the Lord, which he had seen before walking and lifting itself up, and sometimes standing. Because next to the river of this age, called Chobar, which can be interpreted as very serious, glory was seen: which signifies that all the glory of this world overflows and does not have a stable position. But the standing and enduring glory of the Lord, when seen with the standing Prophet in the field, could not stand nor be seen amidst the captives.
