The Hebrew gives the historical sense for the Jews [the Red Sea overcoming Pharaoh], yet this includes another sense, since the One who who did these things now also leads those redeemed and freed by your blood into Zion and into the heavenly Jerusalem—into the church that you have prepared by your blood.… This is what the Hebrew teaches. The rest of the meaning is found through reading the Septuagint concerning Jerusalem, that is, the sinful soul is provoked to put on the strength of God’s arm and to take on the former works such as it did before the fall, when the soul was illumined.
