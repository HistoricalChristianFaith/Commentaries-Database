For the netherworld and death will neither confess nor praise you, according to what is written: “In the netherworld, who will confess you?” Confession in this instance, moreover, is received not as an act of penance but as an offering of glory and praise, as we read in the Gospel: “I praise you Lord, Father of heaven and earth.” He also says: “They who descend to the pit will not hope for your truth,” which is better than the Septuagint’s “will not hope for your mercy.” For he who is in the grave hopes not for the truth of judgment but for the mercy of God, ultimately when the Savior will descend to the netherworld to liberate the captives from it.
