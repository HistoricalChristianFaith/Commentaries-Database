(Verse 8, 9.) Therefore, wait for me, says the Lord, in the day of my resurrection in the future: because I will gather the nations and gather the kingdoms to judge them, and I will pour out my indignation, all the fury of my wrath, for in the fire of my zeal all the earth shall be consumed. For then I will restore to the peoples a pure speech, that they may all call upon the name of the Lord and serve Him with one accord. LXX: Therefore wait for me, says the Lord, on the day of my resurrection as a testimony: for my judgment is in the gatherings of the nations, to receive kings, to pour out all my wrath upon them, the fury of my anger; for in the fire of my zeal all the earth will be consumed, for then I will turn to the peoples a pure language, that they may all call upon the name of the Lord, and serve him under one yoke. The Jews interpret these things as referring to the coming of Christ, whom they hope will come, and they say to all the gathered nations, with the Lord's fury poured out upon them, the earth will be devoured in the fire of his zeal. And just as before the building of the tower, when one language was spoken by all people, so now with all turned to the worship of the true God, speaking in Hebrew, the whole world will serve the Lord. But we, who do not follow the letter of the West, but the life-giving Spirit, and do not listen to Jewish fables, hear from the Lord: Prepare, rise early: all their clusters are scattered; and we, prepared, say: My heart is ready, O God, my heart is ready (Ps. 56:8). And we hear in Proverbs the commandment: Prepare your work in the field (Prov. XXIV, 27). And that which is sacredly said in Leviticus (Chapter XVI), where on the seventh month, the tenth day of the month, Aaron offers a goat sent away, and living, and placing his hands upon its head, he curses upon it all the sins of the people of Israel, and delivers it into the hands of a prepared man, and sends it into the wilderness (we understand within ourselves), and preparing ourselves under the true command of the priest, we remove evil from the midst of the Church. And when we have done these things, the night passes, the day draws near, and as if walking properly in the day, we say: God, my God, I am awake to you from the light (Psalms 62:1). And immediately we conclude: In the morning, you will hear my prayer, in the morning I will stand by you, and I will see (Psalms 5:4, 5). For if we are not prepared, the sun of justice will not rise for us. But when the sun rises, all the clusters from the vineyard of the Sodomites are scattered and perish, so that not only the great bunches, but also what seemed small in us, may be dispersed by the shining lamp of Christ. And promising us a reward for all these things, God said: Expect me on the day of my resurrection as a testimony. For after our vices and sins, God will rise in us. And according to what He commands in another place: Be witnesses for me, and I am a witness, says the Lord God; and the boy whom I have chosen (Isai. XLIII, 10): the Father is a witness with the Son and the Holy Spirit, so that by the mouth of two or three witnesses, every word may be established (Deut. XVII). And it seems to me that the opinion stands in this way, and truth is confirmed by these three witnesses, rather than according to the letter. For there were two witnesses against Susanna (Dan. XIII), and against the Lord Himself (Matt. XXVI), and yet their words did not stand in their mouths. Likewise, the whole city testified against Naboth, but the agreement of wicked witnesses did not have the strength of truth, but the conspiracy of crime (III Reg. XXI). For, he says, it is my judgment to gather the nations together, to assemble the kings in the place of their punishment, to pour out my anger on them, all the fury of my wrath. The one who is lesser quickly deserves forgiveness, and mercy is close at hand. But the powerful endure torments with power. (Wisdom 6:6) From where the peoples and the multitude of nations gather for judgment; but the kings, that is, the leaders of perverse doctrines, will be brought for punishment, that all the fury of the Lord's wrath may be poured out on them. And this is not done out of any cruelty, as the bloodthirsty Jews think, but out of mercy and the counsel of a healer. For it follows: For in the fire of my zeal will all the earth be consumed. For the nations, gathered for judgment, and the kings, for punishment, so that wrath may be poured out upon them, not in part, but in whole, and wrath combined with fury, so that whatever is earthly, whatever belongs to the works of the earth, that is, of the flesh, may be consumed, laying waste all its brambles and thorny thickets, the fire of my zeal will devour it all. And then I will restore to the people their pure language, that every one may return to the ancient confession of the Lord, after having cast off error; and that in the name of Jesus, every knee may bow, of those that are in heaven, on earth, and under the earth, and that every tongue may confess that the Lord Jesus Christ is in the glory of God the Father. And having cast away the burdens and the bitumen which we had for stones and mud, with which we were building up the pride of our error against the Lord, let us receive the language which we formerly lost, and let us be under the yoke of Christ, who says: My yoke is sweet and my burden light. But it must be noted that in the place where we have translated, 'I will give peoples a chosen lip, for the chosen one,' the Septuagint said, 'in his generation, so that the earth may be understood.' And hence the error arose, because the Hebrew word 'Barura' which Aquila and Theodotion translated as 'chosen,' Symmachus interpreted as 'world.' The Septuagint read 'Badura,' thinking that the letter 'Resh' was a 'Daleth,' due to their strong similarity, which is distinguished by a small apex. Moreover, where we have been transferred to, on the day of my resurrection in the future, and all have interpreted, as a testimony. The Hebrew who instructed me in the Scriptures claimed that the word 'Laed' in the present context should be understood more as 'in the future' than as 'as a testimony.' For, what is written with the letters Ain and Dalet can be understood as 'future' and 'testimony.' We can also explain this passage in relation to the first coming of Christ, when all errors were removed, demons were defeated, and earthly works were destroyed, and the apostles spoke in all languages (Acts 2), and through the removal of the old error, one confession was restored. But even the kings who are destroyed and consumed by divine fire are regarded as leaders of perverse doctrines.
