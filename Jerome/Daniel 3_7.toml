At the outset the king admired the prophetâ€™s wisdom, and professed belief that his God is the God of all. But in a brief period of time he returned to his former self, like a dog to his vomit, as the Scriptures says Prov 26:11. (Theodoret of Cyrus) or the fact that in a polytheistic country many gods were worshipped. (Fr. Most) It is the higher ranks which stand in the greater peril, and those who occupy the loftier position are the	more sudden in their fall.
