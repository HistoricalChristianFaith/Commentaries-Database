(Verse 24 and following) And to Semeias the Nehelamite you shall say. And what follows: Thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: Since you have sent in your name letters to all the people who are in Jerusalem, and to Sophonias the son of Maasias the priest. And again from the Hebrew: And to all the priests (the Vulgate adds saying). And then the story continues: The Lord made you a priest to Joiada the priest, so that you may be a leader (or teacher and bishop) in the house of the Lord over every man seized and prophesying, to send him into punishment and into prison (or custody) and into the trap, which Symmachus translated as μόχλος, but Aquila put the Hebrew word itself, Sinac.

And why have you not rebuked Jeremiah of Anathoth, who prophesies to you? For he has sent to us in Babylon, saying: 'Build houses and live in them; plant gardens and eat their fruits.' So the priest Zephaniah read this book in the hearing of the prophet Jeremiah. Shemaiah of Nehelam, who was brought to Babylon with King Jehoiachin, also prophesied falsely to the people, saying that they would quickly return to Jerusalem. However, the following words of Jeremiah demonstrate that he was a false prophet: 'Thus says the Lord to Shemaiah of Nehelam, Because Shemaiah has prophesied to you, though I did not send him, and has made you trust in a lie, therefore thus says the Lord: Behold, I will punish Shemaiah of Nehelam and his descendants. He shall not have anyone living among this people, and he shall not see the good that I will do to my people, declares the Lord, for he has spoken rebellion against the Lord.' It is evident, then, that Jeremiah sent letters to those who were in Babylon, instructing them to build houses and dwell in them, to plant gardens and eat their produce, to take wives and have sons and daughters, and to seek the welfare of the city where they were in exile. He warned them not to listen to the false prophets among them, who were prophesying lies in the name of the Lord. Jeremiah knew that Shemaiah was one of those false prophets, so he sent a letter to Jerusalem addressed to Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah, the priest, and to the rest of the priests. In the letter, Jeremiah asked why he was not being reprimanded by Zephaniah, whose responsibility it was to distinguish between true prophets and false prophets. Jeremiah requested that Shemaiah be put in prison as a punishment for his lies, so that he would stop deceiving the people and causing more harm. Joiada was a priest who handed over the kingdom to Joash after the death of Athaliah, and he killed the priests of Baal (2 Kings 11; 2 Chronicles 23). This is therefore what it says: Why don't you imitate the priest Joiada and kill the false prophet Jeremiah? The Lord has established you as a successor to Joiada, to take care of the temple, and especially to discern those who speak with the Holy Spirit from those who speak with a demonic spirit. But the discernment of spirits is a gift of divine grace, as the Apostle John mentions (1 John 4). Why, he said, did you not rebuke Jeremiah of Anathoth? And because he himself deserved it as a false prophet, he turns it against the true prophet, and distorts the truth by lies. Thus, the more intelligent ones are considered sons of darkness to the sons of light in this generation. While we, who act with patience and await the salvation of the wretched, are preceded by the heretics, and they call us by their own name, leading the blind blind into the pit. He sent, he said, to us in Babylon, saying: It is far away. This is all that he lamented: why Jeremiah wrote the truth against his own lie, that it was a long way off, and that they would return to Jerusalem after seventy years: from where they should build houses, plant orchards, and eat their fruits, take wives, and have children, as the past speech narrated. When the priest Zephaniah received these letters, which were specifically written to his name, he read them to Jeremiah, rebuking him in a way and reproaching the reading itself, questioning why he dared to write such things in Babylon.
