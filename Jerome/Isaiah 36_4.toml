And the Rabshakeh told them: “Say to Hezekiah, ‘Thus says the great king, the king of the Assyrians,’ ” and other things that are contained in the history. In this, the Rabshakeh is to be regarded as presumptuous because, like some sort of contrary power, he is imitating the habit of the prophets, inasmuch as they customarily use “Thus says the Lord” as a preface to display the authority and greatness of the speaker, whereas he now says, “Thus says the great king, the king of the Assyrians.”

The accusation of the Rabshakeh against Hezekiah is evidence that with all the cities of Judah taken captive he would still be confident in the Lord, as he said to the people: “Do not be afraid, nor quake at the king of the Assyrians and all the great multitude that he has with him. For we have a great deal more with us than he has with him. With him is the arm of flesh, but with us is the Lord our God, our help, who will fight for us.” And the people were encouraged, it says, by these words of Hezekiah the king of Judah, which is why the Rabshakeh wanted to destroy what Hezekiah had created, so he said to the people, “Do not let Hezekiah seduce you,” and “Do not let him cause you to rely upon the Lord God.”
