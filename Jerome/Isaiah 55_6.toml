Seek him while he can be found, while you are in the body and as long as an opportunity for penitence is provided, and seek him not in any particular place but in faith. Just how God is to be sought we learn elsewhere.… “Taste of the Lord in goodness, and in simplicity of heart seek him.” … For it is not enough to seek the Lord and while there is a time of penitence to find him and to call on him while he is near—unless the ungodly also leave their former ways and leave the old ways of thinking for those of the Lord.
