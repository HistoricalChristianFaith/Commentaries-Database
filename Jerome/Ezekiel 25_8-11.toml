(Verse 8 onwards) This is what the Lord God says: Because Moab and Seir have said, 'Look, just like all the other nations, the house of Judah is also ours,' therefore I will expose Moab's shoulder, including its cities, with the renowned land of Beth Jesimoth, Beelmeon, and Kariathaim. I will give it to the people of the East along with the Ammonites as their inheritance, so that the Ammonites will no longer be remembered among the nations. I will also execute judgments against Moab, and they will know that I am the Lord. LXX: Thus says the Lord God: Because Moab and Seir said, 'Behold, the house of Judah is like all the other nations.' Therefore, behold, I will open up the shoulder of Moab from the cities of its coastline, the choice land, the house of Beth Jasimuth, on the spring of the coastal city. I have given the sons of the East as an inheritance to the sons of Ammon, so that the sons of Ammon may not be remembered among the nations. And I will execute vengeance upon Moab, and they shall know that I am the Lord. What we have interpreted and added from the edition of Theodotion is not found in the Septuagint. But the Hebrews tell a ridiculous fable in this place. After the city was opened and the temple was unlocked, the sons of Ammon, Moab, and Seir entered the temple and saw the Cherubim protecting the propitiatory, and they said: Just as all nations worship idols, so Judah also has idols of its own religion; and therefore, they say, the Lord is angry and has delivered them into captivity. But we shall say this, that they also insulted the house of Judah when it was captured by the Chaldeans, thinking that, as in the case of other nations, there was no divine help there, and therefore the kingdom of Judah and the city of Jerusalem, deprived of God's protection, fell under the power of Babylon. Therefore, not long afterwards, but at present, the Lord threatens that he will destroy or open his strong and fortified cities in Moab, so that even the victorious Babylonians might enter them, and the cities in Moab might cease to exist, and the famous cities in its borders and territories might be destroyed: among which he names Beth Jeshimoth, and Beelmeon, and Kiriathaim: for which, I don't know what reason, the Septuagint translators rendered them as the house of Beth Iasimuth, though this word signifies a deserted village; and Beelmeon is still today a very large town in Moab, which they translated as "over the spring," and Kiriathaim, a coastal city; and it is handed down, together with the sons of Ammon, the sons of the East, to the Babylonians, namely, according to that interpretation which we have presented against the sons of Ammon. And I will give, he says, Moab as an inheritance, that just as there is no more memory of the sons of Ammon among the nations, so I will also execute vengeance and judgment on Moab, so that they will know that I am the Lord, who delivered Judah because of sin, and I will be an avenger against the sons of Ammon and Moab. However, Moab, which is interpreted as 'from the father,' and Seir, which is turned into hairy and rough, despises and scorns the house of Judah, in which true confession resides, and thinks that it can be easily overthrown, just as the fortifications of other cities are overthrown. And the Lord threatens to open himself up, or to dissolve all the strength of the Moabites, so that they may cease to have cities and may not at all trust in the art of dialectic. But all those boundaries, which they call headlands for the purpose of deceiving the waves, shall be destroyed; and the famous and chosen land of Beth Jesimoth, which means the house of solitude and desert, and Beelmeon, which also means having a spring, or above a spring, and Cariathaim, which the 70 translated as a maritime city, shall perish. For although they may have the strength of warriors, and may proceed to battle with the art of fighting, and may march surrounded and fortified on every side: nevertheless, their famous land is not a home of habitation, but a home of solitude. And what they think they have, a source of knowledge, and a maritime city, which can withstand all the storms of the world, promising patience and fortitude to themselves: yet they will be converted there, so that they may be handed over to the sons of the East, the true light in Christ; just as the sons of Ammon were handed over, who trusted themselves in a heretical multitude. And let us consider the progress and, in the very act of punishment, the mercy of God, so that the sons of Ammon, the sons of the East, may be delivered into inheritance. And let no heresy be named among the nations. But let them come to know, at the end of things, through the judgments and punishments for their arrogance, that the Lord is the one who governs all. Now, in order to prove that the current place of the Moabites is above the pride of the philosophers, about whom it is said: 'I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and the discernment of the discerning I will thwart' (1 Corinthians 1:19), a few examples from the prophets need to be repeated. Amos speaks: Thus says the Lord: Against three crimes of Moab, and against four I will not revoke it, because he burned the bones of the king of Edom into ashes (Amos II, 1). Indeed, whatever is of perverse teachings in the world, whatever pertains to earthly knowledge, and is considered to be strong, is subverted by the art of dialectic and dissolved like fire into ashes and embers, in order to prove that which was thought to be the strongest is nothing. But Isaiah rebukes the pride of Moab, saying: We have heard the pride of Moab: he is exceedingly proud; his pride is taken away (Isa. XVI). Jeremiah also, prophesying against all the nations, speaks directly to Moab: Because you trusted in your fortifications (Jerem. XLVIII, 7). And shortly after: You will have confidence in your glory. And again: How do you say, We are mighty? And then: The day of Moab is near, and his malice is exceedingly swift (Ibid. 14, 10). And more plainly: Declare how the glorious staff is broken, the rod of majesty (Ibid., 20). And again: The horn of Moab is broken. But these things are said so that under the name of Moab, the foolishness of the world, exalting itself to heaven, may be shattered by pride.
