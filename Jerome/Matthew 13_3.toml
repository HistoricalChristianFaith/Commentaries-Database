The crowd is not of a single mentality, for each person has a different frame of mind. He therefore speaks to them in many parables so they may receive different teachings depending on their frame of mind. Further, it should be noted that he did not speak everything to them in parables, but many things. For if he spoke everything to them in parables, the people would go away without gaining anything. Jesus mixes what is clear with what is obscure, so that through the things they understand they may be drawn toward the knowledge of the things they do not understand.

He was indoors, staying at the house, where he spoke to the disciples about that which is holy. He who sows the word of God then went out of his house that he might sow among the crowds. This means that the sower who sows is the Son of God the Father, sowing the word among the ordinary people. Note too that this is the first parable that was given with an interpretation. Furthermore, whenever the Lord speaks to his disciples and answers their questions indoors, he sows words that give us to understand nothing more or less or other than what he has accurately explained.

(Verse 3.) And he spoke many things to them in parables, saying: The crowd is not of one mind, but of various desires in each person. Therefore, he speaks to them in many parables, so that they may receive different teachings according to their various desires. And it should be noted that he did not speak all things to them in parables, but many. For if he had said everything in parables, the people would have left without benefit. He mixes the clear with the obscure, so that through what they understand, they may be provoked to understand those things which they do not understand.
