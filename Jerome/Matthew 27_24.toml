Pilate accepted the water in line with that prophetic saying, “I will wash my hands among the innocent,” that he might cleanse the works of the Gentiles by the washing of his hands and in some way separate us from the wickedness of the Jews who cried out “Crucify him!” What he intimated was this: I truly wanted to release an innocent man, but a riot is breaking out and the charge of treason against Caesar has been brought against me. So “I am innocent of the blood of this just man.”  The judge who was induced to pass judgment against the Lord does not condemn the defendant but puts the blame on the plaintiffs. He declares him to be a just man who was meant to be crucified. “See to it yourselves,” he says. “I am the administrator of the laws. It is according to your word that his blood is being shed.” .
