Pilate accepted the water in line with that prophetic saying, “I will wash my hands among the innocent,” that he might cleanse the works of the Gentiles by the washing of his hands and in some way separate us from the wickedness of the Jews who cried out “Crucify him!” What he intimated was this: I truly wanted to release an innocent man, but a riot is breaking out and the charge of treason against Caesar has been brought against me. So “I am innocent of the blood of this just man.”The judge who was induced to pass judgment against the Lord does not condemn the defendant but puts the blame on the plaintiffs. He declares him to be a just man who was meant to be crucified. “See to it yourselves,” he says. “I am the administrator of the laws. It is according to your word that his blood is being shed.”

(Verse 24) But Pilate, seeing that he was accomplishing nothing, but rather that a tumult was taking place, took water and washed his hands before the people, saying: I am innocent of the blood of this just man: you shall see. Pilate took water, according to that prophetic saying: I will wash my hands among the innocent (Ps. 25:6); so that in the washing of his hands, the works of the Gentiles might be cleansed, and he might separate us from the impiety of the Jews, who cried out, crucify him, thereby attesting in a way that I indeed wanted to free the innocent man; but since sedition arises and an accusation of treason against Caesar is brought against me: I am innocent of the blood of this just man. The judge who is forced to pass sentence against Christ does not condemn the accused; but he accuses those who offer him, pronouncing that the one who must be crucified is just. He says, 'You will see. I am the minister of the laws: your voice sheds blood.'
