(V. 2 onwards.) And he said to me, 'What do you see?' And I said, 'I see, and behold, a golden lampstand, and its lamp on top of it, and seven lamps on it, with seven pipes to the lamps that are on top of it. And there are two olive trees by it, one on the right of the lampstand and one on its left.' Then I answered and said to the angel who talked with me, 'What are these, my lord?' And the angel who talked with me answered and said to me, 'Do you not know what these are?' And I said, 'No, my lord.' And he answered and said to me, 'This is the word of the Lord to Zerubbabel, saying: Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit, says the Lord of hosts. Who are you, O great mountain? Before Zerubbabel you shall become a plain. And he shall bring forth the capstone with shoutings of "Grace, grace to it!"' Then he said to me, 'What do you see?' And I said, 'I see, and behold, a golden lampstand, and a bowl on the top of it, and seven lamps on it, with seven lips on each of the lamps that are on the top of it.' And behold, two olive trees were standing by the lampstand, one on the right side and one on the left side. So I asked the angel who was speaking with me, 'What are these, my lord?' And the angel who was speaking with me replied to me, 'Do you not know what these are?' And I said, 'No, my lord.' Then he answered and said to me, 'This is the word of the Lord to Zerubbabel, saying: Not by might nor by power, but by My Spirit,' says the Lord of hosts. 'Who are you, O great mountain, before Zerubbabel? You will become a plain.' And I will bring out the stone of inheritance: the equality of grace shall be his grace. The angel who raised up Zacharias as if from a sleeping man, asks what he sees, so that when he responds, ignorant and questioning what he discerns, and says, 'What are these, my lord?' let us hear from him: This is the word of the Lord to Zorobabel: Not in an army, nor in strength; but in my spirit, says the Lord. Let us therefore discuss each point in order, first what it seems to the Hebrews, from whom we have learned in the Old Testament: then through these steps let us ascend to the heights of the Church. The solid golden candlestick represents the Law, that is, the νόμον. And the lamp, that is, the flame shining and sparkling at the top of the candlestick, represents Christ, who is the head of the Law and illuminates the entire world. The seven lamps on the candlestick represent the seven graces of the Holy Spirit, which we mentioned above, because it is said that in one stone there are seven eyes. There is no doubt that the Law was written with the inspiration of the Holy Spirit. However, the seven infusions in which there is oil, which is put into lamps that shine on the candelabrum, are understood to mean that these seven graces descend from heaven to humans through the Law. But the two olive trees on the candelabrum, on the right and left side, between which the central lamp shines, are interpreted as the Law and the Prophets. And when the prophet narrated his vision, not knowing what he was seeing, he asked the angel who was speaking in himself, namely the sense illuminated by God. For this is our angel, who intelligently understands, and reveals to us the will of God, and says: What are these, my lord? But the angel does not explain the vision to the prophet, as he had been asked; but he asks the inquirer again: Do you not know what these are? And when he replied, I do not know: he himself also replied; This is the word of the Lord to Zerubbabel saying: Not by an army, nor by strength, but by my spirit, says the Lord. Therefore, the word of the Lord to Zerubbabel, who spoke not in the army, nor in strength, but in my spirit, he is the interpretation of the vision: not in the army, nor in the multitude of warriors, but in the spirit of God, the people are to be led back and more fully restored, and the adversaries are to be devastated. And what follows: Who are you, great mountain, before Zerubbabel, to become level ground? This is understood as a saying to the devil, who stood at the right hand of Jesus, to oppose him, and he was lifted up against Zerubbabel and the people of Judah. But he was brought low and humiliated; and Israel is trampled underfoot, for God will bring forth the chief stone, Christ his Son, who has always been a help to the people of Israel. And by his grace, that is, the stone, he will equal the grace that he always exercised towards their ancestors. We find these things said by the Hebrews. Now let us discuss what has been written by the learned men in the Commentaries. The golden candlestick (which some call the candelabrum) is understood to represent the Church, which in the Holy Scriptures seeks the meaning and intention rather than the words themselves. The fact that gold is understood in a figurative sense is shown in the later part of the 67th psalm, where it is said that the shoulders of the dove radiate with the brilliance or gleam of gold. They understand the lamp itself to represent Christ, who shines in the Church and who said of himself: 'No one lights a lamp and puts it under a bushel (Matt. V, 15),' that is, under the measure of the Law; but on a candlestick, that is, on the freedom of the gospels, so that it may shine for all who are in the house. The seven lamps and their pouring vessels (also called 'suffusoria') symbolize and represent the grace of the Holy Spirit, through which the Church receives the oil of God's mercy and all virtues. The two olive trees on the candlestick symbolize Moses and Elijah, who spoke with the Lord on the mountain and foreshadowed what would happen to him in Jerusalem (Matthew 17). For the entire law and the prophets preach about the passion of Christ. Others interpret the two olive trees on the right and on the left as the Law and the Gospel, so that the Gospel is on the right and the Law is on the left. Concerning the right and left, it is said in the Song of Songs: His left hand is under my head, and his right hand embraces me (Song of Songs 2:6). But many of our people interpret the mountain as the devil and the Antichrist, who dares to stand before Zerubbabel (from whom Christ is to be born) and raise himself up, and say in the Gospel: All these things have been given to me, and I will give them to you if you will prostrate yourself and worship me (Matthew 4:9). He who prostrates himself at the Lord's feet, and makes the proud humble and the lowly, says: 'Get behind me, Satan, for it is written: You shall worship the Lord your God, and him alone shall you serve' ( Ibid., 10, and Deut. VI, 13). And they give an example in the Gospel of the lunatic whom the apostles could not heal, they ask why they could not heal him, and they hear: Truly I say to you, if you have faith like a mustard seed, you will say to this mountain, move from here, and it will move; and nothing will be impossible for you. But this kind does not go out except by prayer and fasting (Matt. XVII, 19, 20). Here the mountain is clearly accepted as the devil. However, others, not without considerable rashness, interpret what is clearly spoken about the devil as referring to Christ, who is often called a mountain in the Holy Scriptures. It is not necessary to give examples, as there is a great abundance of them. But they are led into error because it is written in the Septuagint: Who are you, O great mountain, before the face of Zerubbabel, to be made level? Indeed, this mountain which is before the face of Zorobabel, that is, one who is descended from the lineage of Zorobabel, desires to correct the world itself. And of him it is said: 'I will bring forth the stone of inheritance of which it is written: You are the one who will restore my inheritance to me' (Psalm 15:5). And in another place: 'He has chosen for us his beautiful inheritance, the pride of Jacob whom he loved' (Psalm 46:5). And again: 'The portion of the Lord is Jacob, the line of his inheritance is Israel' (Psalm 105). And in the second Psalm: The Lord said to me, 'You are my Son, today I have begotten you. Ask of me, and I will give you the nations as your inheritance' (Psalm 2:7-8). But the Lord will bring forth the chief cornerstone, of which we read: 'In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God' (John 1:1). And: 'All things were made through him, and without him was not any thing made that was made' (John 1:3). And when he says, 'He will equalize grace to his grace,' he signifies this. We all have received from His fullness, and grace for grace, that is, grace of the Law, grace of the Gospel, so that believing in Israel may receive equal grace, and the people of the Gentiles as well. Hence, Gabriel speaks to Mary: 'You have found favor with the Lord' (Luke 1:30). And the apostle Paul writes: 'For by grace you have been saved' (Ephesians 2:8). And the evangelist John says: 'For the Law was given through Moses, but grace and truth came through Jesus Christ' (John 1:17).
