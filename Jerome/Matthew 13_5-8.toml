(Verse 5 and following) Some fell by the wayside: and the birds of the air came and devoured them. Others fell on rocky ground, where they did not have much soil, and immediately they sprang up, since they had no depth of soil. But when the sun rose, they were scorched. And since they had no root, they withered away. Others fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked them. Others fell on good soil and produced grain, some a hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty. Valentinus uses this parable to prove his heresy, introducing three natures: spiritual, natural or animal, and earthly; while there are actually four: one by the wayside, another rocky, a third full of thorns, and a fourth of good soil. We postpone the interpretation of it for a while with the disciples, wanting to hear privately what is said.
