(Verse 30, 31.) And Jesus warned them, saying, "See that no one knows." But when they went out, they spread the news about him throughout that whole land. And the Lord, fleeing the glory of boastfulness because of his humility, had commanded this. And they, because of the remembrance of his grace, cannot remain silent about the kindness. Note, therefore, that something contrary to what was commanded must have happened. These blind men are healed in the tenth place.
