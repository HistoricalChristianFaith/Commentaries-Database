"What
has been was already named, and it is known that he is but a man. He cannot contend with one who is mightier
than him." Clearly this is predicting the arrival of
the Saviour, since he writes 'he will be'; before he was seen in body his name
was already written in the Scriptures and was known by prophets and holy men of
God, since he was a man; and similar to this, since he is a man, he is not able
to walk with his Father. And in the
Gospel it says: "the Father, who sent me, is greater than me." [Ioh. 14, 28.] In the following passages it teaches not to
ask more than is written for us by Him, so that a man may not wish to know more
than is attested in the Scriptures. For
although we are ignorant of our condition and our life passes us by like a
shadow, and our future is undecided, it is not useful for us to strive for more
than we are able to attain. Some think
that this passage means that God already knows the names of all the men, who
will be in the future, and who will be enclosed within the body of
mankind. Nor is a man able to reply to
his creator, and ask why he has been made in this way or that. For however much more we seek, our vanity and
our unnecessary words are exposed all the more. 
Our choice does not come free from the foreknowledge of God, but precedes
the causes, why any one thing is done in a particular way.
