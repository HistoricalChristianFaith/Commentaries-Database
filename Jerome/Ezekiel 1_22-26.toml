(Verse 22 onwards) And the likeness above the heads of the living creatures was like the appearance of a crystal dreadful ice; extended above their heads was what appeared to be a firmament. Under the firmament their wings were straight, one toward another. Each of them had two wings that covered their bodies, and each one had two wings that covered one side. And I heard the sound of the wings, like the sound of many waters, like the sound of the Almighty God. When they walked, it was like the sound of a multitude, like the sound of a camp; and when they stood still, their wings were let down. For when the voice was being made above the firmament that was above their heads, they would stand and submit their wings. And above the firmament that was over their heads, there was a likeness of a throne, and above the likeness of the throne, there was a likeness as the appearance of a man from above. Wherever we would place ourselves, their wings were straight, and like the sound or voice of the exalted God, the seventy translated it. Their wings were extended and flying; and like a strong voice: which in Hebrew is called 'Almighty' (Saddai). Many things in this chapter and in other chapters have been omitted by them, which they have chosen to skip due to their length. But what we have interpreted more clearly, from one to another: each one covered their body with two wings, and the other likewise covered theirs, for which it is written in Hebrew, a man, on account of his sister, covered his body with two wings, and a man likewise covered his; therefore, after woman, man is put in the same person, so that we may not think of gender in heavenly things: since in one and the same way, according to the Hebrew usage, both man and woman are called the same. Moreover, there appears above four living creatures and as many wheels, the likeness of the firmament, which we call the sky, having the appearance of crystal, which is most pure, and is said to solidify from clean and shining waters by excessive coldness - as much as water is also constricted by frost and called κρύσταλλος in Greek. But it was fitting that in the higher things there be extraordinary purity, which protects all things, that is, rational and wise virtues, and the course of the four seasons, and the regions of the world, and the order of all things, and the preaching of the Gospel, which is understood in part and veiled in part. And the voice that is heard of flying wings, like the voice of many waters, which, according to the Apocalypse of John (Chapter XVII), signifies peoples, and gradually progresses as the voice of camps, and as the voice of the sublime God, which in Hebrew is called Saddai, and according to the Septuagint, the voice of the word; so that we may believe that the voice of the Son of God is everything that is proclaimed in the world. But while the animals were standing, their wings were lowered. For they could not bear the resonating voice of Almighty God in the heavens, but they stood and marveled; and with their silence, they demonstrated the power of God, who sat upon the firmament. The firmament below had the likeness of crystal, but the firmament above appeared like a sapphire stone. The likeness of the sapphire stone was the throne of the one who sat in the likeness of a human. From this, we understand that the firmament, crystal, sapphire, and human are shown in resemblance, not in truth. However, many testimonies teach that the human should be understood as God the Father. Among these is the parable in the Gospel: A certain man planted a vineyard and leased it to farmers (Matthew 21:33). And shortly after: He sent his servants, and above all his son. Again: A certain man made a wedding feast for his son. Not that the son is excluded from the kingdom, of which Isaiah wrote: I saw the Lord sitting on a high and lofty throne. And John said: Isaiah said these things because he saw the glory of the Son of God; but he reigns in the Father and the Son. For all the Son of the Father are, who is the image of the invisible Father God (Colossians 1:15). For also in Daniel, God the Father is portrayed sitting (Daniel 7), and the Son of man is offered to him, that he may receive the kingdom. And in the Apocalypse of John, the same things are written about the Son (Revelation 3:7). And in the battle of the first martyr Stephen, he is seen standing at the right hand of the Father. Of whom it is sung in the psalm: The Lord said to my Lord: Sit at my right hand. I will make your enemies the footstool of your feet (Psalm 110:1). Just as the most pure and shining things are shown in the heavenly bodies, which illuminate our seeing body, so in the sapphire, that is, in the throne of God, and above the firmament that we perceive as the sky, the hidden and secret and incomprehensible mysteries of God are revealed: He made darkness His hiding place (Psalm 18:11), and He is seen in the cloud and in the darkness. And in Exodus it is written: And under the feet of God there was as it were a work of sapphire stone, and as the appearance of the sky when it is most clear (Exodus 24:10). And the bride describes the beauty of the bridegroom in the Song of Songs: His belly is like a block of ivory, set on sapphire stone (Song of Songs 5:14). And in the Book of Revelation, the first foundation is jasper, the second sapphire (Revelation 21). And in the breastplate of the high priest, in the order and arrangement of each stone, the second order has carbuncle, sapphire, and jasper (Exodus 28). Concerning which we have spoken in part about the stones, in the Expositions of Isaiah.
