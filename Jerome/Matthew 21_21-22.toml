(Verse 21, 22.) And Jesus answered and said to them, Truly I say to you, if you have faith and do not doubt, you will not only do what was done to the fig tree, but even if you say to this mountain, 'Be taken up and cast into the sea,' it will happen. And all things you ask in prayer, believing, you will receive. The dogs of the Gentiles bark against us in their volumes, which they have left as a memorial of their own impiety, asserting that the apostles did not have faith because they were not able to move mountains. To which we will respond, many signs were done by the Lord, according to the testimony of St. John the Evangelist, which were written down, the world could not contain them all (John 21:25). Not that the world could not contain the books, which it can, even though they are many, in one small chest or bookcase; but rather that the magnitude of the signs cannot be borne by miracles and unbelief. Therefore, we believe that the apostles did these things, but they were not written down so as not to give greater occasion to unbelievers to contradict. Otherwise, let us ask them whether they believe in these signs that are written about or not. And when we see them as unbelievers, we will consequently prove that they will not believe in greater things if they do not believe in smaller things. This is against them. But let us understand the devil, who is called corrupt mountain by the prophet, as we have said before, proud and boasting against his Creator. And when it possesses the soul of a man and is rooted in it, it can be transferred by the apostles and those who are similar to the apostles into the sea, that is, into salty, turbulent, and bitter places that have no sweetness of God. And it is read in the Psalms: We will not fear when the earth is troubled, and the mountains are carried into the heart of the sea (Ps. XLV, 2).
