(Verse 15, 16) Therefore, the Lord says these things about the prophets who prophesy in my name, whom I did not send, saying: 'Sword and famine will not be in this land; by sword and famine those prophets will be consumed.' And the people to whom they prophesied will be thrown into the streets of Jerusalem, because of famine and sword. And there will be no one to bury them, their wives, their sons, and their daughters. And I will pour out their own evil upon them. Beware of false prophets, who by promising prosperity, deceive the people of God, so that they may perish and the deceived people may be destroyed in a similar way, and may lie in the streets of Jerusalem, trampling on the Lord's commandments, and may perish by hunger and sword, and there will be no one to bury them; nor may their disgrace be covered by the dust of repentance. For both the prophets themselves and the people, their wives and children, and all generations without any propagator will be in the dung heap. How many lie on the streets of Jerusalem! How many we see receiving their own misfortunes unburied, which, as the Lord pours out, they endure!
