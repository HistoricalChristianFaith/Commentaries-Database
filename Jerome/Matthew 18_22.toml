The Lord had said above, “See that ye despise not one of these little ones, "and had added, “If thy brother sin against thee” making also apromise, “If two of you” by which the Apostle Peter was led to ask, "Lord, how oft shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him?” And to his question he adds an opinion, “Until seven times?”.
Or understand it of four hundred and ninety times, that He bids us forgive our brother so oft.
