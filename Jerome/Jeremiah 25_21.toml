(Verse 21.) Idumea, and Moab, and the sons of Ammon, and all the kings of Tyre, and all the kings of Sidon. Idumea, where the mountains of Seir are, and which is called Edom in Hebrew (): Moab and Ammon, they are the sons of Lot, close to the Dead Sea. Tyre and Sidon are the chief cities on the coast of Phoenicia, which themselves were conquered by the Babylonians when they came, among which Carthage is a colony. Hence the Phoenicians are also called the Phoenicians, their language being for the most part closely related to the Hebrew language.
