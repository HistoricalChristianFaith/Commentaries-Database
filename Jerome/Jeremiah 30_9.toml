This is the David of whom the Gospel speaks: “It will be granted to us, that, liberated from our enemies, we may serve him without fear in holiness and justice all of our days.” For, just as the first Adam and the second Adam are described according to the truth of the body, so also with David and the Lord and Savior. For, since everything that Mary gave to the Lord according to the flesh came from David, whatever was of the seed of David also took its origin and conception from the Holy Spirit. And that the Lord says, “I will break his yoke off of your neck, and I will destroy his hold,” is undoubtedly to be understood in reference to Nebuchadnezzar as a type of the devil. - "Six Books on Jeremiah 6.5.2–3"
