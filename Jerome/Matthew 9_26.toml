They that had mocked the Reviver were not worthy to behold the mystery of the revival; and therefore it follows, “And when the multitude was put forth, he entered, and took her by the hand, and the maid arose.”.
To this day the damsel lays dead in the ruler’s house; and they that seem to be teachers are but minstrels singing funeral dirges. The Jews also are not the crowd of believers, but of “people making a noise.” But when the fulness of the Gentiles shall come in, then all Israel shall be saved.
