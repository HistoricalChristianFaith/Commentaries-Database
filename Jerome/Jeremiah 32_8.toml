(Verse 8) And Anameel, the son of my uncle, came to me, according to the Word of the Lord, to the entrance (or courtyard) of the prison, and he said to me: Possess (or buy) my field, which is in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin, for the inheritance belongs to you, and you are a close relative to possess (or buy) it. What the word of the Lord had foretold through the prophet, immediately came to pass. Anameel came to me, by the grace of God, the son of my uncle, that is, the son of peace. But he came to the vestibule of the prison, and he said to me the things that the Lord had foretold to him. Now this priestly field, whose purchase and possession belonged to Jeremiah, is in Anathoth, in the land of Benjamin, where the obedience of the former resounds according to the Son of the Right Hand. And consequently, he desires its acquisition, in which the obedience and virtue of the Lord were evident. For this reason, the Seventy interpreted it as 'elder,' that is, 'elderly,' which does not fit in this context.
