(Ver. 4.) The sons of Javan were Elisha and Tarshish, Kittim and Dodanim. From them were divided the islands of the nations in their lands, each according to its language, its kindred, and its people. From the Ionians, that is, the Greeks, were born the Aeolians, who are called Aeolians: hence the fifth language of Greece is called Aeolian, which they call 'the fifth dialect.' Josephus considers Tarshish to be Cilicia, stating that the letter θ was mistakenly corrupted by later generations into τ: hence their metropolis is called the city of Tarsus, glorious to the Apostle Paul. Cethim, they are the Cetians, from whom even today the city of Cyprus is also called Citium. Dodanim, the Rhodians: for so the Septuagint translators have rendered it. Let us read the books of Varro on Antiquities, and those of Sisinnius Capito, and the Greek Phlegon, and other most learned men: and we will see almost all the islands, and the shores of the whole world, and the lands near the sea, occupied by Greek settlers: who, as we have said, possess all the coastal areas from the mountains of Amanus and Taurus to the British Ocean.
