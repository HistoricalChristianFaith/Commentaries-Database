(Verse 16.) But Jesus replied, saying: O unbelieving and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you? How long shall I bear with you? Bring him here to me. Not because he was overcome by weariness, and gentle and meek, who did not open his mouth like a lamb before the shearer (Isaiah 53), nor did he burst forth in words of fury; but because, in the likeness of a physician, if he sees a sick person behaving contrary to his instructions, he may say: How long shall I come to your house, until I lose the skill of my craft, you commanding one thing and doing another? But he is not angry with the man, but with the fault; and through one man he accuses the Jews of unfaithfulness, so that he immediately says: Bring him here to me.
