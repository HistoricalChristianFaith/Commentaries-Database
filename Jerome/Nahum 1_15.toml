(Verse 15.) Behold, upon the mountains are the feet of the messenger of good news and of the announcer of peace. Celebrate, O Judah, your festivals, and fulfill your vows, for Belial will no longer pass through you; everything has perished. I will postpone the discussion of the Septuagint translators for a little while, because even the chapters themselves have been confused by the variety of interpretations. And when I briefly explain the history, I will adapt their edition to my own style. In the book of Paralipomenon, it is written that when Sennacherib besieged Jerusalem, they were unable to celebrate the Passover in the first month (2 Chronicles 32). However, after Sennacherib was defeated by the angel and news of his death spread, they celebrated the day of Passover with great joy in the second month. Therefore, do not be anxious, O Judah, who reigns in Jerusalem, for your enemy has been slain in the temple of his God. Behold, a messenger comes to you, running through the mountains and hills, and from a high tower far away, proclaiming the death of Sennacherib; his city has been delivered from his rule. Celebrate the feast, fulfill the vows for the death of the enemy, which you promised to God: the transgressor and apostate will no longer pass through you, for this is Belial, as it is interpreted. All has perished, that is, the army, the king, and the empire of the Assyrians have completely fallen. And this is indeed according to the literal meaning. Furthermore, according to the interpretation, it is said to the Church, it is said to the souls confessing the Lord, because the devil who used to plunder you and oppress you with a heavy yoke, perished in the idols and with the idols he had made: celebrate your festivities, and render your vows to God, singing with the angels incessantly: for Belial will no longer pass through you, of whom the Apostle also says, What partnership does Christ have with Belial (2 Corinthians VI, 15)? Because, with the destruction of Nineveh, everything was lost. If ever there is a severe persecution, like under Valerian, Decius, Maximian (or Maximus), and the Lord's vengeance appears against his adversaries, let us say to the Church: Celebrate, O Judah, your festivals, and fulfill your vows, etc.

LXX: Celebrate, O Judah, your festivities, fulfill your vows, for they will no longer oppose you to pass into old age: it is complete, it is accomplished: it ascends, blowing onto your face, delivering from tribulation. Once I said, by the variety of interpretation, the chapters themselves are defined differently, and I am not able to reconcile the sense of the chapters with the Hebrew interpretation. Therefore, what is now said is of this kind: O Ecclesiastic, because the name of your adversaries will no longer be sown, and their rod is broken; and the chains are scattered, and the one who announces peace to you has come, celebrate your festivities, not in wine and feasts, as the carnal Jews esteem, but in spiritual delights and the pleasure of a torrent. O Judah, fulfill your vows, for your enemies will no longer pass through to bring you to old age, that is, to make you bear the image of the old man. For what is old grows old, and what grows old is close to ruin. The world is fulfilled, the adversary is consumed: Christ comes to you, who first blew into your face when he fashioned you from clay, and after his resurrection also breathed into the faces of the apostles, saying, 'Receive the Holy Spirit' (John 20:22). He is the one who delivers you from tribulation. For the destruction of Nineveh, and as the world passes away, so too will tribulation pass.
