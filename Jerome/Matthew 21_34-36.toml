(Verse 34 and following) But when the time of the fruit drew near, he sent his servants to the vinedressers, that they might receive the fruits of it. And the vinedressers took his servants, and beat one, and killed another, and stoned another. Again, he sent other servants more than the first: and they did unto them likewise. And last of all he sent unto them his son, saying, They will reverence my son. But when the vinedressers saw the son, they said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and let us seize on his inheritance. And they caught him, and cast him out of the vineyard, and slew him. We read the letter of Paul to the Hebrews (Heb. XI) ; and from it we learn in great detail the sufferings endured by the servants of the Lord.
