(Judges 5:9-10) My heart loves the leaders of Israel. It should be noted that in Hebrew, not leaders, but teachers is read. This is spoken by Deborah in the person of God, that God loves the teachers who study the law of God. Of whom it follows: You who offered yourselves willingly among the people, bless the Lord. Of whom it has also been said above in that place where it says: You who willingly offered your lives from Israel, etc. You who ride on bright donkeys. In Hebrew, female donkeys. And you sit in judgment. In Hebrew, sitting on judgment. And you walk on the road, speak where the chariots collide, and the army of the enemies is suffocated, there the righteousness of the Lord, the strength of Israel, is proclaimed. The people of Israel who ride on donkeys are called ascenders; but the female donkeys on which they ride are called the teachers of the tribes of Israel, on whose doctrine the rest of the people are said to ascend like on donkeys, that is, to find rest. They are called asses themselves, that is, they walk like an ass in the law, sitting on judgment, that is, on the law. They are also said to sit on judgment, that is, on the law, and to walk in the way under the law, because they would by no means exceed the path of the law. Therefore, Deborah, provoked the people who rested on these asses, that is, on these teachers, to bless the Lord, and she said: Speak, that is, praise. And as if they were asking: where and when will we praise the Lord? she responded: Where the chariots collided, and the army of the enemy was drowned, there let the justice of the Lord be recounted, the strength of merciful Israel; as if she said: Although God is always and everywhere to be praised; nevertheless, he is now to be praised and blessed by us, who overturns our enemies, just as he did with the Egyptians in the Red Sea.
