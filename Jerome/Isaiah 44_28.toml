And he who attacks Jerusalem and destroys Babylon, says also to Cyrus the king of the Persians, who first destroyed Babylon and the Chaldeans, “You are my shepherd,” or as the Septuagint translates, “that you might be wise.” The cause of this difficulty is clear. For the Hebrew word ro’i, if we read a letter res (r), means “my shepherd,” if with a letter daleth (d), then “knowing or understanding,” whose similarity is only distinguished by a little apex, and on account of this the two words are often confused. It is written at the start of Ezra, the prophet, that at the edict of Cyrus, the king of the Persians and Medes, the captivity of the people of Israel was ended and those who wanted to return were sent back to Jerusalem under Zerubabel son of Salathihel and Hiesu the son of Iosdech the high priest. The Lord inspired Cyrus to do his will and carry out his orders.
