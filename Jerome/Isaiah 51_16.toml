For the same verse we, following the Hebrew and Aquila, translated “I have put my words in your mouth, and in the shadow of my hands I have protected you as you lay out the heavens and establish the earth and say to Zion, ‘you are my people.’ ” Symmachus had, “I will put my words in your mouth, and in the shadow of my hand I will protect you—[the hand] with which I laid out the sky and founded the earth so that I might say to Zion, ‘You are my people.’ ” According to the Septuagint, it is spoken to all the souls of believers because, though created towards the image and likeness of God, it was unaware of its dignity. Instead, it feared man and the son of man who can only kill the body and did not understand that it is immortal.
