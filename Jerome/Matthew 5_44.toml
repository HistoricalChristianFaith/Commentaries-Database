(Verse 44.) But I say to you, love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who persecute and slander you. Many, considering the weakness of their own abilities and not the power of the saints, think that the commandments of God are impossible and say that it is enough to have virtues and not to hate enemies. However, they command to love more than human nature can endure. Therefore, it should be understood that Christ does not command the impossible, but the perfect: what David did to Saul and Absalom (1 Samuel 24 and 26, and 2 Samuel 18). Stephanus also, the martyr, prayed for those who were stoning him as enemies (Acts 7). And Paul desires to be accursed for his persecutors (Romans 9). Moreover, Jesus both taught and did these things, saying: Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing (Luke 23:34).
