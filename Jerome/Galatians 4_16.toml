He has finished his sentence elegantly, asking: “Have I become an enemy for preaching the truth to you?” He says this to show that his initial bodily ailment in preaching was not so much truth as a shadow and image of truth.… He has tempered this sentence and made it personal because he has addressed it to the Galatians in person.… Today also, so long as we … explain the Scripture according to the letter, we are praised and respected and held in admiration. But when we make a small attempt to provoke people personally to pass on to greater things, they stop acclaiming us and become resistant.
