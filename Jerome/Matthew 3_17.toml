It sate on the head of Jesus, that none might suppose the voice of the Father spoken to John, and not to the Lord.

The mystery of the Trinity is shown in this baptism. The Lord is baptized; the Spirit descends in shape of a dove; the voice of the Father is heard giving testimony to the Son.

(Verse 17) And behold, the heavens were opened for him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and coming upon him. And behold, a voice from heaven, saying: 'This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.' The mystery of the Trinity is demonstrated in the baptism: the Lord is baptized, the Spirit descends in the form of a dove, and the voice of the Father, testifying to the Son, is heard. The heavens are opened not by the opening of the elements, but by spiritual eyes; as Ezekiel also mentions in the beginning of his book that they were opened. And the dove also sat upon the head of Jesus, so that no one would think that the voice of the Father was made to John, not to the Lord.
