"Let not
your mouth bring guilt on your flesh, and do not tell the messenger that it was
an error. Why should God be angered by
your speech and destroy the work of your hands? 
"What the Hebrew
means is that if you are not able to do these things, do not promise to do
them. For the words do not transgress to
the spirit but are carried at once to the Lord by the angel present, who sticks
to one man only as a companion. You who
think to disregard God, since you have promised, you will anger Him, with the
result that all your work will be destroyed. 
But in that place where he says: "to bring guilt upon your
flesh" and he understood this, though not caring diligently, as if he had
said "let not your mouth cause you not to sin." But there seems to me however another
meaning, which is argued by those, who complain about the strength of the flesh
and say they are compelled by the necessity of the body to do those things that
they don't want to do, according to the apostle: "for I do not do what I
want, but what I do not wish" and so on. [Rom. 7, 15.] And so he says, 'don't seek vain excuses and
give occasion to your flesh to sin'. 
Then in that place where he says "and do not tell the angel that it
was a madness" Aquila takes the Hebrew word "segaga" to mean ignorance, and translates it with the Greek word "akousion", that is, not of ones
will. For if you say this, he says, you
provoke God, as if to say He is like the creator of evil and sin, and anger
Him, so that if you seem to have anything good, He will take it from your
possession. Or indeed he translates such
things with the meaning of reproof, so that you do those things, which are not
appropriate.
