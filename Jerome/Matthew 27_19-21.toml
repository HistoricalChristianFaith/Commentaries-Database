(Verse 19 onwards) Now while he was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent to him, saying, 'Have nothing to do with that righteous Man, for I have suffered many things today in a dream because of Him.' But the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitudes that they should ask for Barabbas and destroy Jesus. The governor answered and said to them, 'Which of the two do you want me to release to you?' They said, 'Barabbas!' Note that God often reveals dreams to the Gentiles; and that the testimony of the people is that Pilate and his wife confess the righteous Lord.
