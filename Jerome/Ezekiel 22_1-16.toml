(Chapter 22, Verses 1 onwards) And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: And you, son of man, do you not judge the city of blood, and show her all her abominations? And say: Thus says the Lord God: The city that sheds blood within herself, so that her time may come, and that has made idols against herself to defile herself. In your blood that was shed, you have sinned, and you have defiled yourself with your idols that you have made. You have brought near your days, and have come to the years of your punishment; therefore I have made you a reproach to the nations and a mocking to all the countries. Those who are near, and those who are far from you, will triumph over you (or mock you), you sordid noble, great in your destruction. Behold the princes of Israel, each one in his own arm was in you to shed blood. They have dishonored father and mother in you (or cursed father and mother). They have slandered the stranger among you. They have oppressed the orphan and the widow (or oppressed). You have despised my sanctuaries (Vulg. you have despised and polluted), you have profaned my Sabbaths. There were detractors (or thieves) in you to shed blood, and they ate on the mountains in you. They committed a crime (or, as it is more significantly in Hebrew, a heinous act), in your midst. They uncovered the shame of their fathers in you, and they humiliated the impurity of menstruation in you. And each one committed an abomination with the wife of his neighbor, and the father-in-law defiled his daughter-in-law wickedly. He oppressed (or humiliated) his own sister, the daughter of his father, in you. They received gifts from you to shed blood. You took interest and excess, and greedily slandered your neighbors (or and I will complete the fulfillment of your evil in your oppression); you have forgotten me, says the Lord God. Behold, I will clap my hands over your greediness which you have done, and over the blood which was shed in your midst. Will your heart endure, or will your hands prevail in the days I will bring upon you? I, the Lord, have spoken and I will act. I will disperse you among the nations and scatter you through the countries, and I will remove your impurity from you. I will possess you in the sight of the nations. (or according to the first edition of Aquila and Theodotion: And I will defile you, or according to Symmachus: And I will wound you in the sight of the nations) And you will know that I am the Lord. And you, he said, son of man (I will use the familiar term for you), judge the city of blood, and show it all its abominations, so that it may know that it deserves its imminent captivity, and that it has brought on its own ruin through much bloodshed. First and foremost among its sins, you have worshiped idols instead of God; and you have also defiled with your own hands the time appointed for your years, which was long spoken of and delayed, in order to bring about repentance. But you, according to your hardened heart, treasure up wrath for yourself in the day of wrath (Romans II). Therefore I have made you a reproach to the nations and a mockery to all the lands around you, both near and far. They will triumph over you and mock you. Filthy, noble, great in destruction. Filthy because you have ceased to be clean. Noble in evil, for once you surpassed all cities in nobility. Great in destruction: the higher you were, the harder you fell. And meanwhile, without mentioning everything else, I will mention a few things that have happened to you. Your rulers, judging not with justice but with the strength and might of the arm, shed innocent blood in you. Others have treated their father and mother with disrespect, even cursing their parents, as Scripture says: 'Whoever curses his father or mother shall be put to death' (Exodus 21:17). They have oppressed the stranger and the foreigner among you, as if their suffering and exile from their homeland were not enough for them. They have saddened and oppressed the orphan and the widow among you: so that those whose entire estate is in the justice of the law, would not only be saddened, but oppressed by you. You have despised my sanctuaries and holy things, and you have defiled my sabbaths: so that you would not distinguish between the holy and the polluted, between the decreed day of religion and the rest of the sabbath for the worship of God, and the other days on which it is allowed by law to work and serve the needs of the flesh. The detractors, whether according to Symmachus and Theodotion, were deceitful, because it is said in Hebrew: Rachil, and they were murderers in you, to blaspheme God, or to do all things with deceit or violence. And the wise men devoured on high mountains, and with pride elevated against God, they committed wickedness or incest in your midst, such things as rarely happen in corners and secret places, when they are avoided by evil-conscious men, you have done openly. The following discourse explains what incest is: They have exposed the more modest parts of their father in you, they have unlawfully joined with their stepmother, and have defiled the impurity of menstruation within you, showing no regard for nature, nor granting any truce to indecency, clinging instead to the wife of their nearest kinsman. And what is even more wicked, the father-in-law has burned with desire for his daughter-in-law, and the brother has disregarded the rights of his sister: he violated his sister, not one born of the same mother, but rather the one born of the same father. They accepted gifts in order to shed innocent blood. They turned the necessity of the poor into profit, in order to receive interest and abundance; and because of greed, they slandered friends. 'But you, O Jerusalem, have done this,' he says, 'because you have forgotten me. For the memory of God excludes all crimes.' Therefore, I have taken on the appearance of an angry Lord, and I have clapped my hands against your greed and against the blood that was shed among you, so that you may understand and comprehend whether I can endure my anger with either mind or hands. For I have spoken, and I will do it: and after thou shalt be taken, Jerusalem, I will scatter thee into nations, and I will fan thee in the air, and thou shalt be moved to and fro in every wind: and my wrath shall be accomplished in thee, and my indignation shall rest in thee. And I will do, so that I may signify: and I will cause my indignation to rest in thee, and my wrath shall depart from thee, and I will be pacified, and will be angry no more. And my wrath shall rest in thee: and my indignation shall depart from thee, and I will be pacified, and will cease to be angry. And they shall know that I the Lord have spoken it, and have done it, saith the Lord God. But if we follow the interpretation of Symmachus and Theodotion, of whom one says, 'And I will wound you, or kill you,' and the other, 'I will defile you before the nations,' all things must be interpreted in a negative sense. Although this is contrary to this meaning, which was stated above, 'And I will cause your filthiness to cease from you.' For the ceasing of filthiness is the restoration of purity. I have discussed both editions equally, in order to avoid the extent of the books.
