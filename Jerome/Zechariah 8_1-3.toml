(Chapter 8, Verses 1 onwards) And the word of the Lord of hosts came, saying: Thus saith the Lord of hosts: I am jealous for Zion with a great jealousy, and with a great indignation am I jealous for her. Thus saith the Lord of hosts: I am returned to Zion, and will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem: and Jerusalem shall be called the city of truth, and the mountain of the Lord of hosts, the holy mountain. LXX: And the word of the Lord Almighty came, saying: Thus saith the Lord Almighty: I am jealous for Jerusalem and Zion with a great jealousy, and with a great fury am I jealous for her. Thus says the Lord Almighty: I will return to Zion and dwell in the midst of Jerusalem; and Jerusalem shall be called the true city, and the mountain of the Lord Almighty, the holy mountain. In the book of Ezekiel (Chapter 16), we learn in greater detail how the Lord took Jerusalem, that is, the Israelite people, when they were in the wilderness like a wife, covered in the blood of idolatry, and he covered them with his cloak and loved them with marital affection. Later, we learn that she ate fine flour, honey, and oil, adorned with the most beautiful garments, and had all the jewelry and ornaments given by her husband, but she committed adultery with the Assyrians and the Chaldeans, and the Lord said: As a wife despises her husband, so Israel has despised me in the house of Israel (Jeremiah 3). But when she was delivered into captivity and mocked by her lovers, and stripped of her former beauty, after she spread her legs to every passerby and was defiled up to her head, she laments the memory of her former happiness, saying: 'I will return to my former husband, for it was better for me then than it is now.' (Hosea 2:7). And he, taking her back in marriage, to whom he had previously said, 'I will not be angry with you, and my jealousy shall depart from you' (Ezekiel 16), now speaks: 'I am consumed with zeal for Zion, with great zeal and great indignation I am consumed for her.' I was very angry that she was defiled by many lovers and stained my marriage bed. Therefore, I handed her over to her lovers, not as an adulteress under her husband, but as a harlot and worthless slave, and she was prostituted in brothels. Now I have returned to her even more, because she has repented and built a temple for me to dwell in the midst of her. And she will be called the city of truth, which was previously called the city of lies, as written in Isaiah: Truth has slept (or dozed) in her; but now murderers. And there will be a mountain, the mountain of the Almighty Lord, a sanctified mountain, in which, with the temple restored, victims are sacrificed, and the order of ceremonies is observed. This is according to the history. However, there is no doubt that Zion and Jerusalem, the watchtower and vision of peace, are able to receive the souls of the faithful, to whom, when they have sinned, the angry Lord hands them over to captivity, so that they who have not sensed God through good and prosperous things may sense Him through evil and adverse things. And when they shall have repented, the Lord will return to Zion and dwell in the midst of Jerusalem, which we understand as the one and the same city, in which before reigned the vices of sins and falsehoods; afterwards Christ will dwell, who is the truth. And the mountain of the Lord of hosts shall be called the holy mountain, of which it is said: They that trust in the Lord shall be as mount Zion (Ps. 142:1). And: Great is the Lord and exceedingly praiseworthy, in the city of our God, in his holy mountain (Ps. 47:1). About which Isaiah and Micah cry out: In the last days, the mountain of the Lord will be prepared on the top of the mountains, and it will be exalted above the hills, and all peoples will flow to it, and many nations will hurry, and they shall say: Come, let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, and to the house of the God of Jacob (Isaiah 2:2-3; Micah 4:1-2). Concerning this mountain and this city, and the Apostle Paul (if indeed in receiving the Epistle, he did not reject the Greek authority in the Latin language) disputing with sacred prayer says: You have come to Mount Zion and the city of the living God, heavenly Jerusalem, and to thousands of angels, and the assembly of the firstborn who are enrolled in heaven (Hebrews 12:22).
