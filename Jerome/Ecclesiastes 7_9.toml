"Better
is the end of a thing than the beginning; "Perorations are better in speaking, than just the
introductory section. For worry comes to
and end in the former, and commences in the latter. Or it could even mean this: he who begins to
hear a speech, and goes to the teacher, is in first place. For indeed he who listens until the last is
consumed and complete in learning. But
this can also be understood in this way: while we are in this world, all that
we know is as a beginning; but when that age is completed, we will understand
everything as newest and completed. My
Hebrew tutor explained this passage together with the following verse as
follows: it is better for you to ponder the end of your business, than the
beginning, and be patient, rather than being seized by the frenzy of
impatience. We learn too from this
reading that there is no wisdom in men, although it is better to do than to
only say that you will do. And since,
when the talk had finished, the listener thinks over for himself what has been
said, and though he begins to speak, he has not yet understood what he can
learn from it. "And the patient in spirit is better than the proud in
spirit. "Since the heavenly one conceded to anger, saying,
"anger is better than laughter", lest we think anger is to be praised
in suffering, now he says that anger must be removed from deep down inside
us. For there he assigns anger instead
of correction in sinners, and learning in children. But here he checks
impatience. But patience is not only
necessary in difficult times, but also in happier times, in case we rejoice
more than we should. It seems to me that
he who is now called high in the spirit of the Gospel, is in contrast poor in
spirit, and is even blessed.
