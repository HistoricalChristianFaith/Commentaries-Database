"But at the same time prepare a lodging for me." I do not think that the Apostle was so rich, and occupied with such great burdens, that he needed a prepared lodging, and that he would not be content with a single cell, a house of small size for his body's limited capacity, but rather to do what he was asked while he was being waited for by Philemon. However, if someone thinks that he was given a command to prepare a lodging for himself, not in a discretionary manner, but truly, the Apostle had to prepare a lodging more than Paul. He was about to go to a new city, to preach the Crucifix, and to impart unheard-of dogmas, knowing that many would come to him; and it was necessary first, that the house be in a celebrated place of the city, to which he could easily be convened. Then, that it be empty of all importunity: that it be spacious, so that it could hold many listeners: not near places of spectacle, not in an unseemly and detestable neighborhood; finally, that it be located on a level site rather than in a cenacle. For which reason, I believe he even stayed in Rome for two years (( "Al." biennio)). And the dwelling place, as I think, was not small, to which the crowds of Jews flowed every day.

For I hope that I will be given to you through your prayers. The Son pleads to the Father, and God grants indulgence, and a brother is often saved by the prayer of his brother. But the Apostle is granted by the prayers of the whole Church, for the benefit of those who are going to hear him. And this gift is said not so much to be on him to whom it is given who is prepared from martyrdom to martyrdom, as on those to whom the Apostle is sent. But that Paul was frequently in prison and was freed from chains, he himself says in another place: "In prisons frequently" (2 Cor. 11), from which sometimes, with the help of the Lord, and frequently even his persecutors finding nothing worthy of death in him, he was let go. For there had not yet been decrees of the Senate against the name of Christian; nor had Nero's sword as yet grown red with Christian blood. But, for the novelty of the new name, either through the envy of wicked men, or the zeal of people eager to destroy their ancient customs, they were sent to prison and again released in a frenzy of popular excitement, which soon subsided. And this is how we say it to be, Acts of the Apostles testify, in which Felix also speaks to Agrippa: that Paul could have been released, if he had not appealed to Caesar (Acts 25). And because he found no reason except for some questions about his own religion, and a certain Jesus, whom Paul preached as alive. From this we observe that, and similarly from other judges, they could have been released, the Lord causing a new preaching to be spread throughout the whole world.
