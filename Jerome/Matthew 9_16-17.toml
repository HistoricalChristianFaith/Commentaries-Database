(V. 16, 17) However, no one puts a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment. For the patch pulls away from the garment, and a worse tear is made. Nor do people put new wine into old wineskins; otherwise the wineskins burst, the wine is spilled, and the wineskins are ruined. But they put new wine into fresh wineskins, and both are preserved. These words were spoken by him to them. What he means is this: Until someone is born again and the old self is removed through my suffering, and he puts on a new self, he cannot bear the stricter commands of fasting and continence, lest through excessive severity he lose even the faith that he seems to possess now. But he set forth two examples, both of the old and the new, and of clothing. By the old wineskins we must understand the scribes and Pharisees. The new patch of clothing and the new wine represent the teachings of the Gospel, which the Jews cannot bear, lest a greater tear be made. The Galatians also desired to do something similar, mixing the precepts of the Gospel with the precepts of the Law, and putting the new wine into old wineskins; but the Apostle speaks to them, saying: O foolish Galatians! Who has bewitched you into not obeying the truth? (Gal. III, 1) Therefore, the word of the Gospel should be infused into the apostles rather than the Scribes and Pharisees, who were corrupted by the traditions of the elders and could not keep the sincerity of Christ's teachings. For there is a difference between the purity of a virginal soul, untouched by the contamination of previous vices, and the filth of one that has succumbed to the desires of many.
