(Verse 15.) Behold, a resident will come, who was not with me; your former stranger will be joined to you. LXX: Behold, proselytes will come to you through me, and they will be your settlers, and they will flee to you. And the Jews believe that this is said about Jerusalem, that many from the Gentiles will become proselytes and accept the law of Moses and its ceremonies. This, according to our interpretation made in reference to the Church, which is gathered by the apostles from both peoples, which has no blemish or wrinkle, which is free, and the mother of all believers (Ephesians 5; Galatians 4). The Lord sent his disciples to gather the lost, converts, and strangers, saying: Teach all nations (Matthew 28:19), so that they may seek refuge in the Gospel and receive the new Law, that former inhabitants of idolatry may become members of the Church. Concerning them, it is said in the Psalms: The Lord makes the wise blind. Or as it is read in Latin manuscripts: The Lord enlightens the blind, The Lord loves strangers (Psalm 146:8-9): so that after the blind receive the light of truth and fools learn wisdom, then those who come to the Church are loved by the Lord, and they hear through the prophet: I will call not my people, my people (Hosea 2:24); with the entrance of these individuals into the Temple of God, zeal seizes the unlearned people.
