Jeremiah too laments over his impenitent people, saying, “O that my head were waters and my eyes a fountain of tears, that I might weep day and night for … my people!” And further on he gives a reason for his lamentation: “Do not weep for the dead,” he writes, “or bemoan him, but weep sorely for him who goes away, for he shall return no more.”
