"The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit." As the people of Israel are numbered according to their tribes (Num. 1:2) from the better part of the head of man, so indeed in the whole man, and in every part of the saints, there is the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ. But from the greater and better part, that is, from the spirit, it is said by synecdoche for the whole man: "The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit." Since grace is in the spirit, it makes the whole man spiritual; that the flesh also serves the spirit, and the soul is not overcome by the flesh, and is brought together in the substance of the spirit, so that it clings to the Lord; for whoever clings to the Lord is one spirit (2 Cor. 6). "Paul, admirable," is interpreted according to the Jews ('Al.' Hebrews). Timothy, a benefactor. Philemon, wonderfully gifted," or "mouth of bread," from the mouth, not the bone. "Apphia, continent," or "freedom. Archippus, length of work. Onesimus, responsive. Epaphras, fruitful," and "seeing," or "growing. Mark, sublime in command. Aristarchus, a mountain of greater work. Demas, silent. Luke, rising himself." If you wish to understand these names according to their meaning, it is not difficult to write wonderfully and benevolently to him for whom all faults are granted and whose mouth is open to heavenly bread. Then for the continent, the free, and the length of the work: that they never cease from holy labors. But to write for he who will answer by his own testimony, and also for him, (whom the letter) is specifically dedicated to, greetings (from the) growing abundance. And (for) him who has (been) made (through) sublime commands, and also (for) him, who has risen up through great works to the mountain, even (for) him who has set a guard upon his mouth, and a fortified gate upon his lips: who perhaps was silent for this reason, because he had left the Apostle for a little while. And finally, (for) him, who rising up daily by himself, grows and has a progress: while the world is filled with his Gospel, and increases as often as it is heard and read, it builds up.
