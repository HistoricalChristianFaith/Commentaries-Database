While you are reflecting upon this thought, meditate upon the mystery that is hidden within it. If we lift up our hands, Jesus triumphs. If we lift up our hands in good works, through our good works, Christ overcomes the devil. Hands, moreover, connote good works, whereupon it is written: “The word of the Lord came by the hand of Haggai”; “the word that came by the hand of Jeremiah the prophet.” To be sure, the word of the Lord does not come by the hand but by the mouth, but grasp the mysticism of the Scripture. God does not come because of words but because of good works.

The sword of God, which is the living Word of God, strikes through the things that people of their own accord, without the authority and testimonies of Scripture, invent and think up, pretending that it is apostolic tradition.
