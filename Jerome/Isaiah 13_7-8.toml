(Verse 7, 8.) Therefore, all hands will be loosened, and every man's heart will waste away and be crushed. There will be twisting and pain: they will be in agony like a woman in labor. Each person will be astonished at their neighbor; their faces will be burned with the expression of fear. This explanation is not necessary, but it is briefly indicated that such a great weight of evils will come upon them, that the hands of the fighters of Babylon will be loosened, and their hearts will grow weak with fear, and the agony of childbirth will twist their insides, and each person will seek help from another, their pale faces showing dread. For it is natural that in the face of impending disasters, we consider others to be more wise.
