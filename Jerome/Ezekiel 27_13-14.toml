(Vers. 13, 14.) Greece, Tubal, and Meshech themselves brought slaves and bronze vessels to your people. From the house of Togarmah they brought horses and horsemen, and mules to your market. Also, Greece and its surroundings, your merchants brought souls of men and bronze vessels to your market. From the house of Togarmah, they brought horses, horsemen, and mules to your trading post. Jones says that the Hebrews called Javan, and Tubal, that is, the Eastern Iberians, or those from the Western part of Hispania, who are called by this name from the river Iberus, and Meshech, whom we understand to be the Cappadocians, of which their metropolis, which later was named Caesarea by Augustus Caesar, is still called in their language Mazaca. They made valuable trade for Tyre, bringing slaves and bronze vessels from Corinth to Tyre, and horses, horsemen, and mules from the house of Togarmah, that is, from Phrygia, which once had a great abundance of those. The Hebrews say that Greece, that is, Javan, means both 'is' and 'is not', which properly refers to secular wisdom. If they find something right, they call it 'is'; if they find it to be in the opposite direction, they call it 'is not'. They discuss many things themselves about the blessings of nature and about duties, self-control, and the despising of riches, which the Stoics properly claim for themselves. And they seem to make the souls of the people whom they deceive profitable. They have bronze vessels, which they present to the people of Tyre, that they may supplant them with the opinion of false teaching. Also, from the house of Thogorma, which means stranger and foreigner, horses will be brought to the market and fair, and both horsemen and mules, of which it is written: A deceitful horse for safety (Ps. 32:17). And in another place: All who mount horses have slumbered (Ps. 76:7). And in the Psalms: Do not be like a horse or a mule, without understanding (Ps. 32:9). Therefore, Doeg the accuser and slayer of the priests was the chief of many (2 Sam. 22), and these are from the house of foreigners and strangers, who do not eat the flesh of lambs, of which it is written: A stranger and a hired servant shall not eat of it (Exod. 12:43); so that all the markets of Tyre may be filled with these goods.


Your sons, O Dadan, are your merchants. For some, interpreting the Seventy, have translated the sons of the Rhodians as, perhaps, by a similarity of the first letters, instead of Dadan, they read Radan, which is itself the largest of the Cyclades, and once was a most powerful city in the Ionian Sea, glorious in naval warfare, and the safest harbor for all merchants. And because the Rhodians are turned into our language, it is now said tropologically of those who perceive the truth of judgment but do not do it, as the apostle said: Therefore you are inexcusable, O man, whoever you are that judges. For in judging another, you condemn yourself. For you do the same things that you judge (Rom. II, 1). But it is better to give the name of Dadan to another place, as it is in Hebrew and among other interpreters.
