"Confident in your obedience, I have written to you, knowing that you will do even more than I say." Whoever presumes of him whom he is about to ask, prejudices himself in a certain manner, that it may not be lawful for him to deny what he is asked. Moreover, if he who asks knows that he will be asked for more than he has asked, he seeks smaller things, that he may have the voluntary compliance of the person asked, and a greater reward in return. But if Philemon does these things according to the precept of man: how much more will he do them for the love of God? Therefore, he is justly praised by the voice of the Apostle, because he anticipated his commands by his actions and could say, "Let the voluntary offerings of my mouth be pleasing to you, Lord" (Ps. 119:108), doing more than the precept required, he conquers those who only did what was commanded and are ordered to say, "We are useless servants because we have done what we were obliged to do" (Lk. 17:10). Virginity is also awarded a greater prize for this reason: because the precept of the Lord does not have it and it extends beyond what was ordered.
