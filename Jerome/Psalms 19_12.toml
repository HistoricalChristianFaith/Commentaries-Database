It is not my will to conceive sin; I do not want to entertain bad thoughts, and yet I do; I do not want to entertain evil, and, like a captive against my will, I am drawn into evil reflections. Because it is not in my power either to think or not to think evil, that is why I declare, “Surely they are wanton sins that come into my heart,” but since I cannot seem to avoid them, I plead, “Cleanse me from my unknown faults.” Unprovoked they come, but because I harbor them, I beg the Lord, “From wanton sin especially restrain your servant.” Why am I saying all this? Because the prophet said, “I shall please the Lord”; not “I please” but “I shall please,” for no matter how much I strive here, I cannot be a perfect man, a just man. Consequently, the apostle also says, “We know in part, and we prophesy in part,” and “We see now through a mirror in an obscure manner.”
