Do not think yourselves to be deceived if you are sent to those who do not hear what you are saying. You must understand that I am preaching to you because they are of unsound mind and they gather together against you and they surround you, leaving no escape to you. For they do this because they are faithless and spurn the commands of God.

Verse 6: Therefore, son of man, do not fear them, nor be afraid of their words, because they are unbelievers and destroyers with you. LXX: And you, son of man, do not fear them, nor be afraid of their presence: because they are insane, and they will gather against you in a circle. Though they may have hard necks and stubborn hearts, my commandments are stronger. And do not think yourself deceived if you are sent to those who do not listen to you. Behold, I foretell to you that they will go mad, and gather together against you, and surround you, leaving you no escape. And they will do this because they are unbelievers and despise the commands of God.

And you live with scorpions. Do not fear their words, and do not fear their faces, for their house is unsettling. They are capable of striking with a curved wound, and with a stinging sting, so that the same blow may open both skin and spread venom. Each one is called by their own behavior. And to the scribes, it is said: Generation of vipers (Matthew 23:33). And of Herod, who was a fox, it is said: Go and tell that fox (Luke 13:32). And false prophets are compared to foxes in this same Prophet. And now they are said to be scorpions with an untameable heart. Hence, we read in the Gospel: All who came before me were thieves and robbers, and the sheep did not hear them (John 10:8). And how did the lost sheep of the house of Israel hear their adversaries? From this it is shown that those who hear thieves and robbers have lost the name of sheep and have taken on other names, so that they have not perished like sheep, but like vipers, foxes, and scorpions.
