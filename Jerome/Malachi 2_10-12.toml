(Verse 10 and following) Is not the Father one of us all? Is not God one who created us? Why then does each one of us despise his brother, violating the covenant of our fathers? Judah has transgressed, and abomination has been made in Israel and in Jerusalem: because Judah has defiled the sanctification of the Lord, which he loved, and has taken the daughter of a foreign god. The Lord will destroy the man who does this, the master and the disciple from the tents of Jacob, and the one who offers an offering to the Lord of hosts. LXX: Is not the Father of you all one? Did not one God create you? Why have you each forsaken his brother, making the abominable testament of your fathers? Judas has been abandoned, and abomination has been made in Israel and in Jerusalem, because Judas defiled the holy things of the Lord, in which he loved, and he discovered foreign gods. May the Lord destroy the man who does these things, until he is driven out from the tents of Jacob, and from those who offer sacrifice to the Almighty Lord. Before we discuss the current chapter, the tradition of the Hebrews must be presented, indeed the truth of the Scriptures must be explained. We read in a volume titled Ezra, spoken in the person of Ezra himself: The leaders approached me, saying: The people of Israel, as well as the priests and Levites, have not separated themselves from the peoples of the lands and from their abominations, namely the Canaanites, Ethiopians, Persians, Jebusites, Ammonites, Moabites, Egyptians, and Amorites. For they have taken of their daughters for themselves, and for their sons: and the holy seed is mixed with the people of those lands. Moreover the hand of the princes and magistrates hath been first in this transgression. And when I had heard this thing, I rent my mantle and my coat, and plucked off the hair of my head and of my beard, and sat down mourning (1 Esdras 9:1). And again in the following: And there were found of the sons of the priests that had taken strange wives: of the sons of Jesus, the son of Josedec, and his brethren, Maasia, and Eleazar, and Jarib, and Godolia: and they gave their hands to put away their wives, and to offer for their offence a ram of the flock (1 Esdras 10:18-19). At the end of the chapter, after listing those who had taken foreign wives ((or had taken)), the Scripture states: All of these took foreign wives, and there were women among them who gave birth to sons. Therefore, upon their return from the Babylonian captivity, both the leaders, priests, and Levites, as well as the rest of the people, rejected their wives of Israelite descent, who, due to poverty and the injustice of a long journey, as well as the frailty of their gender, could not bear the labor and had become worn out, and had contracted physical weakness and deformity. And they had entered into matrimony with foreigners, who were either in the prime of life or possessed more attractive physical appearances, or were the daughters of the powerful and wealthy. So Ezra the prophet rebukes them and challenges them to reject their new wives and take back the wives they had divorced. He says, 'Is not Abraham our father? Didn't Isaiah write about him: Look to Abraham your father, and to Sarah, who bore you; for he was one, and I called him.' Isn't it one God who created us, who chose our lineage from Abraham? Why then do we despise our old wives and cast aside the daughters of our brothers, in order to abandon the covenant of our fathers and not take wives according to the Law? Juda transgressed (for this tribe alone returned from Babylon with the priests and Levites, and abomination was committed in Israel and in Jerusalem. Not from the ten tribes which were held by the Assyrians did this happen, but from those who returned under the authority of King Cyrus, Zerubbabel, Ezra, and Nehemiah from Babylon. Because Judah defiled the sanctification of the Lord, which he loved, and took a daughter of a foreign god, mixing Israel's seed with foreigners and the daughters of the nations, that is, with non-Israelite women who served idols, by marrying them. Therefore, the word of the prophets is directed towards them, and they are drawn away from sin by curses. May the Lord destroy the man who does this. How beautifully he does not pardon the error, nor does he say, 'May the Lord curse the one who did this,' but the one who does it, stretching the curse towards the future, in order to provoke sinners to repentance. The teacher, he says, the disciple from the tents of Jacob, whether he be a priest or a layperson, they shall be struck with the same curse, and there shall be no difference in punishment for those in whom the sins are equal. And the one offering a gift to the Lord of hosts: it is understood that the Lord will destroy him as well, who wishes to offer a gift at the altar for men of this kind, whose only remedy is not to do what they have done. Some, not understanding this passage, nor knowing the truth of history, understand what he says: 'Is not the father of us all one?' concerning Abraham, so as to also mention Abraham as the father of the Gentiles, according to what is written: 'God is able from these stones to raise up children of Abraham' (Matt. 3:9). Certainly they affirm one God the Father according to what we read in Deuteronomy: Is not this the same Father who possessed you, and made you, and created you (Deut. XXXII, 6)? And again: You have deserted the God who created you (Ibid., 18). And elsewhere: I have begotten sons and exalted them, but they have forsaken me (Isaiah I, 2). And in the Book of Psalms: The sons of strangers have lied to me: the sons of strangers have grown old and stumbled from their paths (Ps. XVII, 46). 964 From this one father, who sinned, departing, they made many fathers of their vices: For everyone who commits sin is born of the devil. And this is what follows: Therefore each one of us despises his brother, violating the covenant of our fathers, they interpreted it in such a way as to say: We who are all generated from one father ought to be one, and to have one confession of faith; but afterwards by pride and the building of the tower against God, they were divided into many languages and opinions (Gen. XI). They also refer to acts of charity, saying: Let us despise our brothers when we do not share with them what we have received from God for sustaining life. And they further allege that our brother is called Lord according to the Scriptures, who commanded Mary Magdalene to announce to his brothers that the Lord has risen (John 20), and he speaks in the Psalm: I will declare your name to my brothers, in the midst of the Church I will sing praise to you (Psalm 22:23). So the Jews deserted their brother and contaminated the covenant of their fathers, which God had made with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, that in their descendants, who is interpreted as Christ, all the nations would be blessed. They suspect these things in various ways because they do not find a certain way. Finally, even this which follows according to the Septuagint: Judas has been forsaken, and abomination has been made in Israel and in Jerusalem, they explain thus: The Jews have been deserted because they have blasphemed the Lord Savior and have endured what is written: According to the multitude of their wickedness, drive them out, for they have provoked you, O Lord (Ps. 5:11), so that they would be scattered as wanderers and fugitives into all the provinces. For they have polluted the holy things of the Lord, being devoted to the Son of God, and approaching foreign gods: For whoever does not accept the Son, does not accept the Father who sent him (Luke IX, 43). And because they have done this, they will continue to be destroyed until they are humbled, either by the injustice of captivity, or by the guilt of their conscience: and they will be cast out from the tents of Jacob, so that with the temple and altar destroyed, no sacrifices may be offered among them (or by them). Not content with this explanation (because Judas is interpreted as the confession of the Lord), they transfer understanding to the penitent, who, after confessing the Lord, if he sins, commits an abomination in Israel, and in Jerusalem, in the sense of seeing God, and in the vision of peace. For he pollutes the mysteries of Christ, unworthily receiving his body and blood (I Cor. XI), because he loves vices and finds for himself foreign gods, having the number of gods according to the number of sins. According to the Apostle Paul: God is a voracious belly (Phil. III), and according to Peter (also James). Whoever is conquered by him, is subjected to him (II Petr. II, 19). And whoever does this, will be exterminated from the Church, and from the tents of Jacob, who supplants vices and sins, until he is humbled for his own good, and a victim is offered for him to the Almighty Lord.
