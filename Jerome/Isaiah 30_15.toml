It is never too late to repent. You may have gone down from Jerusalem and may have been wounded on the way; yet the Samaritan will set you upon his beast and will bring you to the inn and will take care of you. Even if you are lying in your grave, the Lord will raise you though your flesh may stink. At least imitate those blind men for whose sake the Savior left his home and heritage and came to Jericho. They were sitting in darkness and in the shadow of death when the light shone upon them. For when they learned that it was the Lord who was passing by, they began to cry out, saying, “You son of David, have mercy on us.” You too will have your sight restored, if you cry to him and cast away your filthy garments at his call. “When you shall turn and repent then shall you be saved, and then shall you know where you have been.”
