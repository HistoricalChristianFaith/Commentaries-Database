(Verse 11.) The sons of Aradius with their army (or their own) were on your walls all around. But also the Pygmies who were in your towers hung their quivers (or your quivers) on your walls in a circle, they completed your beauty. LXX: The sons of Aradius, and your strength on your walls, were guardians all around in your towers. They hung their quivers on your battlements in a circle. They have completed your adornment. --The Word Gamadim (), the first edition of the Eagle, the Pygmies: Symmachus, the Medes: the Septuagint, the Guardians: Theodotus Gamadim, the Hebrew itself, have translated. We still see the island of Aradus, which is entirely a city, and the opposite town of Antaradus, which is adjacent to Tyre, and stretches along the coast of Phoenicia on the mainland up to this day: these are the guards of the city of Tyre and the custodians of its towers, and they have placed their quivers around them and filled their beauty, so that they are taught to be archers, whether they are pygmies, that is, warriors, and very ready for war, ἀπὸ τῆς πυγμῆς, which is translated into Greek as a contest. But if, on the other hand, they are called the deceitful ones of Aradius, everyone who claims to have knowledge of false names and carries in the quiver of his heart the fiery darts of the devil, with which he wounds and inflames the hearts of those who are deceived, should be called Aradius. For he desires to cast down those who strive to ascend to heights, and he completes the beauty of Tyre, of which it is written in Proverbs: Let not the desire for beauty deceive you, nor be captivated by your eyes (Prov. VI, 25). And again: Just as earrings in a pig's snout, so is beauty to a woman who is ill-tempered. (Ibid. XI, 22).
