When Israel was led out of the land of Egypt, God was intimate only with that people, such that it could be said that he took them by the hand and made a covenant with them, which they then violated and were therefore neglected by the Lord. Now, however, it is promised in the gospel that after the cross, resurrection and ascension, the covenant will be written not on stone tablets but on tablets of embodied hearts, since the testament of the Lord was to be written on the minds of believers, he being God dwelling in them and they a people in him, so that they would never again seek Jewish teachers and traditions and human commandments but would be taught instead by the Holy Spirit, provided that they are worthy to hear: “You are God’s temple, and the Spirit of God dwells in you.” But “the Spirit blows where he wills” and has various graces and is himself the possession of the knowledge of the God of all virtue. “And I will forgive their iniquities, and I will not remember their sins any more,” he says. From this, it is clear, according to the proper knowledge of the reading above, that this must be understood of the Savior’s first coming, when both the people of Israel and Judah were joined together. Should anyone worry, however, about why it says “I will make a new covenant—or testament—with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah, not like the covenant that I made with your ancestors,” he should first understand that the church of Christ came to everyone from the Jews and, moreover, that the Lord Savior said, “I came only for the lost sheep of the house of Israel.”
