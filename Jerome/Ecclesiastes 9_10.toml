"Whatever
you are able to do with your strength, do it. 
For there is neither doing, nor reckoning, nor knowledge, nor wisdom in
the grave where you are going. "Do whatever you are presently able to do,
and toil at it, because when you go down to the world of the dead there will be
no place for repentance. Similar to this
is what is taught by the Saviour: "work hard, while there is still day
left; for night will come, when none is able to work" [Ioh. 9, 4.],
but he says this: "to the grave where you are going", remember too
that you believe Samuel was also in the grave, and before the advent of Christ,
all men were retained by the law of the dead, however holy they were. More precisely, the holy were retained after
the resurrection of the Lord in vain in the grave, and the apostle notes this,
remarking, "it is better to die and be with Christ" [Phil. 1, 23.]. But he is with Christ, so that he might not
be held back in the grave.
