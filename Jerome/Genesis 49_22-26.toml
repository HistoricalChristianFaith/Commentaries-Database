(Verse 22 and following) The son of Joseph grew up, the son of Joseph grown tall above the fountain of the daughter, walking with a composed stride on the wall. And they provoked him, and contended with him, and were angry against him, having arrows. He sat in the strength of his bow, and the chains of his hands were broken, from the hands of the mighty Jacob. From there will come the shepherd, the stone of Israel from the God of your father: and the rest. Because the Seventy Interpreters disagree in many places, we have expressed their interpretation as it is in Hebrew. And the meaning of the chapter is this: O Joseph, who is called thus because God has increased you for me, or because you will become greater among your brothers (for indeed Ephraim was the strongest of the tribe, as we read in the Books of Kings and Chronicles); O, I say, my son Joseph, who is so handsome that a crowd of Egyptian girls watches you from the walls, towers, and windows, your brothers envied you and provoked you to anger, wounded by arrows of envy and spears of jealousy. But you have set your bow and weapons of war in God, who is a mighty warrior; and your chains, with which your brothers bound you, have been loosed and broken by him, so that from your seed may be born Ephraim, strong and steadfast, like an unconquerable and unyielding stone, ruling over the ten tribes of Israel.
