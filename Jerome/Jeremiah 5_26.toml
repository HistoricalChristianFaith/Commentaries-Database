(Verse 26.) Because there were found among my people wicked ones plotting like bird catchers, setting snares and traps to capture men; like a net full of birds, so is their house full of deceit. Why did a temporary and late rain deviate from them, and all good things not come? The reasons are given: because there were found among his people wicked ones. He did not say, the unjust and sinners (as the new heresy wants), but the wicked. Impiety openly denies God; if it confesses error iniquity and sin, it easily turns God to mercy. And as we said: Insidious like bird-catchers, and it is not found in the Septuagint, Aquila and Symmachus translated Jasir (), like the net of a bird-catcher, so that even he who seems good and upright among them may lay snares like a bird-catcher, while they hunt each other to death, and bring ruin and loss to others, filling their own houses, so that the saying of the philosophers is fulfilled: Every rich person is either unjust or the heir of an unjust person. And if only these things were done by those who seem to be outside, and whom the Lord judges; and not in our gatherings, which are filled by the root of all evils, greed (Colossians III), so that we do not consider the faces of those who come to us, but their hands.
