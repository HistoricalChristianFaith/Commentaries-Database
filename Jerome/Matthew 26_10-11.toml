(Verse 10, 11.) But Jesus, knowing this, said to them: Why do you trouble this woman? For she has done a good work upon me. For the poor you have always with you, but me you do not always have. Another question arises, why did the Lord say to the disciples after the resurrection: Behold, I am with you always, even to the end of the world; and now he says, but you do not always have me. But it seems to me that in this place he is speaking of his bodily presence, which will not be with them in the same way after the resurrection, as it is now in all their meetings and familiarity. The Apostle, being mindful of this matter, says: 'Even though we have known Christ according to the flesh, yet now we no longer know Him.' (II Cor. 5:16)
