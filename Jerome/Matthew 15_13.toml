Even what seems to be clear in the Scriptures presents many problems. Christ said, “Every plant that my heavenly Father has not planted will be uprooted.” Does this mean, therefore, that there will be uprooted also that plant which the apostle speaks of when Paul says, “I have planted, Apollos watered”? The problem is solved, however, from the words that follow: “But God has given the growth.” He also says, “You are God’s field, God’s building.” And in another place we read, “We are God’s coworkers”; therefore, if we are his coworkers, with Paul planting and Apollos watering, God plants and waters with his workers. .
