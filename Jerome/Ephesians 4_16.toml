This entire upbuilding, by which the body of the church increases cell by cell, is being accomplished through the mutual love of one for another.â€¦ This does not imply that to each member will be distributed the same level of maturity. It is an error to assume, for example, that all human beings will be formed anew into angels. Rather every member will be perfected according to its own distinctive measure and function. Humanity, which has been expelled from paradise, will be restored to the cultivation of paradise again.
