(Verse 20.) And the Egyptians will know the Lord on that day; and they will worship him with sacrifices and offerings, and they will make vows to the Lord and fulfill them. And the Lord will strike Egypt with a plague, and he will heal it; and they will return to the Lord, and he will be appeased by them, and he will heal them. After the Egyptians have come to know the Lord, they will worship him with spiritual sacrifices and offerings; and they will make vows to the Lord and fulfill them; and they will say with David: 'Sacrifice to God a contrite spirit' (Psalm 50:19); and: 'The lifting up of my hands is an evening sacrifice' (Psalm 140:2); when they believe in the Nazarene and themselves become Nazarenes, not drinking wine and strong drink (John 19); and the vinegar that was given to the Lord, and whatever is made from the Sodomite grape. And when they have fulfilled their vows with Abel, and God looks upon them, Cain, the older brother, that is, the people of Circumcision, will envy and shed Christian blood, which will cry out to the Lord (Gen. IV); and therefore he will go forth from the face of God, saying of the Savior: Crucify him, crucify him (Luke XXIII, 11); and: We have no king but Caesar (John XIX, 15). He offers and fulfills his vow to the Lord, who is holy in body and spirit. Zacchaeus also offered a vow and promised to give half of his possessions to the poor (Luke 19). The question arises, if the Savior and defender was sent to Egypt to deliver them from distress, how can it now be said, 'The Lord will strike Egypt with a plague?' But let us consider what follows: 'And he will heal it.' For whom the Lord loves, he chastises (Hebrews 12). And the Savior himself speaks to the Father in Psalm 68: 'For those who you struck, they pursued; and they added to the pain of my wounds.' If, therefore, He has not spared His own Son, but has surrendered Him for us, so that by His bruises and wounds we may be healed (Rom. 8): the Lord also surrendered the martyrs to suffering, but He will restore them in the resurrection, so that the faith of believers may be confirmed by their wounds. Hence, it is also said to Job: Do you think that I have spoken in any other way to you, unless that you might appear just? For He Himself causes pain and restores to former health; He visits His servants with a rod, so that He does not take His mercy away from them. Where are the daughters and daughters-in-law who have greatly sinned and spread their legs to everyone passing by, not visited or rebuked, as the Lord says: 'I will not visit your daughters when they fornicate, or your daughters-in-law when they commit adultery' (Hosea 4:14). Therefore, the Lord strikes the Egyptians, not with fire or sword, but with a rod. For what son is not disciplined by his father? So that once they have been healed, they may return to the Lord, and he may be appeased with them and heal them again. For we always need the mercy of God, and there is no end to His clemency.
