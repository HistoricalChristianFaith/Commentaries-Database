Whoever walks along the one royal way does not labor. Indeed, God issued a commandment about this through Moses: “You shall walk along the royal way and not deviate to your right or to your left.” The one way is the way of truth, as it says in the Gospel: “I am the way, the truth and the life.” But there are various ways of deception, along which Jerusalem is now demonstrated to have walked. God, who knows the difference between such ways, said earlier to those who were wandering: “Your ways are not like my way.” And those who trust in the Lord said, “You have caused our ways not to depart from your ways.” With knowledge of the one royal way, then, let us beware of deviations to the left and right, along which we are forbidden to walk. The royal way is temperance, having neither too little nor too much. For example, the royal and right way entails prudence; we deviate to the right if we understand more than is proper for us to understand and if we prefer cleverness above prudence, by which measure the serpent was more prudent than all the animals in paradise and the children of darkness are more prudent than the children of light. We deviate to the left, however, when we are foolish and have less understanding than is necessary. Concerning such people, it is said, “The fool says in his heart, ‘There is no God.’ ”

The royal road also involves fortitude and constancy, from which the impulsive and rash deviate to the right and the timid and fearful deviate to the left. Hence, a holy person desiring to walk along the right way prays, “Lead me, Lord, on the right path,” and, in another passage, “Make known to me, O Lord, the way in which I should walk, for to you I lift my eyes.” … Then it continues, according to the Hebrew: “You found life by your own hand, so you did not beseech” [Is 57:10], which has the following sense and meaning: Because you were abounding in all things and flowing in riches, you neglected the Lord, whereas Solomon refused such riches precisely so that he would not forget God.… For not only riches but poverty also tests a person, which is why it was written above: “I tested you on the road of poverty,” the same road on which Lazarus the poor man was tested, who sustained debilitating illness as well as poverty.
