Born, in the first instance, of such parentage we are naturally black. Even when we have repented, so long as we have not scaled the heights of virtue, we may still say, “I am black but comely, O daughters of Jerusalem.” … “For this cause shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall be joined unto his wife, and they two shall be” not as is there said, “of one flesh” but “of one spirit.” Your bridegroom is not haughty or disdainful; he has “married an Ethiopian woman.” When once you desire the wisdom of the true Solomon and come to him, he will avow all his knowledge to you; he will lead you into his chamber with his royal hand. He will miraculously change your complexion so that it shall be said of you, “Who is this that goes up and has been made white?”
