For whenever he raised anyone from the dead he ordered that food should be given him to eat, lest the resurrection should be thought a delusion. And this is why Lazarus after his resurrection is described as being at the feast with our Lord.

It was told the ruler of the synagogue, Thy daughter is dead. But Jesus said to him, She is not dead, but sleepeth. Bother are true, for the meaning is, She is dead to you, but to Me she is asleep.
Some one may accuse the Evangelist of a falsehood in his explanation, in that he had added, “I say unto thee,” when in Hebrew, “Talitha cumi” only means, “Damsel, arise;” but He adds, “I say unto thee, Arise,” to express that His meaning was to call and command her. It goes on, “For she was of the age of twelve years. "It continues, “And they were astonished with a great astonishment.”
