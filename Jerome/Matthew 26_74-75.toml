(Verse 74, 75.) Then he began to curse and swear, saying that he did not know the man. And immediately the rooster crowed. And Peter remembered the word of Jesus that he had said: Before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times. In another Gospel, we read that after Peter's denial and the rooster's crowing, the Savior looked at Peter and with his gaze, he caused him to burst into bitter tears. It was not possible for him to remain in the darkness of denial, whom the light of the world had looked upon.



And going out, he wept bitterly. Sitting in the courtyard of Caiaphas, he could not do penance. He goes out from the wicked council to wash the fearful filth of his denials with bitter tears.
