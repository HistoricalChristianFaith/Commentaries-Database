Many read this inaccurately because they add without any punctuation, “that which has been made in him was life.” The correct statement is “All things were made through him, and without him was made nothing that has been made,” meaning that that which has been made without him has not been made. … Now, if all things were made through him, is the Father, on that account, excluded from creation, or Holy Spirit, and has the Son alone worked? Because the Evangelist had said, “All things were made through him,” lest he take away creation from the Holy Spirit and the Father, he added, “And without him was made nothing that has been made.” When he says, “without him was made nothing,” he reveals that another has made but has made nothing without him.
