Figuratively; When the Lord departed from the temple, all the buildings of the Law and the structure of the Commandments were so overthrown, that none of them could be fulfilled by the Jews, but, the Head being taken away, all the parts were at war among themselves.

(Chapter 24 - Verses 1, 2.) And Jesus went out of the temple and was going on his way. And his disciples came to show him the buildings of the temple. But he answered and said to them: Do you see all these things? Amen I say to you: there shall not be left here a stone upon a stone, that shall not be destroyed. According to the manifest sense of the story, when the Lord departed from the temple, all the buildings of the law, and the composition of the commandments, were so destroyed that nothing could be fulfilled by the Jews; and with the head removed, all the members fight among themselves.
