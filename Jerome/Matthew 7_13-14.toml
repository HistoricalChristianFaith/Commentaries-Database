Attend to the words, for they have an especial force, many walk in the broad wayâ€”few find the narrow way. For the broad way needs no search, and is not found, but presents itself readily; it is the way of all who go astray. Whereas the narrow way neither do all find, nor when they have found, do they straightway walk therein. Many, after they have found the way of truth, caught by the pleasures of the world, desert midway.

(Verse 13, 14) Enter through the narrow gate, for wide is the gate and spacious is the way that leads to destruction, and many are those who enter through it. How narrow is the gate and confined is the way that leads to life! And few are those who find it. The wide path is the pleasure of the world, which people desire. The narrow path, which is opened through struggles and fasting, which even the Apostle entered (II Cor. VI, XI): and Timothy is encouraged to enter through it (I Tim. V). At the same time, consider how clearly he has spoken about each path. Many walk the broad path, but few find the narrow one. The broad path is not sought after, nor is there a need for discovery: it offers itself willingly, and is the path of those who wander. But the narrow path, not everyone finds it, and those who do find it, do not immediately enter it. Indeed, many, once they have found the path of truth, are captivated by the pleasures of the world and turn back from the middle of the journey.
