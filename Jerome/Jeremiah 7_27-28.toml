(Verse 27, 28.) And you shall speak to them all these words, and they will not listen to you. And you shall call to them, and they will not respond to you. And you shall say to them: This is a people who has not heard the voice of their Lord God, nor received discipline. Faith has perished and has been taken away from their mouth. Do not doubt, he says, that they have hardened their neck, and have done worse than their fathers. Behold, I give them a place for repentance: and yet I do not speak that they may become, but because they will be, therefore I foretell. Speak now to them with my words, and yet they will not listen to you; and you will call to them, and they will not respond to you. For their pride will be so great that when you call them to hear, no one will deign to respond. And you will say to them: This is a nation that has not heard the voice of their God, nor received discipline. Beautifully, as I have said before, he calls not his people, but a nation. Although this was done in part during the time of the Prophets, and it has preceded in shadow and in image, it is more fully fulfilled in Christ, when they refused to receive discipline and despised the voice of their Lord. Where elegantly is inferred: Faith has perished, which properly belongs to Christians; and it has been taken away from their lips: namely, all confession of the Son of God and of faith.
