Would you like to know in what way the faithful are compared with clouds in holy writ? Isaiah says, “I will also command the clouds that they rain no rain upon them.” Moses was speaking as if he were a cloud when he said, “May my teaching drop as the rain.” The letters of the apostles are spiritual rain for us. As a matter of fact, what does Paul say in his letter to the Hebrews?: “For land which has drunk the rain that often falls upon it,” and again, “I planted, Apollos watered.”
