(Vers. 3, 4.) And the leaders shall enter the gates: I have commanded my sanctified ones, I have also called my mighty ones for mine anger, even them that rejoice in my highness. The princes, and the giants, according to the LXX Translators, Eusebius interprets as angelic powers, and the most wicked demons, who were sent for the overthrow of Babylon. But following the order of the story, we say they were the Medes. Of whom Scripture testifies more explicitly in what follows, saying: Behold, I will raise up against them the Medes, who shall not regard silver, and as for gold, they shall not delight in it. It is not surprising that he calls the Medes sanctified for the destruction of Babylon, since through Jeremiah he himself, Nebuchadnezzar, while destroying Jerusalem, a rebellious city, called them his servant and his dove. Furthermore, when he says, 'My mighty men and those who rejoice in my glory,' he shows that they did not overthrow the power of such a lofty kingdom by their own strength, but rather by the wrath of God.
