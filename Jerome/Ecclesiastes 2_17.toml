"So I
hated life, for I was depressed by all that goes on under the sun, because
everything is vain and a vexation of the spirit." The world has been given over to unkindness [Cfr I John. 5, 19.]
and the apostle moans about the tabernacle saying "I am a wretched man,
who will free me from the body of this death?" [Rom. 7, 24.],
and he hates quite rightly everything that is done under the sun. That is however only in comparison with
paradise and the beatitude of that life, in which we would enjoy the fruits of
wisdom and the pleasures of virtues. But
now as if we are in a prison camp or cell, and with a wall of tears, we eat our
bread in the sweat of our brow.
