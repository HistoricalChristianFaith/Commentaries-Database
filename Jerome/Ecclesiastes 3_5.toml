"A time
for dispersing stones and a time for collecting stones." I marvel how an learned man could have said this
ridiculous note about this passage: "this passage speaks about the
destruction and killing of Solomon's houses, because men first destroy, then
build". Some amass stones to
construct buildings, others destroy those buildings which have been erected,
according to Horace's lines "he demolished, he builds, exchanges squares with
wheels, he fluctuates and disagrees with the whole order of life itself."  [Horat. Epist. I. I. 100, 99.] Whether he is correct in saying this or not I
leave up to the reader to decide. 
Nonetheless we should follow the sequence of the prior explanation-they
say it is a time for scattering and collecting stones, similar to what is
written in the Gospel: "God is powerful enough to raise up the sons of
Abraham from these stones". [Matth. 3, 9.] For there was a time for dispersing the
nation and a time for gathering them again into the Church. I have read in a certain book, (like the
Septuagint however, which says "there was a time for throwing stones and a
time for collecting them") that the harshness of the ancient law of the
Gospel was tempered by grace. In fact
the stern law, unkind and unforgiving, murders the sinner, he pities with the
grace of the Gospel and provokes men to repentance. And there is a time for throwing stones, or
collecting them, because stones are thrown in law and are collected in the
Gospel. Whether this is true fact or not
is credited to the author.  "A time for embracing and a time for being far from
embrace. "The meaning of this is seemingly the
simplest understanding- the apostle agrees with the same words: "do not
cheat each other, unless by chance it is agreed for a time that you give
yourselves to fasting and to prayer." [I Cor. 7, 5.] Attention must be given to children, and
again to self-control. Or perhaps it was
the time for embrace when the opinion was flourishing that we ought to
"grow and multiply, and fill up the Earth" [Gen. 1, 28.]. And the time became far from one of embracing
when it passed away: "the times are hard; it remains that both they that
have wives be as though they had none". [I Cor. 7, 29.] But if we wanted to climb to the higher
parts, we would see wisdom embracing its lovers: for he says "honour it
and it will embrace you" [Prov. 4, 8.],
and hold them in its arms and lap in a tighter embrace. More precisely, it is not always possible to
stretch the human mind to heaven and think about the divine and higher things,
or continually consider celestial matters, but meanwhile to indulge in the necessities
of the flesh. On account of this there
is a time for embracing wisdom, and holding it more tightly, and a time for
relaxing the mind from the study and embrace of wisdom, just as of the care of
the body, and we have those things that our life needs in the absence of
sin.
