(Verse 26 and following) And the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah, saying: Behold, I am the Lord, the God of all flesh. Is anything too difficult (or impossible) for me? Or will any word be hidden from me? Therefore, thus says the Lord: Behold, I will hand over this city to the Chaldeans and into the hand of the king of Babylon, and they will capture it. And the Chaldeans will come fighting: the Chaldeans will come against this city, and they will set it on fire and burn it, and the houses - in whose homes they sacrificed to Baal and poured out drink offerings to other gods to provoke me - they will burn as well. She joins joy to the sorrowful and promises the return of the captive people after the destruction of Jerusalem. And first she explains the causes of God's offense and righteous fury, so that the greater the guilt of the sinners, the more abundant the mercy of the Creator towards the sinners. I am, she says, the Lord God of all flesh. Not at all of all nations, nor of the people of Israel, or certainly, as He is often called by the holy ones, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, the God of Jacob, but God said to all flesh, so that it is believed that He made both rational and brute animals Himself. For there are those who confess the providence of the Creator even up to rational beings: but they assert that brute animals either perish or live by chance events. And the prophetic speech declares that there is nothing that escapes the providence and knowledge of God; because some things are created for their own sake, while others are created for the use of humans. Is anything difficult or impossible for me? Or surely, will every word be hidden from me? And as we have said above: The things that are impossible among humans are possible among God. But we must understand the word here and in many other places to mean 'things.' 'What is it,' he says, 'that has happened?' Therefore, he says these things: 'For this reason, thus says the Lord. For, he says, it is my concern to rule everything, to order all things, and to give to each according to its ways. Therefore, I will deliver this city into the hand of the Chaldeans and into the hand of the king of Babylon, and they will capture it.' First, the city is fortified by the army, and while Nebuchadnezzar is absent, Zedekiah is captured and taken to Riblah, where he is handed over to the king. And they will come, he says, the Chaldeans fighting against this city. Aquila translates it better as 'they will come,' because of what is written, 'they will enter,' which means they will enter the city. For they were not absent to come, since they had surrounded Jerusalem, as the Scripture testifies. Then the army of the king of Babylon besieged Jerusalem. And then: Behold, fortifications were built against the city in order to capture it: and the city was given into the hands of the Chaldeans. So how will those who were present come? But those who were besieging the city, he says, will enter and capture it, and they will advance, and they will burn it down even to the ground (for the Hebrew word 'Bau' (which is ambiguous) can mean both 'come' and 'enter'). And they offered sacrifices to the idol Baal in the houses where they lived, and poured out libations to foreign gods to provoke me, not because of religious error, but rather because of a certain rivalry and contempt towards the Creator. However, how the world is going to perish is written, according to what is written: Heaven and earth will pass away (Matthew 24:35), because it is placed in the wicked one: so also the very houses and places in which wickedness is perpetrated are subject to the wrath of God. There are those who contentiously refer what is written: The place where the Lord and Savior was crucified is spiritually called Sodom and Egypt (Revelation 11:8), to those very places. But others believe that under the name of Egypt and Gomorrah, they signify the whole world. For just as Gomorrah was destroyed by divine fire, so also the world will be consumed by the judgment of God.
