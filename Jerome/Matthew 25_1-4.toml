(Chapter 25, verses 1 onwards) Then the kingdom of heaven shall be like ten virgins who, taking their lamps, went forth to meet the bridegroom and the bride. But five of them were foolish, and five were wise. The foolish ones, having taken their lamps, took no oil with them. But the wise ones took oil in their vessels with their lamps. This parable, that is, the similitude of the ten virgins, some interpret simply in the virgins: some of whom, according to the Apostle, are virgins in both body and mind, while others only preserve the virginity of their bodies, lacking similar works or being kept by their parents, nevertheless they have married in their minds (I Cor. VII). But it seems to me that there is another meaning from what is said before, and it pertains not to virgin bodies, but to the whole human race. For just as two in a field and two grinding at the mill signify two peoples, Christians and Jews, saints and sinners, who are in the Church, they indeed appear to plow and grind themselves; but they do everything in hypocrisy: so now all the ten virgins embrace all men, who seem to believe in God and applaud themselves in the holy Scriptures, both ecclesiastics and Jews, and heretics. Therefore, all women are called virgins because they boast in the knowledge of one God, and their minds are not defiled by a crowd of idolatry (or lust). Virgins have oil, who are adorned with faith and good works. Those who appear to confess the Lord with a similar faith do not have oil; but they neglect the works of virtue. We can interpret the five virgins, wise and foolish, as the five senses: some hasten to heavenly things and desire heavenly things; others, gaping at earthly dregs, do not have the ointments of truth with which to enlighten their hearts. It has been said spiritually by sight, hearing, and touch: What we have seen, what we have heard, what we have beheld with our own eyes, and what our hands have touched (1 John 1:1). As for taste: Taste and see that the Lord is sweet (Psalm 34:9). As for smell: We run after the fragrance of your ointments (Song of Solomon 1:3). And: We are the sweet fragrance of Christ (2 Corinthians 2:15).
