(Verse 15.) They are confused because they have committed an abomination; rather, they have not been confused by their confusion, and they have not known how to blush. This should be read with greater precision according to the Hebrew. And when, he says, they have done so much, are they confused? Have they blushed for their sins? Rather, they have increased sin through contempt, and they have not known how to blush. However, here 'nescierunt' is used in place of 'noluerunt': either due to excessive contempt and the vice of accustomed evil, they were not even able to understand.


Therefore, they will fall among the fallen: at the time of their visitation they will stumble, says the Lord. For, they say, they have not learned to be ashamed, and they have not only lacked work, but even knowledge and the sense of repentance. Therefore, those who once stood among them will fall, along with those who will fall into their vices, and when the time of their visitation and punishment comes, they will join all the fallen. However, it is a great wickedness, not only not to beware, but also not to want to understand sins, and to have no distinction between good and evil deeds.
