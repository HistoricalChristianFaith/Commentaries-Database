(Verse 59 and following) Thus says the Lord God: I will deal with you as you have done, you who have despised the oath and broken the covenant. But I will remember my covenant with you in the days of your youth, and I will establish with you an everlasting covenant. Then you will remember your ways and be ashamed when you receive your sisters, both the older and the younger. I will give them to you as daughters, but not on the basis of the covenant. I will establish my covenant with you, and you will know that I am the Lord, so that you may remember and be confounded, and never open your mouth again because of your shame, when I forgive you for all that you have done, says the Lord God. LXX: Thus says the Lord God: And I will do to you as you have done, as you have despised these things, in order to go against my covenant. And I will remember my covenant, which I made with you in the days of your youth, and I will establish for you an everlasting covenant, and you will remember your ways and be ashamed when you receive your older sisters with your younger ones, and I will give them to you as a test, not according to your covenant. And I will establish my covenant with you, and you shall know that I am the Lord, so that you may remember and be ashamed, and there shall be no more opening of your mouth from the face of your disgrace, when I have been propitious to you according to all that you have done, says the Lord God. Therefore I said to you: your crime and your disgrace you carry, whether you have carried or will carry; in order to receive what you deserve: because you have despised my oath, and nullified my covenant. But when it is fulfilled, I will kill, and I will give life: I will strike, and I will heal (Deut. XXXII, 39): then I will remember my covenant, which I once had with you. And I will raise up for you a covenant, not of the Law that has passed, but an eternal covenant of the Gospel: so that when you remember your ways, and receive your older and younger sisters, Samaria and Sodom and their companions, I will give them to you as daughters, or as a proof (for there must be factions (I Cor. XI, 19) and heresies, so that those who are approved may be made manifest), not based on your merit, but based on my mercy, and then you will know that I am the Lord; and you will remember my benefits, and be confounded, and say according to the Apostle: I am not worthy to be called an Apostle: because I have persecuted the Church of God (I Cor. XV, 9). And may your mouth no longer be closed because of your confusion. For it is the duty of the holy to open their mouth, as the Apostle says: My mouth is open to you, O Corinthians (2 Corinthians 6:11), and of the Lord Savior, who opened his mouth and taught them (Matthew 5), as it is also said in the psalm: I will open my mouth in parables (Psalm 78:2). But to the sinner it is said: You have sinned, be silent (Genesis 4). And: Why do you speak my covenant through your mouth? (Psalm 49:16). And: A sinner's praise is not beautiful on the lips (Sirach 15:9). And only a saint deserves to hear: Open your mouth, and I will fill it (Psalm 80:11). From this, we understand that even when we have regained our original glory through the mercy of God, indeed when we have received the eternal covenant of the Gospel, after the Lord has been appeased towards us in all that we have done, we should still have the memory of past sin and always keep our mouths shut, for we are saved not by our own works, but by the grace of God.
