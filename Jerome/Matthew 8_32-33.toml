(Verse 32, 33.) If you cast us out, send us into the herd of pigs. And He said to them: Go. And they, going out, went into the pigs. And behold, the whole herd rushed headlong into the sea, and they died in the water. But the shepherds fled; and coming into the city, they announced all these things, and about those who had demons. Not that the Savior granted the demons what they were asking, He said, go: but so that through the destruction of the pigs, an opportunity for salvation would be given to the people. For when the shepherds see these things, they immediately report them to the city. Let Manichaeus be ashamed, if the souls of men and beasts are of the same substance and from the same author, how is it that for the salvation of one man, two thousand pigs are choked?
