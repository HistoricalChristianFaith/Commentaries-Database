A city, however, placed on a hill cannot be hid, and lowliness always comes before glory. Wherefore it goes on, “but the more He charged them, so much the more a great deal they published it.”
Mystically, Tyre is interpreted, narrowness, and signifies Judaea, to which the Lord said, “For the bed is grown too narrow,” and from which He turns Himself to the Gentiles. Sidon means, hunting, for our race is like an untamed beast, and "sea”, which means a wavering inconstancy. Again, the Saviour comes to save the Gentiles in the midst of the coasts of Decapolis, which may be interpreted, as the commands of the Decalogue.
