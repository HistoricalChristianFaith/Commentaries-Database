He called a child to him to ask its age or to show the image of innocence. Or perhaps he actually set a child in their midst—he himself, who had not come to be served but to serve—to show them an example of humility.

(Verse 2.) And calling a little child, he set him in the midst of them, and said. Either simply any little child, to inquire about his age, and to demonstrate the likeness of innocence. Or certainly he placed a little child in their midst, who had come not to be served, but to serve, in order to give them an example of humility. Others interpret the little child as the Holy Spirit, whom he placed in the hearts of the disciples, in order to transform pride into humility.
