(Verse 4 onwards) Our Redeemer, the Lord of hosts is his name. Holy One of Israel. Sit in silence, and go into darkness, O daughter of the Chaldeans; for you shall no longer be called the mistress of kingdoms. I was angry with my people; I profaned my heritage, and gave them into your hand: you showed them no mercy. You have made your yoke very heavy on the aged, and you have said, 'I shall be a mistress forever': you did not lay these things to heart, you did not remember their outcome. LXX: The Lord of hosts, his name, the Holy One of Israel, says: Sit down in darkness, daughter of the Chaldeans; you shall no longer be called the strength of the kingdom. I am angry with my people, I have profaned my heritage. I have given them into your hand, but you have shown them no mercy. You have made your yoke exceedingly heavy on the elderly and have said, 'I shall be queen forever'. You did not take these things to heart, nor did you remember the consequences. The first verse is connected to the previous ones according to the Septuagint, with the meaning: And this is what the Lord of hosts, whose name is the Holy One of Israel, will do for you who have been delivered. On the other hand, according to the Hebrew, the Prophet speaks in the person of the people, saying that the Lord of hosts will do these things against Babylon, whose name is the Holy One of Israel. And once again, the discourse is directed towards Babylon itself. Sit in silence, or in remorse, and remember your sins. Enter into darkness, because you cannot bear the light due to confusion and ignominy. You shall no longer be called the mistress of just one kingdom, nor of all kingdoms. And at the same time, because a hidden question was arising: why God was angry against the Chaldeans, whom he himself sent to capture Israel: he answered that he had been angry against his own people, wanting to rebuke them, not to destroy them, to chastise them, not to kill them. But they had abused his cruelty, and had imposed more punishments than the vengeance of God demanded: and it is a great sign of Babylonian cruelty that they had not spared even the old men, whose age is also respected among enemies. But this is also a sign of pride, that, deceived by present happiness, it did not consider the uncertainties of the future. Therefore, in times of prosperity, we must always beware of what is to come: not to oppress those who are entrusted to us, who are taught to become better.
