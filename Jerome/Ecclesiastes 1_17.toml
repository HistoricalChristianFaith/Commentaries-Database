"I
applied my mind to know wisdom and to know madness and folly. I perceived that this, too, is a vexation of
the spirit." Contrary abstract ideas are understood by
looking at contrary facts; and " wisdom is the first to be lacking in
foolishness"  [Horat. Epist.I, 1,41-42.],
but it is not possible to be lacking in foolishness, unless one has understood
it. Many dangerous things are also
created from foolishness, so that while we try to avoid them, we are actually
instructed in wisdom. Solomon wanted to
know wisdom and knowledge with equal enthusiasm, and equally madness and folly,
so that whilst seeking some things and shunning others, his true wisdom might
be proved. But in this too, as in other
things, he said he found great difficulties and was not able to grasp the exact
truth of matters. What I have said above
about "vexation of the spirit" or "suffering of the soul", as it is more
often written in this book, should be sufficient to understand the rest of this
verse.
