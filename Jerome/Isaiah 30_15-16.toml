(Verse 15 and following) For thus says the Lord God, the Holy One of Israel: If you return and rest, you shall be saved; in quietness and in trust shall be your strength. But you were unwilling, and you said, 'No! We will flee upon horses'; therefore you shall flee away, and, 'We will ride upon swift steeds'; therefore your pursuers shall be swift. One thousand at the threat of one; at the threat of five you shall flee. LXX: Thus says the Lord God, the Holy One of Israel: When you turn to me and groan, then you shall be saved, and you shall know where you have been: for you trusted in idols, your strength became vain; and you were unwilling to hear, but you said, 'We will flee upon horses'; therefore you shall flee; and, 'We will ride upon swift steeds'; therefore those who pursue you shall be swift. A thousand will flee at the threat of one, and at the threat of five, many will flee. The Holy One, whom I had kept silent about his name, is the Lord God, who speaks to you and through me and through Jeremiah (Jeremiah XII): If you repent and either abandon vices or the error of evil counsel, and remain in Judah, fearing not the attack of the Babylonians, but my commandments, you will be saved. Rest and hope in the Lord, and take hold of the strength of faith in my promises. You, who have despised the commandments of life and have said in despair, it will not be as you speak; instead, we will flee to the Egyptian horses and go swiftly to them in haste. Since you have said these things, you will indeed flee and enter Egypt with destructive haste; but the Babylonians will be faster, as they will pursue you all the way to Egypt, and such great terror and fear will hold Egypt that a thousand Egyptians will not be able to resist a single Chaldean, and the multitude of fleeing enemies, five against one, as we read in Deuteronomy: The Lord will cause you to fall before your enemies' eyes. By this passage, you will depart from them and flee through seven ways from their presence, and you will be scattered among all the kingdoms of the earth (Deut. XXVIII, 25, 32). According to the allegorical and Septuagint edition, the divine word encourages all sinners, especially heretics, to repent, so that when they have turned away from vices and have repented, they may be saved; and then they will understand where they were before, and that they had hoped in vain things. And when they are encouraged to repent, on the contrary, they trust in false teachers and in the uncertainties of the world: not wanting to hear the words of God, they long for Egyptian horses and rejoice in their swiftness, which the Lord has forbidden to be multiplied (Deuteronomy 17). Therefore, the men of the church will pursue them swiftly, and one warrior's voice, or five fighters (which we should understand to refer to the mind and the five senses), will not be able to withstand a thousand men and an undisciplined crowd fleeing.
