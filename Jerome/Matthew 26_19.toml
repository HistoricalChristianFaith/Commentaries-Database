(Verse 19.) And the disciples did as Jesus had appointed them, and they prepared the Passover. In another Gospel it is written (Luke 22) that they found a large upper room furnished and prepared, and there they made ready for him. But it seems to me that the upper room is to be understood as the spiritual law, which, departing from the confines of the letter, receives the Savior in a lofty place, as Paul himself speaks (Philippians 3), that he has counted as dung and refuse whatever things he previously regarded as gain, in order to prepare a worthy dwelling for the Lord.
