"Or ever the silver cord be loosed, or the
golden bowl be broken, or the pitcher be broken at the fountain, or the wheel
broken at the cistern. Then shall the
dust return to the earth as it was: and the spirit shall return unto God who
gave it. Vanity of vanities says Ecclesiastes;
all is vanity. "He returns to former matter and after a
rather large exaggeration, -which he interposes in this place, in which he
says, "and remember your Creator, in the day of your youth; before the
days of wickedness come, and before the sun, moon grow dark" and so on,
"in the day in which the keepers of the house are renewed". - now he
finishes the point he had begun in a similar way, saying, "before the
silver cord is broken", and this or that happens. But he shows the silver cord to be this white
band, and the space that divides us from heaven. It also means the gold band, which returns to
the place whence it came down. more
precisely the two that follow, the wearing of the jug on the fountain, and the
breaking of the wheel by the pond, are metaphorical images of death. For death is just like the jug, which is worn
down, stops to fill, and the wheel by which water is carried from a well or
pond, if it has been broken. Thus the
interpretation of the Septuagint has it that the usage of water is twisted in
this rope; thus when the silver cord is broken, and the river of the spirit
flows back to the fountain, the man will die. 
He goes on more clearly: "the dust will return to the earth, whence
it was taken, and the spirit is returned to God, who gave it". From which there is enough to smile at in
those who think that spirits are produced with bodies, not from God, but are
made from the parent's body. For when
the flesh is returned to the earth, and the spirit goes back to God, who gave
it; it is obvious that God is the parent of all spirits, not man. Then after the description of man's death, he
goes back to the beginning of his book, saying, "vanity of vanities, says
Ecclesiastes, all is vanity" [Eccl. 1,2.]. For all toil of mortal men, which is argued
all through the books, is pertinent here, so that dust returns to the earth,
and the spirit returns to the place, whence it was taken, it is a great vanity
in this world to toil and obtain nothing for the future from it.
