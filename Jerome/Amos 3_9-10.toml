(Vers. 9, 10.) Make it heard in the houses of Azotus, and in the houses of the land of Egypt, and say: Gather yourselves together upon the mountains of Samaria, and behold the many follies in the midst thereof, them that suffer wrong, and that oppress in the innermost parts thereof, and they have not known to do the right thing, saith the Lord: treasuring up iniquity and spoils in their houses. LXX: Declare ye in the countries of the Assyrians, and make it known in the land of Egypt, and say: Gather yourselves together upon the mountain of Samaria, and behold the many wonderful things in the midst thereof, and the oppressions in it, and they have not known the things that are to come in it, saith the Lord, who treasureth up iniquity and misery in their countries. We have already mentioned that the prophet Amos specifically, indeed a large part of the volume, prophesies to the ten tribes called Israel and Ephraim, and Samaria. Therefore, he is also commanded to announce now to Ashdod and the land of Egypt that follows. For Ashdod, the Seventy Assyrians wanting something, since Ashdod is called Esdod in the language of the Hebrews, and the Assyrians, Assur. For the buildings that are called Armanoth, they rendered regions, which are called Sadoth, and they have nothing in the word of similitude. He said, 'Tell them to gather all the nations that are nearby, and let them see the crimes of Israel, so that they do not think that God's judgment is unjust. Just as if he were to say, 'First see what they do, and then you can approve of my opinion.' And he introduced it beautifully: Over the mountains of Samaria, or the city that is now called Sebaste, then known as Samaria, or the whole province that is situated in the mountains: and see the many insanities in their midst, that they worship calves as gods and sacrifice their own children. Not content with this wickedness, they defame the poor in their own homes and do not know how to do what is right, storing up not gold and money, which are sometimes obtained through labor, but wickedness and plunder in their own houses: so that because they have deserted the worship of God and have worshipped idols, God may give them over to a reprobate mind, to do what is not fitting.' And since, according to the laws of tropology, Samaria is referred to as the heretics who falsely claim to be the keepers of God's commandments, the divine word commands that they preach among the Gentiles who do not have the knowledge of God, in whose doctrine there is a consuming fire, tribulation, and distress. So that they may consider the false Samaria and ascend to the mountains of its pride, and see the many insanities in the midst of the city, while each one imagines whatever he desires and worships his own creation - like Marcion who considers God to be good but inactive, like Valentinus who believes in thirty αἰῶνας and an ultimate Christ, whom he calls an abortive, like Basilides who calls the omnipotent God by the wondrous name Ἀβράξας and says that the annual course of the sun is contained within the circle, which the pagans call Μείθραν under the same number of other letters. And the follies of Iberians marvel at Balsamo Barbeloque. Are these not insanity and many insanities, with each person imagining whatever comes into their mind? They also endure slander in their innermost places, or the simple ones who believe are oppressed; while under the guise of truth they cultivate falsehood, and they do not know how to do what is right at all, because they have lost the path of truth, and they do not believe in the one who says: I am the truth (John 14:6): and they hoard for themselves the doctrines of wickedness, and they seize and enclose in their houses those whom they can deceive with false error. But if it pleases to read the Assyrians (which, however, is not found in Hebrew), let us say that they are those of whom it is written: I will bring upon you a great chief of the Assyrians, who said, With my strength I will act, and so on, so that the heretics may be captured by the Assyrian and held in the land of Egypt, from which they have already come to the Church and been released.
