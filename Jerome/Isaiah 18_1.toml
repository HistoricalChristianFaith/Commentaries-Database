(Chapter XVIII, Verse 1.) Woe to the land with the sound of wings beyond the rivers of Ethiopia. The Hebrew word Selsel (), which Symmachus interpreted as noise, Theodotion as birds, and we translate as cymbal. Aquila translated bis umbram. But it should be known that umbra Sel () is said, but here the syllable itself is doubled. From which we can understand the saying: Woe to the land that promises help in the shadow of its wings. And as the Scripture says: Whoever dwells in the shelter of the Most High will rest in the shadow of the Almighty (Psalm XC, 1), for which it is written in Hebrew, He will dwell in the shadow of the Omnipotent: boasting to have the likeness of God herself, and in danger promises to aid others. But it signifies either No, the city of Egypt, which is now called Alexandria, or Egypt itself, in which Jerusalem has always relied on like a bruised reed, which, when broken, pierces the hand of the one leaning on it. And here is the most beautiful order: just as in the previous Vision the prophetic word threatened Damascus, that the ten tribes would have help in it, begging for the mercy of God; so now also the desolation of Egypt is proclaimed, for which the invocation of God has been neglected. For it is the land itself that is beyond the rivers of Ethiopia, that is, beyond the streams of the Nile river, which no one doubts flows from Ethiopia into Egypt. Egypt can be called the granary of the world because of the abundance of crops; indeed, the swift and rapid flight of birds produces the sound of a cymbal. Some interpret this as referring to the Roman Empire, which sends ambassadors to the sea and on papyrus vessels over the waters, and they relate all history to the times of Vespasian and Titus, during which Jerusalem was destroyed. But this does not befit our faith, that the Lord should threaten the Roman Kingdom, wherefore He has overthrown the impious nation, and again say that gifts are to be brought to Mount Zion, unless perhaps we understand these things spiritually in the Church.
