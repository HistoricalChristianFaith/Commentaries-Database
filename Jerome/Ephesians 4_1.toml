Those who love Christ follow him. They are bonded with him in the ties of love. There is also another explanation [i.e., Origen’s], which it is the reader’s prerogative to accept or not: Suppose what is called here the prison is the body. Because Paul has taken on the body for the ministry of the gospel, he is consequently said to be in bondage to Christ.
