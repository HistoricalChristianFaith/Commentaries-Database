This means one of two things. You will sink to hell for the reason that you most arrogantly opposed my prophecy. Or, although you have received so much privilege in being raised to heaven by my kind generosity, by my miracles and by my acts of goodness, even then you will be battered by a greater punishment because you did not care to believe them. .

(Verse 23) And you, Capernaum, will you be exalted to heaven? You will go down to the realm of the dead. In another version, we find: And you, Capernaum, which was exalted to heaven, will descend to the depths. And there are two different understandings. Perhaps you will descend to the depths because you have proudly resisted my preaching. Or perhaps because you, exalted to heaven in my presence and witnessing my signs and miracles, having such privilege, will be punished with greater sufferings for refusing to believe in them as well.
