(Verse 6, 7) However, the disciples went and did as Jesus had ordered them. They brought the donkey and the colt, and put their cloaks on them, and Jesus sat on them. This colt and donkey, on which the apostles spread their cloaks so that Jesus might sit more comfortably, were naked before the coming of the Savior, and they shivered without cover, with many claiming dominion over them. But after they received the apostolic garments, they became more beautiful and had the Lord as their rider. The apostolic garment, or the teaching of virtues, or the exposition of Scriptures, can be understood, or the variations of ecclesiastical doctrines: unless the soul is instructed and adorned by these, it does not deserve to have the Lord as its dwelling.
