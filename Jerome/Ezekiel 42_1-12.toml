Chapter XLII, verses 1 and following: 'And he brought me to the outer court by the way leading to the north, and he brought me to the treasury which was opposite the separated building and opposite the temple facing the north. On the face of the length of one hundred cubits of the north gate, and the breadth of fifty cubits, opposite the twenty cubits of the inner court, and opposite the pavement laid with stone of the outer court, where the porch was joined to the triple porch.' And before the treasury, there was a walkway ten cubits wide, looking inward, with the doors facing north, where the treasuries were lower on the upper levels because the porticoes that protruded from the lower and middle parts of the building supported them. These porticoes were narrow and did not have columns like the columns of the courtyards, so they protruded from the lower and middle parts of the building by fifty cubits. And there was an outer courtyard by the treasury, which was in the way of the outer court before the treasury: the length of it was fifty cubits. Because the length of the treasuries of the outer court was fifty cubits and the length before the face of the temple was one hundred cubits. And there was an entrance under these treasuries from the east for those who entered from the outer court: in the width of the courtyard of the eastern way before the separate building. And there were before the building treasuries, and a road in front of their face like the treasuries, which were on the northern side, according to their length, and thus their width. And every entrance of them, and their similarities, and their doors, according to the doors of the treasuries, which were on the road facing the South (Known), a door at the head of the road, which was in front of the separate vestibule through the Eastern road for those entering. LXX: And he brought me into the outer court towards the east, opposite the north gate; and he led me to the inner court, and behold, there were five chambers on the north side of the building, and a separate building adjoining the north side, one hundred cubits long and fifty cubits wide, with the same measurements as the gates of the inner court, and like the pillars of the outer court, according to the arrangement of the gateways of the three-sided portico, and opposite the chambers was a walkway ten cubits wide, one hundred cubits long, along the inner way of one cubit, with its entrance facing north. And the walkways of the upper rooms were similar, as the columns of the upper rooms stood out from the lower columns, and the space was similar. And there were triple porticoes, and they did not have columns like the columns on the outer side; therefore, they stood out from those that were lower, and in the middle of the ground fifty cubits, and the outer light was like the outer courtyard porticoes, which faced the porticoes of the north, with a length of fifty cubits. The length of the porticos facing the outer courtyard was fifty cubits. And these are opposite their own facade, all one hundred cubits, and the entrance of these porticos is towards the Eastern entrance, so one may enter through them into the outer courtyard, according to the light that was at the beginning of the walkway to the South, opposite the Southern side of the building, and separate. And the porticos and walkway are opposite their own facade, according to the measurements of the porticos and the way to the North, and their length, and their width, and all their exits, and entrances, and lights, and the entrance to the porticos towards the South, and the entrance from the beginning of the walkway to the light, the space of the reed pen: and so one may go towards the East through them. That which is translated into the East in the LXX is not found in the Hebrew, and it is clear that it is superfluous. For how is it brought out to the outer gate toward the East, when it follows against the gate of the North? That which we have also put above, and in this place: He brought me into the treasury, which will be opposite the separate building, and opposite the temple facing the North, for which it is held in the LXX: And he brought me: and behold, there are five chambers from the remaining building and next to the separate building toward the North: for separate, which Aquila and Symmachus translated, the second edition of Aquila, and Theodotion placed this word itself, Gazera (), expressing it similarly in all places: and many other things which are placed in the present passage between the Hebrew and the LXX not only differ in order, but also in number, and in the interpretation of words, so that if we wished to linger on each one, and seek and explain their reason for the diversity, we would depart greatly from the proposed subject. And I had wanted to pass over in silence my present testimony of final despair and greatness, but I thought it better to say anything than to say nothing at all, adopting that Socratic principle: I know that I do not know. For it is a part of knowledge to know that you do not know. Therefore, after the prophet had carefully observed the things that were inside, the man, whose rope and reed were in his hand, led him out to the outer courtyard, along the path leading to the North, which he had already seen from above before he entered the inner chambers. But we see things differently when it comes to perfect knowledge, compared to the beginning of discipline. And it is necessary for one who has looked into the inner workings, according to the same form and measures and hidden sacraments, to also see the external things. However, he was led into the treasury, or as the Septuagint translated it, the hall, or as Theodotion, the παστοφόριον, which is turned into a chamber: which was located opposite the separate building. But what the Seventy added for the treasury, five exedras, is not found in Hebrew. The treasury was a separate building, as we have already said. Gazera. And it was separate, receiving those who came from the North, and it was against the temple facing the North, that is, looking towards the parts of the North, but not located in the North, so that there would be an easier passage for those who were leaving the cold of the North, from which evils arise upon the earth (Jer. 1). We read in the book of Numbers that the tribes of Dan and Naphtali, and the sons of Bilhah and Zilpah, the maidservants of Rachel and Leah, held their camps in the northern regions. Moreover, the width of the entrance to the north was one hundred cubits, and the length was fifty cubits: a square number and perfect from ten decades, and from seven weeks, which is the number of remission, and at the beginning of unity, that is, the octave, it bursts forth, so that the spaces of the priestly duties in the temple of God may be shown. And that which is joined next to the Hebrew, opposite the twenty cubits of the inner court, which the Seventy have translated, was described like the gates of the inner court, has this meaning: that the number of a hundred and fifty in the outer court should have the same force as the number of twenty in the inner court. For if you reckon four times five times, in the number twenty, you will find both Testaments: so that both the Law may be held in the Gospel and the Gospel may be born from the root of the Law. For the number seventy, the likeness of the inner court, may have been interpreted, perhaps fearing the number twenty, in which offerings of Esau are made, to place in the inner court. It follows: And against the pavement, the floor of the outer court, where there was a porch, joined to the triple porch; for which seventy were transferred: And as the columns of the outer court were placed in order, opposite the face of the triple porches. However, it signifies that the pavement of the outer court was laid with living stone, so that the feet of the priests are not defiled by the dust of summer or the mud of winter. And so, the Lord, about to ascend to the Father, washes the feet of the Apostles (John 13), so that with purified and cleansed feet they may ascend to the kingdoms of heaven; and he commands the apostles that in whichever city they enter and are not received, they should shake off the dust from their feet (Matthew 10; and Mark 6): so that nothing of earthly possessions may remain with them. And not only was the pavement covered with stones, but there was also a portico joined to a triple portico. A portico protecting priests from rain and heat, and joined to the triple portico, showing the mystery of the Trinity, which, while being divided in names among the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, is yet joined in one divinity to itself. There was also before the treasury, or the halls, or the chambers, a walkway of ten cubits in width, looking towards the interior of the road of one cubit. And what was added by the Seventy: It is extra to have a length of one hundred cubits: for in the Hebrew it is not held, what they set forth, they took what is held in Hebrew, looking towards the interior of the road of one cubit, which we translated from the truth of Hebrew. But it signifies that before the doors of all the treasuries, or exedrae, and chambers, there was a walkway, having a width of ten cubits, which is a perfect number, either because of the Decalogue or because of the mystery of the Gospel. For if you come from one to four by twos and threes, the number ten is made, the number of the Gospels: in the width of which the priests walk, going before each treasury. But in such a way that they always look towards the interior of the path which leads to one cubit, that is, to the worship of one divinity, as the Son says to the Father: I have revealed thy name to men (John 17:6). For she is the way, looking inward, which is said in the Gospel: I am the way, and the truth, and the life (John XIV, 6): because no one comes to the knowledge of the Father, except through the Son. It follows: And their doors to the north, where the treasuries were in the lower and middle parts: because the porticoes which stood out from the lower and middle parts of the building supported them. For they were narrow, and did not have columns like the columns of the courts: therefore they stood out from the lower and middle parts by fifty cubits from the ground. What is joined: the doors of these, it is understood, (belong to) the exedrae or treasury rooms, about which there was discussion above. The treasuries were on the upper floors, that is, in the lower rooms. The upper rooms were ascended by Elijah and Elisha (1 Kings 17; 2 Kings 4); and the Lord, with the disciples, celebrated the Passover (Mark 14), and Tabitha, who was raised by the Apostle's faith and the merit of her virtues (Acts 9). These are the upper rooms, about which it is written in the psalm: He waters the mountains from his upper rooms (Psalm 104, 13). For unless a mountain is made, and rises to higher things, it will not be irrigated by the rains of the Lord, which for the diversity of merits are irrigated in the first, second, and third coenaculum. Even the storerooms themselves, that is, the treasuries of the Lord's treasures, are lower in the higher places. (Ephesians 3). However, the higher one is, the more one is humbled with the Apostle, saying: I am not worthy to be called an Apostle, because I persecuted the Church of God. (1 Corinthians 1:9). However, the treasure rooms themselves were located in the lower rooms, because they supported the porticoes that projected from the lower and middle parts of the building. And the reason why the treasure rooms were placed in the lower rooms and were lower was this: because the porticoes, which enjoyed the freedom of the air, supported and projected from the lower and middle parts of the building. In this way, the second floor of the building would be higher than the first floor, and the third floor would be higher than the second, so that as one ascended to higher levels, they would use a higher treasure room, which increased in humility, as the Lord says: 'If anyone wishes to be first, he shall be the last of all and the servant of all.' (Mark 9:35). For they were not carried by other columns, as we read in the columns of the atrium; but they protruded from the lower and middle parts of the ground by fifty cubits, as a sign of the remission of all debts. These, however, are the sad things of which it is commanded: Describe them in triple form, with counsel and knowledge, so that you may answer with words of truth those things that are proposed to you (Prov. 22:20-21). Therefore, the lower and outer parts need columns, but the higher and inner parts do not need the support of columns, that is, of external help. After this it is said: And the outer court was surrounded by a wall, with treasuries along the outside walls. The length of this outer court was fifty cubits, because the length of the treasuries of the outer court was fifty cubits, and the length before the front of the temple was one hundred cubits. The surrounding wall, called the peribolus, enclosed the treasuries along the outside walls of the outer court, and it was fifty cubits in length, as we have frequently mentioned. Moreover, the length in front of the face of the temple was not fifty cubits, as it was before the treasury, but one hundred cubits: so that after the remission of all sins, we may await perfect rewards in the number one hundred (Lev. XII). Regarding the barrier, or wall, which in Hebrew is called Gader (), the Seventy have interpreted it as light, which comes from outside and illuminates the eyes of our hearts: our natural light, which operates in the senses, is not sufficient to have the perfect brightness of knowledge, unless it enters from outside through the grace of God. What first illuminates the eyes of our heart, and the outer atrium, which extends to a width of fifty cubits, makes it shine. Then, when we come before the face of the temple, we shall receive perfect rewards in the number of one hundred. And below, there was an entrance to the treasury from the East for those entering from the outer atrium. For it is necessary for us to possess the riches of God, and to find the entrance below the treasury from the outer atrium, under the treasury of the East, and to come through the width of the vestibule, which faces the way of the East, to the building that is separated for the holy ones, before which are the treasuries, and in that very way, a likeness to the treasuries that were in the way of the North. For although we may reach the entrance to the East, the resemblance of the ancestors is found in the smaller things, and we cannot reach the light of the East except by way of the North, that is, by progressing from the smaller and lower things to the greater and higher things. In the very entrance itself, the length was similar to the width, that is, the same measurement throughout: every entrance and likeness, and doors had the same measurement and likeness as the treasure chambers that were on the road facing the South. For indeed, by the East the cold of the North is resisted, we reach the South, in which the bridegroom reclines at midday, and moves in full light. At the head, however, of the same road, that is, the Eastern one, which is open to those who enter, there is a door, which unless it is opened by Him who says: I am the door (John 10:9) and who has the key of David, to the vestibule separated by holy virtues, and which receives those coming from the North, we cannot reach. It is unnecessary to discuss each individual word of this passage in detail: both what has been said does not lack clarity, and what we keep silent about is almost similar to what we have said.
