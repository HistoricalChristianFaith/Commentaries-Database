Lord, who shall sojourn in your tent? … The tent seems to me to be the church of this world. Now the churches that you see are tabernacles, for we are not here as permanent dwellers but rather as those about to migrate to another place. If “this world as we see it is passing away,” and it says elsewhere that “heaven and earth will pass away,” if, then, heaven and earth will pass away, how much more will the stones of the churches that we see also pass away? Now that is why churches are tabernacles, because we are going to migrate from them to the holy mountain of God. What is this holy mountain of God? It says in Ezekiel against the prince of Tyre, “You have been cut off as one slain from the mountain of God.”
