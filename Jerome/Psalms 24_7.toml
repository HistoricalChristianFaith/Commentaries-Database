As our Lord ascends to the Father in triumph, he issues commands to the angels saying, “Open to me the gates of justice; I will enter them and give thanks to the Lord.” These are the gates of which in the twenty-fourth psalm the angels were speaking while they were preparing for the entrance of the Lord: “Lift up, O gates, your lintels; reach up, you ancient portals, that the King of glory may come in!” Aptly are the gates commanded to lift up high and raise aloft their portals, since, in accordance with the dispensation and mystery of the flesh and in conformity with the victory of the cross, he reenters heaven mightier than he had come down on earth. “This gate is the Lord’s; the just shall enter it.” Through this gate, Peter has entered, and Paul, and all the apostles and martyrs, and today the saints continue to go in; through this gate, the thief was the first to pass with the Lord. Have faith, therefore, and be hopeful for your own entrance.
