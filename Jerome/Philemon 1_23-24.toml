Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, greets you, as do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my fellow workers. As we mentioned earlier, the letter to the Colossians was written at the same time and through the same person as the letter to Philemon, and the names of those who send greetings are mentioned in both letters. In fact, in the letter to the Colossians, it is written: "Aristarchus my fellow prisoner greets you, as does Mark the cousin of Barnabas, and Epaphras, who is one of you and a servant of Christ" (Colossians 4:10, 12). And a little later: "Luke the beloved physician greets you, and Demas; greet Archippus, who is in the Lord. See that you fulfill the ministry that you have received in the Lord" (Colossians 4:14, 17); and: "Remember my chains" (Colossians 4:18). But if someone does not consider the writings to be equally authorized, because a few names that are not mentioned here are written to the Colossians, let them know that not all are friends to everyone or are known; and that it is one thing to write a private letter to one individual, and another to write a public letter to the entire Church. "Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, sends greetings to you," he says. As for who Epaphras, Paul's fellow prisoner, is, we have received such a story: They say that the parents of the apostle Paul were from the region of Gyscalis in Judea; and when the whole province was laid waste by the Roman forces, and the Jews were dispersed throughout the world, they were sent to the city of Tharsus in Cilicia; and young Paul followed his parents' condition. And so it can be said that what he testifies about himself is true: "They are Hebrews, so am I. They are Israelites, so am I. They are descendants of Abraham, so am I" (2 Cor. 11:22). And elsewhere: "A Hebrew of Hebrews" (Philip. 3:5): and other things that indicate him as a Jew rather than from Tarsus. If this is so, we can suspect that Epaphras was captured at the same time as Paul, and when he was released placed with his parents in the city of Colossae in Asia, he later received Christ's words. Hence to the Colossians, as we have said above, is written: "Epaphras, who is one of you and a servant of Christ Jesus, sends greetings. He is always wrestling in prayer for you" (Col. 4:12). If this is so, then Aristarchus, who is said to have been his fellow prisoner in the same Epistle, will be interpreted in the same way, unless perhaps something hidden and sacred, as some think, is shown in the word captivity ("Al." shows) that those who were captured and bound were brought ( "Al." led) into this valley of tears. And if neither [interpretation] is accepted, from what has been added here 'in Christ Jesus,' we can suspect that they endured the same bonds for Christ as Paul did at Rome; and just as a prisoner of Christ [referring to Paul], so also to one caught [in the bonds of Christ]. Or certainly because he is noble himself among the apostles, like Andronicus and Julia, about whom it is written to the Romans: 'Greet Andronicus and Julia, my relatives and fellow prisoners, who are notable among the apostles, and who were in Christ before me' (Romans 16:7). This is about Epaphras. Furthermore, when writing to Philemon about his Gospel and its constraints, he lists Mark, whom I believe to be the founder of the Gospel, and Aristarchus, whom we previously mentioned, and Demas, about whom he complains elsewhere: "Demas has abandoned me, because he loves the present age, and he went to Thessalonica." And Luke the physician, who, abandoning the Gospel and Acts of the Apostles for the Churches, has been turned from a fisherman of fish to a fisherman of men by the Apostles (Matth. 4): so of the physician of bodies, he has been changed to a physician of souls, of whom it is also said elsewhere: "I have sent with him the brother, whose praise is in the Gospel through all the churches" (2 Cor. 8:18): every time his book is read in the churches, his medicine is unfailing.
