(Verse 3) And Jesus, extending His hand, touched him, saying: I will, be clean. And immediately his leprosy was cleansed. By extending His hand, the Lord caused the leprosy to flee. Consider also how humble and devoid of boasting His response is. The man had said, if you will: the Lord answered, I will. The man had said, you can cleanse me: The Lord unites and says, be cleansed. Therefore, it is not, as many Latin speakers believe, to be joined and read as, I will-be-cleanse, but separately, so that first, He says, I will: then, giving the command, He says, be clean (or be cleansed).
