(Verse 23.) Make a conclusion, for the land is full of bloodshed, and the city is full of wickedness. LXX: And I will bring disturbance, for the land is full of bloodshed, and the city is full of iniquities. The Hebrew word Arethich () is interpreted by Aquila as conclusion, and by Symmachus and Theodotion as καθήλωσιν, meaning crucifixion. For this reason, the Septuagint uses φυρμὸν, which we translate as disturbance. Therefore, O prophet, conclude my wrath upon the land of Judah and upon the city of Jerusalem in a brief speech, so that just as the land is full of bloodshed, for all are judged in bloodshed, shedding innocent blood: which the Scripture also records that the Jews did in the person of Naboth: thus their own blood is shed, and the city full of wickedness is demonstrated. For the city of Jerusalem, from gate to gate, is filled with the blood of the prophets, even under Manasseh (1 Kings 21). And there will come for them a conclusion, and disturbance and affliction, so that none of those who are facing imminent miseries can escape.
