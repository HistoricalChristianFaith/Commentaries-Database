(Chapter 28, Verse 1) But on the evening of the Sabbath, which dawns on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to see the tomb. The fact that different times of these women are described in the Gospels is not a sign of falsehood, as the wicked claim, but rather the diligent duty of visitation, as they frequently go and come back, and do not allow themselves to be away from the Lord's tomb for a long time or further.
