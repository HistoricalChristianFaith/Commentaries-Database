" Then I turned my attention to
appraising wisdom with madness and folly - for what can man who comes after the
king do?" This seems to discuss heavenly matters until
the place where he says, "the eyes of a wise man are in his
head". I had summed up all things
in one explanation, intending to show the meaning briefly, and because of that,
again according to "anagoge [Allegorical interpretation bearing out a deeper sense of the
Scriptures.],"
I had only touched lightly on some things, but now I ought to explain in a
manner similar to that in which I began. 
For the meaning is quite different here from the interpretation found in
the Septuagint. But he says he had
returned to seeking wisdom after pleasures and those desires he had condemned,
in which he found more foolishness and stupidity than true and recognised
knowledge. For man, he said, is not able
to know so clearly and truly the wisdom of his creator and of his king, as his
creator knows it himself. And so he says
that those things that we know, we only think we have grasped and value more
than know what is true.
