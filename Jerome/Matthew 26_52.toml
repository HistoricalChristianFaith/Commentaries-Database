(Verse 52.) Then Jesus said to him: Put your sword back into its place. For all who take the sword will perish by the sword. And if one does not carry a sword in vain, who is appointed as the avenger of the Lord's wrath against those who do evil: nevertheless, whoever takes up the sword will perish by the sword. Which sword? That same one which turns fiery before Paradise (Genesis 3): and the sword of the spirit, which is described as the armor of God (Ephesians 6).
