Church people are truly rustic and simple people, but all the heretics are Aristotelian and Platonic. Briefly, that you may know that gold is the usual simile for worldly eloquence, that the heretic’s tongue, for example, is as brilliant as gold, hear the words of the prophet: “Babylon was a golden cup in the hand of the Lord.” Note how he describes the Babylon of confusion. This world, therefore, is that golden cup. All nations drink from that cup of gold.

“Strangers with the inhabitants of Tyre.” Where we have alienigenae [foreigners], the Hebrew text has Philistim, which is interpreted, a cup of poison, for heretics are all drunk from the cup of Babylon, of which Jeremiah says, “The golden cup of Babylon that made the whole earth drunk.” Note: “the golden cup of Babylon.” Babylon connotes confusion: “a cup truly golden,” the teachings of philosophers and the eloquence of orators. Who, indeed, has not been misled by the philosophers? Who has not been seduced by the orators of this world? Theirs is a golden cup, the splendor of eloquence on the outside but within full of poison that they could never conceal except under the gleam of gold. You taste the sweetness of their eloquence, to be sure, and do not suspect the fatal poison. “Strangers with the inhabitants of Tyre.” Tyre stands for “narrowness.” Truly, there is no room there, not the wide open heart of Christ, as the apostle says to the Corinthians: “In us there is no lack of room for you, but in your heart there is no room for us.”
