"Then I
looked at all things that I had done and the energy I had expended in doing
them. "He who does all things with diligence and wariness is
able to say this. "It was clear that it was all
futile and a vexation of the spirit, [and there is no profit under the sun.]" As if he considers that in comparison with
other things, all things are cheap which are under the sun, and are different
according to the variety of desires. "And
there is no profit under the sun". 
Christ placed his tabernacle in the sun. 
So Christ will not be able to live, nor be plentiful in whoever has not
yet obtained the lucidity of the sun, its regularity and constancy.
