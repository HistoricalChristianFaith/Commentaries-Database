Slaves should be subject to their masters in all things: pleasing, not contradicting, not stealing; but showing all good faith, so as to adorn the doctrine of our Savior God in all things. For our Lord and Savior, who says in the Gospel: Come to me, all you who labor and are burdened, and I will refresh you (Matt. 11:28), considers no condition, age, sex, or beatitude to be foreign. Therefore, now the apostle establishes precepts for the servants and members of the body of Christ as part of the Church. And just as he taught Titus how he should instruct the old men, old ladies, young girls, and young men above, he now establishes appropriate precepts for the servants. First, that they should be subject to their masters in all things. But in all these things which are not contrary to God: so that if the master commands something which is not adverse to the holy Scriptures, then the servant should be subject to the master. But if he commands something contrary, then the spirit should obey the master rather than the body. Pay careful attention to how he decrees precepts suitable for people. Servants, he says, should be subject to their masters in all things (Ephesians 6:5). In another place, discussing sons, he says: "Children obey your parents" (Colossians 3:20). For it is right for sons to obey their parents, just as servants are subject to their master. Nor should we consider it contradictory that in another letter he says, "Women, be subject to your husbands" (Ephesians 5:22; Colossians 3:18), and in this one he asserts that wives are subject to their husbands, as if he uses the same word for both servants and wives. For in a sense, a husband is the lord of his wife. "He will rule over you," he says (Genesis 3:16). The Savior himself was subject to his parents (Luke 2), but this was when he was still only twelve years old and not yet of an age to inherit his kingdom. And it is also written elsewhere of him: "When all things are subjected to him, then the Son himself will also be subjected to him who put all things in subjection under him, that God may be all in all" (1 Corinthians 15:28). And all things will be subject to him when he says, "The Lord said to my Lord, 'Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool '" (Psalm 110:1). In subordinate servants the Lord is subject. And just as it is said to be a curse for us when it is not a curse but a true blessing, so it is written for us, either subject or not subject: whether we are subject to God or not. Some read this passage as follows: Let servants be subject to their masters, and after they have distinguished this, they infer, please in all things: whereas in Greek there is a different order of reading, that is, let servants be subject to their masters in all things; so that it follows, to be pleasing: which, though not fully, can still be interpreted in part, as pleasing to themselves: so that the divine sentence does not seem unjust to them on their own terms. But how can a poor person be saved according to their own measure; and a woman in her sexual weakness is not excluded from the kingdom of God, and every condition can receive happiness according to its own order: Thus let slaves be pleased with themselves that they are slaves, and not think that they cannot serve God because they are subject to men; but they will please the will of God more, if they are also subject to their masters in all things, and are content with their condition; and what the Apostle commands to do thereafter, that they should not be contradicted, not stealing. Or the greatest vice of servants is to contradict their masters, and when they have ordered something, to whisper among themselves. Therefore, he admonishes Titus, so that through sound doctrine he may remove such passion from those who are Christian slaves. For if a master commands things, a servant must fulfill: why should he not do this willingly, with goodwill; but also offend the lord, and yet do what is ordered: especially when God is offended by contradiction? And in another place he speaks of grumbling people: Let their murmur cease from me, and they shall not die (Num. XIV). After the contradiction and other vice of the servants let the doctrine of Christ correct them, lest they be thieves. A thief, however, is judged not only in great things, but also in small things. For not only what is taken away by theft is considered, but also the intention of the thief. Likewise in fornication and adultery, fornication or adultery is not different if it is done with a beautiful or wealthy, ugly or poor, prostitute or adulteress: but whatever it is, it is one fornication or adultery. Thus, in theft, however much a servant takes away, he incurs the crime of theft. Therefore, in the law of Moses, thieves are sometimes forced to pay back sevenfold, sometimes fourfold, and sometimes they are put to death, or the thief himself is sold for theft, about which recently I remember having explained to you in Leviticus. But if this is forbidden in regard to a slave, how much more in regard to a free person, so that neither a judge should seize, nor a soldier who is not content with his wages should destroy what belongs to another? A certain very honorable man spoke excellently when the integrity of a certain judge was praised to him, and he who was praising him said, "He is not a thief." He responded, "He would make an excellent slave if he were not also a fugitive, for suspicion of theft should be far removed from every free person." Therefore, let slaves be subject to their masters in all things, let them be compliant with their condition, so that they do not bear their servitude bitterly, do not contradict their masters, do not act extravagantly, and after these things show good faith in all things, so that they might adorn the teaching of our God and Savior in all things. For if they have been faithful with earthly masters, they will begin to be entrusted with greater things by God. But the doctrine of the Lord adorns, who does those things which are fitting for his condition. And he confounds from the opposite, who is not subject in all, whose condition displeases him, who shows no good faith as a contradictor and defrauder in nothing. For how can one be faithful in the substance of God, who could not exhibit faith to an earthly master?
