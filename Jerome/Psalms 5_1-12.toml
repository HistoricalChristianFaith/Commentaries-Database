There are many who insist that the titles do not belong to the psalms but who really do not know why they hold such a view. If the titles were not found in all the manuscripts—Hebrew, Greek and Latin—their position would be tenable. Since, however, there are titles in the Hebrew books, and this one in particular marks the fifth psalm, I am amazed at the implication that there can be anything in Scripture without reason. If it be true that “not one jot or one title shall be lost from the Law,” how much more shall not a word or a syllable be lost?

Who is she who is to obtain the inheritance? I believe it is the church, for it is the church who receives the inheritance.… David sings at the beginning that the church wins the inheritance at the end.… There are, however, several other interpretations. Many say that the psalm accords with the history of the people of Israel who long to return to Judea from Babylon, but they have failed to interpret “unto the end” and “for her that obtains the inheritance.” We, then, by “combining spiritual with spiritual” shall endeavor with the help of your prayers to consider this psalm as applying to the church.
