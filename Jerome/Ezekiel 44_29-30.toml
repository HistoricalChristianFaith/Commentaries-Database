(Verse 29, 30) They themselves shall eat the victim for sin and for transgression (or for ignorance), and every vow (or separation) in Israel shall be theirs. And the firstborn of all the firstborns, and all the libations from all that are offered, shall be for the priests. And you shall give the firstfruits of your food to the priest, so that he may put a blessing on his house (or put blessings on your houses). For the victim and sacrifice, which in Hebrew is called Manaa (), Aquila and Symmachus interpreted as a gift. Again, for the vow which the Seventy translated as ἀφόρισμα, which means separation, Aquila and Symmachus and Theodotion interpreted as a dedication, which in Hebrew is called Herem (). And it is to be considered that all that which the Lord now speaks through the prophet, He had already spoken through Moses. And it is to be sought why the same things that were said are repeated: namely, that those things which are in the minds of men, deleted either by negligence in reading or contempt in hearing and forgetting, may be renewed orally, which are not written with pen and ink, but with the Spirit and word of God. And so the Savior left no written volume of his teaching, which in many cases the apocrypha fabricate delusional writings: but he speaks daily to the hearts of believers through the Father and his Spirit. And this will be the response against those who slander the prophets, asking why they repeat what is contained in the Pentateuch in their own writings. Therefore, let the priests eat the victim, both for sin and for transgression, or ignorance, about whom it is written: They will eat the sins of my people (Hosea IV, 8). We must not only rejoice at the offering of gifts, but also fear the condemnation of honor, if we unworthily misuse them. The first things according to the letter are of living beings, and of inanimate things that are first born, and of those that the earth first produces. The first fruits of our food are also offered to the priests, so that we may not taste of new crops unless the priest has tasted first. We do this so that the priest may repon our blessing and offering in his house, or so that the Lord may bless our houses according to his imprecation. The dignity of priests is great, but their downfall is also great if they sin. Let us rejoice in their ascent, but let us fear their descent. It is not as joyful to have reached lofty heights as it is sorrowful to fall from them. For we will not only give an account for our own sins, but also for the sins of all those whose gifts we have abused, and we are not at all concerned for their salvation.
