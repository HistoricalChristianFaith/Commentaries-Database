(Vers. 5 seqq.) And the wall of the house was measured six cubits, and the width of each side was four cubits all around the house. The sides were side by side, thirty-three on each side, and there were projections that entered through the wall of the house on the sides all around, in order to contain them and not touch the wall of the temple. And there was a ascending courtyard: going up through a spiral staircase and leading to the upper room of the temple in a circular path. Therefore, the temple was broader in the higher parts, and thus one ascended from the lower parts to the higher in the middle, and from the middle to the narrow, and to Thrael. However, what is placed in the Septuagint, 'And from the middle to the narrow,' that is, to the three balconies, and to Thrael, is not found in Hebrew. For Thrael also (which I do not know what it signifies; since it is not found in Hebrew) is read by those of Urani (), which both we and others have translated, and I have seen, so that the order of the testimony may be followed.
