This statement from Paul: "He who set me apart from the womb of my mother and called me through his grace was pleased to reveal his son to me, in order that I might preach him among the Gentiles." (Gal 1:15-16)  John the Baptist was also sanctified in the womb.  He received the Holy Spirit, stirred in the womb and spoke through the mouth of his mother.

Ah, ah, ah, Lord God: He pleads against his office, which in view of his age he cannot fulfill, showing the same modesty as Moses, who said that he was slight and meager of voice.  But Moses was summoned, as it were, at a great and robust age, whereas Jeremiah is given the grace of boyhood, which is adorned with modesty and reserve.

(Verse 6.) And I said: Ah, ah, ah, Lord God, behold, I do not know how to speak, for I am a child. LXX: And I said, O Lord God, I do not know how to speak, for I am young. He detests the office that he cannot sustain due to his age, with the same modesty that Moses himself says he has a thin and weak voice (Exodus IV and 6). But he, as if he were seized with great and robust age, is caught up; forgiveness is given to this childhood, which is adorned with modesty and shame.
