"Surely
oppression makes a wise man mad; and a gift destroys the heart. "Now see the wise man as if regarding profit, according
to that passage which says, "accuse the wise and he will love you" [Prov. 9, 8.]. Wise, or even having completed his training,
he knows no accusation, and is perturbed by no disaster. We should use this verse if we see disaster
befall a righteous and wise man, and he is perturbed by the unlawfulness of the
judgement, and in that case when God does not come to his mind readily. Instead of this though the Septuagint, and
Aquila and Theodotion interpret the phrase "destroys the heart" as "eutonias" "autou "that is 'his strength', or 'his vigour'. Symmachus says, "and "matthana" destroys his heart' (that is 'a
gift'), using the Hebrew word in his interpretation, and making the same
meaning as is written elsewhere: "gifts, too, blind the eyes of the
wise". [Deut. 16, 19.]
