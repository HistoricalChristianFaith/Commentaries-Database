quote='''
There cannot be two contradictory loves in one man. Just as there is no harmony between Christ and Belial, between justice and iniquity, so it is impossible for one soul to love both good and evil. You who love the Lord, hate evil, the devil; in every deed, there is love of one and hatred of the other. “He who has my commandments and keeps them, he it is who loves me.” … You who love the things that are good, hate the things that are bad. You cannot love good unless you hate evil.
