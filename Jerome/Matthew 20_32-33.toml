(Verse 32, 33.) And Jesus stood still, and called them, and said, What do you want me to do for you? They said to him, Lord, that our eyes may be opened. They were blind, not knowing where to go, and unable to follow the Savior. There were many pits in Jericho, many rocks and cliffs plunging into the deep: therefore the Lord stands, so that they can come and be called, lest the crowds hinder them: and he asks as if ignorant of what they want, so that from the blind men's answer their manifest weakness may be revealed, and the power may be known from the remedy.
