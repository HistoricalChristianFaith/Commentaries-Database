Here are two goats; one is the scape goat, that is, one loosed and sent out into the wilderness of hell with the sin of the people; the other is slain, as a lamb, for the sins of those who are forgiven. The Lord’s portion is always slain; the devil’s part,(for he is the master of those men, which is the meaning of Barabbas,) when freed, is cast headlong into hell.
