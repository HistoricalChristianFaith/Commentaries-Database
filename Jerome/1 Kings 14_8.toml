“The Lord is compassionate and merciful, long-suffering and plenteous in mercy.” “The Lord is sweet to all, and his tender mercies are over all his works.” You hear that his mercies are so great, and do you dare to put your trust in your own virtue? “Let all your works, O Lord, confess to you.” If people are also part of his works, then all people should confess their sins. We read it said in Samuel about Solomon: “He shall build a house to my name, and I shall establish the throne of his kingdom forever. I will be to him a father, and he shall be to me a son.” And again: “If he commits any iniquity, I will correct him with the rod of people, but my mercy I will not take away from him.” After giving thanks to God, David said in conclusion, “And this is the law of humankind.” Have recourse, O Lord, always to your mercy, and sustain the weakness of my flesh by your divine assistance. “What have I to do,” he says, “with you also, you sons of Sarvia? Let Shimei curse. The Lord had bid him curse David. And who shall say to him, why have you done so?” For the will of God is not to be discussed but kindly accepted. And in another place: “The Lord commanded that the profitable counsel of Ahitophel be defeated that he might bring evil on Absalom,” whose counsel was certainly the counsel of God. And for what reason was the power of the free will subverted by a greater power? Jeroboam, who caused Israel to sin, is reproved for having neglected the commandment of the Lord, and it is said to him, “I gave you the kingdom of the house of David, and you have not been as my servant David, who kept my commandments and followed me with all his heart, doing that which was well pleasing in my sight.” Therefore, the commandments of God are possible, which we know David had kept; and yet, we find holy people growing weary in maintaining justice forever.
