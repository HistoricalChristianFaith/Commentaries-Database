He who is the Way and the Life said that he had learned the ways to life; he had learned in what way people would follow him who said he is the Way and the Life.… The body he had received—and in his body, the entire human race—rejoiced that the divinity of the Son was made known to it. That is why he rejoices, he says, and has the fullness of joy with the Father … and his delight is full and perfect and his happiness ineffable because he sits at the right hand of the Father.… This is his delight, this his happiness to the end of the divine decree … because the Lord suffered and rose from the dead and entered heaven as victor in order to establish humanity at the right hand of the Lord.
