The kind and merciful Lord and Master does not begrudge his followers and disciples their powers. Even as he had healed every disease and every infirmity, he empowered his apostles to heal every disease and every infirmity. But there is a great gap between having and granting, between giving and receiving. Whatever he does, he does in the power of the Lord. Whatever they do, they display their own weakness and the power of the Lord, saying, “In the name of Jesus, arise and walk.” It must be noted, further, that the power to work miracles is granted to the apostles even to the twelfth man.

(Chapter 10, Verse 1) And having called his twelve disciples together, he gave them power over unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal all manner of sickness and all manner of disease. The kind and merciful Lord and Master does not withhold His powers from His servants and disciples. And just as he had healed all manner of sickness and all manner of disease, he also granted the apostles the power to heal all manner of sickness and all manner of disease among the people. But there is a great difference between having and giving, donating and receiving. Whatever he does, he does it by the power of the Lord: they, if they do anything, confess their weakness and the power of the Lord, saying: In the name of Jesus, rise up and walk (Acts 3:6). It should be noted that in the twelfth place, the power of signs is granted to the apostles.
