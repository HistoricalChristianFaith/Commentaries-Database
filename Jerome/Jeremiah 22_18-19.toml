(Verse 18, 19.) Therefore, thus says the Lord to Joachim, the son of Josiah, king of Judah: They shall not mourn for him, woe to the brother and woe to the sister, they shall not lament for him, woe to the Lord and woe to the illustrious one. He shall be buried like a donkey, decomposed and thrown outside the gates of Jerusalem. This, which we have put from Hebrew: they shall not mourn for him, woe to the brother and woe to the sister, is not found in the Septuagint. And it is specifically said against Joachim, king of Judah, and the riddle is opened, which before seemed hidden and ambiguous among the three brothers, so that it is not about Joachaz or Zedekiah, but specifically about Joachim, whom the Hebrew history narrates was killed by the bandits of the Chaldeans, Syrians, Ammonites, and Moabites. And in Malachi it is written that he died and was buried in silence (2 Kings 24). In the book of Chronicles we read that he was bound with chains and taken to Babylon (2 Chronicles 36): and nothing more is mentioned about him. It is said in a beautiful burial of an ass that he should be buried, which means in other words that he should be left unburied, that is, torn apart by beasts and birds. For this is the burial of an ass.
