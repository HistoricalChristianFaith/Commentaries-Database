“I will be mindful of Rahab and Babylon among those that know me.” Since the psalmist said, “Glorious things are said of you, O city of God,” and we understand this city to be the church gathered together from the nations, the psalm now speaks of the calling of the Gentiles: “I will be mindful of Rahab and Babylon among those that know me.” Let the sinner be at peace; the Lord was mindful of Rahab. I mean, at peace, if the sinner returns to the Lord; otherwise, there is no healing peace in a tearless security. “I will be mindful of Rahab,” of Rahab, that harlot who lodged Jesus’ secret agents, who lived in Jericho, where Joshua had come and had dispatched the two spies. Jericho, that collapsed in seven days, is a type of this world, and as such is determined to kill the secret agents. Because, therefore, Jericho is bent on killing the spies, Rahab, the harlot, alone received them, lodged them not on the ground floor but in the upper story of the roof—or, in other words, in the sublimity of her faith. She hid them under her stalks of flax.
