(Verse 26) Daughter of my people, gird yourself with sackcloth and sprinkle yourself with ashes, mourn for the only begotten (or beloved), make for yourself a bitter lament (or miserable), because the devastator (or misery) will come suddenly upon us (or upon you). For he had said before: Do not go out to the fields and do not walk along the road, for the sword of the enemy, panic is all around; and he had also forbidden flight, he teaches what they should do, namely, to repent, and to have this most firm and secure armor. When we say 'luctum unigeniti', it means 'mourning for the only child', which in Hebrew is written as 'Jaid', which sounds more lonely than 'unigenitum'. If it were 'dilectus' or 'amabilis', as the Septuagint translated it, it would have been written as 'Idid', which God also named Solomon. But there is nothing more painful than losing one's only son (II Reg. XII). Also, the phrase we interpreted as 'the devastator will come suddenly', or 'misery will come upon us', the Septuagint translated as 'upon you', but God has said with much more mercy that whatever is to come upon his people, he also testifies will come upon himself. Vastator properly signifies either Nabuchodonosor or the devil.
