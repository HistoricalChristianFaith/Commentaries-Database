A guarantee (arrab&#;n, “earnest”) is not the same as a token or pledge. For a guarantee is given as an affidavit and bond for a future purchase. But a pledge … is an expression of a present reciprocal transaction. Thus when the money is returned the pledge is restored by the creditor to the one who has repaid the debt…. So from the guarantee the majestic scope of the future inheritance may be grasped. .
