"What
profit is there for a man in exchange for all his toil, which he toils under
the sun?" After the general opinion that all things are
vain Solomon begins to explain with regard to mankind: because men exert
themselves in vain in the toil of the world, amassing wealth, teaching
children, working their way towards glory, constructing buildings, and then are
taken away in the midst of their work by sudden death, they hear the words:
"Thou fool, this night your soul shall be required of you, then whose will
be those things that you have amassed?"  [Luc. 12, 20.] Just as they make nothing for themselves in
exchange for all this toil, so they return naked to the earth from whence they
were taken.
