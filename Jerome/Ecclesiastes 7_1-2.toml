"A good name is better than precious
ointment; and the day of death than the day of one's birth. "Consider, he says, man, your short days since you will
cease to be quickly when your body gives out; fast longer, so that however
perfume delights your nostrils with its smell, in the same way posterity will
delight in all things to your name. 
Symmachus interpreted this very clearly, saying, "a good name is
better than a perfume that smells pleasant". We must remember that it is the custom of the
Hebrews to call good perfume 'oil'. He
also says, "and the day of death
than the day of one's birth", this shows that it is better to die, and
no longer be troubled, or be in an unsteady condition of life, than sustain all
these things while being born into the world. 
For in our death we know what we have been like, but when we are born we
cannot know what we will be like or do in life. 
Since birth is also linked to the freedom of the spirit in the body, it
abolishes moral customs.
