(Verse 33 and following) What is like Tyre, that has become silent (or has been silenced) in the middle of the sea? (Which is not found in the Septuagint.) Who, in the outcome of your dealings (or what reward you received) from the sea, enriched many peoples? In the abundance of your wealth, and with the multitude of your people, you made many kings wealthy. Now you are broken by the sea (or in the sea) in the depths of the waters, your wealth (or your trading) and all your multitude, which was in your midst, have fallen. All the inhabitants of the islands were astonished (or crushed) over you, and all their kings were struck (or turned mad) by the tempest, they changed their countenance (or wept). The merchants of the nations (or peoples) hissed at you, you were brought down to nothingness (or made into ruins), and you will no longer exist (Vulg. remains silent) forever (or for eternity). Captains, sailors, helmsmen, and passengers, in the mourning of Tyre, will remember these things, which so silenced other cities that they had no confidence to speak; and they heard that Gospel saying, Be silent, and be dumb (Mark 4:39). And concerning the Psalms: But to the sinner God said, Why do you declare my justices, and take my covenant in thy mouth? (Ps. XLVI, 16) How rich has Tyre become with so many goods! And why have you sought so much with such great labor, that you gather perishable things through days and nights of shipwreck? Indeed, you have filled many peoples and enriched kings with your wealth, of whom it is written: The kings of the earth stood, and the princes met together against the Lord and against his Christ (Psalm II, 2). But now you are crushed in the sea, and in the depths of the waters, just as it is written about Pharaoh: The chariots of Pharaoh and his army he has cast into the sea (Exodus XV, 4). He was submerged in the deep like a stone, and he could say: I have come into the deep of the sea, and the tempest has submerged me (Psalm XIV, 4). All the islands, or the inhabitants of the islands, that are battered by the waves of this world, will be astonished at you, and their kings, struck by the storm, will sense their own demise. They will imitate the voice of the snake, hissing and saying: You have been reduced to nothing, or you have been made into destruction; so that you have not had the nature of destruction, but the will. And you will not be. But if he had said this until now, a great question would arise, how it was not, which we now see as built. But from what follows, 'Forever', it shows the time of one age, which is reckoned to be around 70 years in the circle of a man's life. Whether you will not be to God, as the Apostle says: 'He calls things that are not as though they were' (Rom. 4:17). And the prophet Isaiah: 'Behold, they shall be confounded and ashamed, all your adversaries.' (Isaiah 41:11). For they will be as if they were not (Isa. XLI, 11): And Esther according to the Seventy Interpreters: Do not give your scepter to those who are not (Esther XIV, 11). And in the psalm: Let me be refreshed before I go away, and I shall be no more (Ps. XXXV, 14). We have already mentioned in what sense these testimonies should be understood. However, all these things can be referred to the person of heretics, who, in the contrition of Tyre and the shipwreck, feel their error and, placed in the midst of the sea, desire to free their souls and mourn the ill-gotten riches, with which they have enriched many kings, namely their patriarchs, and the common people, whose wealth will be destroyed in the midst of the sea. The inhabitants of all the islands (if, however, we want to interpret what has been said in a positive way) will also be astonished at the destruction of Tyre, and the kings of all the islands, being as it were struck by a storm, will change their faces, or at least show the grief of their hearts with weeping and tears, and they will testify to the magnitude of their astonishment with wonder and hissing, declaring how she has become nothing and perished, she who promised salvation to many nations. And furthermore, it will not be, at any certain time, that we interpret αἰῶνα as meaning 'age'; but forever, because the same word signifies both.
