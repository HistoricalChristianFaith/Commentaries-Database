(Verse 19.) The southern region stretches from Thamar to the waters of contradiction (or Mariboth: this word signifies contradiction or disputes). It includes Cades and the river, reaching all the way to the Great Sea. This is the southern region. According to the Book of Numbers, it is written as follows: It begins from the wilderness of Sin, near Edom, and its borders extend towards the eastern sea (some manuscripts add 'the saltiest sea'), encircling the southern region up along the ascent of Scorpio, passing through Senna and reaching south to Cadesbarne. From there, the borders extend to a village named Addar, and continue to Asemona. The boundary line then goes from Asemona to the torrent of Egypt, and ends at the shore of the Great Sea (Num. 34:3-5). This briefly signifies (so that we do not appear to have passed over the very wide stretch of Numbers by occasion of Ezekiel's exposition) to go around the wilderness of Sin, which is near Edom, and the boundary of the Red Sea, and through the ascent of Scorpions, and through Senna and Kadesh-barnea, and the courtyard of Addar, and to come from Asemona as far as the river of Egypt, which flows into the sea near the city of Rhinocorura. But truly, this boundary of the southern region, that is, the southernmost part, begins from Tamar, which is a city in the wilderness, which Solomon also built with marvelous works and is now called Palmyra; and in the Hebrew language, it is called Thamar, which in our language means "palm," as far as the waters of Meribah Kadesh, which is undoubtedly in the desert, and the river entering the Great Sea, which stretches along the coast of Egypt and Palestine, and this is the southern region to the South. Afterward, we receive the Southern region when the light from above is poured upon us, just as Abraham joined in a feast and we are intoxicated with the wine that gladdens the heart, like Joseph and his brothers. This possession begins at Thamar and extends to the waters of contradiction, a place of victory over vices. For virtue is always contradicted. Therefore, Jews opposing Paul in the preaching of the Gospel assert that it is contradicted throughout the whole world (Acts 15). And in the Gospel, we read Simeon saying: This child is destined for the falling and the rising of many in Israel, and to be a sign that will be contradicted (Luke 2:34). However, every contradiction is of holiness, which is interpreted as Kadesh, as the Psalmist says: The Lord will shake Kadesh's desert (Psalm 29:8); which originally did not have the holiness of the Lord, but it was shaken and moved to receive the guest God, who says: Upon whom will my spirit rest, if not upon the humble and quiet one who trembles at my words? (Isaiah 66:2). Beyond the deserted region of Cades, all the way to the great sea in the south, the southern region is arid, as we mentioned before; it does not have rain from the land, but rather from the sky, collected in various forms of different powers.
