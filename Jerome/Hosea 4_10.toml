Desire is insatiable, and the more it is felt, the more it creates in those who enjoy it a greater hunger. On the contrary: “Blessed are the ones who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be satisfied.” For righteousness satisfies, while wickedness—because it has no substance—deceives by fraud those who feed on vain things and leaves empty the stomachs of those who hunger. “They played the whore continually.” In fornication they run out of strength, yet the ardent desire of the fornication does not make a pause. The ten tribes played the whore with the idols of Jeroboam son of Naboth.
