But it is now time for us to raise the standard of Joshua’s chastity. It is written that Moses had a wife. … We read that Moses, that is, the law, had a wife; show me then in the same way that Joshua the son of Nun had either wife or children, and if you can do so, I will confess that I am beaten. He certainly received the fairest spot in the division of the land of Judah and died, not in the twenties, which are ever unlucky in Scripture—by them are reckoned the years of Jacob’s service, the price of Joseph, and sundry presents which Esau who was fond of them received4—but in the tens, whose praises we have often sung. And he was buried in Thamnath Sore, which means “most perfect sovereignty,” or “among those of a new covering,” to signify the crowds of virgins, covered by the Savior’s aid on Mount Ephraim, that is, the fruitful mountain; on the north of the Mountain of Gaash, which is interpreted “disturbance,” for “Mount Zion is on the sides of the north, the city of the Great King,” is ever exposed to hatred, and in every trial says “But my feet had nearly slipped.” The book which bears the name of Joshua ends with his burial. Again in the book of Judges we read of him as though he had risen and come to life again, and by way of summary his works are extolled. We read too: “So Joshua sent the people away, every man to his inheritance, that they might possess the land.” And “Israel served the Lord all the days of Joshua,” and so on. There immediately follows: “And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the Lord, died, being a hundred and ten years old.” Moses, moreover, only saw the land of promise; he could not enter, and “he died in the land of Moab, and the Lord buried him in the valley in the land of Moab over against Beth-peor: but no man knows of his sepulcher to this day.” Let us compare the burial of the two. Moses died in the land of Moab, Joshua in the land of Judea. The former was buried in a valley over against the house of Phogor, the translation of which is “reproach,” for the Hebrew Phogor corresponds to Priapus; the latter was buried in Mount Ephraim on the north of Mount Gaash. And in the simple expressions of the sacred Scriptures there is always a more subtle meaning. The Jews gloried in children and childbearing; and the barren woman, who had no offspring in Israel, was accursed; but blessed was he whose seed was in Zion, and his family in Jerusalem. And part of the highest blessing was, “Your wife shall be as a fruitful vine in the innermost parts of your house, your children like olive plants round about thy table.” Therefore his grave is described as placed in a valley over against the house of an idol which was in a special sense consecrated to lust. But we who fight under Joshua our leader, even to the present day, know not where Moses was buried. For we despise Phogor and all his shame, knowing that they who are in the flesh cannot please God. And the Lord before the flood had said, “My spirit shall not abide in man forever, because he is flesh.” For this reason, when Moses died, the people of Israel mourned for him, but Joshua, like one on his way to victory, was not mourned. For marriage ends at death; virginity thereafter begins to wear the crown.
