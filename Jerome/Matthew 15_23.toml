(Verse 23.) He did not answer him a word. Not out of Pharisaic pride, nor out of the scorn of the Scribes; but so that he would not seem to be contrary to his own command, by which he had instructed: Do not go into the way of the Gentiles, and do not enter into the cities of the Samaritans (Luke 10:5). For he did not wish to give occasion to the accusers and reserved the perfect salvation of the Gentiles for the time of his passion and resurrection.

And his disciples approached him, saying: Send her away because she cries out after us. At that time, the disciples still ignorant of the mysteries of the Lord, either moved by mercy, or desiring to be free from her persistence, were asking for the Canaanite woman, whom another Evangelist calls the Syrophoenician woman (Mark 7), or wanting to avoid her importunity; because she shouted more frequently not for the purpose of calling a compassionate person, but to call for a harsh physician.
