(Verse 6) And in the midst of it is the likeness of four living creatures, and this is their appearance: the likeness of a man is among them. In the midst of it, it is understood, is indeed electricity: but it is better to understand it as fire, which is light for believers and punishment for unbelievers. Therefore, in the midst of this fire, there was the likeness of four living creatures, a likeness, not a nature; and the four living creatures that are later called quadriform, are one likeness of a man, so that all things in the world may be shown to be rational: 'Let us make man in our image and likeness' (Genesis 1). But the image and likeness of God is not the form of the body, but of the mind: described according to the true image of Christ, who is the image of the invisible God. These rational creatures exist in four places, either because of the four cardinal points of the world, by which the globe is enclosed, or because of the four places: celestial, terrestrial, infernal, and supercelestial, of which the apostle Paul also speaks: That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of those that are in heaven, on earth, and under the earth (Philippians 2, 10). Of the three, there is Paul's testimony. Let us see the fourth. Praise the Lord, ye heavens of heavens, and the water that is above the heavens, let the name of the Lord be praised (Psalm CXLVIII, 5). And again, by the Apostle, other heavenly things are said, and other things above heavenly (I Corinthians XV).
