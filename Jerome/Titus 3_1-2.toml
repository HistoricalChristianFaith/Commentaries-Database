Remind them to be subject to the rulers and authorities, to obey; to be prepared for every good work; not to blaspheme anyone, not to be quarrelsome; to be modest, showing all meekness to all people. Such a thing is also written to the Romans: Let every soul be subject to the higher powers. For there is no power but from God (Romans 13:1). And I think this precept was given here and there for this reason, because the doctrine of the Galilean Jews still prevailed at that time and had many followers, and it is mentioned in the Acts of the Apostles in reference to it: for before these days rose up Theodas, saying that he was somebody; to whom a number of men, about four hundred, joined themselves (Acts 5:36); and after him rose up Judas of Galilee in the days of the census, and drew away many people after him: he also perished; and all, even as many as obeyed him, were dispersed (Acts 5:37). The heresy had grown so much that it troubled even the Pharisees and a large part of the people: so that this question was referred also to our Lord: Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or not (Mat. 22:17)? To which the Lord answered wisely and cautiously, saying: Render therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesar's; and to God, the things that are God's (Ibid., 21). To which response the Apostle Paul rightly teaches that believers should be subject to principalities and powers. For the beginnings which are read in Greek sound more like principalities than princes: and they indicate power itself, not the men who are in power. But since he had said, Admonish them to be subject to principalities and powers: the opportunity could be given to those who fear torment to deny it: according to the Apostle's saying, they would assert that they were subject to principalities and powers, and do what they commanded; therefore he added: To be obedient to every good work. If it is good, obey the will of the emperor and governor who orders. But if it is evil, and against God: answer him with that from the Acts of the Apostles: We ought to obey God rather than men. (Acts 5:29). Let us understand this also about servants with their masters, and wives with their husbands, and children with their parents, that they should only be subject to masters, husbands, and parents for those things which do not go against God's commands. But what follows, "to be ready", is to be read in two ways, either as if it were implied, to be ready for every good work; or certainly, with the previous statement, obeying for every good work, and with that finished, as though another proper and specific commandment were given, "to be ready," according to what is written in Leviticus: "And the goat that beareth the curse of the people shall be brought before the Lord, ready to be offered." (Lev. 16:21) Therefore, if someone is prepared to take up an escort of dismissal and lead him ((Al.lead him away)) into the desert and scatter him there, and to the extent that he can, eliminate him by the act of a curse, on obeying he will also be ready for every good work. It can also be accepted in another way to be prepared: they should envision everything that could happen to them in their minds, and when they do happen, they should not endure them as if they are new, but instead everything must be prepared for them. Moreover, to blaspheme no one is not simply taken. For he does not say to blaspheme no man: but absolutely no one: not an angel, nor any creature of God. Because everything that was made by God is very good. For when Michael the Archangel disputed with the devil over the body of Moses, he did not dare to bring a judgment of blasphemy, but said, "May God rebuke you‚Äù (Jud. 9). If Michael therefore did not have the audacity to bring judgement upon the devil, certainly deserving of a curse, for blasphemy: how much more should we be pure from every curse? The devil deserved a curse: but it should not have come out through the mouth of an archangel. Read the old books, and see what was in the minds of the three appointed on Mount Gerizim to bless the people, and what was in the minds of those on the other mountain to curse them. Reuben, who had defiled his parent's bed, and Zebulun, Leah's youngest son, and the children of the handmaidens, are placed on Mount Ebal ((alias Eliel)), to curse those who are worthy of a curse (Deut. 27). It would take too long to enumerate now how Jacob, who had called his sons for a blessing (Gen. 49:1), saying: "I will bless you," afterwards associates them in a curse, "Their fury is cursed, because it is fierce". And even the Lord speaks in Genesis: "Cursed be the earth in thy work" (Gen. 3:17). It is enough to have said this now, that it is not necessary to blaspheme the disciples of Christ, nor is it necessary to be contentious. For if we are the children of peace, and we wish to rest in peace, and we have approached the heavenly Jerusalem, which has received its name from peace, with those who hate peace, let us have peace: and as much as is within us, let us be at peace with all men: not only with the humble, but also with the quarrelsome; because there is no power in bearing the meek: and we permit the place of anger, displaying all meekness towards all men: not because we ought to show ourselves to be meek towards all men, by the desire of vainglory: but while we bear with all things, and do not repay injuries, these very works may become better known to all. For someone can simulate meekness and feign kindness for the sake of boasting, and for the sake of public favor before certain people. But where there is not true and genuine and solid meekness, I do not know whether he can persuade everyone that he is meek.
