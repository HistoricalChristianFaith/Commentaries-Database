When all things were made by the Father, he [the Son] was there with him, in whom the Son rejoiced when he said, I am he who always was with the Father and in the Father and never was without the Father, and who now speaks, and due to the weakness of the flesh I assumed, I say that “the Lord has sent me and his Spirit.” In this short verse we are shown the mystery of the Trinity.
