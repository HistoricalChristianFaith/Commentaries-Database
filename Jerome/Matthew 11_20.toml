(Verse 20.) Then he began to reproach the cities in which most of his miracles had been performed, because they did not repent. The reproach of the cities of Chorazin, Bethsaida, and Capernaum is explained by the heading of this chapter. He reproached them because after performing many miracles and signs, they did not repent.
