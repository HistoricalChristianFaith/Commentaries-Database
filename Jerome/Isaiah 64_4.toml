The apostle Paul inserts a paraphrase of this passage, like a Hebrew from the Hebrews, in the original text of the letters that he wrote to the Corinthians, not rendering it word for word, which he altogether despised doing, but expressing the truth of its meaning, a practice that he used for purposes of emphasis. Hence, the nonsense of the apocryphal texts, which are conveyed to the churches of Christ on the occasion of this passage, fall silent. It can truly be said of these texts that the devil would sit in ambush with the riches of the apocrypha to kill the innocent or that he would “wait in the ‘apocrypha’ like a lion in its lair to seize the poor.” For the Ascension of Isaiah17 and the Apocalypse of Elijah contain this very passage.
