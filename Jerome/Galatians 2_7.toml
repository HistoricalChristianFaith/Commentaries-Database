This intricate passage, full of intervening matter, might be briefly construed as follows: “Those who were conspicuous added nothing to me, but on the contrary gave the right hand of fellowship to me and Barnabas.” An alternative sense is hidden to avoid boasting of himself: “Those who were conspicuous added nothing to me, but on the contrary I have added to them, and they have become more steadfast in the grace of the gospel.”
