"Do
not be too righteous, do not make yourself too wise: why destroy yourself? "If you should see a man who is harsh
and wild to the extent of sinning against his brothers, so that he pardons
neither the sinner in his speaking, or he who is slow on account of natural
slowness, know that this man is more righteous than is good. For when the Saviour teaches, saying "Do
not judge, so that you are not judged" [Luc. 6, 37.],
and let none be without sin, even if it was not his life at any given day, the
judgement of God is not ignorant of the weak state of man. Therefore do not be too righteous, since
accursed conduct in the presence of God carries both a great and a minor
burden. Philosophers have placed virtues
therefore in the middle, and everything which is either too much either above
or below, is thought to be at fault. [Cfr. Apuleius. Plat. 2, 5.] But he also says, "and do not ask too
much, lest you become confused", or "lest you be amazed". For he knows that our mind cannot understand
complete wisdom, (or that which is to be measured), and he says that we ought
to know the wisdom which must be measured in our mortality. Then even Paul asked of him that was able to
know more than man, saying, "why does he yet complain? For who has
resisted his will?" [Rom. 9, 19.] He replies, "O man, who are you that
reply to God?" [Ibid. 9, 20.],
and so on. If he had heard the causes of
the complaint from the apostle, he who is introduced while he is questioning,
by chance he would have been stupefied by numbness and would have felt useful
gratitude. Since it is a gift according to
that same apostle, which is of no use to him that receives it. The command "do not be too
righteous" [Cfr I Reg. 15.]
is interpreted by the Hebrew as being about Saul, who felt pity for Agag, whom
the Lord had commanded to be killed. But
even that servant from the Gospel whom the Lord had pardoned [Cfr. Matth. 18. 23-34.],
the Lord himself didn't want to pardon the servant, yet he can be used in this
verse because he was too righteous.
