We have been speaking in a general way; let us now speak in particular about the interior of a person. A wheel, as you know, rests upon the ground with a very slight base. Nor does it merely rest; it rolls along; it does not stand still but barely touches the ground and passes on. Further, when it rolls onward, it always mounts higher. So the saintly person, because he has a human body, has to give some thought to earthly matters. When it comes to food and clothing and other such matters, he is content with what he has, and merely touching the ground with them, hastens to other things. He who runs in haste to higher things carries within himself your word. We read in the prophet, “Holy stones roll over the land.” Notice what he said: “Holy stones roll over the land.” Because they are wheels, they speed over the land and on to higher places. Do you want to hear about more wheels? We read, “And one wheel within another”;16 and again in Ezekiel, “The wheels move one within the other.” The two wheels are the New and Old Testament; the old moves within the new and the new within the old. And Ezekiel goes on, “Wherever the spirit wished to go, there the wheels went.” Ecclesiastes, moreover, says of the end of the world: “And the broken wheel falls into the well.” Much more could be said about wheels, but our sermon speeds on to the rest of the psalm.
