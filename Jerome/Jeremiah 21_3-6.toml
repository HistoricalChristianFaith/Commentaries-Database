(Vers. 3 seqq.) And Jeremiah said to them: Thus shall you say to Zedekiah: Thus saith the Lord God of Israel: Behold, I will turn back the weapons of war (or the weapons of warfare) which are in your hands, wherewith you fight against the king of Babylon, and the Chaldeans that besiege you round about the walls: and I will gather them (or it) together in the midst of this city, and I will fight against you with stretched-out hand, and with a strong arm (or an exalted one), and in fury, and in wrath, and in great indignation. And I will strike the inhabitants of this city: both men and animals will die from a great pestilence. In vain, he says, do you want to resist the Chaldeans who are besieging you, and prepare your weapons of war, of which you will only have use in the middle of the city, so that you seem to be armed. However, against those besieging you, I will conquer you with an outstretched hand and a strong arm, and I will strike you with my fury and indignation: so that both you and everything that breathes may die in the middle of the city from hunger and pestilence. Indeed, we have read that this indeed happened. Without any crown and without any noise of the combatants, such a great city was captured by siege, that they did not have those whom they had conquered, but only those whom they had captured. Better, he says, were those wounded by the sword than those killed by hunger.
