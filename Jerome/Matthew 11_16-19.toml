They say therefore, We have flayed music to you, and ye have not danced; i. e. We have called on you to work good works to our songs, and ye would not. We have lamented and called you to repentance, and this ye would not, rejecting both preaching, as well of exhortation to virtue, as of repentance for sin.

The children are they of whom Isaiah speaks, Behold I, and the children whom the Lord has given me. (Is. 8:18) These children then sit in the market-place, where are many things for sale, and say,

If fasting then pleases you, why were you not satisfied with John? If fulness, why not with the Son of man? Yet one of these ye said had a dæmon, the other ye called a gluttonous man, and drunkard.

Wisdom is justified of her children, i. e. The dispensation or doctrine of God, or Christ Himself who is the power and wisdom of God, is proved by the Apostles, who are His children, to have done righteously.

Some copies read, Wisdom is justified of her works, for wisdom does not seek the witness of words, but of works.

(Verse 16 onwards) But to whom shall I compare this generation? It is like children sitting in the marketplace and calling to their playmates, 'We played the flute for you, and you did not dance; we sang a dirge, and you did not mourn.' For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, 'He has a demon.' The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say, 'Look, a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners.' And wisdom is justified by her children. To the boys sitting in the marketplace and shouting and saying to their companions: We sang to you, and you did not dance; we mourned, and you did not weep. The generation of the Jews is compared, the Scripture saying: To what shall I compare this generation? It is like the boys sitting in the marketplace, and so on. Therefore, not to us is attributed free intelligence, and the passive interpretation of allegories: but whatever we are going to say about the boys, it must be referred to the likeness of the generation. You are the children who sit in the forum, of whom Isaiah speaks: Behold, I and the children whom God has given me (Isa. VIII, 18). And in the 18th psalm (Verse 8): The testimony of the Lord is faithful, providing wisdom to the little ones. And elsewhere: Out of the mouths of infants and nursing babies you have prepared praise (Ps. VIII, 3). Therefore, these children sat in the forum, or ἐν ἀγορᾷ as it is more significantly expressed in Greek, where many things are for sale. And because the people of the Jews did not want to listen, they not only spoke to them, but shouted with full mouths: We have sung to you, and you did not dance; we have provoked you to do good works to our song, and to dance to our pipe, just as David danced before the ark of the Lord (2 Samuel 6), and you did not want to. We have lamented, and we have provoked you to repentance, and you did not want to do this either, rejecting both preaching, both exhortation to virtues and penance after sins. It is not surprising if you have despised the double way of salvation, both the fasting of God and also abundance. If fasting pleases you, why was John displeasing? If feasting, why was the Son of Man displeased? One of them you call possessed by a demon, the other a glutton and a drunkard. But because you did not want to accept both disciplines, wisdom has been justified by her children: that is, by the dispensation and teaching of God. And I, who am the power and wisdom of God (1 Corinthians 1), have been proved right by my apostles and sons, to whom the Father has revealed what he had hidden from the wise and prudent among themselves (John 17). In certain Gospels it is read: Wisdom is justified by her works (Luke 7:35). For wisdom does not seek testimony from words, but from actions.
