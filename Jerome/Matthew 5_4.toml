For the mourning here meant is not for the dead by common course of nature, but for the dead in sins, and vices. Thus Samuel mourned for Saul, thus the Apostle Paul mourned for those who had not performed penance after uncleanness.

The mourning discussed here does not concern the common natural law of the dead but rather their sins and vices. Thus Samuel grieved over Saul, and the Lord repented that he had made Saul king over Israel. Also Paul the apostle says that he wept and mourned over those who, after committing fornication and impure deeds, did not feel the need of repentance.

(Ver. 4.) Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth. Not the land of Judah ((Al. Judea)), nor the land of this world; not the cursed land, bringing forth thorns and thistles (Gen. V), which the most cruel and warlike possess; but the land that the Psalmist desires, saying: I believe to see the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living (Ps. XXVI, 13). Such a possessor, and after victory a triumphator, is also described in the forty-fourth psalm: Attend, proceed and reign prosperously (Al. and prosperously): for truth, meekness, and justice. No one possesses this land by meekness, but by pride.
