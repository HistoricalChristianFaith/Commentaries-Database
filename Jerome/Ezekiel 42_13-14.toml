(Verse 13, 14.) And he said to me: The treasuries of the North and the treasuries of the South, which are before the separated building, these are the holy treasuries in which the priests who approach the Lord in the Most Holy Place eat. There they shall put the Most Holy Place, and the offering for sin and for guilt. For it is a holy place. But when the priests enter, they shall not go out from the holy place to the outer court, and there they shall put on their garments in which they minister, for they are holy. And they shall put on other garments and then go out to the people. That man, who was a leader and prophet, after he led him into the outer courtyard and showed him all that the previous conversation had mentioned, also the treasuries and the rooms in which he stayed for a long time, said to him: These are the treasuries, or rooms, and chambers to the north and south, which are in front of the separate building, and are called the holy treasuries, in which the priests who approach the Lord in the holy of holies partake. From these things we learn that there are many diversities in foods, which are allowed or not allowed for priests to eat, and of those very things that are allowed to be taken as food, they are not taken in all places, nor by all people, nor at all times. I think that the Gazophylacia Aquilonis Austri is, either those things that contain the simplicity of history, or the sacraments of spiritual understanding, so that through Aquilon we may come to the South. For the letter should not be read in such a way, and the foundations of history should be laid, so that we may not come to the heights; and the roof of the most beautiful building should not be placed in such a way that the foundations are not solid. But the priests who live in the cellars, in which many riches are contained, are the ones who approach the Lord: Scripture testifies of them (Exodus 24) that Moses approached the Lord, and the others could not come near. In the building of the mystical temple, and in the sacrament of the Church, there are many priests and apostolic men who approach the Lord, and not in any place, but in the holy of holies. And as it is said in the Septuagint: Sons of Zadok, which means just, is not found in Hebrew. There, he says, the priests shall place the holy of holies, and the offering, that is, the burnt offering, and for sin, and for ignorance: so that they may not only offer a perpetual sacrifice, but also, due to the diversity of times and the quality of sin and ignorance, know how to appease the Lord, because the place itself is holy and the priestly dignity dwells in it, which can intercede for others. But when it is necessary to proceed to those who cannot penetrate the inner depths of the temple, nor understand the secrets of divine knowledge, let the priests go outside to them into the outer courtyard. Absolutely not clothed in the garments with which they were clothed internally, namely the viscera of mercy and the Lord Savior, of whom it is written: Put on the Lord Jesus Christ (Rom. XIII, 14); nor should they use these words, about which God speaks: My mystery is for me and for my own; lest they fall into that which the Savior prohibits, saying: Do not give holy things to dogs, nor cast pearls before swine (Matth. VII, 6). But they shall lay aside their garments, with which they are clothed, when they minister in the inner part of the temple; for they are holy, and should not be brought out to those who do not have perfect holiness: and they shall put on other garments, and thus they shall come to the people. Thus, he says, they shall speak to the people, in a way that the people can hear. And so the Apostle spoke to the Corinthians, among whom fornication was heard, and such fornication as is not even among the Gentiles: I have given you milk to drink, not solid food: for you were not yet able to receive it. To them again he says: My little children, for whom I am again in travail until Christ be formed in you (Gal. IV, 19). For to little ones and babes solid food is not only useless, but kills those who are suited to perfect age. Moreover, that which is added in the Septuagint: Therefore the priests shall not go out of the outer court, that those who offer may always be holy, let us remark, is not found in Hebrew.
