(Chapter 28, Verse 1) Woe to the pride of Ephraim's crown, to the fading flower of its glorious splendor, which is at the head of the fertile valley of those who are overcome with wine. See, the Lord has one who is powerful and strong. Like a hailstorm and a destructive wind, like a driving rain and a flooding downpour, he will throw it forcefully to the ground. The proud crown of Ephraim's drunkards will be trampled underfoot. The fading flower of its glorious splendor, which is at the head of the fertile valley, will be like a fig before the fruit harvest, as soon as someone sees it and takes it in hand, they swallow it. LXX: Alas for the crown of the pride of Ephraim's hired mercenaries, the flower that falls from the glory atop the fat mountain, those who are drunk but not with wine. Behold, the strong and fierce anger of the Lord, like hail that falls forcefully, without shelter, which violently falls like a multitude of waters drawing the ground, and making space for itself: the crown of the pride of Ephraim's hired mercenaries will be trampled by hands and feet. And there will be a flower that falls from the hope of glory on the summit of the high mountain, like an early fig, which anyone who sees it before it is ripe will desire to devour it. Let us first speak according to history, then according to allegory, and finally according to prophetical vision. The divine discourse speaks against the ten tribes that were reigning in Samaria, and because of Jeroboam, who was from the tribe of Ephraim, they were called Ephraim. And he calls them the crown of pride: because compared to the two tribes, which were called Judah, they were higher in number and strength. And he says that Ephraim has made them drunk, who do not understand their Creator, but worship golden calves as their Lord in Dan and Bethel. These were once in their prime, lords and in glory, when they were ruled by David and Solomon, and they were worshiping God in the temple of Jerusalem in the twelve tribes, which were in the summit of the fattest valley, which in Hebrew is called Ge Semanim (). It signifies the place where the Lord was delivered; on top of which valley the temple of the Lord was situated. These were intoxicated by the wine of error and madness, which Jeroboam mixed for them. Therefore, the Lord threatens punishment against them, because just as a hailstorm shatters everything in its path, and the force of overwhelming waters sweeps away anything in its way, so may the Assyrian army be destroyed, and whatever remains may be transported to the mountains or cities of Media. He compares the glory of the ten tribes to a crown of various flowers, which had such beauty that just as someone, before the arrival of summer and autumn, sees a precursor fig on a tree and immediately eats it as soon as they hold it in their hand, so may the Assyrians see the ten tribes, destroy and devour them, leaving nothing of the former people in Samaria. Let this be briefly said according to history. Let's move on to the allegory. According to the exposition of the prophet Hosea, in which Ephraim and Joseph and Samaria and the ten tribes, which were separated from the body of the twelve tribes, and the temple of the Lord, we refer to the heretics, who are truly, according to the Septuagint edition, a crown of injustice, blaspheming the Lord, and doing everything for the sake of profit, and falling from the glory of the Lord: they do not follow the meagerness of manna, and the ecclesiastical humility; but they wallow on a fattened mountain, drunk without wine. Therefore, the strong and fierce wrath of the Lord, who is going to punish them, is compared to a swift hailstorm that falls not on roofs, but on the heads of mortals, and to the flooding of many waters, which drags whatever it finds in its path. This is the crown of injustice, they are called mercenaries Ephraim, who, according to the Apostle, have fallen from the flower and hope and glory of their former faith, and are involved in pride, and they are the sweetest food of the devil, who devours them daily (1 Peter 5). According to the prophecy, we can say that the crown of injustice called the Scribes and Pharisees, who blasphemed the Lord. And they were called the hirelings of Ephraim, because of Judas, who from the tribe of Ephraim and from the village of the same tribe, Iscariot, sold the Lord for a price, who truly fell as the flower of apostolic glory upon the most fertile mountain, of which we believe it is said: Jacob ate and drank, and he was satisfied and fattened, and the beloved rebelled (Deut. XXXII, 15). Or according to the Hebrew: above the valley of fatness, that is, Gethsemane: in which also the name of the place is signified, where Judas betrayed the Lord. But the valley of fatness, or of the fat ones, is said because of its fertility, and the Scribes and Pharisees who apprehended the Lord there: of whom it is written in the psalm: Fat bulls have besieged me (Ps. 21:13). This valley of fatness, that is, Gethsemane, is called in this second chapter; and I wonder how the LXX first called it a fat mountain, and later an exalted mountain. But the traitor was drunk not with wine, but with greed and the incurable madness of asps, and the food of the devil, which entered into him after the morsel (John 13), and he was entirely consumed, for his prayer was turned into sin, and even his repentance did not have the fruit of salvation. The Hebrew word Sacchore is ambiguous, and it can mean either drunkards or mercenaries. Hence, Issachar is also interpreted as being wages: and Sachar, μέθυσμα, that is, drunkenness: and the others are drunkards: only the Septuagint translated it as mercenaries.
