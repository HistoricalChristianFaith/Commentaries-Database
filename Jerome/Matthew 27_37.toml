(Verse 37.) And they placed over his head the charge against him, written, 'This is Jesus, the King of the Jews.' I cannot sufficiently admire the magnitude of the matter, that, for the sake of the redeemed, with a false accusation and having incited the unfortunate people to sedition and outcry, they found no other cause for his execution except that he was the King of the Jews. And perhaps they did this in mockery and ridicule. However, Pilate also responded unwillingly, 'What I have written, I have written.' Whether you want it or not, Jews, a crowd of all nations responds to you: Jesus is the king of the Jews, that is, the emperor of believers and confessors.
