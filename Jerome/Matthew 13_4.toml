(Version 4.) Behold, he who sows went out to sow. And while he was sowing, he was inside, at home, speaking to the disciples the mysteries. Therefore, he who sows the word of God went out from his house, in order to sow in the crowds. But this sower who sows is signified to be the Son of God, and to sow the word of the Father among the people. And at the same time, observe that this is the first parable, which is placed with its interpretation. And beware that wherever the Lord explains his words and is asked by the disciples to explain inwardly, we should not want to understand anything else, or anything more, or anything less, than what was explained by him.
