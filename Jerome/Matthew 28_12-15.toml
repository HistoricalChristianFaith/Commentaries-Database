(Vers. 12 seqq.) And when they were gathered with the elders, after taking counsel, they gave a large sum of money to the soldiers, saying: Tell them that his disciples came by night and stole him away while we were asleep. And if this comes to the governor's ears, we will satisfy him and keep you out of trouble. So they took the money and did as they were instructed. And the story spread among the Jews to this day. The guards confessed the miracle: they returned to the city and reported to the chief priests all that they had seen and experienced. Those who were supposed to convert to repentance and seek the risen Jesus persist in wickedness, and they turn the money that was given for the use of the temple into the redemption of lies, just as they had previously given thirty pieces of silver to Judas the betrayer. Therefore, all those who misuse the temple offerings and those things that are given for the use of the church for other purposes, in order to fulfill their own desires, are similar to the scribes and priests who bought the lie and the Savior's blood.
