"Sweet
is the sleep of the labourer, whether he eats little or much; the satiety of
the rich does not let him sleep." So far the discourse has treated of riches
and greed, and it is compared to a man who works and one who sleeps without
worry, or eats little or a great deal. 
Because he eats any food obtained from the toil of work and from his
sweat, he enjoys peaceful sleep. For a
rich man indeed is busy with banquets and lacerated by many thoughts, is not
able to sleep, and abounds in hangovers and uncooked food boils in the
intestines of his stomach. More
precisely, since it is called sleep, and is a common exit from life, that rest
will be better for him, who is busy at present and reserves his strength for
good work, than the riches of those men, about whom it is written: "woe to
you, O rich, for you have received your consolation". [Luc. 6, 24.]
