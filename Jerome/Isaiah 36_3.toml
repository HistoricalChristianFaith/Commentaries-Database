Eliakim, the son of Hilkiah, who was leader of the house, went out to him, as well as Shebna the scribe and Joah the son of Asaph from the commentaries. This is the same Elakim, son of Hilkiah, about whom we read above in the vision of the valley of Zion: “I will call my servant Eliakim, son of Hilkiah, and I will clothe him in your tunic, and I will strengthen him with your girdle, and I will give your power into his hand, and he will be like a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem and to the house of Judah.”

But these things were said to Shebna, who was leader of the temple before Eliakim, about whom it is written, “Go, approach him who lives in the tabernacle, Shebna the leader of the temple.” Acting under the threat of the Rabshakeh, the Hebrews betrayed him to the Assyrians and handed over the lower part of Jerusalem to the enemies, and nothing remained of what the Assyrians had left behind except for the temple and the ark of Zion. Hence they err who think that the Shebna who now goes out with Eliakim and Joah to the Rabshakeh is the same as the one above. For that Shebna was made leader of the temple which, it is said, was to be taken by the Assyrians. But this Shebna is a scribe, that is, a grammateis [Greek], which is called sofēr in Hebrew, and is homōnymos [Greek] to the one above.
