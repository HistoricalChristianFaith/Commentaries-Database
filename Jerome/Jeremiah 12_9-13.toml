The house of God has been made a den of thieves! This is the house of which Jeremiah says, “Has not my house become for me the den of a hyena?” Here we have “you have made it a den of thieves,” in Jeremiah, “the den of a hyena.” We have to know the nature of this animal. Then from that, we shall be able to learn why the prophet called God’s house a hyena’s den. The hyena is never seen in the daytime but always at night. Never is it seen in the light but always in the darkness.

I beg you, therefore, and admonish you again and again: do not look to your military experience for a standard of clerical obligation. Under Christ’s banner, do not seek worldly gain, lest having more than when you first became a clergyman, you hear people say, to your shame, “Their portion shall not profit them.” Welcome poor people and strangers to your homely table, that with them Christ may be your guest.
