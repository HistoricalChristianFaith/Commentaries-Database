(Verse 9 and following). In that day there will be one Lord, and his name will be one: and all the land will return to the desert from the hill of Remmon to the South of Jerusalem: and it will be exalted, and it will be inhabited in its place, from the Benjamin gate to the place of the former gate, to the corner gate: and from the Tower of Ananeel to the king's winepresses, and they will dwell in it, and there will no longer be a curse, but Jerusalem will sit securely.  LXX: In that day there will be one Lord, and his name will be one: encircling all the land, and the desert from Gabaa to Remmon to the South of Jerusalem: But Rama will remain in place, from the Benjamin gate to the first gate, to the corner gate, and to the tower of Anamael, to the king's winepresses they will dwell in it, and there will no longer be a curse, and Jerusalem will dwell confidently. The destruction of the city of Jerusalem, and the flowing forth of the waters from its midst, which flow to both seas, the Jews and the Judaizing Christians promise to themselves in the last times, when circumcision will again be practiced, and victims will be sacrificed, and all the precepts of the Law will be observed, so that Christians become not Jews, but Jews become Christians. On that day, they say, when Christ will sit in Jerusalem, golden and adorned, reigning, there will be no idols nor diverse worship of divinity, but there will be one Lord, and all the earth will return to solitude, that is, to its ancient state. And he sets forth the names of the places from which place to which place Jerusalem is to be built: from the hill Remmon (for this is what Gabaa means, where the Maligranati tree is) to the southern region of Jerusalem. And what follows: However, Rama will remain in its place, which Aquila and others have better interpreted to mean, it will be exalted. For Rama means exaltation, according to that prophetic and gospel saying: A voice was heard in Rama, that is, it sounded on high (Matthew 2:18). Therefore, Jerusalem will be exalted and rebuilt in its original place, from the Gate of Benjamin to the Gate called the Corner Gate, and from the Tower of Ananeel (not as the Greeks and Latins wrongly read it as Anamael) to the Winepresses of the King, which in Hebrew is written Ammelech (or, according to some, Amalech). And it is said that they will dwell in it, that is, in Jerusalem, and there will no longer be any curse: no hostile attack, no fear; but Jerusalem will sit or be inhabited in eternal peace and rest. The Jews dream literally and our chiliasts, who desire to hear again: Increase and multiply, and fill the earth (Gen. 1:28), and for the sake of continence of this life and brief fasting, they promise themselves onions, and vulvas, and the birds of Phasis, and the attagen, not the Ionic, but the Jewish ones, concerning which the Lord can truly say: My spirit shall not remain in these men, because they are flesh (Gen. 6:3). For the flesh lusts against the spirit, and the spirit against the flesh (Galatians. V, 17). And let not the book of Revelation (Chapter XX) be opposed to us, for it must also be interpreted spiritually. But we shall interpret the heavenly Jerusalem as the Church, which, though walking in the flesh, does not live according to the flesh, whose citizenship is in heaven (Philippians. III). For when the Lord Jesus shall reign over all the earth, of whom the Holy Spirit speaks to the Father through the Prophet: O God, give Your judgment to the king, and Your justice to the king's son (Psalm. LXXI, 1): then there will be one Lord, of whom it is written: Know that the Lord Himself is God (Deuteronomy. IV, 35): And His name will be one, with all false religion trampled underfoot, according to what the Prophet sings: O Lord, our Lord, how admirable is your name in all the earth (Psalm. VIII, 1)! And again: You have magnified your holy name above all (Psalm 137:3). And elsewhere: As is your name, O God, so is your praise unto the ends of the earth (Psalm 48:11); of which Habakkuk also speaks: The earth is full of his praise (Habakkuk 3:5). Of the glory of his name, God himself speaks: Apart from me, you will not know God, and besides my name, which is magnified above all (Isaiah 44:8). Then all the earth will return, in which the Jews dwelt up to the desert, that is, up to the people of the Gentiles, which was formerly deserted and did not have knowledge of the Law: from Geba to Rimmon, that is, from the hill to the high place, for we ascend from the earth and the desert to the hills, and from the hills to the mountains. And the bridegroom in the Song of Songs passes over the smaller hills and leaps upon the tall mountains (Song 1), of which it is written: He makes the mountains skip like deer (Psalm 104). But if we wish to understand the Remmon, which both words signify in Hebrew, let us say that the limits of the Church begin from the hills, so that the whole ecclesiastical order be constructed, as we have said above, when we interpreted the lament of the only-begotten, and the lament like Adadremmon. And the Church is not content with this end; but it will reach as far as the South in the fullest light, as we have previously explained. And now we remain silent about it, so as not to annoy the reader by repeating the same things often. And the Church which began from the hills will be exalted and will reach the South; and it will dwell in its place, as it is written: 'He has set me in a place of pasture' (Psalm 22:1). From the gate of Benjamin, which is interpreted as the Son of the right hand, and not the Son of days, as some suspect wrongly: for it is one thing if it ends with the letter Nun, another if it ends with the letter Mem. And it shall come to the place of the eastern and former gate, even to the gate of the corners. We begin with virtue, for this indeed signifies the right hand, and we arrive at the former gate, so that we may enter through it to the others. And immediately we encounter the gate of the corners, where the corner stone is, which the builders rejected and has become the head of the corner (Ps. CXVII, 22). This corner stone connects both walls and brings two peoples into one (Ephes. II), about which God speaks through Isaiah: Behold, I will place in Zion a corner stone, chosen and precious in its foundation; and whoever believes in him will not be put to shame (Isai. XXVIII, 16). Here the cornerstone and other cornerstones wanted to be built, so that the apostle Paul might freely say: Built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief cornerstone (Ephesians 2:20). These stones do not imitate the heretics, who do everything for the sake of glory and profit, and pray in the corners of the streets, leaving the straight path. For every corner breaks the straight line, and therefore the prostitute in Proverbs (Chapter 7), however we may understand her, whose feet do not rest at home, but wanders outside or lies in wait in all the corners of the streets, when she sees a foolish young man (for she does not invite one whom she perceives to be wise and mature in age, of whom it is written: The wisdom of an old man is his gray hair), she immediately seizes him, and kisses and flatters him, and leads him to the brothel, and invites him to have intercourse. Let us therefore leave behind false angles and pass on to the firm and robust angles of Christ, to which when we have arrived, we are immediately met by the Tower of Ananeel, which is interpreted as the favor of God. For what is more pleasing than the Tower of Solomon? of which it is said to the bride: 'Your neck is like the tower of David, which is built with bulwarks; a thousand shields hang upon it; all the spears of the mighty are upon it' (Song of Solomon 4:4). The Lord wants this tower to be built in the Gospel (Chapter XIV), with previous expenses and costs computed: and about which it is said to Jerusalem: Let there be peace within your walls, and abundance within your towers (Psalm 122:7), about which the saint also speaks to the Lord: You have led me, for you have become my hope: a tower of strength against the enemy (Psalm 60:4). From the Tower of Ananeel, we come to the king's wine press, for which three psalms also have a title. And the Lord says in Isaiah: I have trodden the winepress alone (Isa. LXIII, 3), so that our vineyard may abound in them, and we may press out the grapes, and in Christ's blood we may trample the reddened juice; so that we may drink the wine that gladdens the heart of man (Ps. CIII); and the bride desires the companions of the bridegroom, saying: Lead me into the wine cellar, set love upon me (Cant. II, 4). If we are made drunk by such winepresses, we will dwell in Jerusalem, where there will no longer be anathema, namely curse and abomination. And the Apostle says: If anyone does not love the Lord, let him be accursed (I Cor. XVI, 2). And in another place: No one speaking in the Spirit of God says 'Jesus be accursed' (I Cor. XII). And for the sake of the salvation of his brothers, he desires to be accursed, imitating his Lord who, though he was not a curse, became a curse for us (Rom. IX). But when all the curse is removed, Jerusalem will dwell secure and confident, and she will fulfill that which is said of her: 'Blessed is the one who trusts in the Lord.' And: It is better to trust in the Lord than to trust in man (Ps. CXVII, 8): about this security and confidence the prophet Jeremiah also mentions: Blessed is the man who trusts in the Lord (Jerem. XVII, 7).
