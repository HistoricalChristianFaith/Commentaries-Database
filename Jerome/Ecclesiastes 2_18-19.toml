"Thus I
hated all my achievements labouring under the sun, for I must leave it to the
man who succeeds me. And who knows
whether he will be wise or foolish? - And he will control all my possessions
which I toiled and have shown myself wise under the sun. This, too, is vanity. "He seems to be reconsidering wealth and riches, because
according to the Gospel, being snatched by sudden death, we do not know with
which kind of heir we die - whether he will be a fool or wise who will enjoy
the fruits of our toil. This was also
the case with Solomon: for he did not regard his son Roboam as similar to himself. We learn from this that a son is not worthy
of his father's heredity if he is foolish. 
But to me studying the work it seems that he is speaking more about
spiritual labour, because a wise man will work on the Scriptures for days and
nights, and will compose books and will hand down his memory to his
descendants, and nonetheless all this will come into the hands of fools, who
repeatedly find in them the seeds of heresy, according to the perversity of
their own mind, and waste other men's efforts. 
For if the text now refers to Ecclesiastes' personal wealth, it was
necessary to say about toil and wealth: "and he will control all my
possessions which I toiled and have shown myself wise under the sun." For what is wise in the pursuit of earthly
riches?
