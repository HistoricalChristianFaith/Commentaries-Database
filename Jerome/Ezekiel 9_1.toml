(Chapter IXâ€”Verse 1) And he cried out in my ears with a loud voice, saying: The visitations of the city have drawn near. In place of visitations, the Seventy translated 'vengeance.' For I will exact vengeance, and I will repay, says the Lord (Deuteronomy 32:35). And every vengeance is like that of a sick person, like one who has wounds, like someone waiting for healing hands, according to what is written elsewhere: I will visit their iniquities with a rod, and their sins with lashes, but I will not take away my mercy from them (Psalm 88:33-34). And rightly (as we have said above), a visit or revenge is said to be approaching with imminent captivity.

And each person has a vessel of destruction in their hand. He did not say, he had, as the Septuagint translated. For he does not narrate the past, but demonstrates the present and the future. Therefore, whoever strikes evil people because they are evil and has vessels of destruction in order to kill the worst, is a servant of the Lord.
