In fulfilment of that prophecy of Hieremias, who said, “I will send unto you many fishers,” when Peter and Andrew, James and John, heard the words, “Follow me, I will make you fishers of men,” they put together a net for themselves formed of the Old and New Testaments, and cast it into the sea of this world, and that remains spread until this day, taking up out of the salt and bitter and whirlpools whatever falls into it, that is good men and bad; and this is that He adds, “And gathered of every kind.”.
For when the end of the world shall be come, then shall be shown the true test of separating the fishes, and as in a sheltered harbour the good shall be sent into the vessels of heavenly abodes, but the flame of hell shall seize the wicked to be dried up and withered.
