As to what is said about the person of the Lord: “I will open my mouth in parables, I will utter what has been hidden since the foundation of the world,” we must pay close attention to the description of the departure of the Israelites from Egypt and the narration of all the signs contained in the book of Exodus. From this we realize that all those things that were written are to be understood through parables. And not only those great writings but also the signs that have been hidden will not ring clear unless we view them as parables. For the Savior promises that he will speak in parables and utter what has been hidden from the foundation of the world.
