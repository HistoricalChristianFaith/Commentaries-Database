As to what is said about the person of the Lord: “I will open my mouth in parables, I will utter what has been hidden since the foundation of the world,” we must pay close attention to the description of the departure of the Israelites from Egypt and the narration of all the signs contained in the book of Exodus. From this we realize that all those things that were written are to be understood through parables. And not only those great writings but also the signs that have been hidden will not ring clear unless we view them as parables. For the Savior promises that he will speak in parables and utter what has been hidden from the foundation of the world.

(Verse 35) So that what was said through the prophet might be fulfilled, saying: I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things hidden since the foundation of the world. This testimony is taken from the seventy-seventh psalm (Verse 2). It is read in some codices, and a diligent reader may perhaps find the same thing in the place where we have put it, and the Vulgate edition has: So that what was said through the prophet might be fulfilled, written there, through the prophet Isaiah, saying. Because it was not found in Isaiah, I believe it was later removed by prudent men. But it seems to me that it was originally written like this: 'What is written by the prophet Asaph, saying. The seventy-seventh psalm, from which this testimony is taken, is inscribed with the title of Asaph the prophet.' And the first scribe did not understand Asaph, and thought it was a mistake of the scribe, and corrected it to the more obvious name of Isaiah. It must be known, therefore, that in the psalms and hymns and songs of God, not only David, but also the others whose names are written, are to be called prophets: namely, Asaph and Idithun, and Heman the Ezrahite, and Ethan, and the sons of Korah, and the rest whom the Scripture mentions. And that which is said in the person of the Lord: I will open my mouth in parables: I will utter things hidden from the foundation of the world, must be carefully considered and found to describe in a more detailed manner the departure of the Israelites from Egypt, and all the signs that are contained in the story of Exodus. From this we understand that all those things that are written should be understood in a parabolic manner: not only to sound out the obvious letter, but also the hidden mysteries; for this is what the Savior promises, opening his mouth in parables, and revealing secrets from the foundation of the world.
