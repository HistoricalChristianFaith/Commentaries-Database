(Vers. 8, 9.) Then your light shall break forth like the dawn, and your healing shall spring up quickly; your righteousness shall go before you, and the glory of the Lord shall be your rear guard. Then you shall call, and the Lord will answer; you shall cry for help, and he will say: Here I am. LXX: Then your light shall break forth like the morning; your healing shall spring forth speedily, and your righteousness shall go before you; the glory of God shall surround you. Then you shall call, and the Lord will answer; you shall cry, and he will say: Here I am. While you are still speaking, he will say: Here I am. When you have not done those things that the previous conversation narrated, and you have done those things that we are now speaking about, then your fasting will be acceptable, and your morning light will break forth; the sun of righteousness, about which Malachi the prophet speaks in the person of God the Father, saying: For you who fear my name, the sun of righteousness will rise, with healing in its wings (Malachi 4:2). That sun is called the light here. For just as the morning light dispels darkness, so the light of knowledge and truth dispels all errors. And your healings, it is said, will quickly arise. For this reason, Aquila, expressing word for word, put: And the scar of your wound will quickly be covered; so that, namely, the wounds of our sins may be closed with a quickly covered scar at the rising of the sun of righteousness. Because of this, the Seventy translated τὰ ἰάματά σου, that is, your healings, with the similarity of the word ἱμάτια, that is, garments. Therefore, deceived by the falseness of many translations, they use this testimony to prove the resurrection of the body, namely that the garment of the soul will receive a body, which will arise on the day of resurrection. And it says, 'Your righteousness will go before you.' (Genesis 30:33, according to the Septuagint). According to what Jacob says: 'Tomorrow my righteousness will answer me,' and what is written will be fulfilled: 'Behold, the man and his works.' And the glory of the Lord will surround you, like a beautiful garment, so that you may be glorified before God and before men. Then you will call upon Him, and the Lord will answer; you will cry out, and He will say: 'Here I am,' not in words, but in works; not in response, but in acts of kindness. This is confirmed in the letter and in the Gospel, when the leper said to the Lord, 'If you will, you can make me clean,' and the Lord answered, saying: 'I will, be clean.'
