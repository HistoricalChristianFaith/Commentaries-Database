(Verse 35.) And Jesus went about all the cities and towns, teaching in their synagogues and preaching the Gospel of the kingdom, and healing all illness and every infirmity. You see that He preached the Gospel equally to both villages and cities, that is, to both large and small, so that He would not consider the power of the nobles, but the salvation of the believers. He went through the cities, having this work that the Father had commanded: and this hunger, to save the unbelievers with His teaching. But He was teaching the Gospel of the kingdom in the synagogues and villages, and after preaching and teaching, He cured every illness and every infirmity, so that those whom his words did not persuade, his deeds would persuade. He is properly called the Lord, who cares for every illness and every infirmity, for nothing is impossible for Him.
