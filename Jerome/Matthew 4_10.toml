“Then Jesus said to him, ‘Begone, Satan! For it is written: the Lord your God shall you worship, and him only shall you serve.’ ” Satan and the apostle Peter are not condemned by the same judgment, as many may think. For to Peter it was said, “Get behind me, Satan,” that is, follow me, you who are contrary to my will. But the devil heard the words “Begone, Satan”; And it was not said to him “Get behind me,” as if it were a matter of simple subjection. Rather it is an instruction: “You shall worship the Lord your God and him only shall you serve.” This is the opposite of the devil’s earlier words to the Savior: “If you will fall down and worship me.” Now he hears that it is he who should worship his Lord and God. Otherwise, “Go into the everlasting fire that has been prepared for you and your angels.”

(Verse 10.) Then Jesus said to him: Go, Satan: for it is written. Not as many think, Satan and the apostle Peter are condemned with the same sentence. For to Peter it is said: Get behind me, Satan (Matt. XVI, 23), that is, follow me, who are contrary to my will: but here he hears, go, Satan: and it is not said to him, behind me, so that it may be understood, go into the eternal fire, which is prepared for you, and your angels.



You shall worship the Lord your God and serve only Him. The devil said to the Savior: if you fall down and worship me, on the contrary, He hears that He should rather worship the Lord, His God.
