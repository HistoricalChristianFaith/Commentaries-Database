(Verse 26.) For it was founded upon a rock. And everyone who hears these words of mine and does not do them will be like a foolish man. Upon this rock the Lord built his Church (Matthew 15): from this rock the apostle Peter obtained his name. Upon a rock of this kind, serpent's tracks are not found (Proverbs 30). Concerning this, the prophet speaks confidently: He set my feet upon a rock (Psalm 40:3). And in another place: The rock is a refuge for rabbits, or porcupines (Psalm 104:8). For a timid animal takes refuge in the caves of the rocks: and with its rough skin and completely armed with javelins, it protects itself with such defense. Therefore, it is said to Moses at that time when he had fled from Egypt, and the rabbit was the Lord's: Stand in the opening of the rock, and you will see my back parts. (Exodus 33:21).
