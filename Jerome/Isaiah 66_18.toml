And Zechariah saw during the night, “behold, a man mounting a red horse, who was standing between two shady mountains, and behind him were red and white and chestnut and variously colored horses.” … John also in the Apocalypse testified that he saw this: “I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse, and he who sat on it was called faithful and true and a righteous judge and warrior. His eyes were like flames of fire, and on his head were many diadems, having a written name that no one knew except himself. And he was clothed in a garment sprinkled with blood and the name by which he was called was Word of God. And an army in heaven followed him on white horses, clothed in the purest white linen, and a sharp sword went forth from his mouth to strike the nations.” The Lord and Savior was sitting on a red horse as he assumed human nature, to whom it is asked: “Why are your garments red? And who is this who ascends from Edom with crimson garments from Bozrah?” Horses of various colors followed him, moreover, either red with martyrdom or chestnut in flight or variegated with virtues or white with virginity. But he was sitting on a white horse when he assumed an immortal and uncorrupted body after the resurrection. Whoever followed him also used a white horse, incorrupt and immortal in body. If we wished to explain both texts, it would take a long time, but let me say only this, that the various vehicles by which people are led to faith are angels, or saints who have advanced from being people to being angels. Many Scripture passages teach that each of us should have angels, one of which is: “Do not despise one of these little ones, for their angels daily behold the face of the Father who is in heaven.” Also, when the maid Rhoda announced that it was Peter at the door, others believed him to be Peter’s angel.
