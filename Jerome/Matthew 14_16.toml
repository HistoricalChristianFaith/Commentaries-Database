(Verse 16.) But Jesus said to them: They have no need to go. They have no need to seek different foods, and buy for themselves unknown breads, when they have heavenly bread with them.

On that day he commanded you to eat. He challenged the apostles to break the bread, so that, in them testifying that he did not have it, the greatness of the sign may become more known.
