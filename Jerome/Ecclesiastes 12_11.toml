"The words of the wise are as goads, and as
nails fastened by the masters of assemblies, which are given from one
shepherd. "The teacher should not be seen to break from
the law of God and afterwards to justify teaching by himself, more hastily than
Moses not so much of his own will, as first by the anger of God, took teachings
therefrom with enthusiasm. He says that
his words are the words of the wise, which like a goad correct the wicked and
they move the slow steps of mortals with a sharp sting, thus they are hard like
nails which hold things up securely and high; and they are not offered with one
man's authority, but with the advice and agreement of all teachers. Let not mankind's wisdom be despised, for he
says it is given from one shepherd. That
is, many are allowed to teach, but there is only one originator of the
teachings, who is God. He turns the
passage against those who think there is one God of the Old Law, and one God of
the Gospels, since one shepherd taught the advice of the wise. But the wise are just as much prophets as the
apostles themselves. At the same time it
should be remembered that the words of the wise are said to sting, not to
flatter or encourage debauchery by a lack of discipline. But as I have said above it is to give the
wound and slow pain of repentance to those who have come into wickedness. For if his speech does not sting but it like
pleasure for the listeners then that is not the speech of a wise man. For the words of the wise are like the goad,
since after all they cause the conversion of the wicked, are firm, given on the
advice of saints, given by the one shepherd, and are founded on a strong
root. I think I have heard it said in
Paul that Saul was thrown into the way of wickedness by this goad: "it is
hard for you to kick against the pricks." [Act. 9, 5.]
