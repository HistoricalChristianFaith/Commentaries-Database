(Verse 17 and following) Will not Lebanon soon become a fruitful field, and the fruitful field be regarded as a forest? On that day the deaf will hear the words of the scroll, and out of gloom and darkness the eyes of the blind will see. The meek will obtain fresh joy in the Lord, and the neediest people will exult in the Holy One of Israel. For the tyrant shall be no more, and the scoffer shall cease to be; all those alert to do evil shall be cut off. Why do people sin in words and overthrow the one who argues at the gate? And they turned away in vain from the just. Let the Jews and friends of simple history answer, those who seek fruit not on the tree, but only leaves and the shadow of words, which quickly wither and perish. How is it that in the coming of the Lord Savior (because from the time of Isaiah until the incarnation of the flesh, for the comparison of eternity, it is a short and small span of time) the mountain of Lebanon turned towards Phoenicia and moved to Mount Carmel? It is called in Hebrew Chermel, and it is near the border of Palestine and Phoenicia, overlooking Ptolemais: although another mountain in the holy scriptures is called Mount Carmel, where there was Nabal the Carmelite (1 Samuel 25), a foolish and wicked man, who had a wife named Abigail, who married David after her husband died; while her husband was alive, she could not marry David, so as not to be called an adulteress if she were associated with another man; and how is Carmel considered a desirable place and unfruitful trees? But since they are unable to express it, let them listen to Libanus, which means "whiteness", referring to the people of the Gentiles who, having been washed in the Lord and cleansed of their former filth, ascend as a whole world. They rely on the person of the Church as the bride of the Savior, and it is said about them in the Song of Songs: Who is this who comes up, shining white, leaning on her beloved? (Cant. VIII. 5) And let this people be transferred to Carmel, which means the knowledge of circumcision, so that they may recognize the mysteries of spiritual and true circumcision, and be in the place of the former people of the Jews. As for those who refuse to accept Christ, let them be considered as thorns and barren trees, which cannot praise the Lord with fruitful trees. But when Lebanon is changed into Carmel, and Carmel into a forest, then those who were deaf and could not hear the words of the prophetic book (of which we have spoken before, that all Holy Scripture is called one book, as Ecclesiastes says: 'The sayings of the wise are like goads, and like nails fixed deep in, given by one Shepherd') will hear and speak, to whom the Savior will say: Ephphatha (which means, 'Be opened') (Mark 7). And that which we translate, the eyes of the blind shall see darkness and mist, the interpretation of which is easy; Aquila and Theodotion and Symmachus translated: The eyes of the blind shall see darkness and mist: to show the sacraments of Christ to the people of the nations, who were previously blind, according to what is said: Dark water in the clouds of the sky (Ps. 17, 12). And in the same psalm it is written about God: He set darkness as his hiding place (Ibid. 12). And in Proverbs we read: This wise person will be wiser by hearing these things and will have possession of prudent governance and will understand parables and dark sayings spoken by the wise and enigmas (Prov. I, 5, 6). Moreover, Moses, in order to understand and see God (Exod. XX), entered into a cloud and darkness, of which it is said in the Psalm: Darkness is under his feet (Ps. XVII, 10). But when the blind or those who are initiated into mystical matters have first beheld these things or have lifted up their eyes from blindness and darkness to see, so that true light may arise for those sitting in darkness and the shadow of death, then the meek, of whom it is written: Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth (Matt. V, 4), whether they be the poor, of whom the leader says in the Psalms: This poor man cried out, and the Lord heard him (Ps. XXXIII, 7); and he who judges the poor people and will save the children of the poor (Ps. XIII, 9), of whom it is said to the Jews: You have despised the counsel of the poor, they shall add joy in the Lord, so that he who glories, may glory in the Lord (II Cor. X); and poor men or those in despair and contempt by men, who did not have knowledge of the law before, will exult in the Holy One of Israel, who says: Be holy, for I am holy (Lev. XI, 44). And there is rejoicing for every downfall: for he who prevailed has fallen. The deceiver, or the arrogant and proud one, is brought to an end, who said: With my strength I will do it, and with my wisdom I will remove the boundaries of nations and destroy their strength; who deceived everyone to such an extent that even the holy one said: My loins are filled with deceits (Psalm 38:8). And all those who kept watch over wickedness have been cut off or destroyed, for their wicked vigilance does not cease: they caused the whole human race to sin by blaspheming the Word of God and placing their mouths in heaven. But the demons, themselves wicked, made all men sin in speech, blaspheming with various teachings, and they would overthrow the one reproaching in the gate and in judgment as much as they could, and they made him turn away from righteousness, who was in the gates of the daughter of Zion, exalted from the gates of death; and he rebuked those who hated him in the gates. These things we understand concerning the devil and his angels, the Nazarenes consider them to be spoken against the scribes and Pharisees, because they failed in their second attempt, who before mocked the people with their wicked traditions; and they watched day and night to deceive the simple, who made men sin against the Word of God, to deny Christ the Son of God.
