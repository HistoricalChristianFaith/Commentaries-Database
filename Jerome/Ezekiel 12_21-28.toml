(Verse 21 and following) And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: Son of man, what is this proverb that you have in the land of Israel, saying: The days are prolonged, and every vision fails? Therefore say to them: Thus says the Lord God: I will make this proverb to cease, and it shall be used no more in Israel. Speak to them, and say: The days are at hand, and every vision shall be fulfilled. For there shall no longer be any false vision, nor ambiguous divination in the midst of the children of Israel. Because I, the Lord, will speak, whatever word I have spoken will be done. It will no longer be delayed, but in your days, O rebellious house, I will speak a word and I will do it, says the Lord God. And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: Son of man, behold the house of Israel, saying: The vision that this man sees is for many days and he prophesies for a long time. Therefore, say to them: Thus says the Lord God: My word will no longer be delayed: the word that I have spoken will be fulfilled, says the Lord God. What we have said, the proverb, according to Symmachus, all other interpreters have translated as a parable, which in Hebrew is called Masal. Again, where it has been said by us: 'There shall not be an ambiguous divination,' the Seventy have translated it as 'nor one divining according to favor.' For which reason all have interpreted it as slippery, whereas what we have said is ambiguous, so that we may understand the deceiving words of our prophets. Now the meaning of the entire chapter is this: He had previously prophesied against the ruler who was in Jerusalem, then he declared to the people that there would be famine and a burning thirst. So the unbelieving crowd takes up an old and well-known proverb: The threat of prophets is postponed to a distant time, and every vision will perish, while it is seen in vain; or, according to Symmachus, it will vanish into thin air and a gentle breeze. Therefore, say to them, my threat will by no means be postponed, nor will a false and ambiguous prediction be made to the people that has an uncertain end, so that it is said at one time and fulfilled at another; but now, while you who speak and those who hear are alive, let the word that I have spoken be fulfilled. However, it signifies the imminent captivity of the city of Jerusalem and the capture of Zedekiah with the people of Judah. Not only at that time, but even today the unbelieving crowd and the hard hearts of mortals do not accept the prophecy of God: but they consider everything that the prophets threaten, everything that the Gospel preaches, to be postponed to another time. And here let us understand the parable that is presented by the Septuagint as being received as a proverb, in accordance with what we read in the psalm: 'And I became a proverb to them' (Psalm 68:12). And in the same prophet: What is this parable to you in the people of Israel, saying: The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the teeth of the sons are set on edge? We clearly explain, so that we may remain in the more obscure.
