God the Father is called aman by a human conception. The vineyard is the house of Israel; the hedge is the guardianship of Angels; the wine fat is the law, the tower is the temple, and the husbandmen, the priests.
The servants who were sent were the prophets, the fruit of the vineyard is obedience; some of the prophets were beaten, others wounded, others slain. Wherefore it goes on: “And they caught him, and beat him, and sent him away empty.”.
The well-beloved son and the last is the Only-begotten; and in that He says, “They will reverence myson,” He speaks in irony.
Or else, the vineyard is given to others, that is, to those who come from the east, and from the west, and from the south, and from the north, and who sit down with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven.
This rejected stone, which is borne by that corner where the lamb and the bread met in the supper, ending the Old and beginning the New Testament, does things marvellous in our eyes as the topaz.
