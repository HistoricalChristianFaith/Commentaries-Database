(Verse 28, 29.) Have mercy on us, Son of David. And when he came into the house, the blind men came to him, and Jesus said to them: Do you believe that I can do this for you? They said to him: Yes, Lord. Then he touched their eyes, saying: Let it be done to you according to your faith. And their eyes were opened. Let Marcion and Manichaeus, and other heretics, who tear apart the Old Testament, hear this and learn that the Savior is called the Son of David. For if he was not born in the flesh, how is he called the son of David?
