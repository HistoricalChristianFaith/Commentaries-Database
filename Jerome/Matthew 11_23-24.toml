(Vers. 23, 24.) Because if in Sodom (or, as some say, in Sidon) the miracles had been done that have been done in you, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes. But I say to you that it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom on the day of judgment than for you. Let the prudent reader ask and say whether Tyre and Sidon and Sodom could have repented at the preaching of the Savior and the signs of miracles, and it is not their fault that they did not believe, but the sin of silence is in him who did not want to preach repentance to those who would have acted on it. To which the easy and clear answer is: to be ignorant of the judgments of God, and to not know the sacraments of his dispensations. The purpose was for the Lord to not exceed the boundaries of Judea, so as not to give the Pharisees and priests a just occasion for persecution. Therefore, before the passion, he commanded the apostles: Do not go into the way of the Gentiles, and do not enter into the cities of the Samaritans (Matthew 10:5). Therefore, Chorazin and Bethsaida are condemned because they refused to believe in the present Lord. Tyre and Sidon are justified because they believed in his apostles. Do not question the times when you witness the salvation of the believers. However, in Capernaum, which means the most beautiful town, unbelieving Jerusalem is condemned, to whom it is said through Ezekiel: Sodom was justified because of you (Ezek. XVI, 52).
