"There is
no remembrance of former things; neither shall there be any remembrance of
things that are to come with those that shall come after."  In the same
way as the past is concealed for us in forgetfulness, thus it is with those
things which are either done now, or will be done. And because of this those men who have yet to
be born, will not be able to know these things, and will live life in silence,
and will be obscured as if they never existed, and that verse will be
fulfilled, which says, "vanity of vanities, all is vanity", for even
the Seraphim, the first and last, cover up their feet on account of the
appearance of God. The Septuagint is
similar here: "There is no memory of former things, and even of things
which are to come, there will be no memory for them with those who will come
after." That is observed from the
Gospel because those who were first in time are first "before all others". [Cfr Matth. 20, 16.] And because God who is benevolent and
forgiving remembers all things no matter how insignificant, he will not give as
much glory to those who deserve to be first on account of their faults, as he
will give to those who humbly wanted to be first. And so it says consequently: "there is
no memory of the wise more than of the fool for ever."  [Eccl. 2, 16.]
