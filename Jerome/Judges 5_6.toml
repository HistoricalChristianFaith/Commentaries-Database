(Judges 5:6) In the days of Sangar, the son of Anath, in the days of Jahel, the paths remained empty, and those who entered through them walked along crooked roads. The paths are said to have remained empty because during the time of Sangar, the leader of Israel, the paths had been taken over by enemies of Israel, and they did not dare to freely ascend to the house of the Lord to pray; instead, those who entered through them secretly ascended through crooked streets, out of fear of the enemies. Concerning which enemies Sangar is said to have not fully freed them (Judg. 3:31). But what is inserted a little above, in the days of Jahel, is to be understood, because when Sisara was killed by Jahel, the roads were opened, and they went into the house of the Lord without any fear, who previously went there by winding paths. And that Jahel is mentioned before Debbora here, it is said that Debbora did this for the sake of humility, because Jahel, the wife of Aber the Cinaean, killed Sisara.
