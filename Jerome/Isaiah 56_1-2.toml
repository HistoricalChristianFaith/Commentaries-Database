This man is also the son of the inner person, about which it is frequently said in Leviticus, a person is blessed in that he does and understands these following things as the priority: namely, judgment, justice, and the salvation of the Lord, all of which are near and are to be revealed to all the nations. Such a person also understands that he will not only do that which is commanded but will hold it firmly. And he will keep the sabbath so that he does not pollute it.… But we are called into freedom, and by this freedom Christ grants us that we do not work for food that perishes. Instead, cleaving to the Lord, let us say with the prophet, “It is good for me to stay close to God, and let us become one spirit with him, and let us fulfill the delightful sabbath, and we shall not belong to the six days in which the world was made.”
