Sometimes the occasion of evil becomes the occasion of good, and God turns evil human plans to an upright end.… If indeed [Onesimus] had not fled his master, he never would have come to Rome where Paul was in prison in chains. If he had not seen Paul in chains, he would not have received faith in Christ. If he had not had faith in Christ, he never would have become Paul’s son, so that he might be sent for the work of the gospel.… Paul says “perhaps” cautiously, hesitantly, with trepidation and not with certainty. If he had not said “perhaps,” all slaves would need to flee in order to become apostles.
