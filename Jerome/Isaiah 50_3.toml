Everything that is above us we call “heaven,” just as the winged things that are in the air are called “celestial” and the enemy powers are called “celestial” since they shuttle between heaven and earth.… Therefore, heaven is not covered up by a bag; but with the light of heaven closed off, the air that is underneath it becomes darkened with black clouds. We can interpret the heavens covered in darkness and concealed in a bag by saying that all are under sin and that the holy ones, too, need the mercy of God.
