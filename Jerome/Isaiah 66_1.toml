“And worship his footstool for it is holy.” What is this footstool of Jesus that is holy? We read in another place: “The heavens are my throne, the earth is my footstool”; and here, “worship his footstool.” If earth is Jesus’ footstool, and the psalm says worship his footstool, then is earth to be adored? How, then, do we read in the apostle that we must worship the Creator, not the creature? In Scripture, adoration conveys two different notions: worship as an act toward God and worship in the sense of reverence. When we use the word worship in relation to God, we mean the adoration that is proper to God. When, however, we use the term with reference to a human being, as for example, Sarah worshiped Abraham and Elijah worshiped Ahab—a most ungodly king—it does not mean that Elijah worshiped Ahab as if he were God but that this worship was more like a greeting.Now, we are ready to examine the words “and worship his footstool,” and [we will] see in which way the word worship is intended. Do we adore God’s footstool just as we adore God or in the same sense that we worship and pay respect to a person? We have read in the Lamentations of Jeremiah and in another of the prophets, “How the Lord has hallowed his footstool!” In this passage, his footstool is Jerusalem, or the temple. And so, the reference is historical.
We shall now consider the verse “and worship his footstool” from another point of view. If feet rest on a footstool, the words “Let us worship in the place where his feet have stood” likewise refer to a footstool. In that event, we may hold to the letter and mean, for example, that place where he was born, where he was crucified, where he arose from the dead. This is the explanation for beginners.… [Or] Jesus’ footstool is the soul of the one who believes. Happy the person in whose heart Jesus sets his feet every day! If only he would set his feet in my heart! If only his footsteps would cling to my heart forever!
