“And worship his footstool for it is holy.” What is this footstool of Jesus that is holy? We read in another place: “The heavens are my throne, the earth is my footstool”; and here, “worship his footstool.” If earth is Jesus’ footstool, and the psalm says worship his footstool, then is earth to be adored? How, then, do we read in the apostle that we must worship the Creator, not the creature? In Scripture, adoration conveys two different notions: worship as an act toward God and worship in the sense of reverence. When we use the word worship in relation to God, we mean the adoration that is proper to God. When, however, we use the term with reference to a human being, as for example, Sarah worshiped Abraham and Elijah worshiped Ahab—a most ungodly king—it does not mean that Elijah worshiped Ahab as if he were God but that this worship was more like a greeting.Now, we are ready to examine the words “and worship his footstool,” and [we will] see in which way the word worship is intended. Do we adore God’s footstool just as we adore God or in the same sense that we worship and pay respect to a person? We have read in the Lamentations of Jeremiah and in another of the prophets, “How the Lord has hallowed his footstool!” In this passage, his footstool is Jerusalem, or the temple. And so, the reference is historical.
We shall now consider the verse “and worship his footstool” from another point of view. If feet rest on a footstool, the words “Let us worship in the place where his feet have stood” likewise refer to a footstool. In that event, we may hold to the letter and mean, for example, that place where he was born, where he was crucified, where he arose from the dead. This is the explanation for beginners.… [Or] Jesus’ footstool is the soul of the one who believes. Happy the person in whose heart Jesus sets his feet every day! If only he would set his feet in my heart! If only his footsteps would cling to my heart forever!

(Chapter 66, Verse 1) Thus says the Lord: Heaven is My throne, and the earth is the footstool for My feet. What is this house that you are building for Me, and what is this place of My rest? All these things My hand has made, and so all these things have come into being, says the Lord. Similarly, let us understand that Mount Zion is the holy mountain, and let us not be deceived by the Jewish error that believes that Jerusalem must be rebuilt and that all the promises of the Lord must be fulfilled there carnally. He takes away this suspicion from us and presents the testimony that Stephen, the first martyr in Christ, used against the Jewish contention (Acts 7). Solomon built him a house, doubtless for God; but he does not dwell in man-made structures, as the Prophet says: Heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool. And Paul in the same volume: God, who made the world and all things in it, does not dwell in temples made by hands (Acts 17:24). For if heaven is his throne, and the earth is his footstool, how can he be confined to a small space, who fills all things and in whom all things exist? And Moses also said: 'Lest thou shouldst say in thy heart: 'It is afar off,' God is in heaven above, and in the earth beneath: and there is no other God besides him (Deut. IV, 39).' And the Psalmist: 'Whither shall I go from thy spirit, or whither shall I flee from thy face? If I ascend into heaven, thou art there: if I descend into hell, thou art present (Psal. CXXXVIII, 7).' To whom Jeremiah also agrees, speaking in the person of God, saying: 'I am a God nigh at hand, and not a God afar off.' Can anyone hide in secret places where I cannot see them? Do I not fill heaven and earth? (Jeremiah 23:23-24) For in Him we live and move and have our being. (Acts 17) He says this to expose the error of the Jewish belief that God, who is invisible, incorporeal, and incomprehensible, can be confined to the temple in Jerusalem. Even Solomon, the builder of the temple, acknowledges this in his prayer to the Lord. (1 Kings 8) Lest we think that the magnitude of God should be measured in both heaven and earth, in another place we read about Him: He holds the heavens in the palm of His hand, and the earth in a fist. (Isaiah 40:12) Through this it is shown that God is both external and internal, infused and surrounding, as He is not contained by the surrounding throne, yet He is contained by a fist and a palm. He is not only the creator of heaven and earth, but also of the invisible beings, the angels and archangels, dominions and powers, and all mankind, as the Apostle speaks about them (Colossians 1). All of these things were made by the hand of God. Job and the Psalmist both mention this: Your hand made me and fashioned me (Job 10:18; Psalm 119:73). For everything was made through him, and without him nothing was made (John 1). He Himself spoke, and they were made; He commanded, and they were created (Psalm 33). And as the Scripture of Genesis demonstrates in mystical speech, God said, and God made (Genesis 1). For by the word of the Lord the heavens were made, and by the breath of his mouth all their host. There is no place of rest of the Lord, except the one that the Prophet mentions.
