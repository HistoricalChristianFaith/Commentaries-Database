Innumerable are the examples we must omit, since we wish to be brief. But all of them make it sufficiently clear that the customary method of most heresies consists in rejoicing in “profane novelties,” in loathing traditional knowledge, which some rejecting have made shipwreck concerning the faith. Conversely, it is proper for Catholics to guard the “deposit,” handed down by the holy fathers, to condemn profane novelties, and, as the apostle said, “before and now I say again,” let him be anathema “if any one preach to you a gospel besides that which you have received.”
