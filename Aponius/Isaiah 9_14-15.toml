He who may have been at the head of the flock of Christ is now made the tail of another flock, as God declared through Isaiah: “The prophet who teaches lies is the tail.” Everyone among the people who is of right faith, even though he may hold a lower position or office, is beyond doubt at the head of the people by virtue of his right faith. But if he were to depart from the head, great though he may seem among the heretics, he becomes the tail by teaching lies. No longer a lamb who hears the voice of the Lord, he is now made like a wandering goat by following in the footsteps of the evil flock.
