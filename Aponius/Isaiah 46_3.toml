We hear the voice of the Holy Spirit with wonder when it tells us in many passages of Scripture that the Word of God, in an ineffable motion of love, has given human nature the names of “sister,” “daughter,” “bride.” For example, the words in Isaiah, “Listen to me, Israel my people, the race of Abraham my friend, you whom I carry in my womb.” … Our mind is set aflame with desire to obtain the love that burns between the Word of God and the soul, so that it can know the measure of love and give love to God in return.
