If Christ is only a man, why did he lay down for us such a rule of faith as to say, “But this is life eternal, that they may know you the one and true God, and Jesus Christ whom you have sent”? If he had not wanted himself to be understood also as God, why did he add, “And Jesus Christ whom you have sent” unless it is because he wanted to be accepted as also God? Because, if he had not wanted himself to be understood as God, he would have added “and the man Jesus Christ whom you have sent.” But as it is, neither Christ added this nor did he hand down to us that he is only man. Rather, he joined [himself] to God so that he might also by this union be understood as God, as indeed he is.
