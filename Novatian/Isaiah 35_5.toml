Isaiah also alludes to him: “There shall go forth a rod from the root of Jesse, and a flower shall grow up from his root.” The same also when he says, “Behold, a virgin shall conceive and bear a son.” He refers to him when he enumerates the healings that were to proceed from him, saying, “Then shall the eyes of the blind be opened, and the ears of the deaf shall hear. Then shall the lame man leap like a deer, and the tongue of the dumb shall be eloquent.” Him also, when he sets forth the virtue of patience, saying, “His voice shall not be heard in the streets; a bruised reed shall he not destroy, and the smoking flax shall he not quench.”
