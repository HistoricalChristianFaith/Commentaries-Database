This word can be true of no human being, “I and the Father are one.” Christ alone declared this word out of the consciousness of his divinity.

But since they frequently urge on us the passage where it is said, “I and the Father are one,” in this also we shall overcome them with equal facility. For if, as the heretics think, Christ were the Father, he ought to have said, “I, the Father, am one.” But when he says I and afterwards introduces the Father by saying, “I and the Father,” he severs and distinguishes the peculiarity of his, that is, the Son’s person, from the paternal authority, not only in respect of the sound of the name but moreover in respect of the order of the distribution of power, since he might have said, “I the Father,” if he had had it in mind that he himself was the Father. And since he said “one” thing, let the heretics understand that he did not say “one” person. For “one,” placed in the neuter, intimates association, not personal unity. He is said to be one neuter, not one masculine, because the expression is not referred to the number, but it is declared with reference to the association of another. Finally, he adds, and says, “We are,” not “I am,” so as to show, by the fact of his saying “I and the Father are,” that they are two persons. Moreover, that he says one, has reference to the agreement, and to the identity of judgment and to the loving association itself, as reasonably the Father and Son are one in agreement, in love and in affection. And because he is of the Father, whatsoever he is, he is the Son. The distinction, however, remains that he is not the Father who is the Son, because he is not the Son who is the Father. For he would not have added “we are” if he had had it in mind that he, the only and sole Father, had become the Son.
