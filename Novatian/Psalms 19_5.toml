He it is who “comes forth as a bridegroom from his bridal chamber.” For he [returns] even to the height; “since no one has ascended into heaven except him who has descended from heaven, the Son of man who is in heaven.” He repeats this very same fact when he says, “Father, glorify me with the glory that I had with you before the world existed.” If this Word descended from heaven as a bridegroom to take on our flesh, so that in taking flesh he might ascend again as Son of man to that place where, as Son of God, the Word had descended, then assuredly, because of a mutual bond, the flesh bears the Word of God, and the Son of God assumes the weakness of the flesh. He ascends with his spouse, the flesh, to the same place from which he had descended without the flesh and receives now that glory that he is shown to have had before the creation of the world. This proves, without the least doubt, that he is God. Nevertheless, since the world itself is said to have been created after him, it is evident that it was created through him. This fact itself gives proof of the glory and the authority of the divinity that is in him, through whom the world was made.
