We acknowledge, therefore, and know that he is God, the Creator of all things. He is our Lord, because of his power; our author, because of his creation. “He spoke, and all things were made. He commanded, and all things came forth.” Of him it is written, “You have made all things in wisdom.” Moses says of him, “God is in heaven above and on earth below,” and according to Isaiah, “He has measured the heavens with a span, the earth with the width of the fist”;11 he “looks upon the earth and makes it tremble.” He “holds the orb of the earth and those who live on it as if they were locusts”;13 he “weighed the mountains on scales and the groves on a balance,” by the exact precision of the divine plan. He laid out this weight of the earth’s mass with precise equipoise, lest the huge ill-balanced mass should easily fall into ruin, if they were not balanced by providential weights. It is he who says through the prophet, “I am God, and there is none beside me.” He says by means of the same prophet, “I will not give my majesty to another,” so that he might exclude all heathens and heretics with their images, proving that he is God who is not made by the hand of an artificer. Nor is he some God whom heretical ingenuity has devised.
