The Fatherâ€™s care and providence neither allowed the garments of the Israelites to perish nor the worthless shoes on their feet to wear out; nor, finally, did he permit the wide trousers of the captive young men to be burned. And this is not without reason, for if he who contains all things embraces all things (all things, however, and the whole sum are made up of individual parts), then it follows logically that his care will be bestowed on every individual part because his providence extends to the whole, whatever it be.
