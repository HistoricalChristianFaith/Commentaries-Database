The same rule of truth teaches us to believe, after the Father, also on the Son of God, Christ Jesus, the Lord our God, but the Son of God—of that God who is both one and alone, namely, the Founder of all things, as already has been expressed above. For this Jesus Christ, I will once more say, the Son of this God, we read of as having been promised in the Old Testament and we observe to be manifested in the New, fulfilling the shadows and figures of the Old Testament types, being the embodiment of truth. For as well the ancient prophecies as the Gospels testify him to be the son of Abraham and the son of David. Genesis itself anticipates him when it says, “To you will I give it, and to your seed.” He is spoken of when Scripture shows how a man wrestled with Jacob; he too, when it says, “There shall not fail a prince from Judah, nor a leader from between his thighs, until he shall come to whom it has been promised; and he shall be the expectation of the nations.” He is spoken of by Moses when he says, “Provide another whom you may send.” He is again spoken of by the same, when he [Moses] testifies, saying, “A prophet will God raise up to you from your brothers; listen to him as if to me.” [Moses] bears witness of him, finally, when he says, “You shall see your life hanging in doubt night and day, and you shall not believe him.” Isaiah also refers to him: “There shall go forth a rod from the root of Jesse, and a flower shall grow up from his root.” The same also when he says, “Behold, a virgin shall conceive and bear a son.”
