Man’s first food was solely fruit and produce from trees. Man’s guilt subsequently introduced the use of bread. The posture of his body shows forth the state of his conscience. As long as man’s conscience did not reproach him, innocence raised him up toward the heavens to pluck his food from the trees. Once sin had been committed, it bowed man down to the soil of the earth to get grain. Still later the use of meat was added.
