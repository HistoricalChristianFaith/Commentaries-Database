He [Christ] foretells that he would rise again from the dead: “And in that day there shall be a root of Jesse and one who shall rise to rule the Gentiles: in me shall the Gentiles hope, and his resting place shall be worthy of honor.” The time of his resurrection is indicated: “We shall find him ready, as it were, at daybreak.” He shall sit at the right hand of the Father: “The Lord says to my Lord, ‘Sit at my right hand till I make your enemies your footstool,’ ” and he is represented as the possessor of all things: “Ask of me, and I will give you the nations for your inheritance and the ends of the earth for your possession.” Finally, he is shown to be the Judge of all: “O God, give the King your judgment, and your justice to the king’s son.” I shall not pursue the matter further at this point; for the things proclaimed about Christ are known to all heretics and are more than familiar to those who hold the truth.
