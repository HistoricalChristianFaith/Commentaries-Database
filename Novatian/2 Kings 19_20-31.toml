When eyes are ascribed to God, it is implied that he sees all things; an ear, to show that he hears all things; a finger, to reveal a certain signification of the will; nostrils, to show that he is aware of our prayers as one is of odors; hands, to prove that he is the author of every created thing; an arm, to make it known that no nature can resist his power; and finally feet, to make it clear that he fills all things and that there is no thing in which God is not.
