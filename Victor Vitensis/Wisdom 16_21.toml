That the Son is from the Father—that is, that he is of the same being as the Father—is proven by the following testimonies. The apostle says, “He is the splendor of his glory and the imprint of his being, sustaining all things by his powerful word.” And God the Father, reproaching the bad faith of unbelievers who did not want to listen to the voice of the Son who, while remaining in his being, had spoken through the prophets, said, “They did not listen to the voice of my being.” And reproaching with fearsome words because the voice of his being had been despised, he speaks again to the same prophet, saying, “Weeping on the high mountains and grief on the desert roads, because they have failed, no longer being human. They did not listen to the voice of my being, from the birds of the air to the beasts.” And again reproaching those who, deviating from the profession of one being, did not want to remain in the being itself of faith, he says, “If they had remained in my being, I would have brought them back from their evil ways and their wicked thoughts.” And it is again stated clearly that the Son must not be professed as being other than the being of the Father but that, with faith, he must be contemplated in his very being with the eyes of the intellect, when the prophet says, “Who has been in the being of the Lord and has seen his word?” Thus, that the being of the Father is the Son was already clearly proclaimed by the oracles of the prophets, Solomon saying, “You in fact showed us your being and your sweetness that you have toward your children.” The Lord showed that these were poured out from heaven on the people of Israel in the figure and semblance of heavenly bread, saying in the Gospel, “It was not Moses who gave you the bread from heaven, but it is my Father who gives you the bread from heaven.” He declares himself to be the bread when he says, “I am the living bread, who came down from heaven.” Of him the prophet David also says, “Human beings ate the bread of angels.”
