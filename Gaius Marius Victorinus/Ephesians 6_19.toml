Isn’t this wonderful? From those whom he himself has just now admonished, those whom he has instructed, to whom he has preached the gospel, he now asks for help. He is asking them for their prayers. He goes on to explain what he is asking them to pray for: “that utterance may be given to me.” His prayer is definite and specific, that a particular profit may accrue.
