He knew that the Philippians, unlike those addressed in his other letters, held to correct teaching. They had not been seduced by false apostles. He is here writing only a short letter of exhortation. He prays that “the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.” For if the Spirit dwells within them, they will respond rightly.
