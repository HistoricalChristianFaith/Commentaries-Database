His expression through the church means through all the members of God and through every soul that has put on his mysteries and has hope in him. From this we understand what has been given to humanity. The powers and principalities in heaven are learning the wisdom of God through a human mediator.

Paul briefly touches on all the parts of the mystery that we have spoken of above when he speaks of the “manifold wisdom of God,” whether this be that he sent his Son or that such great majesty assumed the form of a slave or that greater gifts were given. The promises are so great: the forgiveness of sins, the promise of heaven, eternal life, glorification and our inheritance together with the same Christ in his resurrection after death and even his death itself. This is what makes up the manifold wisdom of God.
