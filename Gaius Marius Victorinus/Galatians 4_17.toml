Since emulate signifies two things—one when someone emulates what he finds pleasing because it is good and another when people are emulators because they feel envy—these people, he says, emulate you in a bad way, by which he means that they are imitators through envy.… When he adds the phrase “so that you may emulate them” [meaning] “that you may follow them,” he has thus used the double sense of emulation in different places, since emulation is imitation, and especially when it is also directed to what is good.… [He continues: ] “Emulate therefore better gifts—not those of Jewish law, which are not gifts and are not better; but emulate those things which are good and better gifts. That is, whatever belongs to faith and love, emulate that with regard to Christ and follow it. It is always good to emulate better things. Emulation as such is not good, but the emulation of better things is always good, and not only when I am present.”
