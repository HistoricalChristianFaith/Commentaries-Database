God in his love has predestined us to adoption through Christ. How could God possibly have Christ for his Son by adoption? â€¦ We speak of ourselves as heirs of God the Father and heirs through Christ, being sons through adoption. Christ is his Son, through whom it is brought about that we become sons and fellow heirs in Christ.
