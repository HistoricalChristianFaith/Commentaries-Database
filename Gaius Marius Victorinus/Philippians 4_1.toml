Love, the sum of every virtue for the Christian, does not fittingly come to pass if the faithful do not stand united as one, thinking in harmony. This is what Paul means here by “Stand firm in the Lord, my beloved.” We may understand that he wants them to be united in understanding from the fact that he calls them [literally] “most beloved brethren.” Mutual love is the result of thinking in unison and standing together in Christ. When all have equal faith in Christ all of us stand together in him.
