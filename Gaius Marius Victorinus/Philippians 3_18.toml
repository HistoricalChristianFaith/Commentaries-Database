There are two types of misunderstanding of Christ, or rather one class of two descriptions, who are enemies of Christ. For some in their carnal thoughts deride the cross of Christ, thinking of Christ merely as a man raised onto a cross…. These pay attention to nothing but the flesh. To them “their god is a belly” and their “glory is in filthiness.” These are the ones who “think earthly thoughts” and whose end is death. On the other hand, there are those who think of Christ only as a spirit. They do not think of him as incarnate or crucified. They too are enemies to the cross of Christ, having death as their end.

An exhortation is stronger when it is accompanied by what is fearful in its alternative…. Paul expresses heartfelt affection when he describes the evils suffered by those who live otherwise, saying, “I say it with tears. ”
