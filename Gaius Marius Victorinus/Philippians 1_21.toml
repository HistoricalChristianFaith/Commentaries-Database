It is not death itself that is gain, but to die in Christ. Life is Christ. The one who has hope in him is always alive, both now and foreverâ€¦. Therefore, they achieve nothing, whether they hand me over to death or to tortures in life. Neither alternative harms me. Life under torments is no punishment for me, since Christ is my life. And if they kill me, that too is no punishment for me, since Christ for me is life and to die is gain.
