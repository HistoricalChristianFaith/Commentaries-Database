It is not enough that we do good; for our goodness will not be recognized straight away by God if we do good, but only if we “do not grow weary in doing good.” Many begin, many in a way persevere, yet later they give up, either tired or led astray. He justly warns them that they should not grow weary in any way, lest by their weariness they leave off what they began when they began to do well.
