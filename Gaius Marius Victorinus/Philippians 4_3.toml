I have said above that he promised that Epaphroditus would come to Philippi, and then I showed that Paul sent him when he said “and so I sent him in haste.” Therefore this is now, so to speak, added so that he may give him a command in the letter, praying and beseeching him to tell those women, Euodia and Syntyche, to have a common understanding in the Lord.… And that Epaphroditus is the one to whom he gives this command to help the aforesaid women to reach a common understanding can be perceived from the fact that he says, “I pray and beseech you, brother and yokefellow,” whereas above he said, “I thought Epaphroditus needful, my brother and fellow soldier.”
