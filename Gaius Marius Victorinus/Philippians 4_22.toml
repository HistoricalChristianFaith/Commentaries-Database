Many apparently have believed even from Caesar’s household. These are people who would otherwise have walked proudly and thought of nothing but Caesar. The power of the gospel has been revealed to these people. Many others who have believed are humble people. He equally greets them all, humbly and affably, wherever they are. The word “especially” in relation to “those of Caesar’s household” makes it apparent that they are taking pains to be pleasing in service.
