Would a man who was only a man say this of himself? For if a person says this, he blasphemes, and “God does not hear sinners.” But indeed Christ says that God hears him. He is therefore neither sinner nor mere man. It has also been said, “Vain is the hope in man.” And it is said, “As for us we hope in our God.”Christ is therefore God, not coming from any other substance; “the Father is living, and I live because of the Father,” and, “I am the bread of life; the one who eats this will live for all time.” All the statements signify one substance. And that is why Jesus says that he is from above who says this: “If therefore you will see the Son of man ascending, where was he before?”
