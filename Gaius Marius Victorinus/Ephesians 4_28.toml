Sin does not consist in simply committing sin but persisting in it. If so, there is always a place for repentance. There is a place for correction. So the apostle says: “let the one who has stolen not steal again.” This should be applied not only to stealing but also to all sin. Anyone who has sinned in any way is now called not to sin again.
