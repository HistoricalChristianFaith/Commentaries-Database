Every prayer that we offer up to God is made either in thanks for what we have received or in petition to receive something else. We are encouraged to pray both for ourselves and for those we love. So Paul says, “I make mention of you in my prayer.” “Therefore my chief prayer is first on my account, then on yours.”
