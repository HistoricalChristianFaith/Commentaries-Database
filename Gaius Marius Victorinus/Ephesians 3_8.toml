Was work given before grace? Or did grace come before any works? That which is working is Godâ€™s power. So grace had already been given. When it is said that Paul was made a minister according to the gift of God, we understand that the gift of being a minister was given before his working to make him a minister, and his being a minister is the gift and grace of God.
