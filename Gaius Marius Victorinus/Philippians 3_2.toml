Divine Scripture speaks of dogs which are of use and are defenders of the church, as David teaches in Psalm 68,  saying that these dogs are sated with the blood of enemies in the temple of God. And here he speaks of the opposite kind of dogs, who are obviously the Jews, because they are “workers” and “evil workers.” For works are the sole exercise of their lives, without any knowledge of God, and from their works they hope for salvation.
