“Whatever is true”—What are these true things? They are set out in the gospel: Jesus Christ is the Son of God and all that goes with that good news. When your thoughts are true, it follows that they will be honorable. What is true is not corrupted, which means that it is honorable. What is not corrupted is true. Then what is true and honorable will also be just, for it is made just or justified. And what is made just is pure since it receives sanctification from God. All that is just, honorable, true and pure is lovable and also gracious. For who does not love these saintly virtues? Who does not speak and think well of them?… Of this list some items pertain to true virtue in itself, while the later ones pertain to the fruit of virtue. To virtue it belongs to love truth, honor, justice and purity. To the fruit of virtue belongs that which is lovely and gracious.

In saying “if there be any excellence, any praise,” he takes good note of the nature of things. For all things happen by the grace of God, who governs and rules through the Spirit that he sends into us. We count on nothing of our own, but on grace alone. This is why he speaks conditionally: “if any excellence,” for the virtues being nurtured in us are not from us but from God’s grace. So not even the praise is ours. Therefore he also says “if there is anything worthy of praise.”
