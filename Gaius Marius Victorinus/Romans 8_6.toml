“To set the mind on the Spirit is life.” For error, imprudence and ignorance are impassioned, self-rebellious, self-contradictory. And because of this “to set the mind on the flesh,” which is imprudence, is death, because it does not know God. Therefore, “to set the mind on the Spirit is life and peace.”
