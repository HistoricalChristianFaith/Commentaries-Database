This means that the consequence of having unity in understanding and faith is that they rejoice in the Lord and are always dear to one another. “Rejoice,” he says “in the Lord”—this is too little: “again I say rejoice.” For when you are joined in heart you rejoice in the Lord, and when you rejoice in the Lord you are joined in heart and stand together in the Lord.
