Assuming that this statement is complete and selfcontained and need not be linked to his subsequent words, I think it must be understood as follows: “If there is anything in what I have said that you construe or understand in a different way, I allow your understanding to develop.” Remember that he is speaking of the perfect, for so he says so: “we who are perfect.” … “In due time ‘God will reveal this to you,’ since both what you understand and what I have said are fitting.”
