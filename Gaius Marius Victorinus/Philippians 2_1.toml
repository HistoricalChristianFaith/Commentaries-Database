When we are in the midst of ills and labor under the ills of the world, if we have mutual love for one another, God will be our “consolation in love.” “If, therefore,” he says, “there is this consolation in love, so that, because I love you, you console me in the midst of my ills, make my joy complete.” … He has done well to put [the Spirit] third. For the first is to be called in Christ, the next to have love. But when both are true and they have already been called in Christ and enjoy the consolation of loving and being loved, without doubt the fellowship of the Spirit is there.… The church becomes one body when those who have been called are bound to one another in the love of Christ, when they are bound also in the Spirit and have the same “affection and sympathy.” The affection corresponds to the calling in Christ and the fellowship of the Spirit, the sympathy to the consolation of love.
