Moses says what was said by God: “Let us make man according to our image and likeness.” God says that. He says “let us make” to a co-operator, necessarily to Christ. And he says “according to the image.” Therefore man is not the image of God, but he is “according to the image.” For Jesus alone is the image of God, but man is “according to the image,” that is, image of the image. But he says “according to our image.” Therefore both Father and Son are one image.
