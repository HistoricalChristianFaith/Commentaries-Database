He commends the character of Epaphroditus by calling him “my brother and fellow soldier.” He is a brother in the law and a fellow soldier in the camp and in the work of the gospel. And he is called “your apostle.” Note that he calls Epaphroditus an apostle. Everyone who is sent on account of the gospel can rightly be called an apostle.

Although he has promised to send Timothy rapidly, nevertheless, because he still speaks of a certain delay, he now sends Epaphroditus.
