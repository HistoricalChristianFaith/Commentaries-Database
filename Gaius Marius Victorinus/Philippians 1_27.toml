There is one Spirit that prevails when we believe the gospel wisely and live in accordance with it. This is why he calls them to “stand firm in one Spirit.” The soul’s task is to overcome contrary feelings in the body. Therefore he in effect is calling them to “stand in one Spirit and fight together with one soul with the faith of the gospel.”

The summing up of one’s whole life for a Christian is this, to conduct oneself according to Christ’s gospel, to announce his grace steadily both to oneself and others, to have hope in him, to do all that one does according to his commands. For this is what it means to “conduct oneself in a manner that is worthy of Christ’s gospel.” A person can live honestly and uprightly, but this is not adequate to Paul’s meaning. Rather we are to conduct ourselves according to Christ’s gospel regardless of what happens and to do so in a worthy manner, living according to Christ’s precepts and doing what Christ wants.
