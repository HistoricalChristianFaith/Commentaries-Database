Hence we are to work, and we are to work good and to work it to all so that there is no partiality toward persons. We are to do nothing except do good and good to all. For indeed if love edifies and every person is beloved, then every good that we work we ought to work on behalf of all…. However, he makes the distinction that the good that we work on behalf of all is to be worked most of all on behalf of the household of faith, that is, those who have come to believing trust in Christ and God. He comes to the climax of his argument in urging this. It was particularly germane to the Galatians. For they, by making certain additions to faith from Judaism, were not acting out of faith. They believed that they would gain fruit from works and mere ritual observance. Therefore he adds, “Let us above all do good to the household of faith, because they have adopted faith in the gospel only, that is, in Christ and God.” .

He gives the strongest possible imperative to well doing: time is short. Life is quickly reaching its term. The end of the world is at hand. “As we have opportunity” means either while we have our own life or while there is life in this world. .
