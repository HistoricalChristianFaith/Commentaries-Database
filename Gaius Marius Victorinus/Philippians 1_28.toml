This work of fearlessness is part of his explanation of what it means to conduct oneself worthily according to Christ’s gospel: Never be terrified, whether by adversaries or anything else.… For this very condition of being courageous tends toward our salvation. It deals a death blow to our adversaries. Yet this too is a work of God, lest we should think it part of our own work that our not being terrified should be a cause of our salvation. “For this too is of God,” he says, “just as I have often told you that all things come about through the will, the mercy and the grace of God.”
