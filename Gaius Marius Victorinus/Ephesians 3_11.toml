From this we see what it means to say that the mystery was concealed in God, for he adds “according to the purpose of the ages.” This means that, after certain ages had reached their destined end, the mystery was to appear through the presence of the Lord in whom it had been concealed. For it was proper for it to be revealed through the One in whom it was concealed. .
