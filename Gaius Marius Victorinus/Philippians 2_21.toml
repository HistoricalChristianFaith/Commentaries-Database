To the charge being given to Timothy as one “who is faithfully anxious on your behalf” he adds this explanation: The others “seek after their own interests”; that is, they are anxious to protect and keep what is theirs and in this are not Christians. For what is it to be a Christian? To seek rather in every companion and brother that which is Christ’s.
