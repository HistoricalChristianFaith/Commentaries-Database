Everywhere Paul reminds us that we receive God’s gifts not by our own merit but by grace. Grace belongs to the giver, not to the recipient. And by adding “according to the working of his power,” he also ascribes this to God, so that “if I do any work, it is God’s power. For it is not my power that works in me but God’s.”
