There is a gift of God the Father, a gift of the Son and also a gift of the Holy Spirit. Concerning the Father the apostle says, “By grace you are saved through faith. And this is not from you, but it is the gift of God.” About the Son, in Solomon, “Because no one can be continent without the gift of God, and it was precisely intelligence to know from whom this gift comes.” The Holy Spirit, in Acts, “Repent, and each of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ, for the remission of your sins. Then you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.”
