The Father is good, the Son is good, the Holy Spirit is good. About the Father it is written in Psalm 72, “How good is the God of Israel toward those who are pure of heart!” About the Son, “I am the good shepherd” and “Good Teacher, what good must I do to gain eternal life?” About the Holy Spirit, in Ezra, “You bestowed on them your good Spirit.”
