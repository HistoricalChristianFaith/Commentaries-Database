Question: If you would say that the Son made what was made by command of the Father. Response: It is not as you claim, that the Son made what was made under the Father’s orders. Rather, by his will he created everything that he deemed in his providence should be created, since the prophet Isaiah says, “Thus says the Lord, ‘I made the earth by my word, and on it I created human beings. With my hand I spread out the heavens, giving order to all their ranks, that they might shine in the sky.’ ” And, “My plan shall stand as valid, and I have fulfilled my entire purpose.” And still, “Thus says the Lord, who created the heavens and the earth. He made it and rendered it stable.” And further, “I am the first, and I am eternal. My hand laid the foundations of the earth, my right hand spread the heavens.” And still, “I made the earth with great power and with a mighty arm.” And in Jeremiah, “He formed the earth by his power; he established the world with his wisdom; with his intelligence he spread the heavens and made the waters in heaven roar.” And further, “Lord, you made the heaven and the earth with great power and a strong arm. You make their children after them suffer the punishment for the iniquity of their ancestors.” And in Solomon, “It was not difficult for your almighty hand, which created the world from invisible matter.” And in Psalm 134, “Everything he wanted, the Lord has done, in heaven and on earth, in the seas and in the abyss.” And in Psalm 113, “Our God is in the heavens.” And again, “In heaven and on earth he made all that he willed.” And in Psalm 64, “You make the mountains firm by your strength, robed in power.” Since it is written that he did all these things, not under the command of the Father but by his power, how is it that you consider him to be inferior to the Father?
