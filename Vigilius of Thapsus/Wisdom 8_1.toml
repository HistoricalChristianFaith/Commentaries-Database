The Father is everywhere, the Son everywhere, the Holy Spirit everywhere. About the Father it is said in Jeremiah, “The Word of the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, ‘Do not I fill the heavens and the earth?’ ” and in Isaiah, “The heavens are my throne, the earth the footstool for my feet.” About the Son, in Solomon, “Against wisdom wickedness cannot prevail. She reaches mightily from one end of the earth to the other.” And in Psalm 102, “In every place of his domain.” The Holy Spirit, in the psalm, “Where can I go from your spirit, where can I flee from your presence? If I descend to the netherworld, you are there,” etc.
