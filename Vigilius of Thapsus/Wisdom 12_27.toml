And if they were to repeat what the Son said? “Those who know you, the one true God, and the one whom you have sent, Jesus Christ.” Response: That the Son is true, just as the Father is, we demonstrate with the words of the prophets and the Gospels, since Isaiah says, “But my servants will be called by another name, which will be blessed on the earth, and they will bless the true God. And those who swear on earth will swear by the true God.” And in Solomon, “They will be ashamed of those who believed that it was the gods who punished them. Seeing him whom they had previously denied, they recognized the true God.” And in the psalm, “Truth sprung up from the earth, and justice looked down from heaven.” And the Lord in the Gospel, “I am the way, the truth and the life.” And in the same place, written of the Father, “Your word is truth.” Then in the letter of John the apostle, “We know that the Son of God has come, and God has given us understanding to know what is true, and so that we would be in his true Son, Jesus Christ. He is the true God and eternal life.” You must therefore acknowledge the unity of the Father and the Son, since the divine Scripture never fails to proclaim that, like the Father, the Son is true God.
