Question: Someone might say that the Son cannot, in a strict sense, see the Father, because it is written, “No one has ever seen God.”Response: Let us now return to the origin of the source, by which we are taught, through the writings of both the Old and New Testaments, that the Son has always been able to see the Father, since Solomon says, “With you is wisdom, who knows your works, who was present when you created the world. She knows what is pleasing in your eyes.” And the Lord, in the Gospel, said, “No one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son and the one to whom the Son wishes to reveal him.” And further, “No one has ever seen God; only the only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, has revealed him.” And to the Jews he says further, “You do not know him. I, however, know him. And if I were to say that I do not know him, I would be like you, a liar.” And in the same passage, “The one who is from God listens to the words of God.” And still, “I know him, because I come from him.” Therefore, we have taught that the Son always sees the Father. How is it that you hold that he cannot see him?
