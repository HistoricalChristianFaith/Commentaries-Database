The Father tests us, the Son tests us, the Holy Spirit tests us. He says of the Father to the Thessalonians, “Thus we preach, not seeking to please human beings but God, who tests our hearts.” Solomon says of the Son, “He tried them like gold in the crucible and found them worthy of himself.” Of the Holy Spirit, Solomon says, “He who tests hearts is the Spirit of the Lord,” and he will wipe out the wicked from the earth.
