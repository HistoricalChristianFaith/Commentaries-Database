The Father renews, the Son renews, and the Holy Spirit does the same. About the Father, we read in Jeremiah, “Make us return to you, Lord, and we will return. Renew our days as of old.” About the Son, in Solomon, “She reaches mightily from one end to the other and governs all things well.” And also, “Though one, she renews all things.” The Holy Spirit, in the letter to the Romans, “But now we are discharged from the law, dead to that which held us captive, so that we serve not under the old written code but in the new life of the Spirit.”
