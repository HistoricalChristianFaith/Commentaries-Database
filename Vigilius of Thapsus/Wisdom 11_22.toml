Who can hide or flee before the unique divinity of the Trinity? To the Trinity, the entire globe of the earth seems as a raindrop, or a bit of foam or a drop of morning dew that descends from heaven. As it is written, "He sits above the vault of the earth, from where its inhabitants seem like grasshoppers." And, "He has measured the waters in the hollow of his hand and held the whole earth in his palm." And further, "The heavens are my throne, the earth the footstool for my feet." Notice that the power of the one divinity is incomprehensible, since the heavens, which he holds in his palm, are also his throne, and the earth, which is enclosed in his fist, is in turn the footstool for his feet. In fact, the whole of the heavens is contained in his palm, and the entire earth is enclosed in his hand. It is also the throne and footstool for his feet, as it is written, "To whom the whole world is like dust on the scales." And thus he fills all things, containing all things from within and without, since this eternal, undivided Trinity is present everywhere and possesses the invisible fullness of the divinity. - "On the Trinity 5"
