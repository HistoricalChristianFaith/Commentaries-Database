The Father reigns, the Son reigns, the Holy Spirit reigns. Of the Father the Gospel says, “If one is not reborn of water and the Holy Spirit, he cannot see the kingdom of God.” Of the Son it is said, “Say to the peoples, ‘The Lord reigned from the wood.’ ” In Solomon it is said of the Holy Spirit, “Your sovereignty comes from the Holy Spirit.” And then, “Though you are ministers of his kingdom, you have not judged rightly.”
