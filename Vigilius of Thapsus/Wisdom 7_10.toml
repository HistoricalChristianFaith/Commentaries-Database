The Son was in the bosom of the Father from the beginning, and from the Father’s heart he has poured forth a good word. And how can one fail to believe that he who is in the Father’s heart, together with him, dwells in inaccessible light? Could the Father have remained in the Son without light or rest without light in the tabernacle of the Son, given that the Son is the radiance of the eternal light20 and the spotless mirror of the divinity? Solomon says to have preferred this light to his health, wanting always to delight in its beauty. Does he not say, “I loved her more than health and beauty, I preferred the possession of her to light itself, because the splendor that comes from her never sets”? For this reason, having desired this light, in his distress the prophet David proclaimed, “Send forth your light and your truth.” And also, “In your light we see light.” In the splendor of this light the Son anticipated his manifestation on the mountain to the three disciples. They prostrated themselves, deathly afraid, convinced that their lives were about to end. In fact, the Son proclaimed this light by showing it in himself, admonishing his disciples that they should walk in it: “Walk while you have the light.” And further, “I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will not walk in darkness but will have the light of life.” And the Evangelist also says, “He was the true light, which enlightens every person who comes into this world.” If it has been shown that this light that is promised to the faithful is in the Son and is eternal along with him who is eternal, how is it that you separate the Son from the Father’s inaccessible light?
