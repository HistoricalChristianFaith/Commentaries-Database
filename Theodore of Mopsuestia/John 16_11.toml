So awesome is the descent of the Spirit—because it is so great and powerful—that through its coming down on men and women the “sin” appears of those who made attempts on my life. They planned to kill him who was worthy of such honor and greatness, as the gift of the Spirit among those who believe in me, will clearly show. Also my “righteousness” will be known, which I preached among them with works and words and with great righteousness and performed with equity. From all this, in addition, it will become evident that the divine plan concerning my passion was not useless and vain. Its purpose was to condemn Satan. Indeed, when through the power of the gift of the Spirit ill people are healed, dead people resurrected, demons exorcised, then through all these works the condemnation of Satan will appear. If I did evil actions or taught false doctrine, I would receive a just punishment according to my actions. And especially after my death I would be despised. And my disciples would also necessarily share with me the same contempt. But when the presence of the Spirit, with the accomplishment of miracles, shows the contrary, when it places my disciples also in great glory, then the condemnation of Satan will appear and the manifestation of my glory will be evident, whereas the sin of my enemies will be condemned. He referred all these actions to the Spirit in order to reveal its nature and power through the things that it does.
