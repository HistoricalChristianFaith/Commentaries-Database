Among all the words said so far, especially here, he clearly shows that he talks about their likeness. Indeed, in the same way, by turning the speech to the Father and him, he reveals the perfect likeness of their nature, so that, as the Father lives in him, and he in the Father, a perfect likeness can be shown in each of them. Then he proves and confirms his words by saying, “The words that I say to you I do not speak on my own.” If you do not believe, he says, in these words, know that so perfect is the conformity of nature, ideas, and virtue that there is no difference in the words either. Whatever I say is in common, and do not only speak on my own. The Father who dwells in me does his works. It would have been opportune to add, “My Father speaks through the words: I do not speak.” But he had said above, “The words that I say,” and here, “The Father does his works,” in order to show that the nature is common, the words are common and the works are common as well. From this it is evident that through the words, “I do not speak on my own,” he does not signify an inferior state, but a perfect communion and an inseparable union. And this appears especially from the context.
