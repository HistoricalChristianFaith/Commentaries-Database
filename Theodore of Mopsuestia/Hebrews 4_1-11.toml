It was fitting for them to be afraid, he says so that they might not be found lacking because of the depravity of their opinion, when they themselves had received the promise of access into the rest. For let no one suppose that the promise of the things to come are sufficient for him, just as it was not sufficient for them. For they were not joined to the things promised in accordance with faith. Therefore, one ought to read as follows, “They did not attach themselves in faith to the things that they heard,” namely, the promises that were made to them from God through Moses.

We ought to be afraid … lest we, too, who have received the promise of the entrance into the rest, may be found lacking through a wickedness of purpose. For let no one think that the promise of things to come suffices him any more than it did them. Indeed, they did not understand in faith what had been promised.

This is the work of true “rest,” namely, not having to run again to the old things, while enduring transition and change. For just as God is said to rest from his creation of the world, having completed its foundation, so it is fitting that also the one who has entered “into rest” not run back again to the old things, viewing with contempt the labors required by the law’s virtuous ordinances to restrain transgression. For out of necessity change and a removal from the old institution follows these things.

“Today” is neither an indefinite period of time, nor can it be predicated of an interval outside of “days” as if “today” were joined with each day. This should be stated not only for the sake of apostolic perspicuity but also for the sake of those who wish to understand, in the matter of the origin of the Only Begotten, the “I have begotten you today” by flatly asserting that the “today” is an indefinite period of time. They cannot perceive that if this were the case one would not be able to speak of a “today” since there was then not yet a day. The apostle has made clear that he would not say that “today” is an indefinite period of time when he said, “Again speaking in David he marks off a day.” Also in another passage, “Comfort them every day until it will be called ‘the Day.’ ” First he showed that the “today” is not being spoken of outside of “days,” by his saying “every day,” and so appending “until it will be called ‘the Day.’ ” Then in the matter of the “day” it does not appear as if he were talking about an indefinite period of time which might be applied both to the time that has already passed and the time that is about to come. For what does he say? Deeming “each day” to be “the Day” which is spoken to we should give heed to remaining in the faith. For as “the Day” indicates the present day, he advises them to make full use of the day for that which is useful for exhortation.
