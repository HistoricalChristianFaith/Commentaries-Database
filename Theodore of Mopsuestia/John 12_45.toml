[In verse 44], he said, “Whoever believes in me believes not in me but in him who sent me.” He said this because they allege they were prosecuting him in order to avenge God. And so he says in effect, “I refer you to [the Father] because, you see, the one who believes in me is the one who comes to know the Father fully through me.” That is why he said what he did there. On the other hand, “whoever sees me sees him who sent me” seems to contradict what had just been said. The statement in [verse 44] shows the difference between Father and Son, while [verse 45] shows their perfect similarity. Because the first statement showed such great humility, however, he logically concluded the second in order to declare his similarity with the Father. Both statements, however, show that he never stood far apart from the Father. The first he said for the unbelievers. The second was to indicate how precise his likeness was to the Father’s.
