Even if he [the Word] gave a certain exceptional cooperation to the one who was assumed, this does not mean that the divinity took the place of the mind. If the divinity did take the place of his mind in the assumed man, as you say, how is it that he felt fear in his passion? Why did he need strong prayers in the face of necessity, the strong prayers that he offered to God with a loud voice and many tears, according to blessed Paul? TREATISES AGAINST APOLLINARIS 3.4.HE WAS OFTEN SAD. CHRYSOSTOM. Our affairs, both our business and our politeness, are turned into laughing; there is nothing steady, nothing grave. I do not say these things only to people of the world, but I know those whom I am hinting at. For the church has been filled with laughter. Whatever clever thing one may say, immediately there is laughter among those present, and the marvelous thing is that many do not leave off laughing even during the very time of the prayer.
Everywhere the devil leads the dance; he has entered into all and is master of all. Christ is dishonored, is thrust aside; the church is made no account of. Do you not hear Paul saying, “Let there be no filthiness, nor silly talk, nor levity”? He places “levity” along with “filthiness,” and do you laugh? What is “silly talk”? That which has nothing profitable. And do you, solitary one, laugh at all and relax your countenance? You that are crucified, you that are a mourner, tell me, do you laugh? Where do you hear of Christ doing this? Nowhere, but that he was sad, indeed oftentimes. For even when he looked on Jerusalem, he wept; and when he thought on the traitor, he was troubled; and when he was about to raise Lazarus, he wept; and do you laugh? If he who grieves not over the sins of others deserves to be accused, of what consideration will he be worthy who is without sorrow for his own sins and even laughs at them? This is the season of grief and tribulation, of bruising and of conflicts, and do you laugh? Do you not see how Sarah was rebuked? Do you not hear Christ saying, “Woe to you that laugh now, for you shall weep”? You chant these things every day, for, tell me, what do you say? “I have laughed”? By no means; but what? “I am weary with my moaning.”
But perhaps there are some persons so dissolute and silly as even during this very rebuke to laugh, because we discourse thus about laughter. For, indeed, such is their derangement, such their madness, that it does not feel the rebuke.
