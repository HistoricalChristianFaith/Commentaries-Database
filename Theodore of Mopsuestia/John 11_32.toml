As Mary came to Jesus, she immediately fell at his feet saying the same things as Martha, “Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.” Martha is not actually said to have fallen at his feet but only to have come to him, so that it seems to many that Mary had a greater love for the Lord. This also appears from the fact that, while the Lord was at their house, Martha was intent on her service, whereas Mary, because of her great love, sat at his feet, as she did not want to be separated from her teacher even for a short time. Therefore the Lord exalted her in his praise more than Martha.
