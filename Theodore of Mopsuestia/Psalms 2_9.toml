Are not, therefore, those words that were spoken by blessed David appropriately applied to the Lord whose kingdom extends to the farthest outposts of the earth and the whole world? [It is he] who, like the rod, threatens and punishes the broken condition of the nations and of the Jews, not in order to destroy them but in order to bring them back together and reshape them, as when the old man is put off and the new man takes his place through the sacrament of baptism. David really said this: “just like a pot of clay you will break them,” showing the parallel, since by their contrition there had been no destruction, but a renewal was about to follow. This is likened to the intention of every potter: that the vases, if they do not follow the will and hand of the one making them, while they are yet new and not hardened by the kiln, the potter breaks them and puts them back on the wheel to be re-formed.
