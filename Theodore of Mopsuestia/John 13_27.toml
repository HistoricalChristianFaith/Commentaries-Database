What Judas believed to be hidden and turning around in his mind was disclosed through the handing of the bread and made known to all the disciples. He was so far away from the admirable virtue of the one who knows the inner thoughts that, even though he had to feel ashamed and blush because of that public rebuke, he on the contrary confirmed even more inside himself the will of his iniquity. And since he was offended by the blame [he received], he prepared to execute his crime at once. The Evangelist rightly called this thought the entry of Satan by attributing to Satan the confirmation of Judasâ€™s will.
