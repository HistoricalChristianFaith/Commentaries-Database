Since they were about to object to the words pronounced by our Lord about himself: “Your words are not true, nor worthy to be accepted, because you bear testimony about yourself”—since in their argument with him they were about to put forward this objection, our Lord forestalled them by saying, “You must not accept me as true, because I bear testimony to myself: this is what you undoubtedly mean. But you would have the right to say such a thing if I were the only one to bear testimony about myself. But now someone else said other things that were similar to my words about me, and he was a very trustworthy witness.”
