This differs not at all in its import from the phrase “Word of the Lord.” Scripture calls God’s activity “Word of the Lord” in reference to the spiritual grace by which the prophets received the revelations of the future. In the same way by “vision” he refers to the divine revelation by which in fact they received the knowledge of the unknown. They also received some insights in ineffable fashion through spiritual activity in their own soul. In response to the activity occurring within them from the Holy Spirit, they obeyed the word of instruction as though from someone speaking. Consequently Scripture calls it both “vision” and “Word of the Lord,” and probably also “report” in that they receive knowledge as though by a report of some kind.
