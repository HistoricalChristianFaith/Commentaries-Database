When Satan, he says, speaks lies and similar words, he does not use those of others but his own. He is the father of falsehood because he generated it and was the first to use it by speaking to Adam when he substituted certain words in place of others. The expression “He is a liar and the father of it” signifies that he is a liar and the father of lies. In other words, the devil not only generated lies. He was also the first to introduce them and to use them.
