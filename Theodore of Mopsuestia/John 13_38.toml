This is not contrary to what is said in Mark. For he said, “The rooster will not crow twice before you will deny me three times.” You see, as soon as he denied him, the rooster crowed. And as he denied for a third time, the rooster crowed for a second time, in some way bearing witness to the truthfulness of the Lord, as well as reminding Peter both what he said to the Lord and what he heard from him. Therefore, when he denied at first, by the will of the Lord the bird uttered a sound out of its proper time. But when he denied for the third time, then it crowed at the appointed time. However Mark, dictating the Gospel according to Peter’s view, also said how many times the bird crowed during the denial, as if he wanted to establish more clearly the reproach of Peter by his own sin.
