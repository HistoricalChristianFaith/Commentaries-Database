Jesus promoted Peter and placed him as the head of the lambs of his herd and said, “Feed my lambs,” that is, all those who believe in me and who, because they were instructed only recently, are weaker. And for this reason, it is necessary that you carry their burden, and protect them, and comfort them in their weakness and nourish them with the grace that was given to you.
