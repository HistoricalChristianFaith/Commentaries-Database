Since they were openly rebuking him for exalting himself over Abraham and the prophets and since they accuse him by saying, “Who do you make yourself out to be?”—he in effect responds by saying: … If I spoke about my glory and the things that belong to me, you would not believe me—and with good reason, because I would be testifying about myself. But it is my Father who revealed my glory by testifying about me, as he said above, “The Father who sent me testifies on my behalf.” You then say you belong to God, but you do not know him; you are not even familiar with him because you do not obey his words. “I do know him,” and what I do matches perfectly with his testimony about me. Even if I say something pleasing about myself, I say nothing contrary to the previous testimony of the Father about me. This is what he means when he says, “And I keep his word. If I would say that I do not know him, I would be a liar like you.”
