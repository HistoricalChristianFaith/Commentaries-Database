Some commentators thought that here blessed David means that he individually formed people’s souls apart from their body, as though “hearts” meant “souls.” Whether this is so or not (it is a topic requiring fuller treatment), here it does not have that sense. Rather, “their hearts” means “them,” referring to the whole from the part. So “he forms them individually” means that none of humankind was in existence, as if to say, when they did not exist, he produced them.

Nothing done by human beings can escape [God’s] attention, since he is the creator of the thoughts’ inner chamber, namely, the heart. In fact, this was the meaning, completely consistent with what went before: Blessed are you who are devoted to him who conducts an examination of everything that is done; instead of anything escaping his notice, he has a precise knowledge of everything.
