In order to increase the miracle before their eyes, he walked on the water and did not get into the boat. But the Evangelist says, “Then they wanted to take him into the boat, and immediately the boat reached the land toward which they were going.” He records this in order to demonstrate that they did not take him but that, while they tried to bring him in, both the boat and the Lord reached land at an awesome speed. They could not doubt what the Lord had done or consider him a ghost when they saw that the boat had reached the land toward which they were going at such a speed, coupled with the fact that the Lord was with them.
