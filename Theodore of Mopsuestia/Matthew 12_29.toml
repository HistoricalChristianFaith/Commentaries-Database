Jesus here compares the earth with a house and human beings with vessels or possessions. Human beings have become possessions of demons and of the devil, having by evil means been brought under his authority. Thus it was impossible for the demonsâ€™ own possessions to be taken away unless the demons were first weakened and bound with chains.
