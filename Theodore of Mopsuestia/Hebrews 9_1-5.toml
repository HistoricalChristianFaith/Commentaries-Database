He begins to say how there were symbols in the law and the types of things in the era of grace and how it was possible to see clearly the things of the new covenant glimpsed beforehand in the things of the old covenant, even as he shows in comparison what sort of preeminence the new covenant things have over those of the old covenant. He makes this the beginning of the exposition of his teaching. Then he says that also the first testament had bounds and commandments of ritual that were obligated to be offered to God. The phrase “regulations for worship” refers to the commandments concerning these things.“And an earthly sanctuary.” Most likely he calls the temple “the sanctuary” because the liturgy is rendered in it to God, or also he calls the tabernacle “the sanctuary,” since they had this in service before the temple. For in a similar manner he called the tabernacle “the temple,” inasmuch as God happened to be present in it, while the later temple was built by Solomon. “And Samuel sat in the temple of the Lord where the ark of God was,” although the temple had not yet been built by Solomon. And just as when God commanded Moses to erect the tabernacle as a symbol of the world according to a certain plan, God ordered him to make an enclosure out of curtains that would divide the middle from the rest, so also the temple was made according to the same plan.
