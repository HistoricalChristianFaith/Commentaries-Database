At once his disciples, who were present, after hearing his words, left John and hurried to go to Jesus about whom John testified. “When Jesus turned and saw them following, he said to them, ‘What are you looking for?’ ” He did not say this out of ignorance but rather in order to give them an occasion to trust him. They immediately called him “Rabbi” and showed their profound intention, that is, that they had been led to Jesus for no other reason but the desire to obey him as a teacher. And at the same time they asked him where he lived, as if they wanted to come to him often. He did not point out a house but told them to come along with him and see, by giving them the space for greater familiarity and trust toward him.
