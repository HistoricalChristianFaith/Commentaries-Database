Many who had come up from the country to Jerusalem in order to purify themselves according to the precepts of the Law before the Passover … gathered together in the temple and discussed among themselves whether the Lord would come out of respect for the festival or would avoid coming in order to protect himself from the ambushes of his enemies. These were the words of those who desired to see him. With good reason the crowd was close to him because of the miracles he had performed.
