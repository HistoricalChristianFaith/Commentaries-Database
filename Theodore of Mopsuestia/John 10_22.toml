This means the dedication of Jerusalem itself—not because the city was established at that time, but because the city had been destroyed often by the enemies. In the end it was devastated by Antiochus, and after the enemies had been driven away by the Maccabees, the city regained its ancient appearance with the help of God. And so, every year they celebrated the day in which they had won, in memory of the victory obtained beyond any hope; and they called it the “Enkainia” of Jerusalem. Then, since all people had gathered on that day of celebration, Jesus walked in the temple, in the portico named after Solomon.
