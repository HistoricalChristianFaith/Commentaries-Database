Even though there are many deceivers, [Jesus says], “No one will snatch them out of my hand.” It is impossible—even in the face of ten thousand enemies—that someone stronger than me may snatch them from my hands. And this is the difference between you and my [followers]: you do not believe after you heard my words and saw my miracles, while they, even though they may suffer ten thousand afflictions, will never recede from my presence. For this reason they will receive the reward due to their good will, namely, eternal life, because, he said, “No one will snatch them out of my hand,” that is, they cannot separate them from me.
