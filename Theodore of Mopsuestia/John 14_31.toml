Great and powerful things will happen to me in the course of my passion. Similar things will happen to those who believe in me after my passion. They will cast out demons with a mere word, heal the sick, perform numerous signs, command the removal of all human tribulations through my name. Any number of different punishments will befall sinners. From all these things it will be clear that I was unjustly executed. But because of my love for the Father I accomplish his [primordial] will that all would be saved. The defeat of death that I will justly accomplish through the intervention of the omnipotent one will be the destiny for all humanity by grace.
