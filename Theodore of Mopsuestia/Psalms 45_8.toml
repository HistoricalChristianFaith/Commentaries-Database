In his wish to imply both the passion and the glory of the passion he says “myrrh, resin, and cassia from your garments,” suggesting by “myrrh” the passion, and by mention of “resin and cassia” implying the fragrance and splendor of the passion, as if to say, Even the passion itself, which affects your temple, will be accompanied by great fragrance and glory, with the result that the fragrance from it will spread to the whole world, as the apostle also says: “We are the fragrance of Christ among those who are being saved and among those who are perishing.” Now, he did well to mention “myrrh” and associate it with the phrase “from your garments” for us to understand the divinity to be free of suffering.
