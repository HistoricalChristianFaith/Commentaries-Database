When Jesus says “hell,” he is emphasizing that punishment there is eternal. By “hell” he means the condemnation awaiting those who receive recompense according to their life.His choice of words shows that there is a great difference between the two things. He first says “kill” but next says “destroy,” and from destruction there is no longer any salvation.
