Then, he says, from these facts only you will learn that what I said to you was true about which you now have your doubts. I said, “I am in my Father” concerning the equality of nature and the inseparable connection when I will appear so. And I said “you are in me” concerning your faith and love for me when you will be made a participant with me in charity and also in the gift of the Spirit. “And I in you” is said with reference to what the close connection will cause when, after being regenerated by the power of the Spirit, you are with me in the body and I am with you in the head.
