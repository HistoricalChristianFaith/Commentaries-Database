How is it new? “Just as I have loved you, you also should love one another.” The way to love is what is new. In the Law it had been ordered that anyone should love his neighbor like himself. But the voice of the Lord wants our companions in faith to be loved even more than ourselves, because he orders us to imitate his love for us. In the words that follow he shows that accurately. Indeed, in order to amplify the greatness of this precept he says, “By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another.” So excellent is the observation of that command that it is a sign clear enough of my discipleship.
