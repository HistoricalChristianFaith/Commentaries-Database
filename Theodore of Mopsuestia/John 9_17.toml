While they were discussing things, they turned to the blind man again, as if they chose him as their arbiter, and they said to him, “What do you say about him? It was your eyes he opened.” Should we admire him for the work he performed? Or is he a sinner because he violated the sabbath? So about the one “who opened your eyes,” that is, since he opened your eyes, what do you have to say about him? What is your opinion? The blind man wisely answered the question, saying, “He is a prophet,” that is, that is the kind of respect I have for him, and it encapsulates what I think of the work he performed. When they saw that the miracle itself already testified to the power of the healer and that the blind man openly revealed the grace he had received and proclaimed the greatness of his helper, they began to doubt whether that man who had been healed was really the blind man or someone else. And so they were obliged to call his parents.
