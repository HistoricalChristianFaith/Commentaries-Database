Not only do sinners meet such a fate, but also those hostile to the righteous will fall foul of troubles. Now, he says this to bring out the extent of the providence that God shows for the righteous. “Will come to grief” means that they will stumble, will trip up, will fail in their hostile intent against the righteous by being punished by God; “come to grief” meaning “missing the mark,” which means failing to achieve a purpose and intent at odds with that prescribed—hence our calling a wrong action a sin as being at odds with the proper intention.
