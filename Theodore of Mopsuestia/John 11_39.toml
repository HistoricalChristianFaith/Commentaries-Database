“Lord, already there is a stench because he has been dead four days.” These words were spoken by the woman who doubted, but they also referred to the greatness of the miracle to be performed. Indeed, the more they knew that his body was putrefying and was in a state of mutation according to nature, the more the miracle to be performed for Lazarus appeared to be extraordinary. So the Lord by reproving her said, “Did I not tell you that if you believed, you would see the glory of God?” From this it is evident that she was not free from doubts even when she had said the words mentioned above and seemed to assent to and believe them.
