Jesus is a man. For “what is man that you are mindful of him?” Yet the apostle asserts that this passage refers to Jesus, for he says, “We see him who was made a little lower than the angels, Jesus.” What then do we conclude? The man Jesus was like all humans and differed in no way from those whose nature he shares, save that to him a grace was given. The grace that was given does not change his nature. But after death was destroyed, “God gave him the name which is above every name.” The one who gave is God. The one to whom it was given is the man Jesus Christ, the first fruits of those who are raised. For he is the “firstborn from the dead.” Therefore, he ascended and sits at the right hand of the Father and is above all.

Some suffer something very laughable here, changing “without God” and making it to read “by the grace of God,” not following the Scripture’s train of thought. Owing to their failure to understand that he once said, “without God,” they erase it to no profit and put in what seems satisfactory to their opinion. Yet what notion would be suggested by Paul inserting “by the grace of God”? And what train of thought would lead him to this? For it is not his custom to append “by the grace of God” capriciously, but always there is some logical train of thought involved. For example, he talks about grace when he, talking about his experience, adds, “by the grace of God I am what I am.” Or when it is his task to speak concerning God’s love for humankind and that God has done all things, even though we are not worthy to obtain them, as is contained in his statement, “By grace you have been saved,” … he appends, “And this not of your own doing, it is the gift of God, not because of works, lest any one should boast.” Clearly he shows through this, that he is speaking concerning the grace of God, which he showed on behalf of all people. But in Hebrews Paul is discussing what is being set forth by him concerning Christ, what sort of person he is and how he differs from the angels (the starting point of his discussion), and in what respect he seems to be lower than them because of his death. What need was there then for him to say, “by the grace of God”? It is out of place for him to speak concerning his goodness concerning us.Instead, the line of argument shows this to be the case when he says, “without God he tasted death,” since his divinity was not hindered in this respect, and therefore he showed a diminution “for a short time” from his usual state. He appears also here to share the honor because of his connection with the other nature. It is most natural that those who have heard these things would think that the indwelling of the Word of God would be spectacular at the time of his suffering, even though this does not correspond with the things that have been set forth. Yet “without” God he tasted the trial of death, he adds, “For it was fitting for him, on whose account all things exist and through whom all things exist, having led many sons into glory while he was the originator of their salvation to be made perfect through suffering.” It is not that his divinity was not a contributor, he says. For the usual things “were fitting.” … For, let me tell you, the fact of suffering in no way was appropriate for it. But clearly this “it was fitting” confirms the notion of “without God.” For although it was not fitting, Paul himself says that it is fitting, showing at the same time also what sort of things he once did, and what they were. “For it was fitting for him, because of whom and through whom all things exist.” Quite clearly he is speaking about the divine Word, inasmuch as he shared with many his sonship and led them into this glory. He is the “originator” of everybody’s “salvation,” our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, the one who is said flatly to have been accepted as a perfect man through his sufferings, so that also Christ’s nature and God’s grace might be made manifest.

In this account of the sonship, the apostle appears to include the man who was assumed with the “many,” not because, like them, he received the sonship by grace, since the Godhead alone possesses the sonship by nature.
