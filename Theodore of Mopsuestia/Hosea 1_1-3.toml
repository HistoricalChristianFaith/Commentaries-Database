By the law the prophet was allowed to take a woman into the marriage relationship, and on marrying her he probably brought her to chaste ways. In fact, while everyone could not but be surprised that a man who was very conscious of propriety should pass over women who enjoyed a good reputation and choose to take a prostitute into the marriage relationship, the novelty of the event provided the prophet with the occasion of telling them their duty. In addition [Hosea’s marriage demonstrated] the greater marvel of God’s condescending to choose such ungrateful people for special attention by the powerful example—namely, the remarkable prophet’s doing his duty by entering into association with a prostitute.
