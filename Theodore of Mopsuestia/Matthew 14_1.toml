Herod the king is one person, Herod the tetrarch, his son, is another. After King Herodâ€™s death the Romans divided his kingdom into a tetrarchy, and one part of the tetrarchy went to his son. This is the man who beheaded the Forerunner and who, for this reason, received his due punishment not long afterward.
