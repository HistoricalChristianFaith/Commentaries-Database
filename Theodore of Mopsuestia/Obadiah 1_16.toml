For the time when God will punish everyone who did evil against Israel is at hand. And he will impose grave punishment upon you just like the punishment you meted out against your brothers. “For as you drank on my holy mountain, so all the people will drink wine; they will drink and ascend and likewise become nothing.” Because you inveighed against my holy mountain and its inhabitants, you will not escape punishment. Your thoughts and your participation indeed will mean punishment for you and your murderous, traitorous allies. In the end, there will be no difference between them and nonexistence. Already the words “you have drunk” and “they will drink” signify an observation in Edom that other enemies will be produced. For “in the hand of the Lord there is a cup, and it is fully mixed. And he has brought this cup down and will pour it out. Surely all the wicked of the earth shall drain it to the last drop and drink even the dregs.” But he remembered his holy mountain, recognizing the accusations of those outside against its inhabitants. Those accusers will be exposed to punishment as well as those who conspired with them, and they shall be punished with the death penalty.In Zion, however, there will be salvation and holiness. Jacob will possess those who possessed him. To you, O Edom, therefore, and to your council of allies this will happen. But Judah will be safe and sound. Indeed there will be no adversity on Mount Zion, because they will no longer seek after wars so that my mountain will be seen as a secure place for the saints. Everyone who was so much trouble to you, Jacob, and those who plotted against you will truly be subjugated.
