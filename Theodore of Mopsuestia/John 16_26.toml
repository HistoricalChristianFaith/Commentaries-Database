Knowing that the Son is consubstantial with the Father, they would, therefore, petition from the Son what he was asking from the Father. By saying, “I do not ask,” he indicated that he is God, able also to give “whatever you may ask,” without petitioning the Father. You see, when he said above, “And I will ask the Father and he will give you another Paraclete,” he spoke as a human, according to the divine plan. After all, why would he ask for that which the Father already intended?
