By “wrath” he refers to punishment and retribution, by “wrath” the divine Scripture meaning not only the initial response but also lasting anger. So by “wrath” he refers to the awful process of vengeance, and by “anger” the effect it rightly has on sinners, the terms being interchanged as usual.… He takes vengeance when angered and is beneficent by purpose and intention.
