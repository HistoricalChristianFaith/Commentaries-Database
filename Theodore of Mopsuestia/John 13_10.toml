Simon did not want his teacher to wash his feet. The purpose of our Lord’s action was … to teach you that you should deeply love and eagerly help one another. Peter did not know that that was the purpose of his action. So again our Lord said to him who was still resisting, “Unless I wash you, you have no share with me.” Since from these words Peter believed that this washing of the feet was in place of baptism, and that from it he would have obtained his share with the Lord and therefore might say that he was entirely washed—if this was the present situation, the Lord corrected his ignorance by saying, “One who has bathed does not need to wash, except for the feet, but is entirely clean. And you are clean, but not all of you.” Then the Evangelist by explaining the words of our Lord added, “For he knew who was to betray him. For this reason he said, ‘Not all of you are clean.’ ” By speaking to Simon our Lord means to say: “This is not the baptism for the remission of sins. You have already received it once and do not need it twice, because you were made clean by the first you received. Now it is necessary that only your feet are washed, and soon you will know the purpose of this act.” Certainly the disciples received the baptism of remission from John, in which the teaching of our Lord confirmed them even more by exhorting them to virtue. And then the descended Spirit perfected them when it later came on them.
