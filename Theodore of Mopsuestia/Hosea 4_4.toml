My people are like a priest who is compromised. He has fallen from his previous dignity and does not appear worthy for any reason, just as a priest who falls into controversy would be set aside and dishonored by everyone. “And he will be weak by day.” To the greatest extent he will become weak because of the upcoming evils.
