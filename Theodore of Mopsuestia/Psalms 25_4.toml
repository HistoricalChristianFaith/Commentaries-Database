As he refers by “way” to people’s actions and exploits (as in that verse, “I have run in the way of your commands,” as if to say, I determined to do and observe your commands), so he calls God’s “way” whatever God deigns to do by creating or arranging. So “teach me your paths” means “make me rejoice in your acting and planning.”
