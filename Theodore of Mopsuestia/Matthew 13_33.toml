He calls Greeks, Jews and Samaritans “three measures of meal,” for when the leaven had been cast into these three it brought about one same nature and fatness in all of them. For human beings, divided from one another, were brought into the same state by my teaching, in its working. The apostle also speaks in the same way, for “in Christ Jesus” there is neither “Greek” nor “Jew” and so on.
