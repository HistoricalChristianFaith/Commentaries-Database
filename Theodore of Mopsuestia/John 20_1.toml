It seems to those who dissent that here also the words of the Evangelists do not agree with one another. On the contrary, it seems to me that on the basis of their accounts their words are perfectly consistent.… Indeed, John says, “Early … while it was dark.” The word early is not referred here to the morning. In fact, he does not say while it was “still” dark, which should have been said with regard to morning. But he wrote, “while it was dark,” that is, on the next day when the night began, by designating with the term early the entire day so that he might say the day after the sabbath. The holy Scripture usually defines both day and night with the word day, because the sun, after its course throughout the night and the day, makes the beginning of the next day by returning to its place in the west. And this is confirmed by Moses, who says, “And there was evening and there was morning, the first day,” which he also says about the second and third days, and all the rest.… John says, “Early on the first day of the week,” indicating the next day, that is, “on the first day of the week, when it was dark,” in order to signify that when the night began, the women came, in order to perform the proper honor according to customs.
