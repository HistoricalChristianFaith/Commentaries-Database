Paul did not say “we hold” because he was himself uncertain. He said it in order to counter those who concluded from this that anyone who wished to could be justified simply by willing faith. Note carefully that Paul does not say simply “without the law,” as if we could just perform virtue by wanting to, nor do we do the works of the law by force. We do them because we have been led to do them by Christ. PAULINE COMMENTARY FROM THE GREEK CHURCH.AUGUSTINE:This must not be understood in such a way as to say that a man who has received faith and continues to live is righteous, even though he leads a wicked life.
