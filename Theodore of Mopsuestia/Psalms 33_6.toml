You see, when it says “mouth” in these cases, it intends to indicate an operation affecting visible creation, as when it also says “hand” and “feet” and the like. Elsewhere, too, Scripture says, “The mouth of the Lord said this,” in the sense that God revealed what had been determined in our regard; nowhere does the divine Scripture by such corporeal expression describe the Lord’s nature or the creation of invisible nature, such as angels and the like, as in our case it is in the habit of saying, “Your hands made me.” So by “breath of his mouth” he means “by his decision.”
