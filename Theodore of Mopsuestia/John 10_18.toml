To say that the body of the divine Logos also had a soul does not suggest the divinity of the soul.… In this context, when something like this is stated, we understand the statement to refer to the flesh, which had a soul and was united with the divine Logos.… After all, even when Peter says, “Now I will lay down my soul for you,” just like the Lord did, there is no difference. You see, just as Peter, who was a man, composed of body and soul, said this, so too Christ, being one and not two, composed of divinity and humanity, says that he lays down his soul, which belongs to him and is part of him (although he was God in nature, assuming flesh—which had soul—and uniting it to himself).
