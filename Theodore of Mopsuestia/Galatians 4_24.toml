Those who are at great pains to pervert the meaning of the divine Scriptures … abuse this saying of the apostle’s, as though they thought that they could derive from it the power to suppress the entire sense of holy Scripture in their aspirations to speak “allegorically,” as if in the manner of the apostle. They fail to see how great a difference there is between their own position and that of the apostle in this passage. For the apostle does not deny the history or pick apart the events of the distant past, but he has stated them as they happened at the time, while using for his own purpose the interpretation of these events.… He would not have said “referred to one who was born” if he had not believed that person had really existed. There cannot be a simile if one takes away the historical reality itself.
