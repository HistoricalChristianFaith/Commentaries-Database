He referred the cause of it all to the Father, in order to confirm his words as indisputable to the unbelievers. And since what he had said could appear to be quite weak, that is, “no one will snatch them out of my hand,” for this reason he introduced the power of the Father and his outstanding greatness by saying, “no one can snatch them out of the Father’s hand,” because all are absolutely inferior to him.
