God will make the return of the remainder so conspicuous that many people who are from different nations and have shared that calamity will perceive God’s care for the people. They will lay hold of any one of them and use him as a guide for a return to Jerusalem, since everyone is sufficiently stirred up to that end from the clear realization that God is with them on the basis of the incredible deeds done for them. The phrase “ten men,” note, here too refers not to number but has the meaning of many.
