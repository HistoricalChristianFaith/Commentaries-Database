As in the episode of Lazarus he said that he was troubled in spirit, because he foretold what would happen, and that he was angered in order to show that he had knowledge of the things that still had to happen as if they had already happened, so here too he says he was angered because of Judas’s betrayal and was confused by how vicious he was. He also said here the words “Jesus was troubled in spirit” because through the operation of the Spirit that was in him he foreknew the future [and the trouble that awaited him].
