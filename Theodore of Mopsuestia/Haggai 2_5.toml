Likewise here too when he says, “My spirit has taken a position in your midst,” he means, my grace and my disposition toward you accompanies you, taking a position and providing you with its benefit. In other words, just as he speaks of a soul in reference to God, thus implying not some hypostasis [i.e., separate entity] but his attitude to something—as when he says, “My soul hates your new moons and sabbaths” to refer to the attitude by which he hated what was done by them in their depraved behavior—so too is his mention of the “spirit.”
