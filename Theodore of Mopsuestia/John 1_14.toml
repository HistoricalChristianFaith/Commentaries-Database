In order to explain the word was, the Evangelist added kai eskēnōsen en hēmin, and “tabernacled in us,” that is, in this sense he became flesh: he lived in our nature. Evidently the words stand for “lived among us,” as also the apostle said about us human beings, “We who are still in this tabernacle groan,” where he called our body a tabernacle. He also writes elsewhere, “We know that if the earthly tabernacle we live in is destroyed.” It is well known that in Scripture usually the whole person is indicated by “flesh,” as in, “To you all flesh shall come.”

We did not agree to believe in him lightheartedly, [John says,] but accepted him as a true, only begotten Son because of those things that we saw. And the things we saw demonstrated the greatness of the one who appeared—they could belong to no one else except the Only Begotten who possesses perfect identity with the Father. And it is also true that the works that were made through him were full of true grace. He called grace truth in comparison with that of the Jews, in order to accuse the unbelievers, and he reveals his intention with the words that follow.He indicates grace with the name of truth, that is, the true grace, because Christ took on the ancient transgressions and gave salvation through the remission of sins. In addition he destroyed death, which reigned because of sin, and gave us a sound hope in the resurrection through our adoption as sons. He gave us hope not only in the word, like the Jews, but also regenerated in us the hope of resurrection by the works [of Christ] through the power of the Spirit. The symbol of resurrection is baptism, which confirms that death itself will never destroy us. For this reason he prepared for us the delights of the heavenly kingdom if we preserve pure in our actions the honor of the adoptive relationship given to us through baptism.
