It is not to be read, as some commentators claim, “Judge me, Lord,” for if it is read “Judge me,” it gives quite a different sense, as though to say, condemn me, as also in Psalm 5 he appealed in the words “Condemn them, Lord,” which is not appropriate for a suppliant to ask for in his own case. So it is to be read as “Give me a just verdict” … because I did not swerve from my innocent purpose, nor did I have any doubts about the hope I placed in you.
