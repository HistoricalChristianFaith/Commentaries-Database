It was “three men” who came to Abraham, and “in the heat of the day”; but in the case of Sodom, “two angels, and in the evening.” Good things are likened to light, bad things to evening, since the “sun of justice” has set on them. For the punishment of the wicked is night and darkness, but the righteous “will shine like light.” It is significant too that where there was an announcement of good things, the Lord was present. But when the subject is punishment, he does not appear in person, showing that when people have good experiences, it is his pleasure, so that he chooses, as it were, to act directly in such matters. Since he takes no pleasure in punishments but inflicts them only because of necessity, he makes use of underlings.
