Since through Adam death came, which subjected everyone, they had heard through their prophets and believed that death would be defeated. When they saw that this had been done by our Lord, who raised a man dead for four days, they took branches of palm trees and went out to meet him as the victor over death, which oppresses humankind, and praised him with appropriate hymns. Since the Pharisees did not like this, they reproached them by saying that they followed him in vain, but it was their reproach that was in vain, since all the people went after him anyway.
