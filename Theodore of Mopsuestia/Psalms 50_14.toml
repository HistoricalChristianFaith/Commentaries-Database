Offer me this sacrifice of praise. That is, offer yourself as a victim to me, taking pains to live in thanksgiving to me and devoting yourself totally to me.… Pray always to me about everything; render me this and perform it. The phrase “pray to me about everything” means, consider me responsible for all your good things, and receive from me all that is at any time good, no one being able to pray unless persuaded of this.… It will be no idle conjecture for you, since with this attitude you will, even if calling in the midst of afflictions, be heard and will attain what you aspire to, and so will take occasion from the beneficence to give even greater glory.
