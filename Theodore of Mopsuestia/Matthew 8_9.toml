It was a sign of the centurion’s intelligence that merely by thinking to himself about what was likely, he believed such things about Christ. For he says, “I also am a man. But nevertheless I am the lord over those I have received authority to rule. Therefore it is nothing strange if you, who have received authority from God, should be able to command illnesses to depart by a mere word.” The centurion did not approach Jesus as one who is Son of God and Lord of the whole creation (for at that time, before the crucifixion, this was not yet known even by the disciples). Rather, he came to him as to a man who, because of his virtues, had received from God some greater-than-human authority. This is why he says, “For I also am a man.” For since he had said to him, “say the word,” and this might seem proper to God only, he rightly adds the statement, “for I also am a man,” as though to say, “It is nothing surprising if you, a man who has received authority from God, should be able to do this thing, since I myself, a man like you, receive subjects and am set over them to command them as I will.”
