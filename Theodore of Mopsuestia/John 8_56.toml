Therefore, he says, after my Father’s testimony about me has been explained, now listen to what is in conformity with that [testimony] about me: I am certainly enough of Abraham’s superior that he also wished and hoped to see the time when I would reform the world through my passion. And in his desire he saw this, as much as he was allowed to, and clearly rejoiced when, by sacrificing his own son, he revealed his will and received from God the revelation so that he might know what would happen. As he accepted giving his son as a victim for God, so also God would give his Only Begotten for the salvation of the world.
