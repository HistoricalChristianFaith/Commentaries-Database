MY VIRGINS: the eighth topic of indignation; for virgins cannot defend themselves nor hurt another.

Historical interpretation THE LORD IS JUST: SADE, which is put before, and is interpreted ‘of justice’, means that the justices of the Lord are right, which is well portrayed in these words: THE LORD IS JUST, FOR I HAVE PROVOKED HIS MOUTH TO WRATH, as if she would say: ‘I have duly submitted to the judgement of his mouth. Hence I have not put off confessing that THE LORD IS JUST.’ And note that above Jerusalem or the prophet invites them who passed by the way, as being rather few, to examine her pain, but now everyone is invited together, that theirs be one suffering, whose natural condition is one. Above he lamented the virgins in affliction and the children taken captives, but now also the stronger young men and the captured virgins, and the more evil is accumulated, the more sorrow is increased.

HEAR I PRAY YOU ALL YE PEOPLE AND SEE MY SORROW: with great respect and acute consideration, these things are separated.  

Allegorical interpretation THE LORD IS JUST: the Church, which above submitted to the judgement of his mouth and which in the divine Scriptures provoked the mouth of the Lord to wrath, is taught to confess: THE LORD IS JUST. Indeed, nothing upon earth is done without a cause, and nothing in God’s great commonwealth takes place without providence. 

FOR I HAVE PROVOKED HIS MOUTH: not that God should have human limbs, but just as human passions are metaphorically ascribed to him, so are also limbs. With MOUTH is signified the Word, brought forth from the Father’s mouth, as if he would say: ‘with my importunity I have provoked the just judge, and I have forced one of gentle nature to pass a grave sentence against me.’ HEAR, therefore, ALL YE PEOPLE: she rates her harm manifold and inestimable, whence she invites everyone to suffer together, so that with the compassion of the many, her anguish may be the lighter to bear. Her VIRGINS, of whom it is said: For I have espoused you to one husband that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ; her young men, whom Mother Church has begotten in the water of baptism, who when being corrupted by heretical crookedness, or defiled by vices, are captured, not in the place but in the mind, and taken to Babylon, that is to confusion. For he who is joined to a harlot, is made one body, then so much grief and so much affliction is accumulated, that he hardly is believed seen, or understood, by all. 

Moral interpretation THE LORD IS JUST: the soul, who is chastised by the judgement of his mouth, rightly confesses that THE LORD IS JUST, because with her shameful desires, she has provoked the mouth of the Lord to wrath, that he would put forth a grave sentence against her, he who is just in all his undertakings. Hence, imbued with her confusion, she dares not raise her eyes towards the angry judge, but invites every one to hear and see her affliction. Indeed, such is the passion of human nature that we seek partners in our pain or happiness, with whose partaking we endure more easily, whence: Rejoice with me, because I have found my sheep that was lost. The soul, therefore, is seeking several mediators, because she dares not even raise her eyes towards the judge, whom she has displeased. 

MY VIRGINS AND MY YOUNG MEN: she sees her clean thoughts and her firmer desires perish, as if with the enemy ravaging the progeny and hope of her womb, and she loses her hope of future generations.
