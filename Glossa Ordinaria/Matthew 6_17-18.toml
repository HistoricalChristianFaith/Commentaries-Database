(ap. Anselm.) The Lord having taught us what we ought not to do, now proceeds to teach us what we ought to do, saying, When thou fastest, anoint thy head, and wash thy face.

(ord.) That is, to thy heavenly Father, who is unseen, or who dwells in the heart through faith. He fasts to God who affliets himself for the love of God, and bestows on others what he denies himself.

(ord.) Behold how every thing in the New Testament is not to be taken literally. It were ridiculous to be smeared with oil when fasting; but it is behoveful for the mind to be anointed with the spirit of His love, in whose sufferings we ought to partake by afflicting ourselves.
