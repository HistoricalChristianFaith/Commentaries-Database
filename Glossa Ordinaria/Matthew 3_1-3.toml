[[commentary]]
quote='''
(ap. Anselm.) The desert typically means a life removed from the temptations of the world, such as befits the penitent.

(ord.) The Kingdom of Heaven shall come nigh you; for if it approached not, none would be able to gain it; for weak and blind they had not the way, which was Christ.

(ord.) John then is, as it were, the voice of the word crying. The word is heard by the voice, that is, Christ by John.

(interlin.) Or, faith is the way by which the word reaches the heart; when the life is amended the paths are made straight.
