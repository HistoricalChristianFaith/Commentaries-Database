Interlin.: Or, “with all thy heart,” i.e. understanding; “with all thy soul,”i.e. thy will; “with all thy mind,” i.e. memory; so you shall think, will, remember nothing contrary to Him. If the Lord had given no answer to the Pharisee who thus tempted Him, we should have judged that there was no commandment greater than the rest. But when the Lord adds, “This is the firstand great commandment,” we learn how we ought to think of the commandments, that there is a great one, and that there are less down to the least. And the Lord says not only that it is a great, but that it is the first commandment, not in order of Scripture, but in supremacy of value. They only take upon them the greatness and supremacy of this precept, who not only love the Lord their God, but add these three conditions. Nor did He only teach the first and great commandment, but added that there was a second like unto the first, “Thou shalt love thyneighbour as thyself:” But if “Whoso loveth iniquity hath hated his own soul,” it is manifest that he does not love his neighbour as himself, when he does not love himself.
