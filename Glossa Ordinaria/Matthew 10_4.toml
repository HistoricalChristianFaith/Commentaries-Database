Ord.: From the healing of Peter’s wife’s mother to this place there has been acontinued succession of miracles; and they were done before the Sermon upon the Mount, as we know for certain from Matthew’s call, which is placed among them; for he was one of the twelve chosen to the Apostleship upon the mount. He here returns to the order of events, taking it up again at the healing of the centurion's servant; saying, “And calling to him his twelve disciples.”.
see Greg. Hom. in Ev., xvii,1: And this doubling seems to have some reference to the two precepts of charity, or to the two Testaments.
non occ.: They are named two and two to express their union as yoke-fellows.
