Ord.: There are two Bethlehems; one in the tribe of Zabulon, the other in the tribe of Judah, which was before called Ephrata.
These Magi were kings, and though their gifts were three, it is not to be thence inferred that themselves were only three in number, but in them was prefigured the coming to the faith of the nations sprung from the three sons ofNoah.Or, the princes were only three, but each brought a large company with him. They came not after a year’s end, for He would then have been found in Egypt, not in the manger, but on the thirteenth day. To show whence they came it is said, “from the East.”.
Or, they had dromedaries and Arabian horses, whose great swiftness brought them to Bethlehem in thirteen days.
interlin.: ‘His star,’ i.e. the star He created for a witness of Himself.
ord.: To the Shepherds, Angels, and the Magians, a star points out Christ; toboth speaks the tongue of Heaven, since the tongue of the Prophets was mute. The Angels dwell in the heavens, the stars adorn it, to both therefore “the heavens declare the glory of God.”.
ord: “In the east.” It seems doubtful whether this refers to the place of the star, or of those that saw it; it might have risen in the east, and gone before them to Jerusalem.
