THEY HAVE HEARD: the second topic of indignation; for it shows to whom this act principally pertains, that is to God himself, whom the enemies have despised in their own affairs, whence: Let all their evil be present.

Historical interpretation THEY HAVE HEARD: there is none who doubts that the gentiles, surrounding Jerusalem, abused her captivities. In fact, they rejoiced that she had been deprived the help of God, whom they envied standing firm among so many tempests. THAT THOU HAST DONE IT: she brings God’s judgement into the reckoning, from which she does not ignore that all things are ordered. THOU HAST BROUGHT A DAY OF CONSOLATION: these are the words of the prophet, who announces the forthcoming consolation to comfort the captured people as if it were something past, because he sees it so clearly. He speaks in a rhetorical manner, to procure the favor of the judge and to instigate against the enemies.

Allegorical interpretation THEY HAVE HEARD: the Church deplores her own troubles and those of her friends, whence the letter SIN, which means ‘of teeth’, is placed before. This is the gnashing of teeth, of which it is read in the Canticles: Thy teeth as flocks of sheep that are shorn. They are those who do not need the milk on infancy but who chew solid bread, whence it is said to Peter: Kill and eat. As if: ‘I have served you not only bread to eat but creeping things.’ For such persons know, with the acuteness of doctrine, to kill vice and to lead creeping things to the body of Christ. Different, however, is the function of the teeth: Some divide, some diminish, others form words; thus others are mystical teeth, such as flocks of sheep that are shorn, who, deprived of old age, provide their offspring with the milk of doctrine and the garments of virtue. Others, whiter than milk, furnished with the beauty of their service, serve the Word to the utmost subtlety, whence the Apostle: Strong meat is for the perfect: for them who have their senses exercised. 

THEY HAVE HEARD THAT I SIGH: the enemies hear the weeping spouse, who feels her absent husband, who, although always present through his majesty, suffers that his spouse is agitated by temptations, so that she is always alarmed and weak, that she may yield to the suggestion of the seducer. They have seen THAT I SIGH, which they always have wished, which they never have suspected. THERE IS NONE TO COMFORT ME, as the spirit of discipline shuns falsehood, and daily MY EVIL is multiplied. The demons are the enemies of the Church and heretics and false Christians. THAT THOU HAST DONE IT, whence: I am the Lord, I make peace, and create evil, that is allowing it by thy just judgement. THOU HAST BROUGHT A DAY OF CONSOLATION: this is more fit for the Church, because after the final captivity no consolation is left for the Jews. On Judgement Day, the Lord will render consolation for the just and punishments for the wicked. 

Moral interpretation THEY HAVE HEARD: the soul deplores that THE ENEMIES HAVE HEARD the evils she endures. THERE IS NONE TO COMFORT: it is an increase of pain to the anxious soul, because the one she puts her hope in postpones his succor. In addition, she suffers unutterably from the fact that the invisible enemies, who formerly flattered her, now mock her. Indeed, her conscience, by more seriously blaming, insults her, and the vices that used to seem sweet, become bitter. Those, however, who before seemed to be her friends and who ought to have shown pity, if they happened to know our crimes, now scorn her as if enemies. Hence David: They that watched my soul have consulted together, saying: God hath forsaken him. But the soul has teeth, that is virtues; thoughts, that know how to separate fortunate things from unfortunate and require the comforting Spirit and to hope for the pity of God, whence he adds: THOU HAST BROUGHT A DAY OF CONSOLATION. Indeed, the forceful soul knows that after the straits, the penitents will be given indulgence, and the insolent repayed with punishments.
