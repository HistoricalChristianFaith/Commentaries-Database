(ap. Anselm) Or, The owner of the beasts will straightway send them to be engaged for Christ's service. Hereto is added the testimony of the Prophet, that it may be shown that the Lord fulfilled all things which were written of Him, but that the Scribes and Pharisees, blinded by envy, would not understand the things that they read; All this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Prophet; (Zech. 9:9.) to wit, Zacharias.

(ap. Anselm.) And the meaning is, Blessed, that is, Glorious, is He that cometh, that is, is incarnate; in the name of the Lord; that is, of the Father, by glorifying Him. Again they repeat, Hosanna, that is, Save, I pray thee, and define whither they would bo saved, in the highest, that is in the heavenly, not in the earthly places.
