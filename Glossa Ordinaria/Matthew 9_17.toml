Ap. Anselm: As much as to say, An undressed patch, that is, a new one, ought not to be put into an old garment, because it often takes away from the garment its wholeness, that is, its perfection, and then the rent is made worse. For aheavy burden laid on one that is untrained often destroys that good which was in him before.
non occ.: This shows that the Apostles being hereafter to be replenished with newness of grace, ought not now to be bound to the old observances.
