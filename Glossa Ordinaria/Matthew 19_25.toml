Ap. Anselm: The Lord took occasion from this rich man to hold discourse concerning the covetous; “Then said Jesus unto his disciples, Verily I say unto you”.
ap. Anselm: It is explained otherwise; That at Jerusalem there was a certain gate, called, The needle’s eye, through which a camel could not pass, but onits bended knees, and after its burden had been taken off; and so the rich should not be able to pass along the narrow way that leads to life, till he had put off the burden of sin, and of riches, that is, ceasing to love them.
