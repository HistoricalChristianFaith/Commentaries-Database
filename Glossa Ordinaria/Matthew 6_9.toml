(e. Cypr.) Amongst His other saving instructions and divine lessons, wherewith He counsels believers, He has set forth for us a form of prayer in few words; thus giving us confidence that that will be quickly granted, for which He would have us pray so shortly.

(ord.) Yet we do not confine ourselves wholly to these words, but use others also conceived in the same sense, with which our heart is kindled.

(ord.) Also because He is a common Father of all, we say, Our Father; not My Father which is appropriate to Christ alone, who is His Son by nature.
