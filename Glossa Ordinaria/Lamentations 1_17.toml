SION HAS SPREAD FORTH HER HANDS: the fourth topic of complaint.

Historical interpretation ZION HAS SPREAD FORTH HER HANDS: this signifies pain as that of a woman in labor, whence it is said elsewhere: As he that swims stretches forth his hands to swim, likewise also Zion in the midst of straits, and Isaiah says: Anguish hath taken hold of me as the anguish of a woman in labor. Indeed, it is the straightness of the heart that is expressed in the extension of the hands, more than with a cry from the mouth. Hence PHE is written before, that is interpreted ‘of the mouth’. Because, when ‘ZION HAS SPREAD FORTH HER HANDS in the midst of straits’, she shows that which she cannot express with her mouth, namely that she suffers in her heart, when she is without a comforter, whence: Depart from me, I will weep bitterly: labor not to comfort me.

THE LORD HAS COMMANDED AGAINST JACOB: with the just judgement of God, both the Chaldeans and the Romans have been brought in, for a people shall not arise against another unless God has previously given order. 

AS A MENSTROUS WOMAN: just as a woman is abominable, when she undergoes menstruation, likewise the Jews are looked upon over the whole world.  

Allegorical interpretation SION HAS SPREAD FORTH HER HANDS: as often as the Church is surrounded by the army of heretics, THE LORD commands AGAINST JACOB, that is to say, the Church, who ought to overthrow her vices, the enemies’ armies against her, because she has dismissed the Holy Ghost, her teacher and comforter, without whom no one is educated to the faith, no one is freed from vices. Therefore HAS she SPREAD FORTH HER HANDS, in the midst of pressures and pains, and there is no worthy voice of the mouth for her, with which she would be able to overcome the dogmas of the enemies and defend her own, whence she is often polluted with the foulness of her carnal works and with the blood of her fleshly desires among the enemies, by whom she is afflicted within and without. Hence: Woe to them that are with child, and that give suck in those days.

Moral interpretation SION HAS SPREAD FORTH HER HANDS: when the soul, who used to be a mirror of God and an over-thrower of vices, because of her iniquity is delivered to spiritual wickedness, she looks in vain for a comforter without, who has lost the spirit within. Justly therefore, THE LORD HAS COMMANDED AGAINST JACOB &c, that is against the soul, once overthrowing her vices, now bragging of the name only, whence her spiritual ENEMIES besiege her AROUND, that she cannot escape. She who often sees her surrounded, spreads FORTH HER HANDS in the midst of straits of thoughts, and there is no voice of the mouth for her, nor any excuse for speaking, because she is A MENSTROUS WOMAN, that is, stained with bloody deeds, from which she is never freed without the comforter, when also the prophet testifies to that all our justices are before him as the rag of a menstruous woman.
