THEREFORE DO I WEEP: the seventh topic of indignation; it displays a cruel and tyrannical deed and the violence of the enemies.

Historical interpretation He HAS TRODDEN THE WINE-PRESS: THE WINE-PRESS signifies vengeance and punishment for sin, whence Isaiah: Why then is thy apparel red and thy garments like theirs that tread in the wine-press; he introduces the Lord having answered the inquiring angels: I have trodden the wine-press alone, that, namely, with which punishments for the wicked and rewards for the just are trodden. This the Lord has trodden alone, as he had no helper, for neither angel nor archangel had assumed a human body, so that he, suffering for our sake, would crush and destroy the strength of our adversary. This WINE-PRESS THE LORD HAS TRODDEN in his passion FOR THE VIRGIN DAUGHTER OF JUDAH, that he would produce rewards for the believers and for the faithless and torturers punishments of perpetual captivity and everlasting damnation. The prophet, however, seeing the obduracy of the Jews, laments, because THE LORD HAS TRODDEN THE WINE-PRESS FOR THE DAUGHTER OF JUDAH. For that which the Lord suffers as her own remedy, she turns for herself into the torment of final captivity and everlasting damnation. Hence he introduces the person of the weeping Synagogue herself: THEREFORE DO I WEEP. THE COMFORTER IS FAR FROM ME: This we often demonstrate, if we consider the faithlessness and obduracy of the Jews. Metaphorically, however, it is said THE LORD HAS TRODDEN THE WINE-PRESS &c: figuratively, the Lord brought his vine out of Egypt and planted it in the land of promise, which for long remained barren and fruitless, according to this: I looked that it should bring forth grapes, and it hath brought forth wild grapes. Therefore THE LORD HAS TRODDEN THE WINE-PRESS, he has reserved wine for himself, he pressed the grape of swine through eternal captivity.

 Allegorical interpretation THE LORD HAS TRODDEN THE WINE-PRESS: when, namely, through his passion he brings the aerial powers under his Church. But she is really the virgin daughter of Judah, for the law hath come forth from Zion, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem. For her THE LORD HAS TRODDEN THE WINE-PRESS, that is the yoke of oppression, that she might be free. But since the Lord is treading, many become the dregs of oil, therefore the prophet says weeping: MY EYES RUN DOWN WITH WATER, and thus AIN is put in between, that is interpreted ‘fountain-head’ or ‘eye’. For when he pressed the wine-press of the cross, a spring flowed out from his side, whence: and immediately there came out blood and water. In this spring the bride is gained and cleansed to be united to the embraces of her spouse, and with this she is endowed, that she might rejoice, that she might adhere to the spouse only, love him only, who has loved her so much. And, since AIN also is interpreted ‘eye’, the eye, inebriated from this spring, has not without cause run down with the water of tears, whence: My eyes have sent forth springs of water.

THE COMFORTER IS FAR: as often as the Church is inflicted with tribulations, as often as she is forsaken by the help of God, she ought to revert to tears, as if to accustomed defenses. When, however, a teacher giving instruction without and the helper is not present, who would furnish and educate her within, therefore ARE her CHILDREN DESOLATE and THE ENEMY HAS PREVAILED. Accordingly, any of the teachers who would have seen that the Church, entrusted to him, convert herself less, would drink from the spring of charity, whence he would produce tears, until he would have brought back the comforting and converting Paraclete. Otherwise, with the enemy prevailing, her CHILDREN shall become DESOLATE, who namely, not yet weaned, have not yet been brought to the perfect man.  

Moral interpretation He HAS TRODDEN THE WINE-PRESS: THE LORD treads THE WINE-PRESS for the unfruitful soul, empty of virtues and works, when he strikes her, as if sterile and idle, with a wholly deservable expiation. Hence she says: THEREFORE DO I WEEP, because she sees that she has lost the comforter and that she falls impenitent, where there will be wailing and rattling of teeth. From which a great lamenting of the soul is described, that she might know that after the vain delight of this world all consolation will be wanting. There the children will be desolate, as the fruit of their evil deeds will be dispersed, and the enemy alone shall prevail.
