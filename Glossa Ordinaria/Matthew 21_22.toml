Ap. Anselm: For in permitting His flesh to suffer that which properly pertains to flesh, He foreshews His passion. Mark the earnest zeal of the active labourer, Who is said to have gone early into the city to preach, and to gain some to His Father.
ord.: The Creator does no wrong to the owner, but His creature, at His will, is converted to the profit of others.
