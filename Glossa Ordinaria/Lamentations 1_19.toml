I CALLED FOR MY FRIENDS: the eleventh topic of indignation; the act is committed by them, namely, who had been expected to prevent it if done by another.

BUT THEY DECEIVED ME: the fourth topic of complaint.

Historical interpretation I CALLED FOR MY FRIENDS: COPH is interpreted ‘a calling’, whence he immediately has added: I CALLED FOR MY FRIENDS, the Egyptians, on whose friendship and aid the Jews had been relying, but they DECEIVED ME, as they did not offer any help in the time of the first or the last captivity. Hence Isaiah: The land of Judah shall be a terror to Egypt in the day of their calamity. They were justly deceived, who trusted more in the Egyptians than in God. MY PRIESTS &c: there can be no doubt that this happened under the Romans.

Allegorical interpretation I CALLED FOR MY FRIENDS: the Church often calls for her friends, whom she regards as fellows in faith, but they deceive, who have corrupted the faith, either by hiding it within, or by bursting forth into open heresy. Also bad Catholics with power and authority, in whom the Church trusts as friends, often deceive her, and what is worse, they then rage more cruelly, when HER PRIESTS AND ANCIENTS PINED AWAY out of hunger for the word of God. Those pursuing the profit of the life of the flesh seek more the food of animal life than the celestial food from Solomon’s dish or from the Gospel feast or from the banquet of wisdom, everyone’s calling to which is denoted in the letter COPH.

Moral interpretation I CALLED: the sweet passions of the flesh, but they deceive the soul who is eager for them, and, since in her perishes the kingly priesthood and the aged counsel of ripeness, she struggles, enticed by vain desires, to relieve the concupiscence of the flesh. The Egyptian helps in vain, because the world passes away and the concupiscence thereof, that is a staff of a reed piercing the hands of him who rests upon it.
