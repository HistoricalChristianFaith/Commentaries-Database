Non occ.: It seems to happen in many cases that the parents love the children more than the children love the parents; therefore having taught that His loveis to be preferred to the love of parents, as in an ascending scale, He next teaches that it is to be preferred to the love of children, saying, “And whosoloveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.”
