Ap. Anselm: These words “That ye may know,” may be either Christ’s words, or the Evangelist’s words. As though the Evangelist had said, They doubted whether He could remit sins, “But that ye may know that the Son of Man hath the power to remit sins, he saith to the paralytic.” If they are the words of Christ, the connection will be as follows; You doubt that I have power to remit sins, “but that ye may know that the Son of Man hath power to remit sins” = the sentenceis imperfect, but the action supplies the place of the consequent clause, “hesaith to the paralytic, Rise, take up thy bed.”
