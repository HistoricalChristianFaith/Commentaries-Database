After that our Lord has prudently escaped the crafty temptation of the Pharisees, it is shown how Healso confounds the Sadducees, who tempt Him. Wherefore it is said: “Then come unto Him the Sadducees, which say there is no resurrection.”.
That is, because they contradicted the Scriptures, and derogated from the power of God.
