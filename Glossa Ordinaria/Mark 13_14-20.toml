(non occ.)

(Non in Gloss. sed ap. Theoph.) Or rather went out of their own accord, being led by the Holy Ghost. It goes on, And let him that is on the housetop not go down into the house, neither enter therein, to take any thing out of his house; for it is a desirable thing to be saved even naked from such a destruction. It goes on: But woe to them that are with child, and to them that give suck in those days.

(non occ.)
