For from the troubling of thesea there arises a certain sound, which appears to be its voice threatening danger, and therefore, by a sort of metaphor, He fitly commands tranquility bya word signifying silence: just as in the restraining of the winds, which trouble the sea with their violence, He uses a rebuke. And immediately the effect followed, for it continues, “And the wind ceased,” when He had threatened, “and there arose agreat calm,” that is, in the sea, to which He had commanded silence.
