Interlin.: “Except ye be converted” from this ambition and jealousy in which you are at present, and become all of you as innocent and humble in dispositionas you are weak in your years, “ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven; "and since there is none other road to enter in, “whoso shall humble himself as this little child, the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven;” for by how much a man is humble now, by so much shall he be exalted in the kingdom of heaven.
