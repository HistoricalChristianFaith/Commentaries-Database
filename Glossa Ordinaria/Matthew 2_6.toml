“The King,” he is called, though in comparison with him whom they are seeking he is an alien and a foreigner. Great station is ever obnoxious to great fears; as the boughs of trees planted in high ground move when never so little wind blows, so high men are troubled with little rumours; while the lowly, like trees in the valley, remain at peace.
Perhaps he was troubled not on his own account, but for fear of the displeasure of the Romans. They would not allow the title of King or of God toany without their permission.
“Jerusalem was troubled with him,” as willing to favour him whom it feared; the vulgar always pay undue honour to one who tyrannizes over it. Observe the diligence of his enquiry. If he should find him, he would do to him as he showed afterwards his disposition; if he should not, he would at least be excused to the Romans.
He quotes this prophecy as they quote who give the sense and not the words.
This latter half of the prophecy the Jews dropped; and other parts they altered, either through ignorance, (as was said above,) or for perspicuity, that Herod who was a foreigner might better understand the prophecy; thus for "Ephrata,” they said, “land of Judah;” and for “little among the thousands of Judah,” which expresses its smallness contrasted with the multitude of the people, they said, “not the least among the princes,” willing to show the high dignity that would come from the birth of the Prince. As if they had said,“Thou art great among cities from which princes have come.”
