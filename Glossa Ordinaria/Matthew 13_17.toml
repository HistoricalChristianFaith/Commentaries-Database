The disciples understanding that the things which were spoken by the Lord to the people were obscure, desired to hint to Him that He should not speak in parables to them. “And his disciples came to him, and said, Why speakest thou to them in parables?”
That is; With the hearing ye shall hear words, but shall not understand the hidden meaning of those words; seeing ye shall see My flesh indeed, but shall not discern the divinity.
So then the eyes of them that see, and will not believe, are miserable, but your eyes are blessed; whence it follows, “Blessed are your eyes, for they see, and your ears, for they hear.”.
The mind is called an eye, because it is intently directed upon what is set before it to understand it; and an ear, because it learns from the teaching of another.
