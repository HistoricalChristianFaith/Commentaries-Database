When John’s disciples approached … they questioned him even while he was at table, in the manner of a physician with the publicans: “Why do we and the Pharisees often fast, whereas your disciples do not fast?” Do you see how the same jealousy motivates and provokes birds of a feather and is made keen by the cruel goad of envy? On the one hand, it set the Pharisees, who boasted about being teachers, against the Teacher. For that reason they also said, “Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?” On the other hand, envy set John’s disciples against Christ’s disciples. That is why they also said, “How come your disciples do not fast?”

It is with the words of John, your own teacher, whom you esteem so highly, that I answer you. Keep it in mind, and you will have the answer to your question. When John bore witness concerning me, he said, “He who has the bride is the bridegroom.” So, if I am the bridegroom and you don’t make a liar out of your own teacher, you know in advance that it is important for my disciples, while they are the children of the marriage … to be gay and joyful and not to become upset or miserable over fasting. In certain respects, fasting is a source of annoyance and can also be arduous for those without a mature disposition.
