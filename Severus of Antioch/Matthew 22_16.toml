Jesus’ opponents expect that one of two outcomes must result for them from Jesus’ response. They think they can show clearly that Jesus was acting wrongly against the law of Moses or against the power of the Romans. “Indeed, if he responds that it is necessary for us to pay the tribute,” the Pharisees will necessarily slander him alongside those who obey the Romans, saying, “He is guiding us outside the law of Moses away from the service of God. He is leading us to a foreign power and a foreign race.” That is indeed why Luke says, “They could not catch him at fault in his teaching before the people.” For it is publicly, that is to say, in the midst of the people, that they are questioning him, in order to set the people against him. And if he does not permit the tax to be paid, the Herodians will immediately lay their hands on him as on one who does not submit to the Roman authorities.Observe what is the passion of hypocrisy, how it has hidden all the hostility and the homicidal thought of the Jews beneath flattery’s vile veil, and how those who hate involuntarily honor as they attempt to cause a death. Indeed, those who were saying, “We are the disciples of Moses, but we don’t know where that one is from” call him “Master.” Those who were calling him a “deceiver” and “seducer” say, “We know that you are truthful.” Those who were doing their best to resist with jealousy and with ignorance, saying, “This man does not come from God, because he does not observe the Sabbath” and “he has a demon” witness that he teaches the way of God in all truth.
