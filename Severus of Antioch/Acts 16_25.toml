You see, the holy Scripture clearly states that they sang hymns, not only in their hearts but also in order to be heard, as is written in the Psalms: “With my voice I cried to the Lord, with my voice I was in need before God.” After the great fame of their actions it was necessary to offer the sacrifices of praise for everything to God, that is, “the fruit of the lips, which confess his name,” as Paul says. David expresses the same saying, “By praising I invoke the Lord, and I will be saved from my enemies.”
