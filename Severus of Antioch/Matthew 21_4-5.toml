It is again a prophecy, that of Zechariah, just as that also found in the book of Matthew, which informs us that a donkey’s foal was tied to its mother. For the prophecy reads, “Rejoice greatly, daughter of Zion, shout, daughter of Jerusalem; behold, your king comes to you, righteous and having salvation; he himself is humble and mounted on a donkey and on a newly born foal.” Now who doesn’t, while waiting for a righteous king, immediately understand that the Christ is in view, who prefigured likewise the name of Melchizedek, whose name in translation evokes the “king of justice”? So the prophet himself does not only say “king of justice,” but he added “and redeemer.” He did so in order to indicate, in an additional way through this means, the name of Jesus, which when translated means “salvation of God” and “healing.” And he added next, “He himself is humble and mounted on a donkey and on a newly born foal.” He does so to show in advance he who is written about in the Gospels: “Learn of me, for I am gentle and humble of heart.” Now there was never any king, simultaneously just, a redeemer, gentle and seated on a donkey, who came to Jerusalem, unless this is he who alone is King of kings, God and Redeemer, Jesus. He is kind, gentle and abundant in mercy for all those who call upon him, as it is written.
