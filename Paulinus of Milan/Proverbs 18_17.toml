He is his own accuser who, instead of waiting, anticipates his accuser, so as to lighten his own sin by confession, lest he have something which his adversary may accuse. And for this reason, Scripture says, “The just is first accuser of himself.” For he snatches away the voice of his adversary and by the confession of his own sins breaks to pieces the teeth prepared for the prey of hostile accusation. In so doing he gives honor to God, to whom all things are exposed, and who wishes the life rather than the death of the sinner. Indeed, to the penitent himself confession alone does not suffice, unless correction of the deed follows, with the result that the penitent does not continue to do deeds which demand repentance.
