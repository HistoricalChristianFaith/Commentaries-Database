Illness of the soul is much more serious than that of the body. Bodily ills cause temporal death, but illness of the spirit brings eternal death. Indeed, when in paradise Adam transgressed the divine commandment, he did not contract an illness of the body but an illness of the soul, by which he would have perished eternally if the grace of Christ had not rescued him from death. Listen to the prophet who proclaims this, when he says, “By his wounds we have all been healed.” The wounds and the passion of the Lord were the remedy that healed humanity. In fact, illnesses of the soul are not healed by the medical arts but only by the grace of Christ. The fever of sin and the wounds of guilt are sicknesses of the soul, which do not enter the body from the outside but from within the soul. These wounds of the soul are not healed by human beings but by God—not by the incision of an earthly knife but by the sword of the divine Word that penetrates into the depths of the soul. Listen to the prophet declare that “it was not an herb or an ointment that cured them but your word, O Lord, which heals everyone.” And the words of David, “He sent his word to heal them.” And rightly the prophet prays to the Lord about the iniquity of the Jewish people in these terms, “Is there no balm in Gilead, no physician there? Why therefore does not the health of your people recover?” The prophet does not speak of just any balm but of a heavenly remedy, nor of a human physician but of a physician who is God.
