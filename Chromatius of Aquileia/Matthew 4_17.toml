The voice of the Lord urging the people to repentance—the Holy Spirit made it known to the people that they might take heed, saying, “Today, when you hear his voice, do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion, as in the day of testing in the wilderness.” In the same psalm above, he made clear that he was urging the sinful people to repentance and showed the state of a repentant soul, saying, “Come, let us fall down before him and lament before the Lord who made us, for he is our God.” The Lord urges the people to repentance, and he promises to pardon their sins, according to Isaiah’s words: “I, even I, am the one who wipes out your iniquities, and I will not be mindful of your sins. But you be mindful, declare first your iniquities that you may be justified.” Rightly then does the Lord urge the people to repentance when he says, “Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand,” so that through this confession of sins they may be made worthy to approach the kingdom of heaven. For no one can receive the grace of the heavenly God unless one has been cleansed of every stain of sin by the confession of repentance, through the gift of the saving baptism of our Lord and Savior.
