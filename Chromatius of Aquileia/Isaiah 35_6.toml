But that these five thousand men are signs of divine power, the Lord himself predicted through the prophet, saying, “Behold, I and the children whom God has given me will be signs in the house of Israel from the Lord of hosts on Mount Zion.” The same prophet later revealed the nature of these future signs when he said, “Then the eyes of the blind will be opened, and the ears of the deaf will hear, and the lame will leap like deer.” We can recognize the fulfillment of this prophecy in the lame man who had been unable to walk since birth.If we look closely, we can also recognize the sacraments prefigured mystically in him, for the lame man received healing while looking toward Peter and John when he was at the Beautiful Gate of the temple. We too were lame prior to coming to the knowledge of Christ, in the sense that we were limping along the way of righteousness. Our halting strides were not those of the body, however, but those of the interior life. Whoever has gone astray from the way of righteousness or from the way of truth is altogether lame, even if his feet and legs are healthy, since he limps with his mind and soul. For the journey of faith and truth is traveled not with bodily steps but with strides of the interior life.
