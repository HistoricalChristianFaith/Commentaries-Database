How important a place the unanimity and harmony of brothers hold with God! We can know from this very fact that the Lord has clearly said that when two or three pray in unanimity, the Father grants everything from heaven. For with God nothing is more pleasing than brotherly peace, nothing better than unanimity and harmony, according to what is written: “Behold, how good and pleasant it is when brothers dwell in unity. And again: “There is great peace among those who love your name, and there is no stumbling block for them.” And in another place: “The God who makes us live in harmony in the house.” So Isaiah also testified: “Lord,” he said, “our God, give us peace. For you have given us everything.” That this harmony of brothers is pleasing to God, the Holy Spirit declared through Solomon, saying, “There are three things which are pleasing to God and men: harmony of brothers, love of one’s neighbors and the union of man and woman.” So quite rightly the Lord in this passage testifies that when two or three come together on earth, whatever they ask for, all is granted by the Father.
