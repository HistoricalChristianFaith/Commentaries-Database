John put it clearly to the Pharisees and Sadducees who had come to him for baptism when he said, “Brood of vipers! Who has shown you how to flee from the wrath to come? Therefore, produce fruit that matches genuine repentance.” Those who for a long time were called God’s children are now by reason of their faults called a brood of vipers, because by doing the will of the devil, who from the beginning was called a snake, they made themselves the devil’s children. “The devil is your father, and it is your will to fulfill your father’s desires.”
