Joseph therefore learns from the angel about the sacrament of the heavenly mystery and happily complies with the angelâ€™s word. Rejoicing, he abides by the divine plan. He accepts holy Mary and glories in exultant praise because he was deemed worthy to hear that the virgin mother of such great majesty was called by the angel to be his wife.
