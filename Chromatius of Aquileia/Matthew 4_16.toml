The Evangelist commemorated in this passage the prophet’s words: “Beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles: the people who sat in darkness have seen a great light.” In what darkness? Certainly in the profound error of ignorance. What great light did they see? The light concerning which it is written: “He was the true light that illumines every- one who comes into this world.” This was the light about which the just man Simeon in the Gospel declared, “A light of revelation to the Gentiles and a glory for your people Israel.” That light had arisen according to what David had announced, saying, “A light has arisen in the darkness to the upright of heart.” Also, Isaiah demonstrated that light about to come for the enlightenment of the church when he said, “Arise, shine; for your light has come, and the glory of the Lord has risen upon you.” Concerning that light also Daniel noted, “It reveals the profound and hidden things, knowing those things which are in darkness and the light is with it,” that is, the Son with the Father, for even as the Father is light, so too is the Son light. And David also speaks in the psalm: “In your light shall we see light,” for the Father is seen in the Son, as the Lord tells us in the Gospel: “Who sees me, sees the Father.” From the true light, indeed, the true light proceeded, and from the invisible the visible. “He is the image of the invisible God,” as the apostle notes.

Concerning this light, the Evangelist points out in the present passage: “The people who sat in darkness have seen a great light.” They see not with bodily contemplation—for the light is invisible—but with the eyes of faith and in the mind’s eye. Therefore he says, “The people who sat in darkness have seen a great light, and for those who sat in the region and shadow of death light has dawned.” Therefore not only to those who were in darkness did this light appear, but he says that a light has arisen for those sitting in the region and shadow of death. This shows that there were others who were sitting in darkness—established in the region and shadow of death. And what is this region and shadow of death if not the region of the infernal abode, about which David speaks: “Even though I walk in the valley of the shadow of death, I shall fear no evil, for you are with me”? He shall not fear any evil, that is, the punishments of hell. Therefore a saving light has arisen for those who are seated in the region and shadow of death, that is, Christ the Son of God who says in the Gospel: “I am the true light. He who follows me shall not walk in darkness.”He who after his venerable and life-giving passion and death went down into the region of the infernal abode suddenly introduced the light of his majesty upon those who were shrouded in death, so that he might free those who were being held among the dead in expectation of his arrival, as the Lord himself in the person of Wisdom says through Solomon: “I will go down into the depths of the earth and gaze upon all those who are asleep, and I shall enlighten those who hope in God.”
