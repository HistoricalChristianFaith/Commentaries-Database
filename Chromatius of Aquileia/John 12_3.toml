See the humility of this holy woman. She does not anoint his head but his feet. It is only afterward that she anoints the Lord’s head. Therefore, first she washes his feet and then his head. But she began at his feet so that she might be found worthy to proceed [to anoint] his head. For “those who are humble,” as it is written, “will be exalted, and those who are exalted will be humbled.” … And she wipes his feet not with a towel but with her hair so that she might exhibit even greater service to the Lord.… Allegorically, the woman was anticipating the figure of the church who truly in the fullness of faith brings its devotion to Christ. And this he freely receives as a very precious perfume.
