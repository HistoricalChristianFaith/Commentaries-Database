Isaiah predicted this would happen when he said, “He himself took our infirmities and bore our sickness.” To this end the teacher of life and heavenly physician Christ the Lord had come that by his direction he might educate people to life and with his heavenly medicine cure the sickness of body and soul, that he might free bodies beset by the devil and restore those persons afflicted by various infirmities to true and complete health. By the word of divine power he cured the weaknesses of the body, but by the medicine of heavenly teaching he healed the wounds of the soul. David clearly noted that the wounds of the soul are healed by God alone when he said, “Bless the Lord, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits,” to which he added, “who forgives all your iniquity, who heals all your diseases.” He is the true and perfect physician therefore who gives healing to the body and restores the soul to health: our Lord and Savior.
