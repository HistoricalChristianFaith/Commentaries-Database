The grace of this time in which John was exhorting sinners to repentance and baptizing those who confessed their sins in the desert, Isaiah previously witnessed when he said, “The desert will rejoice and blossom like the lily. The desert of the Jordan will bloom and exult. Strengthen the hands of the abandoned and bolster their weak knees. You who are lowly of soul, be encouraged and do not fear.”
