Concerning the light Daniel noted, “It reveals the profound and hidden things, knowing those things that are in the darkness and the light is with it,” that is, the Son with the Father, for even as the Father is light, so too is the Son light. And David also speaks in the psalm: “In your light shall we see light,” for the Father is seen in the Son, as the Lord tells us in the Gospel: “Who sees me, sees the Father.” From the true light, indeed, the true light proceeded, and from the invisible the visible.
