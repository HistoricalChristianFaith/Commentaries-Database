In the face of the storm the Lord got into the boat and the wind ceased. Those who were in the boat came and worshiped him. This signifies that Our Lord and Savior, once the storm of persecution had passed, would come again in the last days to his disciples and his church. For this he made holy Peter the first of the apostles and commended his sheep to him, saying, “Feed my sheep.” When the apostles in the church of believers, positioned in the vessel as it were, beheld the glory of the Lord’s resurrection, adoring our Lord and Savior, they declared to the human race that he was truly the Son of God.
