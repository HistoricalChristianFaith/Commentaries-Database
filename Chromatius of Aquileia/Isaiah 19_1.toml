But Isaiah announced the Lord’s future trip to Egypt some time ago when he said, “Behold, the Lord will be seated upon a light cloud and will come to Egypt.” By this saying, the mystery of the Lord’s incarnation is clearly shown. For because the Lord himself, “dawning from on high,” is called “the sun of justice,” it is not without merit that he was foretold to be coming “upon a light cloud,” that is, in a holy body which no sin was able to weigh down. It was under the veil of this corporeal cloud that he concealed the light of his majesty.

To make himself visible, the “sun of justice” assumed a human body like a cloud, according to which it was said, “Behold, the Lord will come upon a light cloud.” What is the cloud upon which the Lord, the sun of justice, was predicted to arrive if not the cloud of the human body, through which the appearance of his divine radiance was shielded? But just as the sun is less visible to us when covered by a cloud, even though its nature remains unchanged, so also the Son of God did not cease to retain the glory of his divinity when he covered his radiance with the cloud of a human body. The Gospel said that “his face shone like the sun and his clothing was made as white as snow” to show the power of his divine radiance, through which even his clothing was made white like snow. “And behold, Moses and Elijah appeared and spoke with them,” it continues. The Lord had already promised the glory of this vision long ago to the same Moses, saying, “You will see my back [posteriora mea].” He used “posterior” here to indicate that he would reveal himself to Moses at a posterior time, after his assumption of the body. “But Peter responded and said to him, ‘Lord, it is good for us to be here. If you like, let’s pitch three tents here, one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.’ ”
