For Herod, as we have said, in his desire to destroy the Savior of the world, sent word to Bethlehem and commanded that all children two years of age and under be killed, figuring the age according to the time that he had learned from the magi. He thought that his edict would reach even to the Lord himself, the source of life. The Holy Spirit had already foreseen his wickedness beforehand. Solomon, speaking for the church, had said, “Who will give to you my brother, the one who nurses at the breast of his mother?” Moreover, by saying, “Who will give to you?” he was demonstrating that Herod would have no power over him who is the Lord and Prince of all powers. Thus the Lord spoke rightly when he bore witness about himself through the same Solomon: “Evil men will seek and not find me. For they hate wisdom and moreover have not partaken of the Word of God and have had no desire for it.” The Spirit also said through David: “Since you are the one who gave birth to me, you are my hope, my mother, from the time I nursed at your breast … you are my protector.” The blessed Moses also relates that Christ the Lord, an infant, could not have been killed while still nursing. He gave witness to this with his words, “You will not cook a lamb in the milk of its own mother.” In this exact statement Moses revealed the expectation that Christ our Lord would be the true Lamb of God who was to suffer at the appointed time.

In Bethlehem therefore all the babies were slain. These innocents who died then on Christ’s behalf became the first martyrs of Christ. David refers to them when he says, “From the mouths of nursing babies you have perfected praise because of your enemies, that you might bring ruin to the enemy.” … For in this persecution even tiny infants and nursing babies were killed on Christ’s behalf and attained to the consummate praise of martyrs. Meanwhile the wicked king Herod was destroyed, he who had usurped the realm to defend himself against the king of the heavens. Thus it is that those blessed babes have deservedly lasted beyond others. They were the first who were worthy to die on Christ’s behalf.
