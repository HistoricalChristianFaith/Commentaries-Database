There is no doubt this axe signifies the power of the divine word, for God says through Jeremiah the prophet: “Is not my word like fire, says the Lord, and like a hammer which breaks the rock in pieces?” Therefore this axe which is laid at the very roots of interior faith in this forest of humanity always implies the severe threat of divine judgment. Unfruitful trees or barren people, bearing no fruit of faith, will be cut down and consigned to perpetual fire.
