There is no doubt that the boat symbolizes the church, bearing in mind what the Holy Spirit says, through Solomon: “She is like a merchant ship, securing her provisions from afar.” This can be speaking of nothing other than the church for these reasons: under the guidance of the Lord, with the apostles for its pilots, being blown by the Holy Spirit, this church, by the preaching of the Word, races through the whole world. At the same time, it carries with it a treasure of inestimable value, with which it has purchased the whole human race, and indeed the whole world: the price is the blood of Christ. Solomon also speaks of this price in another passage when he says, “You cannot trace the path of a ship that crosses the sea.” What this means to say is that the manner of life of the church is not according to the principles of this world but according to the norms of the heavenly life, as the holy apostle reminds us: “But our homeland is in heaven.”
