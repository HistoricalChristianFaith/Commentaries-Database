Although these blind men had no bodily eyes, they had the vision of faith and heart with which they were able to see the true and eternal Light, the Son of God, about whom it is written: “He was the true light which illumines everyone, coming into the world.” It was he who had predicted through the prophet Isaiah that he would come to give sight to the blind: “The Spirit of the Lord is upon me because he has anointed me. He has sent me to evangelize the poor and to restore sight to the blind.” Again Isaiah testified about the same one elsewhere: “Behold, our God will restore justice; he will come and save us. Then the eyes of the blind will be opened and the ears of the deaf will hear.” David also bore witness to him, saying through the Holy Spirit: “The Lord raises up the downcast, the Lord frees the imprisoned, the Lord gives sight to the blind.”
