Therefore John exhorted those coming to him. He preached that the sins they had committed by transgressing the precepts of divine law could be cleansed by repentance. Thus by satisfying God with worthy repentance they might receive forgiveness from him who said through the prophet: “I have no pleasure in the death of anyone … so turn and live.” And again: “Turn to me, says the Lord of Hosts, and I will turn to you.” And again: “I am the Lord who does not remember wickedness, provided one turn from his evil ways and all his iniquities so that he may live.”
