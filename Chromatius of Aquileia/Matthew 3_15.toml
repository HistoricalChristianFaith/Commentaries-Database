The Lord here is testing the faithful deference of service on the part of his servant, but he reveals the mystery of his dispensation by saying, “Let it be so now; for thus it is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness,” showing this to be true righteousness, that he the Lord and Master should fulfill in himself every sacrament of our salvation. Therefore the Lord did not want to be baptized for his own sake but for ours, in order to fulfill all righteousness. Indeed, it is only right that whatever someone instructs another to do, he should first do himself. Since the Lord and Master of the human race had come, he wanted to teach by his example what must be done for disciples to follow their Master and for servants their Lord.
