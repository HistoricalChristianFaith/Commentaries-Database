Elsewhere, the Holy Spirit also speaks of the Virgin about to give birth when he says, “There will come forth a rod out of the root of Jesse, and a flower will arise from his root.” The rod from the root of Jesse signifies the Virgin Mary, who found her origins in the stem of Jesse through David. For, as the Evangelist or apostle reveals, out of the tribe of David came the Virgin Mary, from whom the flower of human flesh arose in Christ. This is the rod which, having been placed in the ark of testimony to be a sign for everlasting memory, has now by a new and wonderful mystery, without moisture from the earth, brought forth the fruit of the almond. It is by this miracle that Aaron’s priesthood was confirmed.
