Therefore, son, pray, ask, as a certain author says in his verses, and repeat with him, “To you be praise, honor and power. You who are rich in all things, give me wisdom.” And further, “Give me wisdom, who is enthroned beside you, and do not exclude me from the number of your children. Send her from your holy heavens, send her from your glorious throne, so that she would help me and be with me in my labors, so that I may distinguish good from evil and choose what is best.” Love her from your youth, seek her unceasingly, invoking God. If God in his goodness grants her to you, love her, and she will embrace you, and you will be happier if she remains in your possession.
