“Love righteousness,” so as to show yourself just in your affairs. In fact, “the Lord is righteous, and he has loved righteousness,” and he always loves it; “his face has looked on uprightness.” In those days, he who said, “Love righteousness, you rulers of the earth,” both loved righteousness greatly and counseled that it be loved. And another said, “If you speak of righteousness, judge uprightly.” In fact, it is written, “With the judgment that you judge, you will be judged.”
