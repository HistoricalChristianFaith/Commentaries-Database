If you love God with your whole heart and meditate on the books of the Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments, committing yourself to doing what you have read, then the spirit of wisdom will rest on you. Indeed, “all wisdom comes from the Lord” (and it could not be otherwise), since, “it has always been with him and exists from before time.” If you seek it and keep it once you find it, you will be blessed and can be called wise. Moreover, “it will guide you on a marvelous way,” sustaining and protecting you with its holy right hand. It will bring you to eternal life, which gives happiness, and will let you feel its embrace, and on you will rest the spirit of wisdom.
