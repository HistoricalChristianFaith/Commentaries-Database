And Paul has declared his [Christ’s] proper and peculiar, natural and excellent sonship when he thus says of God: “Who spared not his own Son, but for us,” who were not his natural sons, “delivered him up.” For to distinguish him from those who are not properly sons, he said that he was his own Son. And in the Gospel we read, “This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.” Moreover, in the Psalms the Savior says, “The Lord has said to me, You are my Son.” Where, showing that he is the true and genuine Son, he signifies that there are no other genuine sons besides himself. And what, too, is the meaning of this: “From the womb before the morning I begat you”? Does he not plainly indicate the natural sonship of paternal begetting, which he obtained not by the careful framing of his manners, not by the exercise of and increase in virtue, but by property of nature? Wherefore, the only-begotten Son of the Father, indeed, possesses a flawless sonship; but the adoption of rational sons belongs not to them by nature but is prepared for them by the uprightness of their life and by the free gift of God. And it [human nature] is mutable, as Scripture recognizes: “For when the sons of God saw the daughters of men, they took for themselves wives,” etc. And in another place: “I have nourished and brought up children, but they have rebelled against me,” as we find God speaking by the prophet Isaiah.
