Paul, too, having learnt these things from the Saviour, wrote, "In the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils which turn away from the truth."

Now concerning their blasphemous assertion who say that the Son does not perfectly know the Father, we need not wonder. Indeed, having once purposed in their mind to wage war against Christ, they impugn also these words of his, “As the Father knows Me, even so know I the Father.” … Moreover, concerning these very men, warnings are not wanting to us, for the Lord foretold, “Take heed that you are not deceived: for many shall come in My name, saying, I am Christ; and the time draws near: do not go therefore after them.” Paul, too, having learned these things from the Savior, wrote, “In the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils which turn away from the truth.”
