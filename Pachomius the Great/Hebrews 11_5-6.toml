Become guileless and be like the guileless sheep whose wool is sheared off without their saying a word. Do not go from one place to another, saying, “I will find God here or there.” God has said, “Do I not fill heaven and earth?” and again, “When you pass through the waters, I will be with you”;49 and again, “The rivers shall not overwhelm you.” My son, be aware that God is within you, so that you may dwell in God’s law and commandments. Behold, the thief was on the cross, and he entered paradise; but behold, Judas was among the apostles, and he betrayed his Lord. Behold, Rahab was in prostitution, and she was numbered among the saints; but behold, Eve was in paradise, and she was deceived. Behold, Job was on the dung heap, and he was compared with his Lord; but behold, Adam was in paradise, and he fell away from the commandment. Behold, the angels were in heaven, and they were hurled into the abyss; but behold Elijah and Enoch, who were raised into the kingdom of heaven. “Seek the Lord and his strength, seek his presence continually!” Seek God out like Abraham, who obeyed God and offered his son in sacrifice to God, who called him “my friend.” Seek God out like Joseph, who did battle against impurity, so that he was made ruler over his enemies. Seek him out like Moses, who followed his Lord, and God made him lawgiver and let him come to know God’s own likeness. Daniel sought God out, and God taught him great mysteries; God saved him from the lions’ gullet. The three saints sought God out and found God in the fiery furnace. Job took refuge with God, and God cured him of his sores. Susanna sought God out, and God saved her from the hands of the wicked. Judith sought God out and found God in the tent of Holofernes. All these sought God out, and God delivered them; and God delivered others also.
