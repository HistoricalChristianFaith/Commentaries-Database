On another occasion when he was sitting by himself some place reading the book of the twelve prophets, he came to the prophet Micah. An angel of the Lord appeared to him and asked him about this verse from Micah: “Like water coming down from its source.” He said to him, “What do you think it means?” While he was still puzzling over it, trying to understand, the angel answered, “Theodore, why do you not perceive its meaning? Is it not obvious that it is the water of the river coming down from paradise?” As soon as the angel had said this, he ceased to see him.
