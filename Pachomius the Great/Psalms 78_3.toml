Instructed by the holy Scriptures and especially by the gospel, Pachomius endured many temptations from the demons. The holy Scriptures did not mention in detail the saints’ struggle, since they used concise language in showing us the way to eternal life. Thus, for example, the law given to our ancestor Abraham was summarized in one saying, “Be well-pleasing before me and be blameless.” But since we are like infants, when our parents break the bread for us, we need to be given as well the true water, as it is written. Therefore, “what we have heard and known and our ancestors have told us should not be hidden from the next generation.” For, as we have been taught, we know that these words of the psalm are about the signs and portents accomplished by God for Moses and those after him. And after the model of the benefit given by them, we have also recognized in the parents of our time their children and imitators, so that to us and “to the rising generation,” until the end of the world, it might be made known that “Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today and forever.”
