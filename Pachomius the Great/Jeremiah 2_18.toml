Truly, I fear that our parents according to the flesh will be found to condemn us and to quote the words of Scripture, “How have you become wretched, greatly put to shame? Great is your affliction; a fire is kindled on you; your branches have become useless.” For this cause they have become a prey. The lions have roared at it and have given out their voice against it. For this reason, the beloved are like the abhorred and the crown of your head is taken away. Cities that face the south, how are you shut off? There is nobody to give access to you. Let indeed the wicked be removed, that he may not see the glory of the Lord.

My child, flee to God, for it is he who created you. It was for you that he underwent these sufferings. For he said, “I gave my back to the whips and my cheek to the slaps. I did not turn my face away from the shame of spittle.” O mortal, what is the good of your going to Egypt, to drink the water of the Geon that is churned up?
