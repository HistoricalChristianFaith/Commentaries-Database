As for us, brothers, understanding these things, let us keep each to his own measure, the one who is considered a shepherd of souls as well as the one who is considered a sheep. Yet let us all pray to be sheep, for no one is the shepherd save he who said, “I am the good Shepherd.” But when he appeared, as David had foretold and signified, “God is the Lord, and he has appeared to us,” God the Word appearing in human form saved us, bestowing on us knowledge of the faith. And before going up into heaven, he established the apostles as his successors, saying to Peter, “Feed my lambs” and “Look after my sheep.” For this reason there is need now too for people who, generation after generation, feed the souls in the Lord, who says, “I am with you.” For we know that after the apostles it is the bishops who are the fathers. But all those who listen to Christ who is in them are also their children, although they do not belong to the clergy and have no ecclesiastical rank.
