Become guileless, and be like the guileless sheep whose wool is sheared off without their saying a word. Do not go from one place to another saying, “I will find God here or there.” God has said, I fill the earth, “I fill the heavens,” and again, “If you cross the water, I am with you.” - "Instructions 1.25"
