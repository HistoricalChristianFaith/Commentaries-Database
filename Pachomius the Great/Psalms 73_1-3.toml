If someone speaks like this: “If ever someone is deceived or snatched away in one of these [abysses], is he already lost and has he no longer repentance,” I will tell him that a person who has repentance and a true understanding regarding the faith and God’s commandments, with a zeal for this, even if he comes close to falling through negligence, yet the Lord will not let him be lost altogether. As it is written, “My feet were on the point of stumbling.” He shows him his grace through the scourge of a sickness or a grief or the shame of his offense, so that becoming conscious [of his negligence] he may walk in the middle of the narrow path until he arrives and may not wander a single foot off, because the path is four cubits wide. He who wanders off is like Judas, who after receiving great benevolence from the Lord and seeing great signs—even the resurrection of the dead—“having the purse,” was not aware of grace. Because of this he was completely lost through love of money and betrayal. But the good, although as people with free will they may somehow have neglected what is fitting, are still “refined through fire like silver” casting away rust. This is why blessed David says, “I, in the abundance of your mercy, will enter your house.” If he says this, how much more we wretches!
