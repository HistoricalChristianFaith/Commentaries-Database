While he was still praying, an angel of the Lord, very terrifying, appeared to him, having in his hand a fiery sword unsheathed. He said to our father Pachomius, “Just as God has blotted out his name from the ‘Book of Life,’ just so do you drive them out from the midst of the brothers, for they are not ignorant. Indeed, even to the ignorant, impurities of this sort seem like abominations before God.” When it was morning he put them in worldly clothing and told them, “Go and do as is fitting to the clothes whose practices you have made your own.” And he expelled them from among the brothers. The words of the prophet were fulfilled about them, “I will drive them out of my house, and I will love them no longer.”
