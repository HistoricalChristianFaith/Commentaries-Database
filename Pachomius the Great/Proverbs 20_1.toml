As it is said, “The priest and the prophet were deranged by wine.” “Wine is licentious, drunkenness is bold. The person who indulges in them will not be exempt from sin.” Wine is a good thing if you drink it with moderation. “If you set your eyes on cups and goblets you will walk naked as a pestle.” Therefore, all who have prepared to become disciples of Jesus should abstain from wine and drunkenness.
