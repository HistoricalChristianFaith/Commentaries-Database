Whoever offers God his choicest goods is likened to Abel’s works, while the one who brings cheap things is likened to the works of Cain or to the one who laughed at his father and went to tell his two brothers, or again to the one who decided to build a tower in the plain of Shinar, forgetting the one who had piloted him on the boat and had saved him from the water of the flood and blessed his fathers. Now he said, fleeing, “Come, let us dress stones and cut sycamores and cedars, and let us build a tower for ourselves.”
