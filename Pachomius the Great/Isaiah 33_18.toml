And if you want all these thoughts to diminish in you and not to have power over you, then recite in your heart without ceasing every fruit that is written in the Scriptures, having in yourself the resolution to walk in them, as it is written in Isaiah, “Your heart shall meditate on the fear”of the Lord, and all these things shall cease from you, little by little.
