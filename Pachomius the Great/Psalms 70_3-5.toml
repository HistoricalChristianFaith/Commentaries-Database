Now is the time to act for the Lord, because our salvation is in a time of affliction. If “those who love his salvation” can “know his steps” and “say constantly: God is great”;6 and if they can say, “My hope shall be in you always,” will they believe only in time of joy and not believe in time of affliction?It is written indeed, “What came out of your mouth, do diligently,” and again, “If you have made a prayer to the Lord, do not delay to render [what you have promised], lest the Lord claim it from you and it be for you a sin.” If you say, “My hope shall be in you always,” may you be found confident in time of affliction, in which is salvation.
