“O wretched person, you have estranged yourself completely from the Lord. But the Lord is good, and he never ‘kept his anger for a testimony, for he delights in mercy,’ and he is ‘able to sink our sins in the depths of the sea,’ for ‘as far as the heavens are from the earth, so far away does he set our sins from us. For he desires not the death of the sinner but his repentance,’ and that the person who has fallen should not remain in his fallen condition but should rise up, and that he who has turned away should not go far off but return quickly to him. Therefore, despair not of yourself; ‘there is hope’ of salvation. For, as it is said, ‘if a tree is cut down, it will sprout again.’45 Then, if you will even now listen to me in everything I say to you, you shall have forgiveness from God.” He answered with tears, “In all things I will listen to you from now on, O father!”
