When a thought oppresses you, do not be downhearted but put up with it in courage, saying, “They swarmed around me closer and closer, but I drove them back in the name of the Lord.” Divine help will arrive at your side immediately, and you will drive them away from you, and courage will compass you round about, and the glory of God will walk with you; and “you will be filled to your soul’s desire.” For the ways of God are humility of heart and gentleness. It is said indeed, “Whom shall I consider if not the humble and the meek?” If you move ahead in the ways of the Lord, he will watch over you, will give you strength and will fill you with knowledge and wisdom. Your remembrance will remain before him at all times. He will deliver you from the devil, and in your dying day he will grant you his peace.
