And now, my child, if you take God as your hope, he will be your help in the time of your anguish; “for anyone who comes to God must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who search for him.” These words were written for us, that we may believe in God and do battle, great and little, by fastings, prayers and other religious practices. God will not forget even the saliva that has dried in your mouth as a result of fasting. On the contrary, everything will be returned to you at the moment of your anguish. Only humble yourself in all things, hold back your word even if you understand the whole affair. Do not quietly acquire the habit of abusing; on the contrary, joyfully put up with every trial. For if you knew the honor that results from trials you would not pray to be delivered from them, because it is preferable for you to pray, to weep and to sigh until you are saved, rather than to relax and be led off a captive. O man, what are you doing in Babylon? “You have grown old in an alien land” because you did not submit to the test and because your relations with God are not proper. Therefore, brother, you must not relax.
