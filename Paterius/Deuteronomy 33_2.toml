What does God’s left hand mean, except the reprobate, who are to be placed at God’s left hand? The elect are called God’s right hand. For at God’s right hand there is a fiery law, because by no means do the elect hear the heavenly commands with cold hearts but flame up at these commands like torches of inner love. The word comes to their ears, and their minds burn with the flame of inner sweetness.
