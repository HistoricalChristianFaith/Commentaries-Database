The saints are certain of their hope, even if, as the Psalmist gives them voice, they always fear temptation. “Let my heart rejoice that it may fear your name.” Note that it does not say, “Let my heart rejoice because it feels secure,” but “Let it rejoice that it may fear.” They remember, in fact, that though their works may have been successful, they are still in this life, about which Job says, “Life on earth is a trial.” They have also remembered what is written, “A corruptible body weighs down the soul, and the earthy tent burdens the mind with many thoughts.” They have remembered and they fear, and they don’t dare convince themselves they are secure. Rather, poised between the joy of hope and the fear of temptation, they trust and they fear, they feel comforted and they hesitate, they are certain and uncertain.
