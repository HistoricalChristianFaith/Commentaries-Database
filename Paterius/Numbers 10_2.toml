“Make for yourself two trumpets of hammered silver.” The army is led by two trumpets because the people are called to readiness in faith by the two commandments of charity. Scripture bids them to be made of silver, so that the words of the preachers may shine with gleaming light and not confuse the minds of the hearers with any darkness of their own. They are to be hammered, because those who preach the life to come grow through the blows of the present tribulations. Scripture says well, “When the short signal sounds, the camps will move.” When the preacher’s word is subtle and concise, the hearers are aroused more ardently for the struggle against temptation.
