To take (accipere) means “to take away.” Thus those birds that are eager to seize other birds are called hawks (accipiter). Paul says, “For you bear it, if anyone consumes you, if anyone takes you.” The same would be true if he said, if anyone seizes you. The sinner’s confession is like the pledge of a debtor. For the pledge is received from the debtor when the sinner makes his confession of sin. The upper and lower millstones in this confession are hope and fear. Hope draws us up to the heights. Fear keeps the heart low. But upper and lower millstones must be joined together; one without the other is useless. Thus in the sinner’s confession, hope and fear should always be joined, because the sinner hopes in vain for mercy if he does not also fear justice. In vain did he fear justice if he does not also trust in mercy. Hence merely an upper millstone or a lower millstone alone may not be taken as a pledge. One who preaches to a sinner should compose his sermon with such balance that he does not take away fear by offering hope alone or leave the sinner only in fear by taking away hope. For the upper or lower millstone is taken away if the preacher’s tongue separates either fear from hope or hope from fear in the sinner’s heart. Exposition of the Old and New Testament, Deuteronomy
