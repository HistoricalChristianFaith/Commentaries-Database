Moses says this with regard to the holy church. Shoe in Holy Scripture means the office of preaching, as is written, “Feet have been shod in preparation for the gospel of peace.” Since iron means virtue and bronze means perseverance, a man’s shoes are said to be iron and bronze when his preaching is strengthened with incisiveness and persistence. With iron he penetrates opposing evils, and with bronze he preserves the good he had patiently proposed.
