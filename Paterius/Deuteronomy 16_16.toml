He appears emptyhanded in the sight of the Lord who brings none of the fruits of his labor with him. One man seethes with desire to increase his power; another pants with longing to gather praise. But because the dying man leaves all these things behind, he appears before the Lord emptyhanded, for he brings nothing with him when he appears before the judge. Thus the law admonishes us to good effect when it says, “You will not appear emptyhanded in the sight of the Lord.” For the man who does not plan for the reward of a meritorious life by acting well appears emptyhanded in the sight of the Lord. The psalmist says of the just, “coming they will come rejoicing, carrying their sheaves.” They who come to the judge’s court carrying sheaves are the ones who display in themselves good works by which they merit life.
