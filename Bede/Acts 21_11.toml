Agabus is imitating the ancient prophets who were accustomed to say, “The Lord God says this,” because the Holy Spirit is Lord and God in the same way as the Father and the Son are, and it is impossible to separate the operation of those whose nature and will are one. Hence too we read above, “The Holy Spirit said, ‘Set apart for me Barnabas and Saul for the work for which I have called them,’ ” namely, the office of apostle. And Paul himself writes, “Paul, an apostle, sent not from people or by people but by Jesus Christ and God the Father.” We have said these things so that no one might believe, following Macedonius, that the Holy Spirit is a creature or of less authority than the Father or the Son.
