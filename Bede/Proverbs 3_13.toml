Blessed is the man who finds wisdom, etc. Because he was comforting those placed under discipline and correction, he adds what he had begun; insinuating that true blessedness of man is not to be free from adversity in the present, but to rejoice in the perception of eternal wisdom. Which is, to know God's will in this life, and to enjoy his vision in the future. And well did he say, "Blessed is the man who finds wisdom," adding immediately, "And the man who gains understanding." For there are those who find wisdom by hearing the doctrine of truth; but they neglect to gain understanding, unwilling to expand the bosom of their heart to perceive its breadth.
