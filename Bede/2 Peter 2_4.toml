It is to be remembered that the wicked angels were not created that way by God. They became evil by their own sins. Therefore they too will have to undergo the last judgment, even though they have already been cast into the fiery prison of the lower depths. Hell is referred to in this way in order to emphasize that it is as far away from the heights of heaven as it can possibly be.
