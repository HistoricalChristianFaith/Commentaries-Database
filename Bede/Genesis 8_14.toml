In the second month, on the twenty-seventh day of the month, the earth was dried. It was stated above that the surface of the ground was dried up in the beginning of the first month; and now, in the second month, nearly completed, it is described as dry because then the ground was dried on the surface with growing grass, so that it could revive and produce anew the grass that the water had consumed. But now it is dried even inwardly to such an extent that it could bear the footsteps of those walking on it, and covered with so many flowering grasses that it was also suitable for the pasturing of animals and beasts of burden.
