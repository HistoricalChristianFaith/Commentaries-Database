Hence it is good that we are told that two bronze pillars of excellent and marvelous work were set up in this porch and that capitals worked to resemble lilies were placed on top of them. The pillars stood in front of the door of the temple because illustrious teachers, concerning whom the apostle says, “James and Cephas and John, who were reputed to be pillars,” precede the coming of our Redeemer, to bear testimony to the coming of the one who said, “I am the door; if anyone enters through me, he will be saved.” One of these [pillars] stood at the right of the door and the other at the left, because they foretold to the people of Israel, then fervent with divine faith and charity, the future incarnation of their Redeemer; and they proclaimed to the Gentiles, still as it were facing north, numb with the cold of unbelief, that this [door] was to be opened to make way for the entry of the Redeemer. That the capitals of the pillars were made by a workman to resemble lilies signifies that the entire import of the preaching [of James, Cephas and John] resounded with the clarity of everlasting happiness and promised that his glory would be seen by their hearers. He who existed as God before the ages became a human being at the end of the ages, so that like the flower of the lily he might have a golden color within and be white on the outside. For what is the significance of the glow of gold surrounded by whiteness except the brilliance of divinity in a human being? He first revealed this human being as brilliant because of his virtues, and after his death he clothed him in the snowy white splendor of incorruptibility.
