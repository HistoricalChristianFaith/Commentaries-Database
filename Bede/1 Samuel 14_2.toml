But he did not tell his father the same thing. Jonathan concealed from his father and the people the crossing to the station of the Philistines, as he had planned; for just as it is always most fitting to use the counsel of the spiritual, so sometimes it is useful to hide from the carnal the meditated, or even initiated deeds of the greater virtues; lest either their trepidation frighten and break the tender, so to speak, desire of our mind, or they themselves, by emulating us, attempt what they are not yet capable of beginning, or surely the favor of imperfect praise corrupt the integrity of our spiritual purpose. For as Saul in this place and the people who were with him have not yet made progress in virtues, the following words reveal, when it is said:

Moreover, Saul was staying at the edge of Gibeah, etc. For indeed, it pertains to the indication of virtue that he dwelled in Gibeah, that is, the hill, under a pomegranate tree, and had six hundred companions. As we have already said above, the hill represents the height of virtues; the covering of the pomegranate tree represents the protection of the Lord's cross; the number six hundred of the soldiers signifies those perfect in hope and action. But that he sat at the edge of the hill, that the tree under whose shade he was covered was situated in Migron, that is, in the throat, are signs of a still imperfect mind, that is, one that has not yet fully attained the desired heights of virtues; one that holds the mystery of the Lord's Passion in speech, but cannot yet imitate it. If we read Magdon instead of Migron according to the ancient interpreters, which means "tempting," it refers to the same sense. Because there are those who, endowed with right faith and enkindled by desires of right action, do not cease to endure the harsh battles of tempting vices: and therefore certain secret matters of these perfect athletes of Christ, which wage wars against unclean spirits, they deliberately hide from such comrades-in-arms.
