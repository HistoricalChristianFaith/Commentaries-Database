When one of those who reclined at table with him heard this, he said to him, "Blessed is the one who will eat bread in the kingdom of God." The bread eaten in the kingdom of God, according to Cerinthus, is not to be understood as food of the body, but truly he who says: "I am the living bread that came down from heaven. If anyone eats of this bread, he will live forever" (John VI). That is, if anyone perfectly incorporated into the sacrament of my Incarnation is deemed worthy to enjoy the vision of my divine majesty, this one will rejoice in the everlasting happiness of immortal life. But because some receive this bread by faith alone, as if by worshipping, but disdain to truly taste its sweetness, the following parable condemns such laxity as unworthy of the heavenly feast.
