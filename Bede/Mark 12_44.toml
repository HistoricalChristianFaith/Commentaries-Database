For all of them have contributed out of their abundance. But she, out of her poverty, has given all she had, her whole livelihood. The Jew contributes to the gifts of God out of his abundance, who, presuming upon his own righteousness, prays to himself thus: God, I thank you that I am not like other men, extortioners, unjust, etc. (Luke 18). But the Church gives all her living to the gifts of God, understanding that all she lives is not by her own merit, but by divine grace, saying: God, be merciful to me, a sinner (Ibid.). And again: I will keep my strength for you, because you are my protector, my God; his mercy will precede me (Psalm 58).
