The Lord, who had warned them to avoid the desire of high place and vain glory, now distinguishes by a sure test those who brought in gifts. Wherefore it is said, “And Jesus sat over against the treasury, and beheld how the people cast money into the treasury. "In the Greek language, “phylassein”, means to keep, and “gaza” is a Persian word for treasure; wherefore the word “gazophylacium”which is here used means a place where riches are kept, which name also was applied to the chest in which the offerings of the people were collected, forthe necessary uses of the temple, and to the porch in which they were kept. You have a notice of the porch in the Gospel, “These words spake Jesus in the treasury as He taught in the temple:”.
Reckoners use the words “quadrans”for the fourth part of any thing, be it place, money, or time. Perhaps then in this place is meant the fourth part of a shekel, this is, five pence. It goes on: “And He called unto Him His disciples, and saith unto them, Verily I say unto you, That this poor widowhath cast more in, than all they which have cast into the treasury:” for God does not weigh the property but the conscience of those who offer; nor did He consider the smallness of the sum in her offering, but what was the store from which it came. Wherefore He adds, “For all they did castin of their abundance, but she of her want did cast in all that she had, evenall her living.”
