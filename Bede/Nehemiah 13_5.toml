Moreover, I shook the folds of my robe and said, 'So may God shake out from his house and out of his labors every man who does not keep this word. So may such a man be shaken out and made a wanderer!' For whoever either refuses to show mercy on poor people or is not ashamed to demand from them, as if lawfully, what they do not have to give, this person is shaken from his house (namely, is cast and shaken out from the fellowship of the Holy Church in which he believed he would remain forever) and deprived of his labors, doubtless, that is, of the fruit of good works in which he believed that he had toiled admirably. For labors performed without piety cannot become fruitful before the Lord. But how greatly this reproach or curse of Nehemiah moved the hearts of all becomes evident when it is immediately added: And the whole assembly said, 'Amen,' and praised God, and then it is added: So the people did as he had said. For when upon hearing his declaration they all responded 'Amen' and, praising God, did what Nehemiah had commanded, it is surely evident that they had not been forced by fear but had received his words in the inmost affection of their heart.
