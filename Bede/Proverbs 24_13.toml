Eat, my son, honey, for it is good, etc. It is very clear why he compares the doctrine of wisdom to honey and the honeycomb, because certainly, as the former surpasses foods, so the latter surpasses other teachings in sweetness. But there is a difference in the significance of each, because the honey, which is ready to eat, implies the moral surface of the letter; but the honeycomb, in which honey is expressed from the wax, figuratively denotes the allegorical speech, where, with the veil of the letter removed, the sense of spiritual sweetness is perceived with some labor or delay.
