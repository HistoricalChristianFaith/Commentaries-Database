But the signatories were Nehemiah the Tirshatha, etc. Another translation has, Nehemiah, who is the Tirshatha; for Nehemiah had two names. Hence it is uniquely added, the son of Hacaliah; which is more clearly indicated above, where it is said: But Nehemiah said, he is the Tirshatha, and Ezra the scribe, and the Levites interpreting to all the people, This day is holy to the Lord our God (Neh. VIII).
