And he placed his life in his hand, etc. The Lord, they say, commended his love for you, which no one has greater, by placing his life for you; so that through death he might destroy him who had the power of death, that is, the devil; and might free those who throughout their whole life were subject to bondage. Many from among our number witnessed the glory of his resurrection, and his ascension into heaven, and rejoiced (Hebr. II).
