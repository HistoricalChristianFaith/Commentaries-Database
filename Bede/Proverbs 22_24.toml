Do not be friends with an irascible man, etc. And although this can generally be taken of any irascible or raging person, yet nothing hinders from understanding it of those who raged with mad minds against the Saviour and His disciples; from whose friendship and company all believing in Him, caring for their salvation, were banned, so that also being neighbors to the wicked they themselves would not perish; which is proven to be possible in Judas Iscariotâ€™s case. Generally, it is said that, just as perfect men should not avoid perverse neighbors, because they often bring them to righteousness and are never drawn to perversity; so, those who are weak should avoid depraved society, lest the evil they often see and cannot correct they be tempted to imitate.
