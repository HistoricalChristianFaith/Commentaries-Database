He separated the disciples, daily disputing in the school of a certain Tyrannus. This happened for three years, etc. At this time, while Paul was staying in Ephesus, it is said that he wrote the first letter to the Corinthians, in which he also mentions Priscilla and Aquila, saying: "Aquila and Priscilla greet you much in the Lord, with the church that is in their house" (1 Cor. XVI). By this word it is also shown that not only did they serve Christ faithfully, but also had a congregation of faithful in their house. Furthermore, the second epistle is said to have been written when he was in Troas: Moreover, the Epistle to the Romans was written later as the record shows. For he himself testifies that he wrote it on his journey to Jerusalem.
