What color the stones were with which the temple was made is openly stated in the book of Paralipomenon when David said to Solomon on showing him the materials of the temple that he had procured, “I have prepared all manner of precious stones and marble of Paros in great abundance.” White marble is called Parian marble because it was produced on the island of that name. Hence the poet writes of it: “[past the] Isle of Olives, and then past snow-white Paros and the Cyclades sprinkled about the sea we sped o’er the waters tossed by many a wind.”
