Do not be with those who bind their hands, etc. Do not be with those who, though free and keeping themselves available to themselves, bind themselves in the care of the salvation of the wicked, promising to render an account to the Lord for their souls. If he for whom you stood surety does not have good works to make you free and secure of your surety, what good is it to you to be judged for his soul on the day of judgment and to lose the habit of righteousness with which you seemed to be clothed? Hence also the Lord: The harvest indeed is plentiful, but the laborers are few (Matt. IX).
