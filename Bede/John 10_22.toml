The first dedication of the temple was by Solomon in the autumn; the second was by Zerubbabel and the priest Jeshua around that same time of year; a third dedication was conducted by Judas Maccabeus during the winter time when he instituted an annual commemoration of the dedication and cleansing of the temple by the priests.
