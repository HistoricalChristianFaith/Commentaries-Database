As the cold of snow in the day of harvest, etc. It seems altogether inopportune to snow in the time of harvest. For we read below: As snow in summer and rain in harvest, so is honor unseemly for a fool. But nevertheless, in the very hot regions of Palestine, it is quite delightful to the reapers if, suddenly, cold, as it is wont to come with snow, arrives; which would somewhat cool the burning of the sun, wipe away the sweat of the laborers, and temper the burning breaths. To this cold, the faithful legate is rightly compared, because by acting prudently, he soothes the mind of him who sent him. Mystically, however, the faithful legate is the catholic teacher; and he who sends him, the Lord. Moreover, the day of harvest in heat is the time of preaching amid the furies of persecutors, about which it is said: The harvest indeed is plentiful (Matthew IX).

The cold of snow in the harvest, etc. There is some quiet for those who preach from the persecution of the resisters. It is therefore rightly said, As the cold of snow in the day of harvest, so is the faithful legate to him who sent him; he makes his soul to rest. Because as it is desirable for the preachers of the word when they receive some refreshment from the rage of the infidels, nor is the ability to teach denied, so it is known to be pleasing to the Lord who sent them to preach, when they faithfully fulfill the commission received from him even amid the adversities of those who oppose. Finally, as Luke recounts, when the disciples returned from the office of preaching, exulting in the Holy Spirit, he gave thanks to the Father, saying: I thank you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, etc. (Luke X).
