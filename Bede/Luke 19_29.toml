And it came to pass, when he approached Bethphage and Bethany, to the mountain called the Mount of Olives, he sent two of his disciples, saying: Go into the village opposite you. Bethphage was a village of priests on the Mount of Olives. Bethany was also a small town or city on the side of the same mountain, about fifteen stadia from Jerusalem, as the evangelist John reveals, where Lazarus was raised from the dead. Whose tomb a church now built there shows. Bethphage means house of the mouth, Bethany means house of obedience. The Savior, about to arrive in Jerusalem, exalted these places with the dignity of his presence, because before his passion he filled many with the gifts of pious confession and spiritual obedience by teaching them. These beautiful cities situated on the Mount of Olives refer to, that is, the very Lord, who refreshes us with anointing of spiritual graces and the light of knowledge and piety. Hence, when he said elsewhere: A city set on a hill cannot be hidden (Matthew V), he immediately added: Nor do they light a lamp and put it under a basket (Ibid.), because the same Mount of Olives, that is, the chief distributor of spiritual graces, who exalts his city to stand out, also anoints it with the oil of gladness so that it can shine. And because the same light did not wish to be put under a basket, he sent the disciples to the village opposite them, that is, he took care to send teachers to penetrate the uneducated and barbaric coasts of the whole world, as though they were the walls of a village placed opposite. And so rightly two are sent, either for the knowledge of truth, and purity of work, or for the sacrament of the twin love, namely of God and neighbor, to be preached throughout the whole world.
