And Peter said: Man, I do not know what you are saying. And immediately, while he was still speaking, the rooster crowed. The sacred Scripture often signifies the merit of causes through the state of times. Hence Peter, who denied in the middle of the night, repented at the crowing of the rooster. Also, after the resurrection, in the light of day, he professed three times that he loved the Lord whom he had denied three times, because evidently what he erred in the darkness of forgetfulness, he corrected in the hope of the remembered light, and having attained the presence of the true light, he fully restored whatever had changed. I think that this rooster should be understood as some teacher who, waking us up and reproving us when we are sleepy, says: Awake, just ones, and do not sin (I Cor. XV).
