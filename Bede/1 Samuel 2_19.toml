And his mother made for him a little tunic. The Lord assumed not only a chaste and free from all sin, but also an entirely humble flesh, which the Church makes for Him, or whoever believes Him rightly and most wholesomely such, or because the virgin, a not ignoble member of the Church, from whom He Himself was born, shines brightly.

Which he offered on the appointed days, etc. And the Church, never deserted by Christ, whom it has with it in secret all the days until the end of the age, ascending on the solemn days of the Mass to sacrifice, carries with it the mysteries of his flesh and blood in wine and bread. Indeed, to the people whom the Church bears for Christ, it instills the habit of humility, which it brings with it through the increase of each one's virtues, progressing to higher things with the grace of Christ, that it may render the vows of thanksgiving to the Father of lights. This is the wedding garment, according to the parable of the Gospel (Matthew 22), that everyone who enters the solemnities of the heavenly kingdom needs. And this was first donned by the Son of the great King himself, the author and sanctifier of spiritual weddings; who, proceeding as a bridegroom from his chamber, humbled himself, becoming obedient unto death (Ezekiel 40; Philippians 2). This tunic de facto small in appearance but great in power, he did not allow to be torn even at the time of his death by those who inflicted death upon him; for he preserved even in death the example of humility which led him to death.
