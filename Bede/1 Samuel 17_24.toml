And all the Israelites, when they saw the man, fled, etc. For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God (Rom. 3). Only Christ could say: The prince of this world is coming, and he has no claim on me (John 14). And therefore David alone despises, and considers as nothing, the pride of the Philistine, whom all the others shunned and fled in fear.
