He said to him: "Lord, I am ready to go with you both to prison and to death." But he said: "I tell you, Peter, the cock will not crow today until you deny three times that you know me." Because the Lord had said that he had prayed for Peter's faith, he, aware of his present fervent affection and faith, but ignorant of his future fall, did not believe that he could in any way fail him. But he who alone knows what is in man, so that no faithful person may either confidently trust in their own stability or carelessly distrust their fall, foretells as God the manner, time, and number of his denial, and as a merciful one promises the help of his protection.
