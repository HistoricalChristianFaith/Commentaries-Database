But Samuel said to the people who were coming: Let us go to Gilgal, etc. With the heretics vanquished, condemned, or corrected, any perfect teacher says to the Church subject to him: Come, with the face of the heart unveiled, let us contemplate the glory of the Lord. For Gilgal is indeed called revelation. And the more we are renewed in the spirit of our mind in the knowledge of him who created us, the more we see the dangers of those we have conquered; because remaining in oldness, they did not want to reveal their way to the Lord and hope in him, nor to supplicate him confidently, and say: Reveal our eyes, that we may behold the wonders of your law (Psalm CXVIII).

And all the people went to Gilgal, etc. Upon hearing the exhortation of their spiritual teachers, the people grew in faith and in the knowledge of the truth, and in the revelation of the heart, illuminating themselves by humbling and despising themselves, sought the glory of Christ in everything, and exalted his name among each other, and for the peace of the Church offered whatever they could of their devotion before the Lord.
