What the psalmist said of the Father concerning our Lord as he rose from the dead, “You have put all things under his feet,” is surely the same as what our Lord himself said to his disciples as he rose, “All power in heaven and on earth has been given to me.” Indeed, even before he rose from the dead, the angelic virtues in heaven knew that they were rightfully subject to the human nature they saw had been specifically assumed by their Maker. Blind human beings on earth, however, disdained to be brought into subjection to one they knew had put on mortality in common with themselves; they declined to understand the divine power in his miracles, since they discerned that there was human weakness present in his sufferings.
