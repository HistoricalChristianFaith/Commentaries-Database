And he went and spoke with the chief priests and magistrates about how he might betray him to them, and they were glad. His saying: He went and spoke, shows that he was invited by the chiefs, not constrained by any necessity, but of his own accord he entered into the plan with a wicked mind.

And they agreed to give him money. And he promised. And he sought an opportunity to betray him without a crowd. Many today shudder at the crime of Judas, who sold his Lord, Master, and God for money, as something monstrous and nefarious, yet they do not beware. For when they speak false testimony against anyone for bribes, surely because they deny the truth for money, they sell the Lord for money. For he said: I am the truth (John 14). When they stain the fellowship of brotherhood with any plague of discord, they betray the Lord, because God is love. Even if no one gives money, they sell the Lord for silver, because they take the image of the prince of the world, that is, the examples of the ancient enemy, ignoring the creator's image to which they were created. For just as John the Baptist, who did not die for the confession of Christ, but for the defense of the truth, yet, therefore, died for Christ because he accepted martyrdom for the truth, so on the contrary, he who scorns the laws of charity and truth indeed betrays Christ, who is truth and love. Especially when he does not sin through weakness or creeping ignorance, but in the likeness of Judas seeks an opportunity to change truth into a lie, virtue into crime, with witnesses absent.
