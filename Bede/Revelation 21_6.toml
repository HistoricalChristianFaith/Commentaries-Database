Just as he testified at the beginning of the book that he was [the Alpha and the Omega], so now this is repeated for the third time, so that no one might believe that there is any other god before him or any other god after him, as Isaiah says. Indeed, since he is speaking of the end of the world, the one who consummates the world should be understood to be the same one as he who was its creator.
