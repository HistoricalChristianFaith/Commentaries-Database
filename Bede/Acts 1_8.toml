But you shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you, and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, etc. When the Holy Spirit comes upon you, he says, it will not bring the kingdom of Israel, or the kingdom of God in Israel, as you suppose, but will provide you with the power to testify about me. And so far off are the times of that kingdom, that first not only this city of Jerusalem, but also all the borders of Judea, and then even the nearby region of Samaria, will be spread by the fame of the Gospel to the ends of the world.
