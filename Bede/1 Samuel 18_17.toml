Therefore, Saul said to David: Behold my daughter Merab, etc. Above, where Saul, through the anointing of holy chrism and the governance of the kingdom, holds the type of Christ, we understood the two daughters of Saul to signify the peoples, who, begotten for salvation by faith in Christ and love, are perfected by the chastisement of body and mind; or certainly, the greater to designate the Synagogue, and the lesser, the Church. However, in this place, because the order of surrounding affairs has changed, David indeed designates the Lord Christ, but Saul, envying him, designates the people of the Jews. Rightly, the elder daughter, who was promised to David but not given, signifies that part of his people which, greater in number and power, was promised as if to be joined to a strong and desirable hand of a bridegroom, when the predecessors of that part, namely the scribes, priests, Pharisees, and elders of the people, would flock to his hearing, call him a good teacher, and not only that but also uniquely wise as a master, whether for the sake of learning or tempting him, would frequent him with questions. However, she was not given to him but to another, when those same teachers, seeking to be called Rabbi by men, forced as many as they could to listen to them instead. The younger daughter, who by loving David deserved to be given to him, is indeed that portion of the Jewish people which, both in smallness and contempt, preferred to follow, love, and hear the Lord Savior rather than the scribes and lawyers, hearing from him: "Do not be afraid, little flock, for it has pleased your Father to give you the kingdom" (Luke 12). Therefore, the Pharisees and other leaders of the Jews said to Christ: Behold, we entrust the greater part of the subjected Synagogue to you for teaching, just see to it that, being strong in spirit, you fight with word for the freedom of the people, who are commanded to keep the law of God and serve Him alone. For we know that you are truthful and do not care for anyone; for you do not regard the person of man, but teach the way of God in truth. Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or not? (Matthew 22; Mark 12) They said this, however, in the presence of the ministers of Herod, so that if he forbade giving tribute, they, punishing him, might seem exempt from his death.
