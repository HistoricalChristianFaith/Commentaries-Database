Responding to him, the Lord said: "Hypocrites, does not each one of you on the Sabbath untie his ox or donkey from the stall, and lead it to water? Indeed, he reproached the leaders of the synagogue for their faithlessness, and deservedly notes them with the name of hypocrites, that is, dissemblers, who, despite wanting to seem like teachers of the people, would not be ashamed to place the healing of a person after the care of a beast: but in a higher sense, by the word ox and donkey, he signifies a Jew and a Greek. Concerning their calling, it is written: The ox knows its owner, and the donkey its master's crib. Both of these, released from the bonds of sin, have quenched the thirst and heat of this world by the draught of the Lord's fountain.
