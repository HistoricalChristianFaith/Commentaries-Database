In this context, it is very much to be asked how it is said: Those who would pass to you cannot. For it is not doubtful that those who are in hell desire to pass to the lot of the blessed. But how is it said that those who have already been received into the lot of blessedness desire to pass to those who are tormented in hell? But just as the reprobates wish to pass to the elect, that is, to migrate from the affliction of their punishments, so the just, out of mercy, wish to go in mind to the afflicted and those placed in torments and to desire to free them.

But after hope is taken away from the burning rich man, his mind turns to the relatives he had left behind, because the punishment of the reprobates' souls sometimes trains them uselessly into charity, so that even then they spiritually love their own, who here, while they loved sins, did not even love themselves.
