And Jesus was casting out a demon, and it was mute. And when He had cast out the demon, the mute spoke, and the crowds marveled. This demon-possessed man is narrated in Matthew to have been not only mute but also blind, and it is said that he was healed by the Lord, so that he spoke and saw. Therefore, three signs were accomplished simultaneously in one man. The blind sees, the mute speaks, the one possessed by a demon is freed. This was indeed done physically at that time, but it is also completed daily in the lives of believers, so that, with the demon first expelled, they may behold the light of faith, and then the mouths previously silent may be opened to praise God.
