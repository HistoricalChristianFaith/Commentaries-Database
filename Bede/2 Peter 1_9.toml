The eye stands for knowledge and the hand for action. A blind man who tries to act is someone who does not know what he should be doing. Lacking the light of truth, he puts his hand to something which he cannot understand and goes down a road which he cannot see, with the result that he ends up in a complete wreck. The person who lacks the things which Peter mentions here is just like that.
