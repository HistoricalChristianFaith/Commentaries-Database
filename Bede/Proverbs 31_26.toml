She opened her mouth with wisdom, etc. She opened her mouth for this only, to teach wisdom, according to that of the Apostle: Let no evil word proceed from your mouth, but only that which is good for the edification of faith, that it may give grace to the listeners (Ephesians IV). Or certainly she opened her heart, to learn inwardly from wisdom itself the truth which she would teach others outwardly. To both these senses, because the Church does both, appropriately applies what follows; And the law of kindness is on her tongue, namely this, that she did not immediately punish sinners in the manner of the Mosaic law, but mercifully called them to the medicine of penance. An example of this kindness she received clearly from the wisdom of God Himself, our Lord and Savior, when the adulterous woman was brought before Him: He said, If any of you is without sin, let him be the first to throw a stone at her (John VIII); and so, having shown mercy under the condition that she sin no more, He absolved her from the crime she had committed.
