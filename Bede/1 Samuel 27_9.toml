And David struck all the land, etc. The Lord strikes with the sword of His word whatever earthly and lowly thing He finds in unbelievers; nor does He allow anyone of those who truly receive the faith, either in spirit or in flesh, to live further in their prior conduct, but makes all by true confession say with the Apostle: But it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me (Gal. II).
