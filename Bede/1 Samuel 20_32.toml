But Jonathan answering his father Saul, said, etc. The assembly of the faithful in Christ, answering the unbelievers, said: Why does the Christian religion perish? Why is Christ Himself torn apart by you with a rapid bite, whom the governor himself, who gave Him over to death, first confessed to be innocent and just? Whom the thief, who also received the same sentence of death, testified to have done no evil? Indeed, co-heirs of Christ, persisting in the defense of the faith, the perfidious took up arms to conquer them; and because, after the glory of the resurrection, they could not reach Christ, nor lay hands on Him a second time, they struck His members in His place.
