Since the image of a dove is placed before us by God so that we may learn the simplicity favored, let us look diligently at its nature, so that from each one of its examples of innocence we may take the principles of a more correct life. [The dove] is a stranger to malice. May all bitterness, anger and indignation be taken away from us, together with all malice. It injures nothing with its mouth or talons, nor does it nourish itself or its young on tiny mice or grubs, which almost all smaller birds [do]. Let us see that our teeth are not weapons and arrows, lest gnawing and consuming one another we be consumed by one another. Let us keep our hands from plundering. “He who has now been stealing, let him steal no more; let him labor by working with his hands, which is a good thing, so that he may have something he can bestow upon one who is suffering need.” It is also reported that the dove often supplies nourishment to strangers as though they were her own young. She feeds them with the fruits and seeds of the earth.

Behold, you are beautiful in the simplicity of heart, because for the sake of the intention of eternity, you persist in good deeds, awaiting the blessed hope and the coming of the glory of the great God. Your eyes are doves, the eyes of your heart are simple and pure, and entirely free from any duplicity of deceit and pretense. Therefore, they are very blessed, because such shall see God. Likewise, your eyes are doves, because your senses are endowed with spiritual understanding; for since the Holy Spirit descended upon the Lord as a dove, rightly the spiritual sense and gifts are denoted by the term dove or doves. Likewise, the friend of Christ has the eyes of doves, because every soul that truly loves Him inwardly is not kindled by any desire for external things, like the manner of kites, nor does it contemplate anything harmful against any living beings. This is said to be characteristic of dove-like gentleness, which considers all things that occur with a simple, gentle, and humble heart. Hearing, therefore, from the Lord the twin beauty attributed to her, both of work and of intention with the simplicity of a pure heart, she immediately responded with a devoted voice:
