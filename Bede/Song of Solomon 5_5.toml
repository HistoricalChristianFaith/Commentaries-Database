My hands dripped with myrrh, etc. For in the hands are the works that are done by them; in the fingers is taken the discretion by which the works are directed: for certainly no parts of our body are distinguished by numerous joints, none are more apt for bending than the fingers. Hence it is that the Lord, about to give a sentence concerning the adulteress, first wrote with his finger on the ground, thus mystically advising us that whenever we intend to chastise or judge others, we should first humbly carve out our own conscience with diligent discretion, carefully considering lest we also be tempted. It has often been said that myrrh signifies the continence of the flesh and martyrdom: hence the sense is clear that the hands of the spouse drip with myrrh, when the holy soul dedicates itself to works of continence; and her fingers are full of the most proven myrrh, when, examining herself with careful discretion, she finds that she lives continent only with a view to heavenly recompense. For those who seek the favor of human praise, who, according to the judge himself, have received their reward, these indeed seem to drip with myrrh from their hands, but in no way have their fingers filled with the most proven myrrh, because if they do not only give their wealth to the poor, but also deliver their bodies to the flames, if they do not have charity, it profits them nothing. Therefore, because the one who wants to teach others must himself abstain from carnal enticements and be ready to suffer for the confession of faith, it was fitting that when she said: I arose to open to my beloved, she immediately added: My hands dripped with myrrh. And because the same continence or passion ought to be performed only with the intention of eternal reward, she rightly added: My fingers are full of myrrh. Again, the hands of the spouse drip with myrrh when her workers, that is, the holy teachers, subject their bodies to salutary mortification, and her fingers are full of the most proven myrrh when they progress so much in tribulations that their invincible patience is also declared, according to the Apostle: But we glory in tribulations, knowing that tribulation works patience, and patience, experience; and experience, hope; and hope does not disappoint (Rom. V).

I opened the bolt of my door to my beloved. The bride opened the bolt of her door to her beloved, when each chosen soul made the temple of her heart worthy of divine visitation and indwelling. She opens the bolt of the door to her beloved knocking, when, suddenly inspired and enkindled with a desire for heavenly things, she strives to open wider the bosom of her mind to receive the taste of that same heavenly sweetness. For it had been said above that the beloved, having sent his hand through the hole, touched her and shook her with trembling: deeply inflamed by his touch, she now desires to be touched not through the narrowness of the hole by his hand, but, with the door of her heart opened, to enjoy his most blessed embrace, that is, to be more fully satisfied with the sweetness of divine illumination, which she had sensed briefly and modestly. But since the perfect vision of eternal joys is granted to none of the elect in this life, which is reserved for all the righteous in the next life as a reward, it is rightly added:
