John explains in what way Cain was of the evil one. Wherever there is jealousy, brotherly love is impossible. Rather the sin of the evil one, that is, the devil, is in that manâ€™s heart, because the devil also rejected man because of his envy. The works of righteous Abel are works of love, whereas the works of Cain amount to hatred for his brother. It is only to be expected that someone who hates his brother will envy his works.
