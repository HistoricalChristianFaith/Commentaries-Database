But he who pretends not to believe what he has heard is punished with the penalty of silence, because he is mute who does not understand the spiritual sense within the letters. Nor does such a one know how to give words to the people like a teacher, but, lacking the word and reason, he, so to speak, makes silent gestures. Such was then the priesthood of the Jews, when they did not care to understand the reason for sacrifices or the declarations of the prophets. While Zacharias remains mute, Elisabeth conceives John, because although the priests may not understand the distinction of faith, and the Pharisees and Scribes lose it, so that neither themselves enter nor permit their listeners to enter, yet the interior of the law abounds with the sacraments of Christ.
