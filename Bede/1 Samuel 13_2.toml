And there were with Saul two thousand in Michmash, etc. The Church chooses for itself the strongest and those worthy of a thousand in number, by whose sword of the word and shield of faith it is fortified; furthermore, it sends back the weaker in faith to protect the tabernacles of their own conscience, in which they are strangers to the Lord. However, since both Saul and Jonathan pertain to the kingdom, but the merit of both is not the same; of whom, to pass over other things in silence, one persecutes God's chosen David as an enemy, while the other loves him as his own soul, a dual order of believers or preachers seems to be signified in them. One of them says: Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name (Matthew VII)? The other hears: But you are those who have remained with me in my temptations (Luke XXII). Hence, Saul is rightly called "desired," without doubt referring to him about whom the Lord speaks to the apostles: Behold, Satan has desired to sift you as wheat (ibid.). Jonathan, however, is interpreted as the gift of the dove, or he gave the dove, or the gift of the Lord: signifying those who attribute all virtue they have to the spirit of grace and confess they have received it from him. And Saul remained in Michmash and in the mountain of Bethel, that is, in humility and in the mountain of the house of God: Jonathan, however, in Gibeah of Benjamin, that is, on the hill of the son of the right hand with his soldiers. Because even the reprobate sometimes seem to exercise or even teach spiritual virtues with a left or unstable mind, but only those endowed with dove-like simplicity are proven to belong to the exalted kingdom of Christ, who is at the right hand of God. Also, the fact that there were two thousand with Saul, but a thousand with Jonathan, surely teaches that the more perfect they are, the fewer they are. Or certainly, the two thousand are devoted in humility and on the mountain of the house of God, by the purity of faith and advanced in the height of hope: while the thousand in the hill of the Son of the right hand are glorious in the perfection of charity, which never fails.
