The two cherubim can also stand for the two Testaments. These cherubim, no doubt, were made in the oracle because in the design of God’s providence, which is, of course, inaccessible and incomprehensible to us, it was arranged before the world began, when and how and by what authors sacred Scripture was to be written. They were made of olive wood because the divine books were composed by men “of mercy, whose godly deeds have not failed,” men who were enlightened by the unction of the Holy Spirit. They were made of olive wood because they afford us the light of knowledge with the help of the flame of God’s love that is poured forth in our hearts by the Holy Spirit. They are ten cubits high because by the observance of the Decalogue of the law they preach that God is to be served since they show that those who serve God faithfully are to be rewarded with the denarius of an everlasting kingdom. They have twin sets of wings because they proclaim that the Testaments have always, both in adversity and prosperity, pursued heavenly things with tireless resolve and attained to them, because they point out to their listeners that they must do exactly the same. Five cubits is the length of one cherub’s wing and five the length of the other’s since in all the fluctuations of transient things the saints lay all the senses of their eyes ever on the Lord. They desire to hear the sound of his praise and to recount all his wonderful works, considering his words are sweeter to their throats than honey and the honeycomb to their mouths. Running after the odor of his ointments and while there is breath left in them and the spirit of God in their nostrils, they do not speak evil with their lips or utter folly with their tongue. Thus going on their way “with the armor of righteousness on the right hand and on the left,” they succeed in receiving the heavenly denarius that the supreme master of the household has promised to the workers in his vineyard.And the two cherubim formed one work because the writers of both documents served God with one and the same purity of work and devotedness of love and proclaim God with one harmonious voice and belief. What the New Testament relates as accomplished facts regarding the Lord’s incarnation, passion, resurrection and ascension, the calling of the Gentiles, the expulsion of the Jews and the manifold affliction of the church, these same facts the Old Testament, rightly understood, truthfully foretold as events that were to happen.
