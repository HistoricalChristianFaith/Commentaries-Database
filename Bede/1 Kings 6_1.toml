Where it says, “in the fourth year in the month of Zio, which is the second month of the reign of Solomon over Israel,” the intended order is, in the fourth year of the reign of Solomon in the month of Zio, that is, the second month. He calls the second month May, for April, in which the Pasch, the principal feast among the Hebrews, is held, was the first month of the year. From this it is quite clear that later when the Pasch was over, he began to build a house for the Lord, and after they had been consecrated by the mystical solemnity, the people set their hands to the mystical task. A commemoration is made of the exodus from Egypt when work began on the building of the tabernacle so that the reader may be made aware what a period of time had passed between the building of both houses and learn the spiritual mystery attaching to this period of time. For four times 120 make 480; now four is very appropriate to evangelical perfection on account of the actual number of the Evangelists; 120 is appropriate to the teaching of the law on account of the same number of years of the legislator. It was also in this number of men that the primitive church received the grace of the Holy Spirit, clearly showing that those who use the law legitimately, that is, those who recognize and embrace the grace of Christ in it, are deservedly filled with the grace of his Spirit so that they may become more ardent in his love.
