John does not simply say that there is life in the Son; he says that the Son is life itself. The Son in his turn glorified the Father by saying: “Just as the Father has life in himself, so he has given the Son also life in himself.” He goes on to show how this life is common to both Father and Son, when he says: “And this is eternal life, that they know you the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom you have sent.”
