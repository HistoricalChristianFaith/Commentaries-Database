Peter means that the lower part of the universe was destroyed, because the higher part was not touched by the flood at all. More specifically, the earth perished, not just because it was submerged and therefore lost the ability to bear fruit, but also because when the floodwaters receded its shape was different, as we have already mentioned. The heavens also perished, or at least the earthâ€™s atmosphere did, because the Bible also talks about the birds being affected by the flood.
