But I say to you who listen: Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you. Because He had said earlier what they might suffer from their enemies, now He shows in what way they themselves ought to act towards these same enemies. Many, however, think it is enough virtue not to hate enemies, but to love them is commanded as more than what human nature can bear, not seeing that Moses, Samuel, and Stephen prayed for their enemies, and David mourned his dead enemies. For the Lord does not command impossibilities, but perfection. Therefore, not faltering while there is time, let us do good to all, especially to those who are of the household of faith.
