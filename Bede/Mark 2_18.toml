And the disciples of John were there, etc. Others recount that the evangelists themselves questioned the Pharisees and the disciples of John about this with the Lord. Here, however, the evangelical message seems to sound as if some others, moved by this concern, posed this question to him. From which it must be gathered that this question was posed to the Lord by many, namely by the Pharisees and the disciples of John, and by the guests or by others who were moved by this: why do the disciples of John and the Pharisees fast; but the disciples of the Savior do not fast. However, in a mystical sense, it can be explained thus: that the disciples of John and the Pharisees fast, but those of Christ do not fast, because everyone who either boasts of works of the law without faith, or, which is more serious, follows the traditions of men, or even certainly hears the preaching of Christ with the ear of the body only and not with the faith of the heart, abstaining from spiritual goods, with a fasting heart, withers away. But he who is faithfully incorporated by love into the members of Christ cannot fast, who feasts on his flesh and blood. Otherwise, John does not drink wine and strong drink, the Lord eats and drinks with publicans and sinners, because he increases merit through abstinence when there is no power in nature. The Lord, however, who naturally possesses the ability to forgive sins, why would he avoid those whom he could make even purer by abstaining? But Christ also fasted, so that you would not evade the precept, he ate with sinners, so that you would perceive grace, recognize power. And Jesus said to them: Can the children of the marriage feast fast, as long as the bridegroom is with them? As long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast. But the days will come when the bridegroom shall be taken from them, and then they shall fast on that day. In Matthew, it is thus placed: Can the children of the bridegroom mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them? (Matt. IX). The bridegroom is therefore Christ; the bride is the Church. From this holy and spiritual union, the apostles are created. They cannot mourn and fast, as long as they see the bridegroom in the wedding chamber and know that the bridegroom is with the bride. But when the nuptials are over and the time of passion and resurrection has come, then the children of the bridegroom will fast. According to the laws of allegory, it must be understood that as long as the bridegroom is with us and we are in joy, we can neither fast nor mourn. But when he has withdrawn and flown away because of sins, then fasting must be prescribed, then grief must be taken up. No one sews a patch of unshrunken cloth on an old garment. Otherwise, the new patch takes away from the old, and a worse tear is made. When the Lord was asked why his disciples did not fast, he responded that those who are still carnal and not yet solidified in the faith of his passion and resurrection cannot endure the more severe precepts of fasting and continence, lest through excessive austerity they also lose the faith which they seemed to have. Hence, he still calls the disciples old garments, to which a new patch, that is, any piece of doctrine pertaining to the temperance of a new life, is unfitly sewn, because if this happens, the doctrine itself is, in a way, torn, whose part that pertains to fasting from food is untimely handed down, since it teaches a general fasting not only from the desire for food but from all temporal delights. Whose like a patch, that is, some part that pertains to food, he says should not be imparted to men still bound to old customs, because from there also a kind of tearing seems to happen, and it does not fit with the oldness itself.
