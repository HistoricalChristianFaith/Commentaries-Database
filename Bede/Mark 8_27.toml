We note that the Lord called himself “Son of man,” while Nathanael proclaimed him “Son of God.” Similarly is the account in the Gospels where Jesus himself asks the disciples who people say the Son of man is, and Peter answers, “You are the Christ, Son of the living God.” This was done under the guidance of the economy of righteousness. It shows that the two natures of the one mediator are affirmed: his divinity and his humanity, and attested both by our Lord himself and by human mouths. By this means the Godman declared the weakness of the humanity assumed by him. Those purely human would themselves declare the power of eternal divinity in him.
