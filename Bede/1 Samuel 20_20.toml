And I will send three arrows near him, etc. And I, the Church says to the Lord, with you dwelling in the hearts of the perfect, will send preachers of the holy and undivided Trinity, who, with wings of virtues, will be quick-flying, penetrating with the sharpness of their speech, stirred by the bow of diligent reading, to strike with the word of faith those who are more fragile and still, and almost earthly, yet remaining in the vicinity of the strong, held by the friendly bond of love, so that, touched by the salutary wound of charity, they may be compelled to bear all visible things gravely, to rest in the memory of their Creator alone, and to have His sole vision as sweetness. But I will send them, not as if they would end the uncertain course of the word, but as if training me to the sign of true and singular salvation, as if following only the look of divine will, directing all the blows of my doctrine to the intended target, I will pursue to the prize of the heavenly calling of God in Christ Jesus. I will also send listeners eager to obey the faith; who, diligently seeking through all the spiritual teachings or deeds of the doctors, may piously relate to the glory of my state, by following it devoutly. To these listeners, indeed, if I show them capturing these same teachers who are near them, and placed among them by living well, if you deign to visit me, I will show that the usual blessing from the Jews is to be increased because peace is yours, with the arms of the hateful at rest meanwhile. But if I show that the same teachers, humbled by me, being further cast out and pursued from Judea, go and tend to visit all nations; because this is the will and providence of the eternal Father, that, blindness coming upon Israel, the fullness of the nations may enter the gates of life. Of the single word of the Father, which we shall have spoken, I confessing, and you teaching, let God the Father almighty Himself alone be the eternal witness between me and you; and rightly, because the Father alone knows the secrets of the Son, and only to those whom the Father has deigned to reveal them. Of these, the same Son speaks to the Father: And you revealed them to little children (Matthew XI). Who decreed that this God, begotten before the ages, should be incarnate at the end of the ages, and that they should be saved by the same incarnation. But speaking these things, the Church does not instruct the Lord as if He were ignorant of what He should do, nor does she teach what she herself shall do as if He were unaware; but she prays devotedly that He accomplish these things quickly, which she has learned mercifully to be done by Him. What she should do rightly, having received through Him, she ceaselessly praises herself for this by giving thanks.
