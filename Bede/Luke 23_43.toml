And Jesus said to him: Amen, I say to you: Today you will be with me in paradise. A most beautiful example of the conversion to be sought, that so quickly the thief is forgiven, and the grace is more abundant than the prayer. For the Lord always gives more than he is asked. For he asked that the Lord remember him when he came into his kingdom. But the Lord said: Amen, I say to you, today you will be with me in paradise. For life is to be with Christ, because where Christ is, there is the kingdom. Some fit the two thieves crucified with the Lord to the two kinds of the baptized. For whoever has been baptized into Christ Jesus, has been baptized into his death (Rom. VI). For both are similarly crucified, but one is worse in blasphemy on the cross, the other is made a martyr by confession. Because through baptism, by which we sinners are washed, some praise God suffering in the flesh with faith, hope, and charity, and are crowned; others, while they either refuse to have the faith or the works of baptism, are deprived of the gift they received.
