When I sent you without purse, and wallet, and sandals, did you lack anything? And they said, Nothing. Then he said to them: But now he that has a purse, let him take it, and likewise a wallet; and he that has none, let him sell his cloak and buy a sword. How rightly does the judgment of the Fathers define discretion as the mother and nurturer of all virtues, and from this saying of the Lord, it is proven, who instructs his disciples not by the same rule of living in times of persecution as in times of peace. For there are virtues that must always be upheld firmly, and there are those that, for time and place, are to be changed by prudent discretion. Who indeed does not know that the bowels of mercy, kindness, humility, patience, modesty, chastity, faith, hope, charity, and the like, are to be kept by the faithful without any interruption of time? But indeed hunger, thirst, vigils, nakedness, reading, psalmody, prayer, the labor of working, teaching, silence, and similar things, if anyone thinks they are always to be performed, not only will he deprive himself of their fruit, but he will incur the mark of indiscreet obstinacy, indeed of stubborn foolishness. Therefore, the Master and Lord of virtues, to insinuate the measure of discretion, sends his disciples to preach, commanding them to take nothing on the way, as he ordains that those who preach the gospel should live by the gospel. But when the danger of death is imminent, and the whole people at once are persecuting both shepherd and flock together, he decrees a rule suitable to the time, permitting them to take money necessary for sustenance until the furor of the persecutors calms down and the time to evangelize returns. Here he also gives us an example that for a just cause, sometimes certain rigors of our commitment can be temporarily set aside without fault. For instance, when we travel through inhospitable regions, it is allowed to carry more provisions for the journey than we had at home. He also commands to take up or to buy a sword if they do not have one, so that readers may know that the disciples do not lack the ability to resist, but rather that the teacher possesses the love of suffering. Where, even if there were no other cause for drawing the sword, that would be enough, so that by the ear of the servant being cut off and healed by the touch of the Lord, the virtue of the Savior's blessing might instruct even his assailants not to endure the anger of the one struck, but rather to prefer to embrace the faith of the risen one.
