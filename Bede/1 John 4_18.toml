The love of God is such that it makes it possible to imitate God’s goodness to the point where we start to do good toward our enemies and even to love them. The fear which love casts out is that spoken of in the psalm: “The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.” The new convert is afraid that the strictness of the righteous Judge will condemn him, but love casts this kind of fear out and gives him assurance on the day of judgment.
