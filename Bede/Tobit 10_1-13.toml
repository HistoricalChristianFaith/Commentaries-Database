Because of Tobias's delay due to the wedding, his parents were saddened that he did not return to them on the appointed day. And now, as Christ tarries among the Gentiles through faith in the Church gathered from the Gentiles, whoever among the Jews individually converts to faith in Him are greatly grieved; because the Lord delays His coming to save them, being retained among the Gentiles. This well suits what his mother, poor and as if bereft of both husband and son, said with much sorrow:

"Alas, alas, my son, why did we send you to travel, the light of our eyes, the staff of our old age, etc." And Tobias, consoling her, responds: "Be quiet and do not be disturbed, our son is safe, etc.," suits those same ones who now believe among the Jews; who still console themselves and their own with this, that truly a time will come when the Lord will return to them, and then all Israel will be saved; knowing that the Lord, who promised this, is faithful. For as we taught above, the same Tobias, by his blindness, signifies the unbelievers, and by his faith, the believers, according to the customary manner of the Scriptures.

Raguel asks Tobias to stay with him for a longer time, but he is not heard, with Tobias saying: "I know that my father and my mother are now counting the days, and their spirit is tormented within them." And when the fullness of the Gentiles has come in, no one will be able to prevent God from granting salvation to Israel and removing the blindness that has happened in part. For divine mercy remembers that there is great sadness and continuous sorrow of heart for those who believe from among the Jews because of the blindness of the unbelievers, who are their relatives according to the flesh, who are Israelites.

Therefore, Raguel sent Tobias back to his parents, giving him Sarah with much substance. In the end, the teachers of the Church send Christ back, with the Church itself full of the riches of virtues, to enlighten with faith and enrich with the substance of good works the Jewish people, from whom He took His flesh.
