According to the Gospel, when the Lord was foretelling the destruction of the world, he added, “Now when you see these things taking place, look up and raise your heads,” that is, make your hearts glad.… This is that judgment that the souls of the saints sought for with a loud cry, “How long, O Lord, holy and true, before you will judge and avenge our blood?”
