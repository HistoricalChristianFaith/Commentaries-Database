But Jesus answering said: "I will also ask you one thing, and you answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I do these things. The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or from men? Answer me." The Lord could have refuted the calumny of the tempters with an open answer, but he prudently asks, so that they may be condemned either by their silence or by their own decision.
