And the satraps of the Philistines indeed marched by the hundreds, etc. Understand the last contingent either by the merit of humility or by the order of time. For in every age of the world, the nations of the gentiles have set up in battle array against the Jews, since that nation was founded, and strive to defeat them by hand or mouth; but also against the heretics, because they are a portion of the Church, burning with a similar mind due to envy of the name of Christ, the Lord appears humble and despised by those chosen from the secular world; because the children of this age are wiser in their generation than the children of light (Luke XVI). He also, having incarnated in his time, and in the fullness of times, appeared humble to the world, showing examples of humility, rejection, and poverty outwardly to his followers, whom he instructed within on how desirable it is to be mighty in hand for defeating the proud, and in blessing the submissive.
