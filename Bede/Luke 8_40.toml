And it happened, when Jesus returned, the crowd welcomed him, for they were all waiting for him. And I said above that at the end of the age the Lord will mercifully return to the Jews and will be gladly received by them through the confession of faith. For the fact that they were all waiting for him is certainly what the prophet speaks to the synagogue: "You will wait for me many days, you will not be unfaithful, and you will not belong to another man" (Hosea 3). Now indeed, neither subjected to the man Christ nor committing idolatry, in the long expectation of her former spouse, that is, the Lord Christ, she awaits the embrace to come by grace.
