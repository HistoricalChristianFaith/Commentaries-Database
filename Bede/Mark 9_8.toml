And immediately looking around, they saw no one anymore, but only Jesus with them. When the Son began to be designated, the servants soon departed, lest the father's voice be thought to have been directed to them. Otherwise, when a voice was made over the Son, he was found alone, because when he has revealed himself to the elect, God will be all in all; indeed he himself with his own will shine as one through all, that is, the head with the body. For this unity he said elsewhere: And no one has ascended to heaven except he who descended from heaven, the Son of Man who is in heaven (John 3).
