You are those who have remained with me in my trials, and I appoint to you, as my Father appointed to me, a kingdom. Not the beginning of patience, but perseverance is granted the glory of the heavenly kingdom. Because, indeed, perseverance, which is called constancy by another name, is a certain strength and fortitude of mind, and (so to speak) the pillar of all virtues. When it stands well upright and firm, nothing is more certain, nothing safer for good morals. But if it is thrown down by any storm, it does not fall alone; for indeed, all the goods of the soul collapse together. Therefore, as the Father appointed to the Son the kingdom, who was made obedient to death, even the death of the cross, exalted him, and gave him a name that is above every name (Philippians 2), so also the Son will lead those who remain with him in the trials to the eternal kingdom. For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall also be in the likeness of his resurrection (Romans 6). From the height of whose promise the unhappy Judas is excluded. For even before the Lord spoke these things, he is believed to have gone out. He not only spurned to remain with Him in the trials but also helped the authors of his trials. Those who, having heard the words of the incomprehensible sacrament, went back and no longer walked with Him, are also excluded. For there are none who have departed from the Lord, except those who returned repenting, who could be saved.
