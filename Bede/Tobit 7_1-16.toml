They entered Raguel's house, who received them with joy. The Lord visited the people of the nations through the teachers of His word, who were gladly received in many places, as the Acts of the Apostles testify.

When asked for his daughter, Raguel at first feared, knowing what had happened to those seven men; but the angel teaching that the unclean could not possess her, while Tobias, who feared God, could, he soon consented to give her. The people of the Gentiles, hearing the word of faith and admonished by the apostles to make the Church of Christ from their progeny throughout the world, could not accept the laws and customs of the new faith without certain exploration; knowing that for many former times they had teachers, who, as if comprehended in the number seven, knew only the joys of this life, saying nothing certain about eternal things, and therefore, without the hope of immortal life, the destruction of eternal death had seized them. But with the inner truth itself teaching, which sounded outwardly through the mouths of the doctors, they finally understood that it was necessary for fools to say foolish things and for those who did not know the true Lord to perish; but by right, the Creator of the world coming into the world should take up the governance of the world. And confessing faith in Christ, they rejoiced to be sanctified by His sacraments.
