You know the truth of faith and life because you have been anointed by the Spirit, and you have no need to be taught anything other than that you should continue along the path you have already embarked upon.… We have been warned how to recognize the antichrist, for Christ said: “I am the truth.” Therefore every lie is foreign to Christ, and those who tell lies do not belong to him.
