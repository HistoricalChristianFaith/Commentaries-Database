But Pilate said to the chief priests and the crowds: I find no cause in this man. This is what he himself said to the disciples the day before he suffered among other things: For the prince of this world is coming, and he has nothing in me (John 14). But because the prince of the world, that is, Pilate, absolved him, in whom he found no cause to condemn, see what the Jews do, who, not out of love for justice to investigate the truth, but driven by the goad of envy, strive to condemn the just.
