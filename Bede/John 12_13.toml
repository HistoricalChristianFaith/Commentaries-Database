Those who went ahead and those who followed exalted our Lord with one and the same voice of praise, for undoubtedly the faith of those who were approved before our Lord’s incarnation and of those after it is one [faith], although they had sacraments that differed according to the customs of the times. Peter bears witness [to this] when he says, “But we believe that we are being saved in the same way as they also were, through the grace of the Lord Jesus.” As for their saying, “Hosanna,” that is, “salvation to the Son of David,” this is the same thing we read in the psalm, “The Lord is [our] salvation, [let] your blessing [be] on your people.” It is the same as the chorus that the saints echo with a chant of great praise in the Apocalypse, “Salvation to our God, who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb.”

The crowd took this verse of praise from the one hundredth and seventeenth psalm, and there is no one who doubts that it is sung about the Lord. Hence it is appropriate that there is previously sung of him in the same psalm, “The stone which the builders rejected has become the cornerstone,” for Christ, whom the Jews rejected as they were building the decrees of their own traditions, became a memorial for believers from among both peoples, namely, the Jews and the Gentiles. For as to the fact that Christ is called the cornerstone in this psalm, this is what was being chanted in high praise in the Gospel by the voice of those who followed and those who went ahead.

“In the name of the Lord” signifies “In the name of God the Father,” just as [our Lord] himself said elsewhere to the unbelieving Jews, “I have come in the name of my Father, and you do not receive me; another will come in his own name, him you will receive.” Christ came in the name of God the Father because in everything that he did and said he was concerned with glorifying his Father and with proclaiming to human beings that he is to be glorified. The antichrist will come in his own name, and although he may be the wickedest person of all and a great help to the devil, he will see fit to call himself the Son of God while “being opposed to and raised above everything that is said to be God and is worshiped.”
