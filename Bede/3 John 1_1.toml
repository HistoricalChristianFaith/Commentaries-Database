Who this Gaius was and what he was like becomes apparent in the course of the letter. He was a man who had believed in Christ and as a result of that was living a life of good works. He was not a preacher himself, but he was happy to support the preaching ministry out of his own pocket. He is probably to be identified with the Gaius mentioned by Paul as his host. For Gaius was a host to the whole church, who opened his doors to everyone who came along, whether they were the preachers or the hearers of the Word.
