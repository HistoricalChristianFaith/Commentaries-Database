My God, I am too ashamed and blush to lift up my face to you, My God, because our iniquities are multiplied over our heads and our sins have grown to the heavens from the days of our forefathers, and so on until the end of the prayer where it says, Here we are before you in our sin; no one can stand in your presence because of this, is appropriate to the humility of our Redeemer, who appeared in the likeness of sinful flesh to take away the sins of the world. Hence in the Psalms also (which, as the Gospel attests, were written in his own person) he clearly refers to our sins, which he had taken upon himself, as his own, saying, My God, my God, why have you abandoned me far from my salvation? and adding why he says, the words of my sins, and again, Oh God, you know my foolishness, and my sins are not hidden from you, not because he himself could have sins or foolishness in him, who, as the Apostle says, has become for us wisdom from God and righteousness and holiness and redemption, but because taking upon himself the cause of those whom he had come to save, he compassionately deigned to transfer to himself even those things that in reality were proper to their weakness.
