And there were shepherds in the same region, watching and keeping the night watches over their flock. And behold, an angel of the Lord stood by them, and the glory of God shone around them. With the most beautiful reason, with the Lord born, the shepherds watch, and by guarding their flock from the dangers of the night, they protect it. To show indeed also through this that that time has arrived, which the true and only good Shepherd once promised, saying: "Behold, I myself will seek out my sheep, and I will visit them, just as a shepherd visits his flock, and I will rescue them from all places where they were scattered on a cloudy and dark day." And a little later: "And I will set up over them one shepherd, my servant David, and he will feed them, and I will make the evil beasts cease from the land" (Ezekiel 34), etc. What was wondrously foretold by the prophet, we see more wondrously fulfilled by the Lord. The prophet Micah also remembers this time and place, saying: "And you, O tower of the flock, the hill of the daughter of Zion, to you it will come, and the former dominion will come, the kingdom of the daughter of Zion" (Micah 4). For the Tower of the Flock, which is called the Tower of Eder in Hebrew, is about a thousand paces east of the city of Bethlehem, foretelling these shepherds long before by the prophecy of its name, to which the angelic powers indeed came, appearing to the shepherds. Therefore, with the Lord born, let the shepherds watch over their flock of sheep, signifying by his clear dispensation, shepherds in the Church will keep watch over pure souls. To whom it is said: "Feed the flock of God which is among you" (1 Peter 5). But with the shepherds watching well, an angel appears, and the glory of God shines around them, because those who deserve to see sublime things before others are those who know how to diligently watch over the faithful flocks, and while they piously watch over the flock, divine grace shines more abundantly upon them. Similarly, an angel instructs Mary, an angel instructs Joseph, an angel instructs the shepherds. And the citizens of heaven testify to the Lord to be conceived, conceived, and born, so that they may sufficiently instruct mortals and ceaselessly offer their service to their author. For in the subsequent events—when He was tempted, when He was to suffer, to rise again, and to ascend to heaven—they are always reported to be present.
