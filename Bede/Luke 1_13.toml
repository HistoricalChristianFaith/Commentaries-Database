And your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son; and you shall call his name John. By saying the prayer is heard, he immediately promises the birth of his wife. Not that he who had entered to sacrifice for the people could have prayed for obtaining children, especially since no one prays for what he despairs of receiving. But so much did he despair of having children, remembering his own old age and his barren wife, that he did not believe the angel promising this; but what he says, your prayer has been heard, signifies for the redemption of the people: And your wife will bear you a son, unfolds the ordinance of that same redemption, namely that the son born to Zechariah would make way by proclaiming for that redeemer of the people. A sign of singular merit is given whenever a name is either imposed or changed by God upon men. Thus Abram, because he was to be the father of many nations, was called Abraham. Thus Jacob, because he saw God, deserved to be called Israel. Thus King Josiah, on account of the summit of his exceptional virtue, was named by God long before he was born. Therefore John is interpreted: in whom is grace, or the grace of the Lord. By this name it is declared that first, the grace is given to his parents, to whom a son would be born in their old age; then to John himself, who would be great before the Lord, and would be enriched by the gift of the Holy Spirit even from his mother's womb; finally also to the sons of Israel, whom he would turn to the Lord their God.
