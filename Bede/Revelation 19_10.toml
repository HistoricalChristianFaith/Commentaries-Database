testimony: After that the Lord Jesus Christ raised the person of man, which He assumed, above the heavens, the angel feared to be worshipped by man, namely, as worshipping the God-man above himself. Yet we read of this having been done before the Incarnation of the Lord by men, and not in any wise forbidden by the angels.

fellowservant: He had said above, &quot;I am the first and the last.&quot; He shews, therefore, that the angel was sent as a figure of the Lord and the Church. In the same manner he also says at the end, &quot;I, Jesus, have sent my angel to testify these things to you in the churches.&quot;
