And he said, "I beg you therefore, father, that you would send him to my father's house; for I have five brothers, that he may testify to them, lest they also come to this place of torment." In this matter, it is to be noted how many signs of punishment are accumulated for the burning rich man. For to his punishment, both knowledge and memory are preserved. For he recognizes Lazarus whom he despised, and remembers also his brothers whom he left behind. Indeed, perfect vengeance for him would not be, if he did not recognize him in retribution. And perfect punishment in the fire would not be, if he did not fear the same for his own. Therefore, that sinners may be punished more in torment, they both see the glory of those whom they despised and are tormented by the punishment of those whom they loved in vain. But it is to be believed that before the retribution of the final judgment, the unjust in their rest behold some of the just, so that seeing them in joy, they are tormented not only by their own suffering but also by the good fortune of the others. The just, however, always look upon the unjust in torment, so that their joy is increased by seeing the evil which they mercifully escaped, and they render greater thanks to their Deliverer, as they more clearly see in others what they themselves could have suffered if they had been neglected. For those who see the glory of their Creator, nothing is done in creation that they cannot see.
