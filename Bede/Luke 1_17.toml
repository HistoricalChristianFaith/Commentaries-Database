And he will turn the hearts of the fathers to their children, and the disobedient, etc. To turn the hearts of the fathers to their children means to infuse the spiritual knowledge of the holy ancients into the people through preaching. But the wisdom of the just is not to presume righteousness from the works of the law but to seek salvation through faith. So that although they observe the commands of the law, they may understand that they are saved by the grace of God through Christ. For the just shall live by faith (Rom. 1). And Peter spoke of the yoke of the law: "Which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear, but we believe that through the grace of the Lord Jesus we shall be saved, just as they (Acts 15).” Because this wisdom is long imparted to the unbelievers through John and through Elijah, it is rightly said about Elijah by Malachi in almost the same words as it was said about John by the angel: "Prepare a perfect people for the Lord.” For because it was said that Zacharias was heard when supplicating for the people, it teaches in what order that people ought to be saved and perfected, namely by the preaching of John in repenting and believing in Christ.
