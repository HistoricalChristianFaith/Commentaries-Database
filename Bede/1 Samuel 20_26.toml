He was thinking that perhaps it had happened to him, etc. For the Jews thought that Jesus was neither clean nor purified from sins because he had violated the Sabbath and done other things contrary to the decrees of the law or rather of their own traditions, and taught them as well. Therefore, they rightly found nothing in the Scriptures that could be recorded about him. They thought that the disciples of Christ were not clean because they saw that they placed the righteousness of faith before the works and purifications of the law. And so they did not consider it significant that they had not come with them to sacrifices, for they utterly detested them in their hearts due to their lifestyle differences, or even had excommunicated them from the synagogue.
