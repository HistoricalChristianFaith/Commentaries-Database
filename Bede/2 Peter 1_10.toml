Jesus said: “Many are called but few are chosen.” The calling of all those who come to faith is certain, but those who consistently add good works to the sacraments of faith which they have received are the ones who make their calling and election certain in the eyes of those who observe them. The opposite is also true, for those who go back to their crimes after they have been called and who die in their sins make it clear to everyone that they are damned.
