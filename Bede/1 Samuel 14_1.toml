Jonathan’s name means “gift of the dove.” His armor bearer refers to the teachers endowed with the grace of the Spirit, the disciples who obediently carry arms not made of flesh but arms made mighty for God. Their youth is renewed like that of an eagle. A certain day to begin their battle represents the sudden inspiration of supernal light against the trials of the enemy. On a certain day Jonathan urges his armor bearer to join him in crossing over to the Philistines and their garrison, since every perfect teacher, suddenly regarded by heavenly grace, urges the hearts of his pious hearers to conquer the onslaughts of vices.

When Jonathan was about to go to the camp of the Philistines, he kept his plan hidden from his father and the rest of the people. Just as it is always most appropriate to avail oneself of the counsel of spiritual people, so it is also useful to keep hidden from carnal individuals great and virtuous undertakings, when planning or beginning them. We do this so that their fear might not break us and scare us while the desire of our mind is still tender; we also do this so that they themselves might not begin to do the very same things in emulation of us when they are not yet up to the task; and we also do this so that their imperfect praise might not degrade the integrity of our spiritual undertaking. For the following words relate that Saul at this juncture and the people who were with him had not yet attained spiritual maturity.
