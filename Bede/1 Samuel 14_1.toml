And it happened one day, that Jonathan said, etc. For Jonathan, who is interpreted as the gift of the dove, foresaw the grace of the Spirit teachers; his young armor-bearer, the disciples obediently bearing arms not of the flesh, but powerful in God; whose youth is renewed like the eagle's (Psalm 103); a certain day begins the conflict, their sudden inspiration against the temptations of the enemy designates the inspiration of heavenly light. Jonathan encourages his armor-bearer on a certain day to go to the station of the Philistines, just as each perfect master, suddenly graced from heaven, stirs the hearts of pious helpers to overcome the assaults of vices.
