The Word: Because the same Who appeared for a time as a man of suffering, &quot;in the beginning was God with God.&quot; He is called the Word, because nothing in His nature was visible, nor corporeal; or because the Father made all things by Him, the perfect knowledge of Whose nature, as he says above, is known to Himself alone, and to the Father. For &quot;the peace of God passeth all understanding;&quot; that is, the peace by which God Himself was reconciled unto Himself, exceeds the wisdom of any creature, whether human or angelic, for &quot;Of his wisdom there is no number.&quot; For when it is said, &quot;And he, to whom the Son will reveal,&quot; That is, the Father and the Son, &quot;knows,&quot; this has respect to the capacity of the creature.           <a

vesture: The vesture of Christ ought to be understood according to the place. Here, accordingly, it appears to indicate the very act of the Passion, so that in the white horse is designated the immaculate birth, in the vesture stained with blood, the innocent death.

Apparently this passage refers to the passion, as his immaculate birth was indicated in the white horse and his innocent death is indicated in the bloodstained garment. “His name is called Word of God” because the same who in time appeared as a man who was going to suffer in the beginning was God with God. He is called “Word,” because nothing in the substance of his nature is visible or corporeal, or because through him the Father created all things. As it says above, perfect knowledge of his nature is known to himself alone, and to the Father. “For the peace of God passes all understanding,” that is, that peace by which God himself is peace unto himself surpasses every creaturely understanding, all human understanding and even the understanding of the angels. “His wisdom is without end.” When it says, “And to whom the Son chooses to reveal [the Father],” it means that one who knows the Son and the Father, knows them after the manner of the creature.
