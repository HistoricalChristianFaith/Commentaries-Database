The Word: Because the same Who appeared for a time as a man of suffering, &quot;in the beginning was God with God.&quot; He is called the Word, because nothing in His nature was visible, nor corporeal; or because the Father made all things by Him, the perfect knowledge of Whose nature, as he says above, is known to Himself alone, and to the Father. For &quot;the peace of God passeth all understanding;&quot; that is, the peace by which God Himself was reconciled unto Himself, exceeds the wisdom of any creature, whether human or angelic, for &quot;Of his wisdom there is no number.&quot; For when it is said, &quot;And he, to whom the Son will reveal,&quot; That is, the Father and the Son, &quot;knows,&quot; this has respect to the capacity of the creature.           <a

vesture: The vesture of Christ ought to be understood according to the place. Here, accordingly, it appears to indicate the very act of the Passion, so that in the white horse is designated the immaculate birth, in the vesture stained with blood, the innocent death.
