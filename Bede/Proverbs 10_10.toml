He who winks with the eye causes trouble. Whoever mockingly winks at someone will not escape without the pain of torment and regret. Of such people the Psalmist says, Those who hate me without cause and wink maliciously with the eye (Psalm 35); or certainly, he who winks with the eye causes trouble because a foolish son is a grief to his mother.

A foolâ€™s lips bring him strife. It is either from his own, by whom he deserved to be condemned, because death and life are in the power of the tongue (Prov. XVIII), or from those by whom, because he could not be corrected, he received the sentence of condemnation; as the Psalmist says, "Lord, deliver my soul from lying lips and a deceitful tongue" (Psal. CXIX), he asks this from the Lord, so that he himself neither possesses lying lips and a deceitful tongue, nor can he be deceived by the iniquity and deceit of others.
