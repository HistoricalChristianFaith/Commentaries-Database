And when the day of battle came, neither sword nor spear was found, etc. When the day of battle against adversarial powers is a daily occurrence, many content with their rusticity, very few proceed properly armed for this battle with a fitting reading or hearing of the Scriptures; hence, aided by our lethargy, the spiritual adversary now does to us what it is described the carnal adversary did to Israel then.
