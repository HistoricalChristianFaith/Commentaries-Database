And his parents went every year to Jerusalem, at the feast of Passover. You see this evangelist, among the four creatures, not without reason compared to the calf, which, as if designated for sacrifices, revolves around the temple and Jerusalem with the course of his narrative. For indeed at the beginning he places a priest praying at the altar, establishes a multitude of people in the courts of the temple, soon sends Mary, having conceived the Lord, to Jerusalem, introduces her into the house of the High Priest. There he recounts the birth of the Baptist, and immediately after the birth, transfers the Lord with an offering. He leads him there every year with his parents, and at the age of twelve inserts him into the choir of doctors in the temple. Where among other things, he says astonishing things to the wise: Because it behooves me to be in the things of my Father (Luke 2). And after such things, he concludes his Gospel with the disciples praising God in the temple.
