To everyone who asks of you, give. He says, to everyone who asks, not to everyone requesting everything, but to give that which you can give honorably and justly. For what if he asks for money to oppress the innocent? What if in the end, he asks for a disgraceful act? But without going into many details, which are innumerable, certainly that should be given which neither harms you nor another, as far as can be known or believed by man. And to whom you have justly denied what he asks for, the justice itself should be indicated, so that you do not send him away empty-handed. Thus, you will grant to everyone who asks of you, though not always that which is requested, you will grant. And sometimes you will grant something better, when you correct one asking for unjust things.

And from him who takes away what is yours, do not demand it back. He speaks of clothing, house, estate, beast of burden, and generally of all money. However, whether this should apply to slaves is a great question. For a Christian ought not to possess a slave in the same manner as a horse or silver. Although it may happen that a horse is worth more than a slave, and something golden or silver far more. But if that slave is being educated or governed more correctly, honorably, and in a manner more fitting to Godâ€™s worship by you the master, than by the one who desires to take him away, I do not know whether anyone would dare say that he should be disregarded like a garment. For a man ought to love his fellow man as himself, upon whom the Lord of all commands also to love even enemies.
