Moses alone ascended to its very top, where the divine majesty shone forth in fire and a dark cloud. Only the more perfect know how to grasp and observe the deeper and most secret mysteries of the law; the carnalminded people, content with the external aspects of the letter, and gathered apart, as it were, and below, stood to hear the words from heaven.
