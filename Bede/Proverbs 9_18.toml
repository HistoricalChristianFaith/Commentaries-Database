And he did not know that giants are there, etc. The adulteress does not know, the heretic does not know, that unclean spirits inhabit their houses, and those who suffer eternal punishments in the depths of hell delight in the acts of the luxurious, and in the dogmas of the heretics, as if they were lavish banquets. But when the sacraments of Christ are duly celebrated in the Church of Christ, the word of Christ is heard and preserved (who is the wisdom of God), it is established that angelic virtues are there, and in the heights of heaven, the faithful partake. For He gave them the bread of heaven; man ate the bread of angels (Psalm LXXVII).
