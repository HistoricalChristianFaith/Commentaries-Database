“May his habitation become desolate, and may there be none to dwell in it, and may another take his office.” Indeed these verses are clear and plainly set forth by the blessed Peter’s interpretation. On the one hand Judas received a deserved penalty for his double-dealing, and as he went to his own proper place (namely, infernal hell), by his untimely and impious death he forsook the common dwelling place of the human way of life. On the other hand, however, by Matthias’s acceptance of the place of his [Judas’s] ministry and apostolate, the most sacred fullness of apostolic perfection was restored.
