The book of the holy father Tobit is clearly of saving benefit to its readers even in its superficial meaning, inasmuch as it abounds in both the noblest examples and the noblest counsels for moral conduct, and anyone who knows how to interpret it historically (and allegorically as well) can see that its inner meaning excels the mere letter as much as the fruit excels the leaves. For if it is understood in the spiritual sense, it is found to contain within it the greatest mysteries of Christ and the church. - "On Tobit, foreword"
