Do not, I beseech you, my lord the king, set your heart upon this wicked man, Nabal, etc. The synagogue of believers, moved by pious humility, begs the Lord not to utterly destroy their wicked rulers and nobles before the punishment of the final judgment, so that those who are awaiting eternal destruction for their foolishness of disbelief, may at least enjoy a little temporal pleasure. At the same time, humbly excusing or rather lamentably accusing herself, that she too recognized the messengers of such great good, that is the apostles whom He sent, so late.
