[[commentary]]

To the affection of a son, who doubts not that all things which are his father's are his, he by no means lays claim, but desires the condition of a hired servant, as now about to serve for a reward. But he admits that not even this could he deserve except by his father's approbation.

That is, his working, that by works faith may shine forth, and by faith his works be strengthened.
