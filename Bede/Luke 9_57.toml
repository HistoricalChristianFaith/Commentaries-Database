It came to pass, as they walked on the way, a certain man said to him: I will follow you wherever you go, and so on. Both wonderful and dreadful is the righteous dispensation of the secret judgment. The Samaritans are asked to receive the Lord, and not wanting to, are forbidden to be struck. This man promises to follow him and is removed, another desires first to bury his father and is compelled to evangelize. Another, intending to follow the Lord, wishes to announce this at home, but is not permitted. Someone who does not follow Christ works miracles in Christ's name and is commanded not to be prevented. But in each of these instances, the words of the Apostle are applicable to us: O the depth of the riches of the wisdom and knowledge of God, how incomprehensible are his judgments, and how unsearchable his ways (Rom. XI)! And with Samuel: Man sees what is apparent, but the Lord looks on the heart (I Reg. XVI).
