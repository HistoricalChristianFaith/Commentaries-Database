Jesus said to him: "Today salvation has come to this house, because he too is a son of Abraham." Zacchaeus is called a son of Abraham, not because he was born of his lineage, but because he imitated his faith. Just as Abraham left his land, kin, and father's house, at the Lord's command, for the hope of future inheritance, so he also, to acquire treasure in heaven, left his goods to be shared with the poor. And he beautifully says, "And he too," to declare that not only those who persist in righteousness, but also those who repent of unrighteousness, belong to the sons of the promise. Alternatively: Salvation, which once filled the house of the Jews, today has shone upon the people of the nations, because this people too is a son of Abraham by believing in him. The Apostle says: "If you belong to Christ, then you are Abraham's seed" (Gal. III). And, as he says elsewhere, Abraham is the father of circumcision, not only to those who are of the circumcision but also to those who follow the footsteps of the faith that is in the uncircumcision of our father Abraham (Rom. IV).
