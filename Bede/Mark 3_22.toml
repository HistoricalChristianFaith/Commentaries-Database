And blessed indeed the concourse of the crowd, flocking together, whose anxiety to obtain salvation was so great, that they left not the Author of salvation even an hour free to take food. But Him, whom a crowd of strangers loves to follow, His relations hold in littleesteem.For it goes on, “And when His friends heard of it, they went out to lay hold upon Him. "For since they could not take in the depth of wisdom, which they heard, they thought that He was speaking in a senselessway.Wherefore it continues, “for they said, Heis beside Himself.”.
Now there is a great difference between those who do not understand the word of God from slowness of intellect, such as those who are here spoken of, and those who purposely blaspheme, of whom it is added, “And the Scribes which came down from Jerusalem” For what they could not deny they endeavour to pervert by a malicious interpretation, as if they were not the works of God, but of a most unclean spirit, that is, of Beelzebub, who was the God of Ekrom.For ‘Beel’ means Baal himself, and ‘zebub’a fly; the meaning of Beelzebub therefore is, the man of flies, on account of the filth of the blood which was offered, from which most unclean rite, they call him prince of the devils, adding, “and by the prince of the devils castethHe out devils.”
