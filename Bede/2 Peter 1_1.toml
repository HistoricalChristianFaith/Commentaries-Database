Simon Peter, a servant and apostle of Jesus Christ, etc. It is written later in this Epistle: Behold, beloved, I write to you this second Epistle. Hence it is clear that he wrote this to the same elect proselytes dispersed in Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia, to whom he had sent the first Epistle. He considers them equals to himself, not because they had received circumcision according to the Law, which, being a Jew by nature, he himself held, but because they had received the same faith he had obtained through the illuminating grace of Christ. For it is not legal circumcision, but only evangelical faith that unites the peoples of the nations with the ancient people of God. But, since the same faith cannot save without works, it is rightly added:

In the righteousness of our God and Savior Jesus Christ. Therefore, the apostle Peter writes a letter to them, greeting those who have obtained an equal faith to his own, and exercise it through works of righteousness. Namely, the righteousness which human prudence has not discovered, nor legal institution teaches, but the Lord and our Savior speaking through the Gospel has shown, when he says: Unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will not enter the kingdom of heaven (Matthew 5). And again: You have heard that it was said to those of old, You shall not murder. But I say to you, etc. (Ibid.).
