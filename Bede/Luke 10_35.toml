And the next day he took out two denarii and gave them to the innkeeper, and said: Take care of him. The next day is after the Lord's resurrection. For even before, through the grace of his Gospel, he had enlightened those who sat in darkness and in the shadow of death (Luke 1), but more so, after the celebration of the resurrection, the splendor of perpetual light shone forth. The two denarii are the two Testaments, in which the name and image of the eternal King is contained. For Christ is the end of the law (Romans 10). The two denarii were given to the innkeeper the next day: because at that time he opened their minds to understand the Scriptures (Luke 24). The next day the innkeeper received the denarii, by whose value he would heal the wounded, because the Holy Spirit came and taught the apostles all truth (John 16), so they might steadfastly teach the nations and preach the Gospel.

And whatever more you spend, I will repay you when I return. The innkeeper spends more than he received in the two denarii, when the Apostle says: Concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord, but I give my advice (1 Corinthians 7). And likewise: The Lord ordained that those who preach the Gospel should live of the Gospel (1 Corinthians 9). But we did not use this power, lest we should hinder any of you (1 Thessalonians 2). To whom, returning, the debtor will repay what he promised, because the Lord, coming in judgment, says: Because you were faithful over a few things, I will make you ruler over many things. Enter into the joy of your Lord (Matthew 25).
