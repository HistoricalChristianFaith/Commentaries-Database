When he saw them, he said: Go, show yourselves to the priests. And it happened as they went, they were cleansed. The Lord is found to have sent none of those to whom he granted these corporal benefits to the priests, except lepers, because evidently, the priesthood of the Jews was a figure of the future royal priesthood, which is in the Church, whereby all belonging to the body of Christ, the highest and true Prince of priests, are consecrated. And whoever has lacked the grace of the Lord, either by heretical depravity, gentile superstition, Jewish perfidy, or even fraternal schism, must come to the Church and show the true color of faith they have received. But other vices, like the health and as it were the senses and limbs of the soul, the Lord heals and corrects within through conscience and understanding. Indeed, Paul also, having heard the voice of the Lord: Why do you persecute me? and, I am Jesus whom you are persecuting (Acts 9), was nevertheless sent to Ananias, so that through that priesthood established in the Church, he might receive the sacrament of the doctrine of faith, and be approved in its true color. Not because the Lord cannot do all things by himself (for who else does these things even in the Church?) but so that the very society of gathered faithful, by approving and communicating the doctrine of true faith among each other, might impart in all that is said in words or signified in sacraments, as it were, one form of true color. Cornelius also, although his alms and prayers were accepted and heard by the angel, is nevertheless commanded to send for Peter, for the unity of doctrine and sacraments, as if to him and his it was said: Go, show yourselves to the priests; for as they went, they were cleansed. For Peter had already come to them, but they had not yet received the sacrament of baptism, had not yet spiritually come to the priests, and yet by the infusion of the Holy Spirit and the wonder of tongues, their cleansing was declared.
