A certain young man followed him, clothed in a linen cloth over his naked body, and they seized him. But he, leaving the linen cloth behind, fled from them naked. When it says 'clothed in a linen cloth over his naked body,' it is implied on the body, that is, on the naked body, because he had no other clothing than only the linen cloth. But who this young man was, the evangelist does not say. Whoever he was, he proves that a greater love for the Lord remained in him than in the others, who, while they were already fleeing, he, bound by the bond of love, did not cease to follow him until he was apprehended by the enemies. Although he had not yet perfected love, who could even while being held flee from the companionship of the Savior. Because just as perfect love casts out fear (1 John IV), so fear, besieging the mind, proves imperfect love.
