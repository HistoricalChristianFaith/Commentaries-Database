But after waiting another seven days, he again sent the dove out of the ark; and it came back to him in the evening, carrying a fresh olive branch in its mouth. For the olive branch found outside and brought into the ark by the dove signifies those who receive baptism outside the Church but are fruitful in the richness of charity and, with a pious intention, are upright like the greenness of leaves: many of whom, later on, as if at evening, are called back to the Church by the reconciliation of spiritual men, just as the dove did well after the seven days when it did not find rest outside itself. For the number seven of days is mystically adapted to the light of spiritual grace because, after spiritual men withdraw their minds from carnal desires, they strive to withdraw others as well, guided by the same spirit of grace. It may also be understood that in the dove, which brought the olive branch into the ark after the window was opened after the flood, this is prefigured: that, when the Lord was baptized in the Jordan, the heavens were opened, and the Holy Spirit descended in the form of a dove upon Him; that, upon each individual receiving baptism as a child of the Church, the hand of the bishop is laid upon them through the anointing of the sacred chrism to open to them the gate of the heavenly kingdom, so that they receive the Holy Spirit. To this figure aptly corresponds the raven that had gone out before the dove brought in the olive branch and did not return to the ark, lest prophecy should pass over in silence or Simon's unbelief, who was indeed baptized in the Church but, before receiving the grace of the Holy Spirit through the laying on of hands, was cast out from the Church because, filled with the gall of bitterness, he bore not the innocence of dove-like simplicity but the raven's blackness in his wicked heart.
