And the men who held Him mocked Him, beating Him, and blindfolded Him, and struck His face. The prophecy is fulfilled that says: "With a rod they strike the judge of Israel on the cheek" (Micah 5). But He who was struck then by the blows of the Jews is also struck now by the blasphemies of false Christians. But they blindfolded Him, not so that He would not see their wickedness, but to hide His own face from them as they once did to Moses. For if they believed Moses, they might perhaps have believed in the Lord as well. But this veil remains over their hearts to this day, not revealed to them, but taken away from us who believe in Christ. For not in vain, at His death, was the temple veil torn in two.
