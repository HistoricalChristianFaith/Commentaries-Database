As a learned teacher, Peter first admonishes unbelievers for the crime that had been committed, so that once their consciences had been stung by righteous fear, he might afterwards devote [his discourse] more advantageously to the plan of salvation. And because he is speaking to those who know the law, he shows that Christ himself is the one promised by the prophets. Nevertheless, here Peter does not at first give him the name Son of God on his own authority. Rather [he calls him] a man approved, a righteous man, a man raised from the dead—not raised with others in the ordinary and general resurrection (that is, the resurrection that is deferred to the end of the world), but raised in that resurrection celebrated on the third day, so that his assertion of a unique and glorious resurrection might acquire [the value of] a testimonial to his eternal divinity. For when he has proved that the bodies of others underwent corruption after death, he demonstrates that this man, of whom it is said, “I will not give over your holy one to see corruption,” was exempt from human impermanence. Peter also proves that he [Christ] exceeded the merits of the [merely] human condition and that he should therefore be considered to be God rather than [merely] human.In the history of Cornelius the centurion and in the sermon given by the apostle Paul at Athens, you will be shown the sort of introduction that the apostles used in preaching among the Gentiles.
