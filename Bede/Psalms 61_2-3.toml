We should note that this flood of temptations assails the church in three ways: “one is tempted, drawn on and lured by one’s own desire,” or is worn down by the depravity of false brothers or is assaulted by the more open snares of those outside [the church]. In another place the Lord calls these temptations “the gates of the lower world,” and rightly so, for if victorious they drag us down to eternal destruction. He says, “I shall build my church on this rock, and the gates of the lower world shall not prevail against it.” Although the gates of the devil strike against it, yet they do not overthrow Christ’s church; although the flood of faithlessness inundates it, it does not undermine the house of faith. For [the church] is able to say truthfully to its helper, “When my heart was disquieted, you raised me up on a rock.” It is not vanquished by external forces because, by suffering and acquiring the crown of martyrdom, it triumphs over the ferocity of the unbelievers who persecute it. It is not corrupted by false brothers because it refutes the dogmas of heretics by believing properly, and it avoids the vicious example of some Catholics by living soberly and justly and piously. It is not blinded by the smoke of private greed because it is inwardly aflame with the ardor of the Lord’s charity alone.
