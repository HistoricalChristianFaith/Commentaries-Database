And no one puts new wine into old wineskins; otherwise, the new wine will burst the skins; it will be spilled, and the skins will be ruined. But new wine must be put into new skins, and both are preserved. He also compares them to old wineskins, which, with new wine—that is, spiritual precepts—would burst more easily than they could contain it. But they will be like new wineskins, when after the Lord's ascension, they are renewed with the desire for his consolation by praying and hoping. Then they received the Holy Spirit, which filled them to speak in all tongues; from the Jews who did not understand, it was truthfully attested: These men are full of new wine. For new wine in new wineskins meant the fervor of the Holy Spirit filling spiritual hearts. Alternatively. A teacher must beware not to commit the secrets of the new mysteries to souls not yet renewed, but persisting in the old malice.
