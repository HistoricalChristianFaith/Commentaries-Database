So that as Peter came along, at least his shadow might fall on some of them and they would be healed. At that time, Peter visibly raised the sick with the shadow of his body, and even now he does not cease to strengthen the infirmities of the faithful with the invisible shadow of his intercession. And since Peter is the type of the Church, he indeed walks upright himself, but by his shadow accompanying him he raises those that lie down, because the Church, with its mind and love intending towards heavenly things, seemingly runs through the earth shadow-like, and here renews those by temporal sacraments and figures of heavenly things, whom it rewards there with perpetual gifts. Some connect to this place what the Lord said in the Gospel: He who believes in me will do the works that I do, and greater works than these will he do (John 14).
