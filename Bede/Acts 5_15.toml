At that time Peter visibly relieved the infirm by the shadow of his body. Now, he does not cease to strengthen the infirm among the faithful by the invisible screen of his intercession. And because Peter is a type of the church, it is beautifully appropriate that he himself walked upright, but by his accompanying shadow he raised up those who were lying down. So the church, concentrating its mind and love on heavenly things, passes like a shadow on the land, and here [on earth], with sacramental signs and temporal figures of heavenly things, it renews those whom there [in heaven] it rewards with everlasting gifts. Some relate to this passage that saying of the Lord in the Gospels: “He who believes in me, the works that I do he also will do, and greater than these he will do.”
