A certain girl having a spirit of divination. What pythonic divination entails in terms of knowledge, we find in the book of Kings, where, at Saul's request, a witch summoned either the soul of Samuel or rather an unclean spirit in his stead from the underworld. This kind of magical fantasy, discovered by Apollo Pythius and named after him, is thus called. But the Hebrew name also fits, who call the Python the mouth of the abyss.

As we were going to prayer, a girl having a spirit of Python met us. He who mercifully gathered the believing purple seller to the members of the holy Church, soon afterward strictly judged and removed the wicked art from the pythoness proclaiming the great deeds of God with an unclean mouth. For this is the power which the holy apostles received from the Lord, when He said: "Whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven; and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven" (Matthew 18). However, what I wrote in the previous book, that python could mean "mouth of the abyss" in Hebrew, I wrote because I found it in the book of Hebrew names. But let the reader know that this name is Greek and forcibly interpreted according to the Hebrew language, which even the interpreter of Hebrew names, Jerome, did not remain silent about, as if it were said "Fythona": for the Hebrews do not have the letter p, but use f instead of it in foreign words. Indeed, it should be noted that in this reading, where it is written that the girl met us, for the Latin "obviare" it is written in Greek ὑπαντῆσαι, which I thought should be mentioned, so that the reader may notice that the Lord's feast, which is called the Presentation of the Lord, took its name from this in Greek, because, when the Lord was brought to the temple, Simeon, Anna, and the other faithful and chosen ones who were there came to meet Him with devout heart and homage.
