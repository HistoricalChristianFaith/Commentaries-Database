A certain girl having a spirit of divination. What pythonic divination entails in terms of knowledge, we find in the book of Kings, where, at Saul's request, a witch summoned either the soul of Samuel or rather an unclean spirit in his stead from the underworld. This kind of magical fantasy, discovered by Apollo Pythius and named after him, is thus called. But the Hebrew name also fits, who call the Python the mouth of the abyss.
