Just as the six hundred years of life which Noah completed prior to entering the ark designate the perfection of faith and confession of those who approach the church’s sacraments of heavenly grace and perpetual reward, so also does the three hundred and fifty years that he lived after the great flood19 typify the perfection of those who, having received the sacraments of life, zealously and faithfully serve the Lord until death. For we say that three hundred, because it is denoted in Greek by the letter tau, which is written in the shape of a cross, most aptly signifies those who resolve not to glory except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ. Hence Gideon, at the Lord’s command and with his assistance, conquered the innumerable army of the Midianites with three hundred men, thus teaching figuratively that by faith in the Lord’s cross we will be victorious in the wars waged against us both by this world and by our own vices.
