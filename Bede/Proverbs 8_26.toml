"Before he made anything from the beginning," etc. Similar to this in the Gospel: "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. All things were made through him" (John 1). Perish those, therefore, who deny that the power of God and the wisdom of God, namely Christ, was begotten by the Father from the beginning, indeed even before any beginning could be said or thought. Another translation begins at this place: "The Lord created me the beginning of his ways in his works," which the Fathers understand to be spoken of the incarnation of the Lord, saying that by the mystery of a certain grace it is said, "The Lord created me," and not "The Father created me." Flesh, they say, acknowledges the Lord, glory signifies the Father. The creature confesses the Lord, charity names the Father as the beginning; or "in the beginning of his ways," as he himself said, "I am the way," because rising from the dead, he made a path for his Church to the kingdom of God, to eternal life. "In his works," because he was created from the Virgin to redeem the works of the Father; taking flesh to free the works of the Father from the bondage of corruption. For the flesh of Christ is for the works, the Divinity before the works.
