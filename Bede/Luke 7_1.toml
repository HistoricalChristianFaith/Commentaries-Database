When he had completed all his words in the hearing of the people, he entered Capernaum. Here it must be understood that, when he had indeed completed all his words in the hearing of the people, Christ entered Capernaum, meaning that he did not enter before these words had been finished, but it is not stated after what interval of time, once he had finished these discourses, he entered Capernaum. Within that interval, that leper was cleansed whom Matthew interposes in his own place, but this one anticipates beforehand.
