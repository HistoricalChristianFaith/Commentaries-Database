Golden apples in silver settings, etc. The sacred words are most rightly compared to silver settings; settings, namely, because they provide rest for the souls of the listeners; silver, however, because they shine splendidly with the virtues of the fathers. Where it is written: The words of the Lord are pure words: as silver tried in a furnace of earth (Psalm XI). To the adornment of the readers, he adds golden apples, whoever explains and demonstrates these divine words, full of spiritual senses and mysteries. These senses are aptly called apples because they arise from the tree of life, that is, the wisdom of God. Aptly golden apples, because they infuse the mind with the knowledge and love of eternal clarity. Therefore, golden apples in silver dishes, he who speaks a word in due season, because whoever knows how to preach the word of God opportunely according to the capacity of the hearers, sometimes repeats the examples and sayings of the fathers, through whose guardianship eternal rest is reached, according to the letter; at other times, he reveals the sweeter fruits of spiritual senses in these, by which he satisfies the pious desires of the hearers, having removed the veil of the letter.
