He was telling them that the time of that kingdom is secret, that it is accessible only to the Father’s knowledge. And, when he said, “It is not for you to know,” he showed them that he himself also knew (since all things are his which are the Father’s), but that it would not be expedient for them, as mortals, to know. Thus, being always uncertain about the coming of the Judge, they should live every day as if the next day they were to be judged.
