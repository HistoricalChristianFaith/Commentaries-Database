Certain wiser individuals were more cautious in not trusting the heretics and recognized in them the ancient dragon or serpent speaking in them (that is to say, the devil or Satan as in various writings of Paul or even as Christ himself spoke in his parables). These wiser individuals said, “Do not compel us to believe your new doctrine until we read through the writings of the fathers and inquire of the sevenfold Holy Spirit, who was given to the church as its light. If there will not be anything in them which will defend our faith, we will come out to you and leave behind the inner catholic unity and instead ally ourselves with you who have already left it and assail it. Then we will listen to you in that matter, even if it is against us.” “They went out from us but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would certainly have remained with us.” They said these things, however, not as if they would ever agree on any condition, but because they were most convinced of the soundness of the faith of their fathers and were confident that they would completely conquer the heretics in this exchange. - "Four Books on 1 Samuel 2.11"
