And the people were waiting for Zechariah and were wondering at his delay in the temple. But when he came out, he was unable to speak to them. And they realized that he had seen a vision in the temple, and he was making signs to them and remained mute. And it happened that when the days of his service were completed, he went home. This is what I said: that during their turn of duty, priests, being engaged solely in the temple's duties, not only refrained from the embrace of their wives but also from entering their own homes. From this, an example of maintaining perpetual chastity is given to the priests of our time, who are always commanded to serve at the altar. For since in those days the priesthood succession was sought from the line of Aaron, it was necessary to provide for a time to produce offspring. But because now it is not a carnal succession but a spiritual perfection that is sought, consequently, priests are commanded to always abstain from wives and always maintain chastity, so they can always serve at the altar.
