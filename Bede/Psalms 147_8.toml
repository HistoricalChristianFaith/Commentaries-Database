That you may be aware that God the Father worked not only on those first six days but “even until now,” read the [saying] of the prophet, “Before I formed you in the womb, I knew you”; and in the psalm, “He who shaped the hearts of every one of them”; and elsewhere, “Who covers the heavens with clouds and prepares rain for the earth, who produces hay on the mountains,” and other things of this sort. We must indeed note that [the psalmist] did not put the verb in the past tense, saying, “who covered and prepared and produced,” but in the present, “he covers, prepares, produces” in order to demonstrate that the Father works every day, no less on the sabbath than on other days. So that you may not doubt that the Son works all things equally, recall that [saying] of the psalmist: “He spoke, and flies and gnats came; he spoke, and the locust and the grasshopper came; he spoke, and there stood forth the wind of a storm.”
