Otherwise, the fraudulent one will not gain profit, etc.: he who fraudulently pretends to be good while living wickedly in secret, will not find the goods of the life to come; but he who truly acquires the substance of spiritual virtues, from it will gain the brightness of the perpetual kingdom; which he more clearly stated in the following verses, On the path of righteousness is life; the way of error leads to death. For the path of righteousness acquires the substance of virtues, which more precious than gold, buys the brightness of eternal life; but the perverse way, in which the fraudulent walks, having lost the temporary gain he seeks, leads to the eternal death he wished not to foresee.
