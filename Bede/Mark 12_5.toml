And again he sent another, and they killed him, and many others, beating some and killing others. A third servant with his companions, understand a chorus of prophets, who with continuous attestations confronted the people and predicted the evils that were imminent for this vineyard. But which of the prophets were they not persecuting? And they killed those who foretold the coming of the Lord Savior (Acts VII). And all these spoke much about the barrenness of this vineyard, but the lamentation of one Jeremiah is sufficient to mention. But I, he says, planted you as a chosen vineyard, all true seed, how then have you turned into a degenerate shoot of a foreign vine (Jer. II)? Clearly, by these three ranks of servants all the figures of the teachers under the law can be understood, the Lord elsewhere openly declares, saying: For everything written about me in the law of Moses and the prophets and the psalms must be fulfilled (Luke XXIV).
