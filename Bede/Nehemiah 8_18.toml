The literal sense is clear to this extent: the Feast of Tabernacles itself was customarily celebrated for seven days (i.e., from the fifteenth moon of the seventh month to the twenty-first); then, on the eighth day (i.e., the twenty-second day of the month), a second assembly of the people was held, an assembly notable for its greater festivity. For it is written in Leviticus, “From the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when you have gathered in all the crops of your land, you shall celebrate a festival of the Lord for seven days; on the first day and on the eighth there will be a sabbath, that is, a day of rest. And on the first day you shall take for yourselves the fruits of the most beautiful tree,” and so on. Therefore, for the seven days of the Feast of Tabernacles, Ezra read to the people from the Book of the Law of God, doubtless because this is our true feast of the mind in this life—that each day (i.e., through all the good works by which we are illuminated by the Lord), we should make time for reading, hearing and performing his words with a resolute heart. But this feast begins “on the fifteenth day of the month when the moon is at its fullest in the evening,” when all the obscurities of our mind are dispersed by the most luminous light of Christ. And the eighth day of the sabbath (i.e., of rest) follows it, namely, at the moment of our resurrection in the life to come by whose joys in our present life we are uplifted in hope but that we will then enjoy in reality when the most longed-for gathering, the whole assembly of the saints (both of angels and of human beings), having been gathered in their Creator’s sight and never to be separated, will rejoice.

He read from the book of the law of God, etc. As far as the meaning of the text goes, the Feast of Tabernacles was typically celebrated for seven days, that is, from the fifteenth day of the seventh month of the moon, up to the twenty-first. Then on the eighth day, that is, the twenty-second of the month, a gathering of the people took place once more, marked by a greater festivity. For it is written in Leviticus: On the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when you have gathered all the fruits of your land, you shall celebrate the Lord's feast for seven days. The first day and the eighth day shall be a Sabbath, that is, a rest. And you shall take for yourselves on the first day the fruit of beautiful trees, etc. (Leviticus 23). So Ezra read to the people in the book of the law of God during the seven days of the Feast of Tabernacles; because this truly is our genuine solemnity of mind in this life, that through each day, that is, through all the good works by which we are enlightened by the Lord, we may devote our attentive hearts to reading, hearing, and doing His words. This solemnity begins on the fifteenth day of the month, when the moon is at its fullest at night, whereupon all the shadows of our mind are resolved by the most brilliant light of Christ. And it follows with the eighth day of the Sabbath, that is, of rest, obviously at the time of the resurrection in the future life; the joys of which we are uplifted by hope for now, and then we will fully enjoy in reality, when that most longed-for gathering—the entire assembly of saints, both angels and men—rejoices together in the presence of their Creator, never to be separated.
