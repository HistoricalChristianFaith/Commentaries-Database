But he said to him: Son, you are always with me, and all that is mine is yours. But it was fitting to celebrate and be glad, for this your brother was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found. When he says: And all that is mine is yours, it should not be thought that this implies that they are not also the brother’s, as if you were to suffer anxieties in an earthly inheritance. How could everything be the older’s if the younger also has his own share? For indeed, everything belongs to the perfect and fully purified and now immortal children in such a way that all things belong to each one, and each one to all. For just as desire holds nothing without anxiety, so charity holds nothing with anxiety. Therefore, when we attain that blessedness, the superior things will be ours to live by, the equal things ours for companionship, the inferior things ours to rule over. But if anyone is troubled as to how, in supplicating the Father, the truth says: And all mine are yours, and yours mine, which seems very similar to what is said to this son: And all that is mine is yours, let him know that all that belongs to the Father belongs to the only-begotten Son, because he is also God, and being born of the Father, he is equal to the Father. For even what he says concerning the Holy Spirit: All things that the Father has are mine, therefore I said that he will take of mine and declare it to you, he spoke of those things that pertain to the very divinity of the Father, in which he is equal to the Father, possessing all that the Father possesses. For the Holy Spirit was not to take something from the creature that is subject to the Father and the Son when he said: He will take of mine, but certainly from the Father from whom the Spirit proceeds and from whom the Son is born. Whether therefore these two sons should be referred to the two peoples, or as some prefer to any two individuals, namely the penitent and the just, or one who seems just to himself, let the older brother rejoice, for the younger brother was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found.
