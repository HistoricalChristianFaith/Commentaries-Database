I will pour out of my spirit upon all flesh. The word effusion shows the largess of the gift, because, not as before to the prophets and to the priests only, but to all indiscriminately in both sexes, conditions, and persons, the grace of the Holy Spirit would be given. For what all flesh may mean, the prophet subsequently explained.

And your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, etc. And I will show wonders in heaven above, and signs on earth beneath. Wonders in heaven, when a new star appeared at the birth of the Lord, the sun was darkened when He ascended the cross, and the very heavens were covered with darkness. Signs on earth, when the Lord gave up the Spirit, the earth quaked, the graves opened, rocks were split, and many bodies of the saints who slept arose.
