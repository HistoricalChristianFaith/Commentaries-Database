The same knowledge from which Scripture itself was originally composed is always increased and never ceases to be multiplied.… Moses acquired more knowledge than the patriarchs.… Likewise the Lord himself declares the apostles to have known greater things than the prophets.… “Many prophets … desired to see the things you see and did not see them.…” But he also promises them still greater grace of knowledge after his resurrection and ascension.
