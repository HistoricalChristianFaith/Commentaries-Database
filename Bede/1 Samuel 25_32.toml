And David said to Abigail: Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, etc. The Lord refers the grace to the believing synagogue to the glory of the Father, signifying that we should always bless and praise Him; also rewarding the believing synagogue that prays even for the unbelievers with deserved blessing. Simultaneously showing how pleasing He considers a prayer that is made with a benevolent mind for the adversaries.
