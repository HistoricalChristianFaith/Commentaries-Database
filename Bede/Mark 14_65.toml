And some began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to buffet him, and to say to him: Prophesy. And the officers struck him with the palms of their hands. The prophecy was fulfilled here which says: I gave my cheeks to the smiters, and I did not hide my face from confusion and spitting (Isaiah 50:6). But he who was struck then with buffetings from the Jews is now also struck by the blasphemies of false Christians. He who was then spat upon with the saliva of the unbelievers is now even to this day dishonored and provoked with insults by the frenzied only in name faithful. They covered his face, not so that he would not see their crimes, but so that they themselves, as they once did to Moses, might hide from themselves the grace of his knowledge. For if they believed Moses, they might perhaps also believe in the Lord. That veil remains until this day upon their hearts not revealed. But it has been taken away for us who believe in Christ. For it was not in vain that the veil of the temple was torn in two at the moment he died, and the things that had been hidden throughout the whole time of the law, and had been concealed from the carnal Israel, were made manifest to the worshippers of the New Testament in the sanctum sanctorum secrets. But what they say to him: Prophesy, and according to other evangelists: Prophesy who is the one who struck you; they do this as if in scorn of him who wished to be considered a prophet by the people. But he himself arranging what he suffers, everything is done for us, as Peter exhorts: Since Christ suffered in the flesh, let us arm ourselves with the same thought, and be prepared to endure the mocking insults for his name.
