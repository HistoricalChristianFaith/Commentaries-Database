"The sons of Javan were Elishah, Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim. From the Ionians, that is, the Greeks, are born the Elishah, who are called Elishites, hence also the fifth language of Greece is called Aeolic, which they call 'penten dialecton.' Josephus assumes Tharsis to be Cilicia, saying that the letter 'h' has been corruptly omitted in 'Thar' by later generations; hence also their metropolis city is called Tarsus, glorious in the apostle Paul's time. (Some think that Tharsis, from where gold was brought to Solomon, refers to the region of India.) Kittim is from Kittim, from whom to this day the city of Cyprus is named. Dodanim is identified as the Rhodians, for it is better read as Rodanim, or Rodim, as the Septuagint translators rendered it, and even our translator placed it in the book of Hebrew names. For the similarity of the letters Daleth and Resh often causes this error among the Hebrews, so that one is read for the other. But Rhodes is the largest of the Cyclades, and once the most powerful city in the Ionian Sea, glorious in naval combat, and a refuge for all merchants because of its very safe harbor.
