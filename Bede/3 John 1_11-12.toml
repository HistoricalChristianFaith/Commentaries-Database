Beloved, do not imitate what is evil, but what is good. He reveals that he desires him to imitate what is good by adding:

Demetrius has received a good testimony from everyone. That is, he himself welcomed the weak and supported the needy for the sake of the truth. Therefore, Gaius should also imitate him, so that he too may be worthy of the praise of all.
