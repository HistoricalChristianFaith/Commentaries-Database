Then, it says, King Darius issued an order, and they searched in the archive of the books which were stored in Babylon, and there was found in Ecbatana, which is a fortress in the province of Madena, a scroll, and this record was written in it: In the first year of Cyrus the king, King Cyrus decreed that the house of God which is in Jerusalem should be built in a place where they may sacrifice animals as offerings. Josephus stated the name of the place in which this letter of Cyrus was found as follows: And a book was found at Ecbatana in a fortress built in the region of Media? Moreover, another translation has the following: In Ecbatana in a very secure building in the region of the Medes. Hence it seems likely that the name 'Madena' means nothing other than 'Media'.
