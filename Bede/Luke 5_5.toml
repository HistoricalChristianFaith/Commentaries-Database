And responding, Simon said to him: Master, we have toiled all night and caught nothing. But at your word, I will let down the net. --Unless the Lord builds the house, those who build it labor in vain (Psalm CXXVI). Unless the Lord illumines the hearts of the listeners, the teacher labors in the night. Unless the instruments of discourse are let down through the word of divine grace, the preacher casts the javelin of his voice in vain. Because the faith of the peoples is not produced by the wisdom of composed words, but by the gift of divine calling.
