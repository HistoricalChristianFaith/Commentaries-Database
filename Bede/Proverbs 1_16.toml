"For their feet run to evil," etc. They hasten not only to the evil they work temporarily, but also to the evil they will suffer perpetually, as often as they hurry to commit murder or some other crime. For as much as they are led to commit a crime, so much they approach to endure the punishment for the crime. These things can be especially understood of the plotters against our Savior. However, the following verse is generally inserted about his faithful who equally endure the malice of the wicked.
