But Samuel rose up and went up from Gilgal, etc. The prophet demonstrates the same change of the kingdom which he had predicted by word also by changing the place. For even the Lord, who said of the unbelievers: "Arise, let us go from here" (John 14); having left the Synagogue, ascended the hill of the Son of the right hand, that is, the high hearts of that people; who wished to be the Son not of any earthly, but of heavenly and eternal blessedness; and the prophetic word illuminated by the dispensation of the Savior, through the literal revelation, by which rough minds were imbued, taught those perfected in the higher and more sacred mysteries of Christ and the Church. Indeed, what was said about the two peoples, we see carried out daily in individual persons. For the people set in Gilgal by Saul are terrified, while each of the faithful, either in the revelation of knowledge, which he received as less strong; or in the mire of vices, in which he shamefully fell, weakly fixed, the soul conscious of its frailty is troubled, and for the sake of seeking its own salvation, usefully stirs up itself, lest perhaps the spiritual adversary Machmas, that is, humility, which he especially desires, be overcome; lest the revelation of heavenly doctrine be taken away; lest the walls of the other virtues be broken through by the deceitful victor. Saul waits seven days, according to the agreement of Samuel, while someone in tribulation, with faith and diligent action, seeks the promised help of the Lord. For seven consists of three and four; three pertains to faith because of the confession of the Holy Trinity; four to works, because of prudence, fortitude, temperance, and justice; by which four as corners the whole structure of spiritual virtues is established. But when someone perfectly completes these seven days, that is, the light of sevenfold devotion, according to what the Psalm advises: "Wait on the Lord, be strong, and let your heart take courage" (Psalm 27); the Lord will come into the heart, and making his abode in it, will immediately destroy all the snares of the hostile army by the illumination of his coming. But he who has less of this perfection, less patient in adversity, less confident in the regard of divine aid, having forgotten that of Ecclesiasticus: "Do not delay in the time of distress" (Ecclesiasticus 10); loses all at once the ranks of virtues in which he had congratulated himself, by despairing; just as Saul, because on the seventh day not yet well completed, he despairs of Samuelâ€™s promised arrival, is abandoned by the people as they slip away; who, if he had completed the appointed time, would not have lacked the promised aid of the prophet: "For the Lord is near to all who call upon him in truth" (Psalm 145). But Saul increased his sin, not only by wavering about the promises of the prophet, but also by offering the burnt offering himself, which was fitting for the priest. Pelagius increases blasphemy, another so-called faithful increases it, while less diligent about divine grace, he confidently believes he can be saved by his own strength; and what is the gift of the high priest alone, he foolishly thinks to acquire by the decision of his own will. Therefore, according to the Apocalypse of John: Another comes, and receives the promised kingdom and the crown of life and blessing from such people. This change was signified not by the counsels of supernal beings, but by the human affairs themselves, as Samuel himself, when with the rejection of the unfaithful, and the election of the most faithful king foretold, he rose up and went up from Gilgal to Gibeah of Benjamin. Because the word of God sent into the world will not return to him void, but will accomplish whatever he wills, and will prosper in those to whom he sent it (Isaiah 55). And having left behind the hypocrites and cunning ones, who provoke the wrath of God, he seeks the simple and faithful, whom he may elevate to the heavenly kingdom, as hearers.
