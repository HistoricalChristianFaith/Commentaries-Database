And the father said to his servants: Quickly bring the first robe, and put it on him. The first robe is the garment of innocence, which man, well created, received but lost when poorly persuaded, when after the fault of transgression he recognized himself to be naked, and with the glory of immortality lost, he took on the skin, that is, a mortal garment. The servants who bring it are the preachers of reconciliation. For they bring forth the first robe when they assure mortal and earthly men that they will be elevated, so that they may not only be citizens of angels but also heirs of God and co-heirs with Christ.

And put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet. The ring is either the seal of sincere faith, by which all promises are inscribed with a certain impression in the hearts of believers, or the pledge of those nuptials by which the Church is espoused. And it is well that the ring is given on the hand so that faith may shine through works, and works may be strengthened by faith. But shoes on the feet announce the duty of evangelizing, so that the course of the mind tending to celestial things, may be preserved and kept clean from the contagion of earthly matters, and fortified by the examples of the former ones, may safely tread upon serpents and scorpions. Therefore, the hands and feet, that is, the work and the course, are adorned. The work so that we may live rightly; the course, so that we may hasten to eternal joys. For we do not have a lasting city here, but we seek the one to come (Hebrews 13).
