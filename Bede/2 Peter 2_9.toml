Peter says that the punishment of the wicked is kept in reserve until the day of judgment, not because they are not already receiving punishment for their sins, even before that day, but because then their punishment will be much greater. The reason for this is that at the last judgment they will be punished in their resurrected bodies, whereas now they are suffering only in their souls.
