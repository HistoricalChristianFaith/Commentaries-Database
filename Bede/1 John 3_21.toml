If the truth is that we love, and love is second nature to us, not feigned but sincere, seeking the welfare of others and asking for nothing in return except the salvation of a brother, we have confidence. If, in other words, our heart does not condemn us, then we have confidence toward God, not in the sight of other people but where God alone can see itâ€”in our hearts.
