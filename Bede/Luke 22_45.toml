And when He rose from prayer and came to His disciples, He found them sleeping from sorrow. And He said to them: Why do you sleep? Rise and pray, lest you enter into temptation. That is, lest the cup of my passion fall on you. Where He clearly shows that He prayed for them too, whom He diligently warns, by vigilantly and praying, to be participants in His prayers.
