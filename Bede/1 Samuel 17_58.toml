"I am the son of your servant Jesse the Bethlehemite. When the Lord was preaching before his passion and healing all those oppressed by the devil, which is to go out against the Philistine, to be laid low by the staff of the cross and the fulfillment of the Scriptures which were about him; some among the Jews were asking among themselves who he was, Elijah, or Jeremiah, or the Baptist, or another of the eminent prophets. But what they needed to know they could not, because by not coming to faith, they knew not how to inquire from him. But after the triumph of his passion, resurrection, and ascension, when the apostles were preaching, many of them believed and truly recognized him as the Christ, from Bethlehem of Judah, and the root of Jesse, according to the prophecies of the prophets, who came forth and defeated the kingdom of the prince of the world with invincible strength; which is to have had in his hand the head of the slain giant as a strong young man.
