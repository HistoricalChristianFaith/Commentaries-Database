It should not be supposed that this example of the psalm pertains to Christ’s resurrection, even though he [Paul] mentions it next to [his reference to] that event. Instead, it pertains to his incarnation, about which he spoke above. Moreover, the following verse very clearly bears witness to the resurrection. Since in the preceding verses he [Paul] concerned himself with his [Christ’s] incarnation, passion and resurrection, he wished to provide each [of these events] equally with testimonies furnished by a psalm. You then, he says, are eternal, Son before the ages. Now will you appear, born in time. Some manuscripts have, “just as is written in the first psalm.” This is explained as follows, “Among the Hebrews the first and second psalms” are conflated “in one psalm, which begins with blessedness and comes to a close in blessedness.”
