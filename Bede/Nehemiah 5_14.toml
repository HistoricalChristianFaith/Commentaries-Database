From the day on which he commanded me to be their leader, etc. Explaining this typologically, the Apostle says: “For the Lord has ordained that those who preach the Gospel should live by the Gospel; but I have used none of these things” (I Cor. IX). Nehemiah, along with his brothers, lived in such a way for twelve years during his leadership that they did not consume the provisions owed to the leaders, thereby mystically indicating that it is an apostolic work when someone promoted to the governance of the people of God nobly exercises the work of leadership by building up the Church, but does not seek material gain from those he governs by preaching and living well.
