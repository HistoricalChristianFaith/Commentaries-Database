"She considers a field and buys it, etc." The field means the possession of the heavenly inheritance. About which the patriarch blessedly speaks to his son Isaac: "Behold, the smell of my son is as the smell of a field which the Lord has blessed" (Genesis XXVII). For the odor of the saints is as the odor of a field which the Lord has blessed, because with the whole intent of their mind they contemplate what the fullness of blessing is in the homeland of the heavenly kingdom. Therefore the Church considered the field and bought it, because she diligently learned what are the joys of eternal life, and strove to labor whatever she could for their attainment. She even planted a vineyard from the fruit of her hands, because she established holy scripture from the fruitful deeds and words of her faithful, through which to strengthen the minds of her listeners in faith and love of their Redeemer. Nor is it irrelevant if by the name of vineyard we understand it to represent the Church itself, which is designated by the strong woman, and the offspring of the vineyard are the sons of the woman. The woman planted the vineyard when the early Church widely spread the seeds of faith through the world by sending out preachers. For she considered the field when she saw that the entire world, horrid with the thorns of vices, needed a spiritual cultivator. She indeed bought it when, sending teachers everywhere, she conferred the talent of the word on listeners, so that by believing she may subject them to the most blissful servitude of Christ. Moreover, she planted a vineyard in that field when she founded the Church among the newly believing peoples by the full instruction of evangelical truth. Which vineyard she planted from the fruit of her hands, because the apostles and their successors not only instructed the peoples verbally, but also joined the testimony of good works and the signs of miracles to their words of doctrine. But even up to this day and indeed until the end of the world, a strong woman considers a field and buys it, and from the fruits of her hands she plants a vineyard, because the holy Church is always diligently searching whom it can convert to the faith. And whoever it finds to be receptive, it buys them with the money of the word, into the service of Christ; and in them it strives to plant the vineyard of Christ, or rather to make them the vineyard of Christ. And because anyone who desires to teach another should first abstain from evil himself and exercise himself in good deeds, it is rightly added:
