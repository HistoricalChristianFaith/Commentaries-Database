For all the people were hanging on to hear him. This can be understood in two ways: either the people feared a tumult and did not find what they might do to Jesus whom they had determined to destroy; or they sought to destroy Jesus because, neglecting their teaching, they saw so many flock to hear him. Meanwhile, it is pleasing to consider briefly how beautifully the legal shadow of Passover corresponds, not only in mystery but also in the measure of time, with our true Passover in which Christ was sacrificed. He says, "On the tenth day of the first month, let each one take a lamb according to their families of their household." According to this rite, you will take a kid, and you will keep it until the fourteenth day of the same month (Exod. XII). For on the tenth day of the first month, that is, five days before Passover, as the evangelist John testifies, all the people went out to the Mount of Olives and took the Lord from there. Who is the lamb, because he came to take away sins, and there is no sin in him; he is the kid, because he was accused of sin. They brought the lamb into the house, singing joyfully, "Blessed is the King who comes in the name of the Lord"; the kid, they said out of envy, "Master, rebuke your disciples"; the lamb, the entire people were hanging on to hear him; the kid, the leaders who sought to destroy him. And five days before Passover, that is, from the tenth moon to the fourteenth, they kept the lamb or the kid to be sacrificed. Because although they thirsted for his blood even then, no one laid hands on him, because his hour had not yet come. They kept the lamb, who willingly listened to his words; the kid, who through their plots sought to catch something from his mouth to accuse him. But on the completed fourteenth day, that is, during the evening, after he handed over the sacraments of his body and blood to be celebrated by his disciples, for those coming who would bind and seize him, there began to be fulfilled what follows: "And all the assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it in the evening" (Exod. XII). For by the cross of Jesus stood not only the wicked who mocked his death, but also the saints who mourned. I have chosen to briefly touch upon these matters to remind the reader that everything which follows leading up to the Lord's passion pertains to the figure of the lamb retained in the house and prepared for sacrifice.
