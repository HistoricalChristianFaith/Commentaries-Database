And three companies went out to pillage from the camps of the Philistines, etc. And everyone who legitimately fights in her camps feels that the Church is daily tested by these three companies. For three companies go out to pillage from the camps of the Philistines when impure spirits attempt to assault the guard of our inner man, either his rational part, or his irascible part, or his concupiscible part, trying to strip them of the riches of virtues, whether individually in each of them or all in one. To these parts, indeed, also correspond the names of those places and the said companies that went out. The way of Ephrath, which means the growing one, against which the first company marched, is the concupiscible part of the soul; rightly named thus, because it never ceases seeking increase; indeed, of good things, if it is ruled by Israel, that is, by the soul that longs for uprightness and the vision of God; but of evil things, if setting itself against the laws, it is ravaged by the wickedness of vices and unclean spirits. And it is fitting that when speaking of the first company, he said, “It marched against the way of Ephrath,” he added, "to the land of Saul"; for the first and indeed greatest aim of the wicked spirits is to turn the leaders themselves of the holy struggle away from the undertakings of virtues by the concupiscence either of the soul or of the flesh; so that from the deprivation of the leaders of justice, the wicked contagion may more freely spread among the unsuspecting people. The road to Bethoron, which means the house of wrath, to which the second company was heading, indicates even by its name the passion of the mind it signifies. This house was well governed by the Israelite owner when that exceedingly meek man, who was more meek than all the men who dwelt on the land, left Pharaoh, being greatly angered, to liberate the people of God. The Philistine, however, was plundered, when Cain, who was of the evil one, greatly angered by the righteousness of his good brother, was provoked to such an extent that by his wrath he broke the first laws of brotherhood through murder. The valley of Seboim, which means of the roes or the deer, to which the third company turned, figuratively announces the rational insight of the mind. For these animals are said to excel in keen sight; hence they are also called Dorcades by the Greeks from keen seeing; and it is not for nothing that they are so often mentioned in the Song of Songs under the praise of Christ and the Church. And rightly, not a mountain but the valley of the roes is mentioned, rightly placed against the desert; because we always need the help of humility, especially when discerning good and evil, lest our judgment goes astray, and the humbler one is, the more they understand what of the world is less to be loved and sought. Therefore, the road to the boundary of the impending valley of the Dorcades holds the way of the growing one, and also the way of the house of wrath, possessed by Israel in peace, when the people of God or any faithful person, with humble intent, recognizes what should be followed and what should be scorned, and endeavors to grow in the things that they usefully recognize should be followed until the perfect day; strives to be healthily angry and not to sin for anything that attempts to hinder either their spiritual insight or their progress and course; so that anyone who foolishly chooses evil for good by erroneous reasoning, and harmfully desires to pursue these harmfully chosen things, and thinks it necessary to be angry for everything that resists such concupiscence, all the paths and bounds of this person's mind are devastated by the bitterness of the invisible enemy.
