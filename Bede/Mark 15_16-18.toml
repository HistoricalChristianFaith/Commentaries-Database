But the soldiers led Him into the courtyard of the praetorium, and called together the entire cohort, and they clothed Him in purple, and after weaving a crown of thorns, they placed it on Him, and began to salute Him: Hail, King of the Jews. The soldiers did this because He had been called the King of the Jews, and because the scribes and the priests had accused Him of seizing power in the Israelite people for Himself. They did this in mockery, stripping Him of His former clothes, dressing Him in purple, which ancient kings used, placing a crown of thorns on Him instead of a diadem, giving Him a reed instead of a royal scepter, as Matthew writes, and worshipping Him as though He were a king. But let us understand all these things mystically. As Caiaphas said: It is expedient that one man should die for the people (John XVIII), not knowing what he said (Luke IX); so whatever they did, although they did it with a different intent, nevertheless, for us who believe, they were administering the sacraments.
