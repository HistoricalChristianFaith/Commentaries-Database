Sasabasar took everything, etc. Because surely none of those who are predestined to life can perish forever; but all who belong to the Lord, although they may seem to be led into Babylon, that is, the confusion of sins, for a time, are brought back by divine provision through association with the just also by whichever means to the peace of the Church. Moreover, the vessels which the army of the Chaldeans is said to have captured from Jerusalem and smashed, and the broken ones taken to Babylon, express the type of those who are so captured by the victorious devil, that before they can be saved by repenting, they are taken away from human affairs to be seized for eternal punishment.
