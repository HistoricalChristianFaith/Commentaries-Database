For each tree is known by its own fruit. Which fruit it is by which a tree should be distinguished as good or evil, the Apostle shows, saying: "Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are fornication, impurity, licentiousness, idolatry, sorcery, enmities, quarrels, jealousies, wraths, strifes, dissensions, heresies, envies, murders, drunkenness, revelries, and such like. I forewarn you, as I have forewarned you, that those who do such things will not inherit the kingdom of God." But the fruit of the Spirit is charity, joy, peace, long-suffering, kindness, goodness, faith, modesty, continence (Galatians 5). Furthermore, almsgiving, or prayer, or fasting, are indeed properly fruits of the good, but sometimes are simulated and even usurped by the wicked. About these the Lord says: "For they have received their reward" (Matthew 6). And elsewhere: "Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves" (Matthew 7). But for this reason, sheep should not hate their clothing, because wolves often hide themselves with it, showing one thing to deceive, and another to prey upon or kill those who cannot see the wolves under this sheep's clothing. Therefore, it is not this fruit by which he warns the tree should be known, but that which is shown above.

For they do not gather figs from thorns, nor do they harvest grapes from a bramble. I think thorns and the bramble are the cares of the world and the pricks of vices, about which it was said to the sinful man: Your land will produce thorns and thistles for you (Gen. III). But the fig and the grape, the sweetness of a new way of life which the Lord hungered for in us, and the fervor of love, which gladdens the heart of man. About which, with the Gospel shining, the voice of the turtledove resonates far and wide on the earth, the fig tree has put forth its figs, the flowering vines have given their fragrance (Cant. II). But figs are not gathered from thorns, nor grapes from a bramble. Because a mind still oppressed by the habit of the old man can pretend, but cannot bear the fruit of the new man. But if anyone wishes to object and say that Moses harvested a grape from a bramble when he received useful counsel from a gentile relative, and that they gathered figs from thorns, to whom it was said about the Pharisees: Do what they say, but do not do what they do (Matth. XXIII); let them know that just as a true vine sometimes reclines entangled in a hedge, bearing its fruit, the thorn does not keep its fruit for human use, so the words or actions of the wicked, if they sometimes profit the good, it is not the wicked who make this happen, but it is done by the providence of the supreme plan.
