To the angel of the church in Ephesus write. He reproaches part of this church according to the quality of its name and praises part. For Ephesus is said to be interpreted as a great fall and my will in it.

These things says he who holds the seven stars in his right hand. That is, he holds you in his hand and governs and controls you by his power.

Who walks in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks. Who, moving among you, investigates the hearts and loins of each one.
