Ephesus: Part of this Church he blames, and part he praises, according to the character of the name. For Ephesus is said to be interpreted, &quot;a great fall,&quot; as well as &quot;my will in it.&quot;

He blames part of this church, and he praises part of this church, according to the quality of its name. For Ephesus may be interpreted as either “great fall” or “my will in it.” … He shows that what he writes to the individual churches, he is saying to all the churches. For, it was not the church of the Ephesians alone, which, should it not repent, was to be moved from its place, nor was Pergamum only the seat of Satan, and not everywhere. Likewise, the remaining things of the individual churches are common to every church.… The “tree of life” is Christ, by the vision of whom holy souls are nourished in the celestial paradise and in the present body of the church.
