Samuel also judged Israel, etc. The Lord judges the Church at all times, in which, while it wanders on earth, He vivifies it with the light of His divine presence. For the days of Christ are the same as the days of the Church. About which He speaks in the Gospel: "As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world" (John IX). Elsewhere, specifying this clearly, He says: "And behold, I am with you all days, even to the end of the age" (Matt. XXVIII). He also judges it, either by teaching through adversities, illuminating with gifts, delivering it from an unholy people, or leading it to heavenly kingdoms. Therefore, with hidden presence examining each of the elect, their hope, faith, and love, how much each has advanced in the aforementioned virtues, He examines daily either by Himself, who knows the secrets of the heart, or through spiritual teachers. For that a year denotes a person through figurative speech is also proven by the fact that the four well-known humors, by which the human body is sustained, are harmoniously associated with the four annual seasons: true blood with spring, red bile with summer, black bile with autumn, and phlegm with winter. Furthermore, the memorized cities are rightly compared to the aforementioned virtues, as their very names indicate, of which Bethel is translated into "house of God," Galgal into "wheel," and Masphat into "watchtower." The house of God signifies those who, having recently accepted the mystery of faith, have already become the temple of their Creator. The type of wheel alludes to those who, confirmed by the certainty of hope, have undertaken the swift course of transferring from this world in mind. By the name "watchtower" are expressed those who, perfected by the excellence of love, although still dwelling in the flesh, have learned to transcend the confines of the flesh by contemplating eternity. Indeed, it is narrated above that Samuel gathered Israel in Masphat, and there judged them, and went against the Philistines to fight them, but, while he was offering a burnt offering, they were defeated and fled. Now, however, he is reported to have also circled around two other cities, as if they were associates with Masphat, because the principal virtue that gathers the Church and fortifies it against all enemies is charity. But so that one may worthily attain to this, it is necessary first to care for the gift of faith, which purifies hearts, and hope, which leads to higher things.
