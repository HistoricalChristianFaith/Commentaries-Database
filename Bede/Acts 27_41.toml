This ship perished because it did not glide over the waves with a smooth movement. Rather it became violently stuck upon the sea floor, part [of the ship] held fast, while part was broken up by the smashing waves. Such, without a doubt, is the fate of a mind attached to this world. When such a one has made no effort to trample mundane desires underfoot, he fixes the prow of his intention radically upon the earth, and therefore with the waves of cares he dashes to pieces the whole structure of works that follow [from that intention.] However, those who escaped on the pieces of this ship made for the land, because, affected by the example of those who are perishing, others conduct themselves with greater care.
