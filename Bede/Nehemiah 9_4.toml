And we prayed to our God and set watchmen on the wall day and night against them. This is the sole /725/ refuge against all enemies of the Church - namely prayer to God and the zeal of teachers who, meditating day and night on his law, fortify the hearts of the faithful against the attacks of the devil and his soldiers by preaching, consoling, and exhorting.
