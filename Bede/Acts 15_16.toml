The tabernacle of David signifies a trace of the law, which was corrupted and torn to pieces by the betrayals of the Pharisees. However, with the Lordâ€™s return, that is, his appearance in the flesh, it was built up by God with spiritual grace, so that not only the Jews but also all the Gentile nations would seek after his name.
