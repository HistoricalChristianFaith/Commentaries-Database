God put it into my heart, and I assembled the nobles and the officials and the common people, that I might make a census of them. And I found the census book of those who had come up first. When, therefore, not only the nobles and officials but also all the common people had assembled before him, he diligently endeavored to make a census of their number so that, having made a review of the total of all the people, he might be able to determine which ones should dwell in the city of Jerusalem itself and which in the other cities.
