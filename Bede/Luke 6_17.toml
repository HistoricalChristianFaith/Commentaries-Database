And he descended with them and stood on a level place, and a crowd of his disciples, and a great multitude of people. The Lord went up into the mountains to choose the apostles, but he returned to the plains to teach the crowds, for the crowds can only see Christ in humility. For this is the standard which the Apostle followed when he said: I could not speak to you as spiritual people, but as carnal ones. As infants in Christ, I fed you with milk, not solid food. For you were not yet able, but even now you are not able (I Cor. III). However, the apostles themselves, according to Matthew, being more perfect, are said to have been taught both on the mountain and with the mouth of the Savior open. Where, if anyone wishes to examine both evangelists more carefully, it can be understood that when on the mountain he chose the twelve disciples from among the many, whom he also named apostles, which Matthew omitted, then he delivered the address which Matthew included and Luke omitted, that is, on the mountain. And then when he descended, in the level place he delivered another similar address, about which Matthew was silent, but Luke was not, and both addresses concluded in the same way.

From all Judaea and Jerusalem and the maritime regions, and Tyre and Sidon, etc. I consider the maritime multitude not to be from the nearby Sea of Galilee (for he would not place this among miraculous locations), but from the great sea, in which even Tyre and Sidon could be included. Truly, because they are cities of the Gentiles, given indeed to the Jews by lot, but not possessed by them, since the enemies could not be exterminated, they are specifically mentioned by name, so that the fame and power of the Savior may be hinted at, which summon even foreign cities to obtain health and doctrine. It should be noted here that although the Lord had mercy on the Gentiles coming to him, as he healed the centurion's boy and the daughter of the Canaanite woman upon approving their faith, he is not found to have entered their cities, lest he provide a reason for complaint to the fault-finding Jews, but he rather reserved the perfect salvation of the Gentiles for the time of his passion and resurrection. When that time was imminent, and the Gentiles sought to see him, he said: Unless a grain of wheat falls to the ground and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it produces much fruit (John XII).
