And approaching, he bound up his wounds, pouring on oil and wine. Sins, which he found in men, he restrained by reproving, instilling hope of pardon in those who repent, and terror of punishment in those who sin. For he binds up the wounds when he commands: "Repent," he pours oil when he adds: "for the kingdom of heaven is at hand" (Matthew 3). He also pours wine when he says: "Every tree that does not produce good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire" (ibid.).

And setting him on his own beast, he brought him to an inn, and took care of him. His beast is the flesh, in which he deigned to come to us. And he set the wounded man on it because he bore our sins in his body on the wood (1 Peter 2); and according to another parable, having found the sheep that had strayed, he placed it on his shoulders and brought it back to the flock (Luke 15). Therefore, to be set on the beast is to believe in the very Incarnation of Christ, to be initiated into his mysteries, and simultaneously to be protected from the enemy's attack. The inn is the present Church, where travelers are refreshed, returning from this pilgrimage to the eternal homeland. And rightly so, he brought him to the inn, having set him on the beast, for no one will enter the Church unless baptized, unless united to the body of Christ.
