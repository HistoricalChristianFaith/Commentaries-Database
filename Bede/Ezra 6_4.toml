“And so that they lay foundations that may support a height of  cubits and a breadth of  cubits, three rows of unfinished stones and in the same way rows of new timber”: we need not comment on it because neither in the building of the first temple nor of the subsequent one are any of these measurements or works of this sort found. It can thus be inferred that Cyrus proposed this from his own ideas and that he noted the measurements and arrangement of the work as seemed appropriate to him. Indeed, as Chronicles relates, in the first measurement (that is, inside the inner walls) the temple was  cubits long and  cubits wide, but the height, as the history of Kings explains, was  cubits to the upper room; from there to the high chamber an additional  cubits, which was the level reached by the top of the porticos, as Josephus attests; and from there another  to the top of the roof, which is to say,  cubits all together, as Chronicles explains. Yet how does it say that three rows of unfinished stones and in the same way rows of new timbers are to be laid, when all inside the temple was lined with cedar, unless perhaps it was a custom of the Persians to make temples with varied work in such a way that there were three rows of stones throughout the walls and a fourth made skillfully from timbers, and Cyrus thought that this should be done too in the same manner in the Jerusalem temple; or perhaps we should understand that he spoke of the courtyard of the priests, which, built in a circle around the temple, had three rows of finished stones and a fourth of cedar wood and was as high as a man’s chest; or else of the portico of the Lord’s house that was in the front of the temple, concerning which Scripture, when King Solomon’s palace was being built, relates thus: “And he made the greater courtyard round with three rows of hewn stones and one row of planks of cedar, and also in the inner courtyard of the Lord’s house and in the portico of the house.”

And in the reign of Ahasuerus, in the beginning of his reign, they wrote an accusation against the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem. And in the days of Artaxerxes, Bishlam, Mithredath, and Tabeel, and the rest that were in their council wrote to Artaxerxes king of the Persians, and so on. Josephus believes that this Artaxerxes, who upon receiving the letter of accusation from the Samaritans forbade that Jerusalem and the temple be rebuilt, is Cyrus's son Cambyses, who after the thirty-year reign of his father himself ruled for eight years. After him, the Magi ruled for one year and they were succeeded by Darius son of Hystaspes, during whose second year, in which he authorized the rebuilding of the temple, the angel interceding on behalf of the people said through the prophet Zechariah: Oh Lord of hosts, how long will you withhold your mercy from Jerusalem and from the cities of Judah, which you have been angry with these seventy years? Perhaps the reason that no mention is made of whether Ahasuerus, to whom a letter of accusation is likewise said to have been sent, wrote back or responded in any way is that he either died the very year he began to rule and left the authority to rule and look into these matters to Artaxerxes; or, being a contemporary of Artaxerxes but of lesser power, so to speak, he allowed him to deal with and decide on them.
