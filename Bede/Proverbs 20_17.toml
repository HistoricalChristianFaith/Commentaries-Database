Sweet is the bread of falsehood to a man, etc. In whichever member one has sinned more, in that member he will suffer greater torment in retribution. Therefore, rightly, he who has sinned more with his tongue is said to burn more in it, as his mouth is to be filled with a burning stone, which is known to have happened to the rich man who feasted splendidly daily, as he, burning in hell, asked for his tongue to be cooled by Lazarus. For he who had erred in idle words and feasting burned more in his tongue.
