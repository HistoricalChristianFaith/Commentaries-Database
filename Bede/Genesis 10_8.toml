Moreover, Cush begat Nimrod. He began to be mighty on the earth, and he was a mighty hunter before the Lord. While the progeny of Shem and Japheth remained in the innocence of a simple life, a cursed offspring was born of the lineage of Ham, who would pervert the state of human interaction with a new way of living, being lifted up with unique power, living first by hunting; then, having gathered an army, he endeavored to exercise unusual tyranny over peoples; and finally, he is read to have had a kingdom and to have built great cities: which Scripture confirms because he was the first to do so, as it says: He began to be mighty. He began indeed because he was the first to do it. Moreover, he was mighty on the earth because, neglecting heavenly matters, in which the just are mighty, he learned to seek lowly things and place his hope in them.
