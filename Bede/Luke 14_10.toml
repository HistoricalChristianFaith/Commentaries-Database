But when you are invited, go, recline in the lowest place. The more you are, he says, humble yourself in everything (Eccli. III). And the Psalmist boasts: "I have been humbled in every way, Lord, revive me according to your word" (Ps. CXVIII). Clearly indicating that he can be revived by the Lord if he himself feels humble about his virtues.

So that when the one who invited you comes, he may say to you: Friend, move up higher. The Lord, coming and finding him humble, calling him blessed by the name of friend, will order him to ascend higher. For whoever humbles himself as a little child, he is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.

Then you will have glory in the presence of those who recline with you. It is beautifully said: Then you will have glory, so that you do not begin to seek now what is reserved for you at the end; for, as Solomon says, an inheritance hastened at the beginning will lack blessing in the end. But it can also be understood in this life, that he who is found reclining in the lowest place will be exalted by the coming of the Lord, because the Lord enters his marriage daily, judging the manners, seats, and habits of those dining, despising the proud and often granting such great gifts of his spirit to the humble that he rightly glorifies them with the admiration of the unanimous assembly of those who recline, that is, of those who rest in faith, and jumping up in praise of his author, he says: "But to me, your friends, O God, have been greatly honored; their sovereignty has been greatly strengthened."
