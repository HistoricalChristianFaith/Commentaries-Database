earth: Preachers pour out the wrath of God in a twofold manner, while they either impose the punishments of the ungodly upon the ungodly themselves by judging spiritually; as Peter said to Simon, &quot;Thy money perish with thee;&quot; or they manifest it to holy Church by preaching, as he also said, &quot;For their judgment now of a long time lingereth not, and their perdition slumbereth not.&quot; A third manner may also be understood, in that each sinner, as the preaching of the truth is heard, is destroyed by the severer wound of contradiction, of which the Lord said, &quot;If I had not come and spoken unto them, they had not had sin.&quot;
