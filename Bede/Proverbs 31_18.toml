She tasted and saw that her trading was good, etc. What he says, "Her trading," surely refers to that field which he mentioned above: "She considered a field and bought it." Therefore, the holy Church tasted, a perfect soul tasted, that is, recognized from the innermost desire of the mind, that the trading of everlasting life is good, which we merit in heaven by forsaking temporal allurements. She tasted, that is, she clearly learned that it is good through the insistence of preaching to lead as many as possible into the way of truth. And therefore, the lamp of her devotion cannot be extinguished by any darkness of tribulations, nor even by death itself. For their lamp is extinguished in the night, even though it seems to burn by day, who, as the Lord says: "For a while believe, and in a time of temptation fall away" (Luke VIII); but even their lamp is extinguished at midnight who, when the judge comes, are found to have no oil of charity in the vases of their hearts, while, having lost the boast of false virtues, they undergo the torments of real darkness. But if we wish to interpret night here as rest, as is said above, "She rose from the night," that is, she prepared herself to work after rest, it is aptly said that the lamp of the holy Church is not extinguished in the night because even when she rests from the business of action, she is more freely devoted to the light of heavenly contemplation. While she ceases from public works, she takes care to more ardently dedicate herself either to the hearing of sacred readings or divine praise: like the example of the industrious woman who not only tends to necessary labors by day but also often at night, by the light of the burning lamp, takes equal care of the household.
