But one of the lawyers, answering, said to him: Teacher, in saying these things you also reproach us. How miserable a conscience that, hearing the word of God, thinks itself reproached, and always understands itself to be condemned by the mentioned punishment of the faithless. Hence, for me and my kind, the only refuge remains to supplicate the Lord with the prophet: May my ways be directed to keep your statutes. Then I shall not be ashamed, while I have regard for all your commandments (Psalm 119).
