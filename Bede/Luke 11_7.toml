And he from within shall answer: Do not bother me, the door is now shut, and my children are with me in bed. I cannot rise and give to you. The door of the divine friend is the understanding of the word, which the Apostle prays to be opened for speaking the mystery of Christ. And it is closed in the time of the famine of the word when understanding is not given. And those who, like bread distributors, preached gospel wisdom throughout the world, the children of the master of the house, are now in secret rest with the Lord. Yet through prayer, it is accomplished that he who desires understanding receives it from God Himself, even if a man is not present through whom wisdom is preached.
