Moses and Elijah, who talked with the Lord on the mountain, and spoke about his passion and resurrection, represent the oracles of the law and prophets which were fulfilled in the Lord.… The figures of Moses and Elijah embrace all who are finally to reign with the Lord. By Moses, who died and was buried, we can understand those who at the judgment are going to be raised up from death. By Elijah, on the other hand, who has not yet paid the debt of death, we understand those who are going to be found alive in the flesh at the judge’s coming.
