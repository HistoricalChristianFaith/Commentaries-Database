As regards the first part of his statement, namely, “he made little doors of olive wood,” he seems to have wanted to explain this more clearly when he added “and two doors of olive wood.” For there was one entrance to the oracle. But this entrance was closed by two doors and was opened again when they were unlocked, just as the temple and the portico before the temple no longer had an entrance. They give rise to a certain mystery because [since there is] “one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God,” we must hope for one entrance into the present church after baptism and one entrance into the heavenly kingdom through works of faith.
