The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom. There are two fears of the Lord: the first is servile, which is called the beginning of knowledge or wisdom; the second is friendly, which accompanies the perfection of wisdom. Servile fear is the beginning of wisdom because whoever begins to be wise after the error of sins is first seized by divine fear, lest they be led to punishments. But this fear is cast out by perfect love (1 John 4). However, the holy fear of the Lord, which remains forever and ever (Psalm 111:10), is not excluded but is increased by charity. This is the fear by which a good son fears lest he offend the eyes of his most loving Father even slightly. For in the initial fear, the servile spirit still fears lest it be subdued by punishments from an angry master. Both fears, however, will cease in the future life; charity will never fail (1 Corinthians 13), but it will remain in the fullness of wisdom perpetually; which is to know the true and only God, and Jesus Christ whom He has sent (John 17:3).

Fools despise wisdom and discipline. It has been said of the wise man that he will become wiser upon hearing the word, and the one who understands will learn to rightly govern his actions. In contrast, it is said of fools that they do not only fail to attain the wisdom of right doctrine and the discipline of pure conduct but also despise knowing it. Indeed, while wisdom in the flesh was preaching, the wise rejoicingly ran to it: but the Pharisees and the chief priests spurned its saving words and deeds alike. And note that the singular form is used for the wise man, but the plural for fools, because there are not only more fools than wise people, but the assembly of the wise follows a single path of piety. Moreover, those erring with dissimilar doctrines have a dissimilar order of living.
