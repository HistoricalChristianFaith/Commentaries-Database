Your passions are at war in your members whenever your hands or your tongue or some combination of your bodily parts obeys the promptings of your depraved mind. It is also possible that the passions mentioned here are in fact good desires, pointing towards the riches and benefits of Godâ€™s kingdom. On account of these and many other such things there is often a struggle between good and evil going on in our minds.
