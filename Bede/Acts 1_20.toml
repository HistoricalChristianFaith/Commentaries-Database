Indeed these verses are clear and plainly set forth by the blessed Peter's interpretation. On the one hand Judas received a deserved penalty for his double-dealing, on the otherhand, by St. Matthias's acceptance of the place of Judas's ministry and apostolate, the most sacred fullness of apostolic perfection was restored.
