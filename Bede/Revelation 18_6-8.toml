[When the angel says, “Repay her double for her deeds,” he is praying] that [the city] that took delight in temporal enjoyments might be tortured with eternal sufferings. Since she took delight in the luxury of the present time, she took no effort to prevent the coming retribution. Therefore, in a short time she will be punished with both spiritual and bodily disaster.… The citizens of the heavenly land, who place Jerusalem before their own happiness, do not want to sing the Lord’s song in a foreign land, that is, to receive in the present time that joy that pertains to the future age.
