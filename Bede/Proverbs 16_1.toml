It is for man to prepare the soul, etc. It is certain that neither to prepare the mind, nor to govern the tongue, nor to do any good thing, we are able without divine grace; because without me, he says, you can do nothing (John XV, 5). How then is it for man to prepare the mind, and for God to govern the tongue, unless this specifically signifies in the time of persecution? about which the Lord said: But when they hand you over, do not be anxious about how or what you are to speak; for it will be given to you in that hour what you are to speak (Matthew X, 19).
