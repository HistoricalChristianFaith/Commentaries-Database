I am amazed at how some people interpret this as having to do with certain foods that were prohibited by the old law but that are now to be consumed, since neither serpents nor reptiles can be eaten. Nor did Peter himself understand it in this way. Rather [he understood it as meaning that] all people are equally called to the gospel of Christ and nothing is naturally defiled. For when he was reproached, he explained the symbolism of this vision, not [as giving the reason] why he ate beasts but why he associated with Gentiles.
