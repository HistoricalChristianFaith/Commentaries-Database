And should not this daughter of Abraham whom Satan has bound for eighteen years long, be set free from this bondage on the Sabbath day? The daughter of Abraham is any faithful soul, the daughter of Abraham is the Church gathered from both peoples into the unity of faith, which, after the time of the law and the fulfillment of the Lord's resurrection, through the sevenfold grace of the Holy Spirit, broke the bonds of long captivity. Indeed, in this way, perhaps the mystery of the Sabbath and the eighteen years can conveniently be understood. It is therefore mystically the same to release the ox or the donkey from the stall to lead it to drink, as it is to raise the daughter of Abraham from the bond of harmful oppression, that is, the Church gathered from Jews and Gentiles to be freed from the snares of sins through the water of baptism, and to be lifted up to hope for heavenly things. Certainly, it must be noted that the most impious heresy, from the fact that the Lord said, the woman bound by Satan, tries to assert that the afflictions of human bodies do not pertain to God as their author, but rather to the devil, as if the devil, although always desiring to harm, could harm anyone unless he received power from the Almighty. For what else is declared not only in the book of blessed Job, which the aforementioned heresy, along with the other books of the Old Testament, and with God Himself who gave it, malignantly spurns as being under the rule of an evil world prince, but also in the Gospel, where the demons could not even enter into the swine unless He Himself permitted it, as we have also taught above."
