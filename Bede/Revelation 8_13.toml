The voice of this eagle each day flies through the mouth of the eminent teachers in the church when they announce the evil of the heretics and the rage of the antichrist and the day of judgment, which with all severity will come to those who love the earth, saying, “In the last days there will come perilous times, and there will be men who are lovers of self,” and later in the same writing, “Men of corrupt mind and counterfeit faith,” and elsewhere, “Then that evil one will be revealed, who opposes and exalts himself over everything which is called ‘god’ or is the object of worship.” And again: “The day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; Wwhen people say, ‘Peace and security,’ then sudden destruction will come upon them.”
