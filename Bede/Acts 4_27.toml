Against your holy servant Jesus, whom you anointed. They interpret the name of Christ, about whom it was said: "And against His Christ" (Psalm II), according to the word. For Christ received his name from chrism, that is, from anointing. According to what is said: "God, your God, has anointed you with the oil of gladness" (Psalm 45:7), that is, with the Holy Spirit.
