And others, testing Him, sought a sign from heaven from Him. Either they wished for fire to come down from above in the manner of Elijah, or, similarly to Samuel, for thunder to roar, lightning to flash, and rains to fall in the summer, as if those could not also be slandered and said to have happened from hidden and varied passions of the air. But you, who slander those things which you see with your eyes, hold with your hands, feel with their benefit, what will you do with those things that have come from heaven? Surely, you will answer that the magicians in Egypt also performed many signs from the heavens.
