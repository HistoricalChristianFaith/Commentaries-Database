The foolishness of a man supplanteth his steps, etc. It is the habit of fools, that when they abandon the way of truth through sinning, they do not admit they have erred, but refer the origin of guilt to their Creator, as if He has given the opportunity for sinning, either because He made man fragile, or because He allowed a crafty enemy to tempt him. Hence also the first parent of our race, after the excess of transgression, being reproved by the Lord, instantly fled to the defense of an excuse, saying: The woman whom You gave to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I ate (Gen. III). And the woman said: The serpent deceived me (Ibid.). For they indeed turned against the Creator what they had sinned: he, that he had received a woman from the Lord as a companion through whom he perished; she, that the Lord had placed the serpent who deceived her in paradise. Against this the Wise Man prays to the Lord not to incline his heart to an evil word, to excuse excuses in sins. But also, he, failing his steps against God, burns with fervor in his mind, who, despising divine commands through his own inertia, even reproaches God Himself with an insane mind, as if He had imposed unbearable burdens on men.
