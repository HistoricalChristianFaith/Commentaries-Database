The spirit of a man sustains his weakness. And the man himself says, The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak (Matthew 26). It may also be understood of any holy man who supports the weakness of the flesh with the strength of the mind, lest he yields in temptations.

Truly, the spirit is easily moved to anger, etc. He who is easily moved to anger cannot even sustain himself, so that when he is angry, he often says things which, when calm afterward, he regrets having said and often does not even remember having said. However, his madness is sometimes most easily endured through the moderation of the wise and is immediately quieted.
