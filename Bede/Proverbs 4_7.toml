And in all your possessions acquire prudence. In all the good things you possess, remember to act wisely, or in all your possessions acquire prudence. Contemn all the earthly possessions you hold; provided you acquire wisdom. This is what Solomon himself did, when given the choice, he placed love of wisdom before all things (1 Kings III); and in the Gospel, he who sought the precious pearl, having found it, sold all he had and bought it (Matthew XIII).
