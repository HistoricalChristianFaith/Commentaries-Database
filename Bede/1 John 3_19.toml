When we do the works of godliness, it becomes apparent that we are of the truth which is God, because we are copying his perfect love to the best of our ability. When we love our neighbors in deed and in truth, we see clearly that we are reassuring our hearts in the light of the supreme truth. For whenever we want to do something, we think it over long enough to persuade ourselves to do it. Those who want to do something wicked also want to hide it from God as much as they can, but those who want to do good have no hesitation about reassuring themselves that they want to do this good in the sight of God.
