Let [anyone] beg, however, in faith, in no way hesitating. Let him, by living well, show himself to be worthy of being heard when he begs. For anyone who remembers that he has not obeyed the Lord’s commands rightly loses hope that the Lord pays attention to his prayers. For it has been written, “The prayer of one who closes his ear that he may not hear the law will be detestable.”
