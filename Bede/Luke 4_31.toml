And he went down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee, and taught them on the Sabbath. Behold the mercy of the Lord the Savior: neither moved by indignation, nor offended by wickedness, nor violated by injury, he does not abandon Judea; rather, forgetting the injury, but mindful of mercy, sometimes teaching, sometimes liberating, sometimes healing, he soothes the hearts of the faithful people. But that he especially grants the gifts of his healing and teaching on Sabbaths, shows that he is not under the law, but above the law, who also came to fulfill the law, not to dissolve it, choosing not the Jewish Sabbath, on which it is not lawful to light a fire or move hand and foot, but the true Sabbath and the rest beloved to the Lord, if, caring for the salvation of souls, we abstain from servile work, that is, from all illicit things.
