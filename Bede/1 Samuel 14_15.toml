And a miracle happened in the camps through the fields, etc. By the miracle, strength and virtue are given to the just among those who are reprobates camping through the fields, having hearts astray, weakened by both malice and an abundance of pleasures. Hence the blessed apostle Peter, when he described the excess of those who, as if residing in the field of free pleasure, live in desires, drunkenness, revelries, drinking bouts, and illicit idolatries, added, saying: "In which they are surprised that you do not run with them into the same flood of debauchery" (1 Peter 4). But also the spiritual adversaries, although fierce plunderers of human salvation, are accustomed to be astonished at the deeds of perfect men, and to yield to the devotion of perfect prayers and other virtues.

And the earth was troubled, etc. So that those who are wise in earthly things may be troubled by the deeds of heavenly men; so that demons, terrified and groaning, may recoil from attacking men, their malice broken and their strength shattered; this is not a work of human virtue, but a miracle of divine mercy. Hence Paul, when he said he had labored more than all of them, immediately added: "Yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me" (1 Corinthians 15).
