And it happened on the following day, as they were descending from the mountain, a great crowd met Him, and behold, a man from the crowd shouted out, saying: Master, I beseech You, look upon my son, for he is my only one. The places match the events: On the mountain, the Lord prays, is transformed, reveals to the disciples the secrets of His majesty; descending to the lower places, He is met by the crowd, struck by the lamentation of the wretched. Above, He reveals the mysteries of the kingdom to the disciples; below, He reproaches the crowds for the sins of unbelief. Above, He discloses the Father's voice to those who could follow Him; below, He expels wicked spirits from those who were being tormented. Even now, according to the quality of merits, He ceases not to ascend and descend for some. For those who are still earthly and beginners, as if seeking the low places, He strengthens, teaches, and corrects; but the perfect, whose conversation is in the heavens, He glorifies by exalting more highly, instructs more freely about eternal things, and often teaches those things which the crowds cannot even hear.
