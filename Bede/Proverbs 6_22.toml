When you walk, let them guide you, etc. Let your meditation of the Lordâ€™s law be so constant that when you are working while awake, you recall this with diligent mind; when you wish to sleep, you will rest in this memory; when you wake up, first recall this to your mind; for in this way you will neither err while awake, nor be harmed by the fear of the night. Another interpretation: When you walk in the progress of righteousness, let the commandments of God be with you to instruct you; when you sleep in death, let them guard your soul, so that the enemy does not seize it; when you awaken in the resurrection, speak with them in seeking the rewards which they promised you if you kept them.
