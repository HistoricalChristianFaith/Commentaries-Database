As if he says, "If it were man who promised these miracles, one might with impunity demand a sign, but when an angel promises, it is then not right to doubt. It follows; And I am sent to speak to thee.

Here we must remark, that the angel testifies, that he both stands before God, and is sent to bring good tidings to Zacharias.

But he gives him the sign which he asks for, that he who spoke in unbelief, might now by silence learn to believe; as it follows; and, behold, thou shall be dumb.
