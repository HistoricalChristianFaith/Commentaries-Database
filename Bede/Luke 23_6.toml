But Pilate, hearing of Galilee, asked if the man were a Galilean. And when he knew that he was under Herodâ€™s jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who was also in Jerusalem in those days. Pilate, indeed, lest he be forced to sentence him, whom he knew to be innocent and handed over out of envy, sent him to Herod to be heard, so that he would rather absolve or punish him, who was the Tetrarch of his homeland: truly, by divine Providence, lest any excuse remain for the Jews, as if they had not crucified Christ but the Romans, Herod also, who by birth and religion was a Jew, was permitted to show what he thought of him with his army. At the same time, the impiety of both provinces, namely Judea, in which he was born, and Galilee, in which he was raised and lived, conspiring in his death, is shown.
