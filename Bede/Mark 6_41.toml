Nor must we overlook the fact that as he was on the point of refreshing the multitude, he gave thanks. He gave thanks in order to teach us always to give thanks for the favors we have received from heaven, and in order to impress upon us how much he himself rejoices at our spiritual refreshment.

By the manifold grace of the Spirit he disclosed how matters that seemed insignificant and unworthy of attention might be fruitful, and he handed these things over to be administered to all nations by the apostles and their successors. Hence it is appropriate that the other Evangelists relate how our Lord administered the loaves and fishes to his disciples, and the disciples then administered them to the crowd. Although the mystery of human salvation received its start by being declared by our Lord, it was confirmed in us by those who heard it [from him]. He broke up the five loaves and two fishes, and distributed them to his disciples, as he opened their minds to understand everything that had been written about him in the law of Moses and in the prophets and the psalms.
