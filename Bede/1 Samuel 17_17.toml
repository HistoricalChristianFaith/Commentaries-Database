Jesse said to David, his son, etc. All the faithful Hebrew people said to the Lord Savior, about to be born of their seed, desiring His advent with eager longing: Take, I beg you, to refresh and help in the spiritual battle your people Israel, who are your brothers; for you have also deigned to become man and to be born of them according to the flesh; take, I say, appearing in the midst of their camps worn out by the daily battle, the form of perfect humility; and deign to freely undergo the observance of the law, to which you owe nothing. For pounded grain signifies the contrite spirit, and the heart broken and humbled. The measure of the ephah, which holds three seahs, signifies the spirit, soul, and body of the Lord Savior Himself, or of each one of the elect, perfectly united and combined with a worthy rite of humility. Indeed, this grain of humility appeared to us in the Lord in His own power, as much as He willed, to instruct us. But in all of us, it can be completed by the lower and upper millstone, that is, fear and hope. The ten loaves brought by David also openly demonstrate the nourishment of completing the Decalogue, which we have not from ourselves but as a gift of the giver. After He Himself was made under the law, He also made the burdens of the law bearable for us; just as by His undue humility, He taught us to be humble by the grace of so many debts, which we could in no way repay. But, He says, from the milk-like tenderness of the same Decalogue, so to speak, and as if still suited to infants, to the strength of spiritual understanding, by which He can refresh and strengthen also the great and distinguished leaders of the heavenly army, convert. Then indeed, our mighty and desirable One, after giving loaves to His brothers, and pounded grain, also brought little cakes of cheese to the tribune, when, after showing to the magistrates of the Jews the example of patience and humility, after not abolishing but fulfilling the mandates of the law and the prophets, He also opened the minds of His disciples, whom He was more intimately instructing as leaders of the Church, so that they might understand the Scriptures.

And you will visit your brothers, etc. And the Lord Himself in the flesh carefully attended to His own, if they acted rightly. And wherever and with whomever He found them, He made sure to visit and call them, and now also through His own members He ceaselessly does the same, distinguishing the good from the bad, giving His gifts to these, dismissing those empty-handed. This Isaiah commanded to do just as he commanded David, just as all faithful ones in Israel either in their own words or in prophetic speech entreated the Lord to come quickly and redeem the world, saying: Lord God of Hosts, turn now, look down from heaven, and see, and visit this vineyard, and direct it (Psalm 80), and other such things.
