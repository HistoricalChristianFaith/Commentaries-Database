But what I say to you, I say to all: Keep watch. Not only the apostles and their successors, indeed the leaders of the Church, but all are commanded to keep watch. We are all urgently ordered to guard the doors of our hearts, lest the ancient enemy break in by suggesting evil. We must each carefully avoid being found sleeping when the Lord comes. For each of us will give an account to God. He keeps watch who has the eyes of his mind open to the vision of true light. He keeps watch who, by working, keeps what he believes. He keeps watch who repels the darkness of lethargy and negligence from himself. Hence Paul says: Awake to righteousness, and do not sin (I Cor. XV). Hence he says again: It is now the hour for us to rise from sleep (Rom. XIII).
