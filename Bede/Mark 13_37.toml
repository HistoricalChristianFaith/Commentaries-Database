The heaven which shall pass away isnot the ethereal or starry heaven, but the heaven where is the air. For wheresoeverthe water of the judgment could reach, there also, according to the words of the blessed Peter, the fire of judgment shall reach . But the heaven and the earth shall pass away in that form which they now have, but in their essence they shall last without end.
The man who taking a far journey left his house is Christ, who ascending as a conqueror to His Father after the Resurrection, left His Church, as to His bodily presence, but has never deprived her of the safeguard of His Divine presence.
