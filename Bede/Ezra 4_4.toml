It happened therefore that the people of the land disturbed the hands of the people of Judah, and hindered them in building. Rightly does he call those who were trying to hinder the workers of truth and impede the work of the Church the people of the land, whereas those who were seeking to build for their Lord God with a uncorrupted mind (that is, to convert the minds and mouths of all those whom they could to do his will and seek his glory) he calls the people of Judah (i.e. 'he who confesses and glorifies'). Would that we did not know how often heretics, not just in individual cities but in entire regions as well, have impeded the doctrine of true confession either by wrongful instruction or even by violent threats. For - to pass over the teacher of the Gentiles who was imprisoned for two years in Caesarea and restrained his tongue from the duty of building God's house due to the persecution of the Jews - let us consider the blessed Athanasius, exiled for many years from his homeland by the attacks of the heretics who pursued him; Ambrose, besieged in his own city; Hilary, banished3 into exile; Eusebius, who suffered martyrdom; the many bishops in Africa who had their tongues cut out and were expelled from their province;6 and many others who were afflicted with a variety of punishments or put to death - all these left the house of God which they had built to profanation by the peoples of the land (that is, by men who were seeking their own ends not the things which are of Jesus Christ) until at a time foreordained by divine providence there were again sufficient resources for the rebuilding of the same house by wise architects after the captivity - i.e. until an opportunity was given to catholic Fathers to restore the Church after heresies had been detected and overcome.
