He approached Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. Joseph, indeed, was of great dignity in the world, but he is praised for having greater merit before God, so that by the righteousness of his merits he was worthy to bury the Lordâ€™s body, and by the nobility of his worldly power he could receive the same body. For not just anyone unknown could approach the governor and obtain the body of the crucified.
