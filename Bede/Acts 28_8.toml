Why did [Paul] heal a sick unbeliever by prayer, when he restored Timothy, one of the sick believers, by the art of medicine, and Trophimus, another sick believer, he left entirely? Was it not because this outsider had to be healed by a miracle since he was not inwardly alive, while those who were living with inner health had no need [of healing]?
