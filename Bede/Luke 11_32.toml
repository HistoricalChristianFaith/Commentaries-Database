The men of Nineveh will rise in judgment with this generation and will condemn it because they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and behold, something greater than Jonah is here. Jonah preached for a few days, I for so long a time. He to the Assyrians, an unbelieving nation; I to the Jews, the people of God. He to strangers, I to citizens. He spoke with a simple voice and, doing no signs, was accepted; I, doing so many signs, endure the calumny of Beelzebub. Thus, there is something greater than Jonah here, that is, in your midst preaching. And therefore, in the same way the queen of the south, the men of Nineveh will condemn the generation of Jews, that is, they will accuse them of infidelity. Otherwise: In the men of Nineveh and the queen of the south, the faith of the Church is preferred to Israel, which is reconciled to the Lord not less through repentance of past foolishness than through the industry of learning wisdom. For the unity of the Church is certainly gathered from two parts, namely, from those who do not know how to sin and from those who cease to sin. For repentance abolishes the crime, wisdom guards against it.
