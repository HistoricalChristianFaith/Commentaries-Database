So the children of Israel removed Baalim and Ashtaroth, etc. These idols are from the Sidonians; of which Baalim signifies the higher or ascending ones, and Ashtaroth the workmanship of explorers. Therefore, whoever of the children of Israel served the true God the Father at the preaching of the Savior, cast out all profane thoughts, which, ascending into the heart from the lowest, and not from above from the Father of lights, among the best and perfect gifts descending, desired to be above good; they removed every device of unclean spirits from their chest, who, going around the folds of the faithful, seek whom they may devour.
