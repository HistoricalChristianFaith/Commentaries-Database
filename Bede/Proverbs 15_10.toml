The instruction of the wicked leads away from life, etc. The doctrine is evil of those who desert the path of truth; about whom the Lord says, Whoever therefore breaks one of the least of these commandments, and teaches men so, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven (Matt. V). But such, if they repent their corrections, have an open return to forgiveness; but if they do not yield to ecclesiastical corrections, certain destruction remains for them.
