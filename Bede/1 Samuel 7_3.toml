If with all your heart you return to the Lord, etc. Here it is shown figuratively how the Lord teaching in Judea, performing miracles, suffering and rising, ascending into heaven and sending the grace of the Holy Spirit, made not only the Jews but also the Gentiles partakers of His mercy. Therefore, Samuel, having taken the priesthood after the death of Eli, addresses the whole house of Israel to remove foreign gods from among them.

And prepare your hearts for the Lord, etc. The Lord, author of a new priesthood, which is according to the order of Melchizedek, appearing in the flesh, teaches the whole house of Israel, that is, the Church of those desiring to see God, to remove from themselves the traditions of the Pharisees; and not only the works, which the law also taught, but also to prepare their hearts themselves to serve the Lord alone, saying: You have heard that it was said to the ancients: But I say to you (Matthew V.) Thus they can be freed from all enemies in the life to come.
