"The light of the righteous rejoices," etc. The light of the righteous, which perpetually rejoices, is the hope of future things; the lamp of the impious, which suddenly goes out, is the happiness of this fleeting world. Among the proud, there are always quarrels, but those who act with counsel are governed by wisdom. Heretics always quarrel among themselves, and so do other reprobates, because, evidently, they do not know the unity of faith and truth. But the faithful, who continuously enjoy the counsel of divine words, are governed by the moderation of wisdom, which does not allow them to quarrel.
