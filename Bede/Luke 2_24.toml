And to offer a sacrifice, according to what is said in the law of the Lord, a pair of turtledoves or two young pigeons. It is said in the law that for a child, if it is a male, as I have said before, on the fortieth day, if it is a female, on the eightieth day of birth, a year-old unblemished lamb for a burnt offering, and a turtledove or a young pigeon will be offered for a sin offering. However, if his hand cannot find it or he is unable to offer a lamb, he shall take two turtledoves or two young pigeons, one for a burnt offering and the other for a sin offering (Leviticus XII). Therefore, the Lord Jesus Christ, although He was rich, became poor for us and desired a poor sacrifice to be offered for Him. That by His one poverty He might make us wealthy in faith here and heirs of the kingdom there, which God has promised to those who love Him. Morally, whether someone has performed valiant works or created weak ones, which are distinguished by the names male and female, so that these might legitimately be consecrated to the Lord, it is necessary to offer a lamb of innocence and equally a turtledove or a pigeon of compunction. For since these birds have moaning instead of singing, they rightfully signify the tears of the humble, by which we greatly need even in our good works. For although we know that our works are good, we do not know with what strictness they must be examined by the Lord or with what perseverance they must be completed by us. But whoever does not have the wealth of virtues, about which the Apostle said to the Corinthians: “For you have been made rich in everything in Him, in all speech and in all knowledge” (1 Corinthians 1), if he does not find in the flock of his deeds a lamb of innocent life, let him at least offer two turtledoves or two young pigeons, that is, let him seek the aid of tears. And rightly two, one for sin and one for a burnt offering (Leviticus XII). For a burnt offering is called wholly burnt; because there are surely two kinds of compunction. The soul longing for God is first pricked by fear, then by love. First, it is moved to tears because, recalling its evils, it greatly fears to suffer eternal punishments for them. But when the anxiety of prolonged sorrow has consumed the fear, a certain security of presumed forgiveness is born, and the soul is inflamed with the love of heavenly joys. The mind contemplates what those choirs of angels are, that very assembly of blessed spirits, the majesty of the eternal vision of God, and weeps more because it is deprived of eternal goods, than it wept before when it feared eternal evils. Therefore, he who at first wept not to be led to punishment offered a turtledove for sin; of the other, he makes a burnt offering when afterward he begins to weep bitterly because he is deferred from the kingdom. He offers a dove for sin who labors in his groaning, washes his bed every night, that is, in each darkness of striking guilt, with good works, in which he should rest, he does not cease to wash with tears. They bring the young of doves as a burnt offering, who lamenting the absence of the heavenly fatherland say: “By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat and wept, when we remembered you, Zion” (Psalm 137). For as doves delight to sit beside the flowing waters, so that they might foresee and evade the advent of the hawk in the shadow’s swift flight over the waters: thus indeed, thus the souls of the poor in spirit, surpassing the waves of the world in their minds, the more they are nourished by their lamentations in this Babylon, the more they see the examples of the wicked enemy, the more frequently they raise their wings to the eternal of their desire. Certainly, there is this difference between the signification of the turtledove and the dove, that the dove, which is accustomed to associate, fly, and coo in flocks, demonstrates the frequency of active life: of which it is said: “Now the multitude of those who believed were of one heart and one soul, and no one said that any of the things he possessed was his own, but they had all things in common” (Acts 4). But the turtledove, which delights in solitude, so much so that if it loses its mate by chance, it remains alone thereafter, signifies the heights of contemplative life, because this virtue is for the few, and attributed to them individually. Isaiah alone sees the Lord of hosts, contemplates the praises of the Seraphim, and because he has spoken ill, he groans like a solitary turtledove. Moses, when the people are trembling afar, ascends alone to the Lord, and lest the same people be struck, he obtains by tearful prayers. Daniel is alone among the angels when his companions flee. Ezekiel alone marvels at the chariots of the Cherubim and the lofty buildings of the celestial city. Paul alone is caught up to the delights of paradise and to see the secrets of the third heaven. Likewise, when I enter the chamber, closing the door, I pray to the Father in secret, I offer the turtledove. But when I seek companions of the same work, by singing with the Prophet: "Come, let us worship and bow down before the Lord, who made us" (Psalm 95), I offer doves on the altar. And because both sacrifices are equally acceptable to the Creator, Luke wisely does not say whether turtledoves or young pigeons were offered for the Lord, lest he prefer one form of living to another, but teaches both are to be followed, both to be offered in divine worship. Therefore, since the discourse on purification has been extended, what the number of days of purification contains of mystery, and why the same is ordered to be doubled in the purification of the woman who has given birth will be more suitably explained in Leviticus.
