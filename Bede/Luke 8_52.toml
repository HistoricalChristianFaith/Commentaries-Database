They all wept and mourned for her. "Can the wedding guests mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them?" he asked. "But the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them, and then they will fast." Therefore, the synagogue, because it lost the joy of the bridegroom, by which it might live, lies as if dead among mourners, not even understanding this itself, why it is mourned.

But he said: Do not weep. She is not dead, but sleeps. Dead to men, who could not raise her, she was sleeping to God, in whose power her soul was received and lived, and her body, to be resurrected, rested. Hence, the Christian custom has prevailed that the dead, who are undoubtedly to be resurrected, are called sleepers, just as the Apostle: "We do not want you to be ignorant, brothers, about those who sleep, so that you do not grieve like the rest who have no hope" (1 Thess. IV). But even in the part of the allegory, when the soul which has sinned itself dies, yet it can be said to have slept to us, for it merited to be raised by Christ.
