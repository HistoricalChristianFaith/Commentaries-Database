And immediately the father of the child cried out with tears, saying: I believe, Lord; help my unbelief. No one becomes supreme suddenly: but in good conduct, everyone begins from the smallest things, so as to reach the great. For the beginnings of virtue are one thing, progress another, and perfection yet another. For if faith itself were not led to its perfection by certain stages, this one, when asked if he believed, would not answer: I believe, Lord; help my unbelief. For if he believed, why did he speak of unbelief? And if he knew he had unbelief, how did he believe? But because faith grows through the hidden inspiration of grace by the steps of one's merits, at one and the same time the one who did not yet believe perfectly both believed and was unbelieving.
