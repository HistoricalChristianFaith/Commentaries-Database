These precious stones individually were allotted to each of the foundations because, although all the [stones] by which the city of our God is adorned and established upon his holy mountain are perfect and shine by the light of spiritual grace, nevertheless “to one is given through the Spirit the utterance of wisdom, to another the utterance of knowledge, to another gifts of healing, to another various kinds of tongues, to another faith by the same Spirit” and the like. “Its builder and maker is God,” who is the Foundation of foundations and who for our sake was also found worthy to be High Priest so that by the sacrifice of his own blood he might both wash clean and dedicate the walls of this very city, and that whatever the Father has he might possess as his own. For this reason these same stones with the names of the patriarchs inscribed upon them were commanded to be placed on the breast of the high priest, so that by this most wonderful mystery it might be shown that every spiritual grace that each saint received individually and in part has been wholly and perfectly fulfilled by the mediator of God and man, the man Jesus Christ.

All the glory of the head is referred to the body. Just as “the true light that enlightens every person” has granted to the saints to be the light of the world, so also he himself, since he is the single pearl that the wise merchant purchased after selling all that he had, in similar manner compares his disciples with the bright appearance of pearls.
