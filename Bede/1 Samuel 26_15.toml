And David said to Abner: Are you not a man? etc. The apostles said: Are you not the scribes, learned in the law, chief priests, and Pharisees, excelling the people equally in rank and knowledge? Why did you not protect the untouched dominion of your people, insisting on the vigilance of perfect work and doctrine?

For someone from the crowd entered to kill the king your lord. Literally, this is said of Abisai, who entered the camp with the intention, if somehow possible, to kill the king. Allegorically, it is understood of the apostles, who with diligent warning predicted the future destruction of the wicked kingdom because of sins.
