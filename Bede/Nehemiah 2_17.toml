"And I said to them: You see the distress we are in," etc. These words are plain and very apt in a spiritual sense, because holy teachers, and indeed all who are fervent with zeal for God, are in great distress as long as Jerusalem, that is, the vision of peace which the Lord has left and entrusted to us, is seen to be deserted through the wars of dissensions; and they observe the gates of virtues, which, according to Isaiah, ought to have been occupied by praise (Isa. 60), being cast down and held in contempt by the prevailing gates of hell. Hence they strive, by gathering the ministers of the word into a single endeavor, to rebuild by faith and good action those things which seemed to be destroyed.
