Wherefore consider and reflect upon what you do, because, etc. I have explained, he says, what benefit and grace the faith of Christ has, and how great a hardness our leaders have shown in resisting it. Wherefore consider and reflect upon, by what order you have declined and avoided the malice of the proud, who did not want the blessing, and it will be prolonged from them, that you might not only escape His wrath but also be deemed worthy to receive the blessing of inheritance; because the malice of vindication against the leaders of your people, and against your own people, has been fulfilled; who, having formerly killed and stoned the prophets, to complete the malice of their sin, did not fear to lay hands on the Lord, the uniquely powerful one among the prophets, and they are the sons of the devil, choosing Barrabas the robber for themselves instead of Christ the Savior; so hardened in their minds, that they are unable to grasp the words of any of the spiritual teachers.
