She made a fine linen garment, and sold it, etc. In the weaving of fine linen is symbolized the holy preaching in which one softly rests, because the mind of the faithful is refreshed by a heavenly hope. Thus also animals were shown to Peter in a linen cloth, because the souls of sinners, mercifully gathered, are contained in the gentle rest of faith. Therefore, the Church made and sold this linen garment, because the faith, which it had woven by believing, it learned by speaking, and receives from the faithful the life of righteous conduct. And it gave a girdle to the Canaanite woman, because through the strength of demonstrated justice it extinguished the loose works of paganism. So that what is commanded may be held by living: Let your loins be girded (Luke XII). Indeed, well by the name of Canaan, who also begot the Gentile people and is interpreted as changed, the Gentile populace converted to faith is designated; which by a most blessed change, migrated from vice to virtues, from the devil to Christ. Hence also the forty-fourth Psalm is written in his praise, whose title is: To the end, for those who shall be changed, a song of the sons of Korah; moreover the sons of Korah are interpreted as the sons of Calvary, who are the sons of the Lord’s cross, saying: But far be it from me to glory except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ (Galatians VI). As for how they are changed, the following of the same psalm teaches, where the Beloved Himself, that is, the Church's Lord, says: Hear, O daughter, and see, and incline your ear, and forget your people and your father’s house (Psalm XLIV). For He desires her to be changed, whom, so that she may be called a daughter, He orders to forget the house of her prior father, that is, the ancient foe.
