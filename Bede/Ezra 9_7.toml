And on the first day, it says, of the fifth month he came to Jerusalem, according to the gracious hand of his God upon him, that is, confirmed by grace and divine protection, through which he would successfully complete the journey he had begun. Similarly, in the mystical sense, the mediator of God and men came into the Church according to the gracious hand of his God upon him, i.e. according to the disposition of the divine power that was in him. For God was reconciling the world to himself in Christ. This hand was on him in accordance with the fact that he became a man. This is why he says: The Father is greater than I. For greater than Christ's humanity is the divinity not only of the Father but of Christ himself and the Holy Spirit too, which is one. Having been exalted in suffering by this hand of divine power, he ascended to the walls of the heavenly city and revealed the pathway of ascent to his faithful ones who humbly follow him.
