And David restrained his men with his words, etc. And the Lord restrained the severity of his disciples, who wished the impious to perish, by saying: Do not judge, and you will not be judged (Matthew VII). Do not condemn, and you will not be condemned (Luke VI). And elsewhere: For God did not send his Son into the world to judge the world, but that the world might be saved through him (John III), and so on of this kind, and he did not permit them to take immediate vengeance on the wrongdoers, but rather to love the correction of those who amend their ways.

Moreover, Saul rising from the cave, etc. The keepers of the Lord's tomb, who, having fallen prostrate through fear of the approaching angel and had become like dead men, and fleeing from the tomb, nonetheless continued the evil schemes against the Lord, saying that his disciples had come at night and stolen him away while they were sleeping. Which can also be rightly understood of those who placed guards at the tomb (Matthew XXVIII); who, even though they withdrew from guarding the tomb of the Lord with groans and confusion, nonetheless did not turn away from their intent of persecuting his faith with raging steps. With these both having been driven away from the watch of the tomb, the Lord himself did not delay to gradually reveal the glory of his resurrection, which he had assumed secretly, to his followers. And with this truth confirmed and taught, soon through them thundered the proclamation of free preaching, calling back benignly to the remedy of repentance and his love those who had turned away from him, his persecutors. To those whom he reconciled to himself with the first words of humanity and piety, he diligently taught some of them to look back after him, that is, to repent of their crime against God.
