In the Greek, and in some Latin manuscripts, it is written thus: “Three days ago at this very hour I was fasting and worshiping from the sixth hour to the ninth, and behold, a man,” and so forth. And it was very fitting that his prayer was heard, since he persevered in the earnestness of his prayer for three hours, extending it from the sixth hour to the ninth—the time at which the Lord himself, whom he entreated, was praying, with his hands stretched out upon the cross, for the salvation of the whole world.
