And departing from there, they passed through Galilee, and he did not want anyone to know. But he was teaching his disciples, and saying to them, "The Son of Man will be delivered into the hands of men, and they will kill him. And after being killed, on the third day he will rise again." He always mixes sorrow with prosperity, so that when they suddenly come, they will not terrify the apostles, but their minds will endure them by premeditation. For if it grieves them that he is to be killed, it ought to gladden them that he will rise again on the third day.
