He will guard the salvation of the upright, etc. Virtues are related to each other, righteousness and simplicity, nor can they be separated from each other. Hence, wisdom does not seek one of them without the other; but in whomsoever both are found, these it guards and protects. Finally, of the blessed Job it is said that he was a simple and upright man (Job I): simple, namely, by the innocence of meekness; upright, by the caution of discretion. Simple, because he desired to harm no one, but indeed to benefit all; upright, because he permitted himself to be corrupted by no one.
