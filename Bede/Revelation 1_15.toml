feet: By the &quot;fiery feet&quot; he means the Church of the last time, which is to be searched and proved by severe afflictions. For orichalcum is brass, which by much fire and various ingredients, is brought to the colour of gold. Another translation, which renders it, &quot;like orichalcum of Lebanon,&quot; signifies that in Jud&aelig;a, of which Lebanon is a mountain, the Church will be persecuted, and especially at the last. The temple also frequently received the name of Lebanon, as there is said to it, &quot;Open, O Lebanon, thy gates, and let the fire devour thy cedars.&quot;

The phrase “feet refined by fire” refers to the church of the end time, which will be examined and tested by terrible afflictions. For indeed orichalcum is bronze, which is brought to a golden color by a very hot fire and added elements. Another translation, which renders with “like burnished bronze of Lebanon,” signifies that the church in Judea, in which Lebanon is a mountain, will be persecuted, especially at the end time. For even the temple is often referred to as “Lebanon,” for it is said to it, “Open, O Lebanon, your gates, and let fire consume your cedars.”
