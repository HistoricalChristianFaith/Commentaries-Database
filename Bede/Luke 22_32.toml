"And when you have turned back, strengthen your brothers." Just as I (he says) protected your faith by praying that it may not fail when Satan tempts, so you must remember to strengthen and comfort weaker brothers by the example of your repentance, lest they despair of forgiveness. This same exhortation he gives after the resurrection, when he commands three times to feed his sheep to the one who professes loving him three times (for it was fitting that the fear of a threefold denial should be washed away by a threefold confession of love).
