"Many daughters have gathered riches," etc. He calls many daughters the churches of heretics and crowds of the wicked; and the daughters of the Catholics or of Christ or the Church, for they too are reborn through the sacraments of the Lord, and received the adoption of children, which they did not preserve. Hence John says: "They went out from us, but they were not of us" (1 John 2). They have gathered riches, namely, the works of good deeds, fastings, alms, affliction and chastity of the flesh, restraint of the tongue, meditation on the Scriptures, and the like. These are true riches of the Spirit where they are conducted with the pure sincerity of mind; but where they are done without faith which works through love, they benefit nothing to those who do them. But even those daughters have vainly gathered riches; of whom the Lord says: "Many will say to me in that day: Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and done many mighty works in your name? And then I will declare to them, I never knew you" (Matt. 7). But the Catholic Church surpasses all such daughters, which follows the footsteps of its Redeemer with pure faith and perfect works.
