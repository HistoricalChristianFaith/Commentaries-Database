This baptism, he says, could not grant the remission of sins but only teach repentance. For just as the sign of circumcision among the patriarchs had been a mark of the faith that they lived by, so also repentant people received this washing as a singular mark of their devotion. Nevertheless, it also figuratively pointed to Christâ€™s baptism, by which remission of sins would be given.
