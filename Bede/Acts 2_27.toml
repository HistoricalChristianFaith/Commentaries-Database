Because you will not abandon my soul in hell, nor will you let your holy one see decay. It is certain that the soul of the Lord was not abandoned in hell, which, having taken away those for whom He descended there, soon returned to the heights above; it is certain that nor was His flesh corrupted, which was glorified by a swift resurrection. But it must be asked how He says in another psalm, reproaching the impenitent and the stubborn, the suffering of His passion: "What profit is there in my blood, while I go down into corruption?" (Psalm 29). This is solved because there He says He descends into corruption when His body is penetrated by the piercing of nails and the lance, for the transfixion of the solid body itself may not unreasonably be considered a kind of corruption spoken of. Here, however, He rightly denies that corruption, that is, putrefaction, not happening, which generally devastates human flesh, but it had no power to come upon His most sacred body.
