The Lord Christ is the head of all the saints, in himself always remaining equal and indivisible, to be sure, but distributing the grace of his Spirit to each one of those who are elect, according to their capacity for receiving. For this reason, not only to the whole church in general but also to each of its members in particular is it permissible to proclaim with confidence that prophetic [word]: “And now he has lifted up my head above my enemies.”
