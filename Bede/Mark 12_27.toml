And fitly do they frame such a fable in order to prove the madness of those who assert the resurrection of the body. Such a thing however might really have happened at some time or other among them.
We must here consider that the Latin custom does not answer to the Greek idiom. For properly different words areused for the marriage of men, and that of women; but here we may simply understand that, “marry,” is meant of men, and “given in marriage” of women.
Or else; because after proving that the soul remained after death, (for God could not be God of those who did not exist at all,) the resurrection of the body also might be inferred as aconsequence, since it had done good and evil with the soul.
