And there appeared to them divided tongues as of fire. For the Holy Spirit appeared in fire and tongues, because all whom He fills He makes both burning and speaking. Burning indeed from themselves, and speaking about themselves. At the same time, indicating that the holy Church, extended to the ends of the world, was to speak with the voice of all nations.

And it sat upon each of them. What is said to have sat is an indication of royal power. Or certainly because His rest is indicated in the saints.

And there appeared to them divided tongues as of fire, and one sat upon each of them, etc. This fire, not this fire. For in Greek it is πυρὸς, not πῦρ. This distinction would be easier to see if, adding a word, it were said: Divided tongues appeared as if of burning fire, or as if of shining fire, so that it may be understood that the tongues were divided in the appearance of fire.
