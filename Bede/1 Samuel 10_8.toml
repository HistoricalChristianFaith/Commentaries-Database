And descending before me in Gilgal, etc. The Lord descended before John in Gilgal, that is, the place of rolling, namely those about which he speaks to the Father in the Psalm: Save me, O God, for the waters have come up to my soul. I sink in deep mire, where there is no foothold (Psalm 68). Not because the Lord had undergone death's destruction before John, but because before they killed John, the Jews were persecuting Jesus and seeking to kill Him; because He not only broke the Sabbath but also called God His Father, making Himself equal to God (John 5). And John descended to Him, because he accepted the mud of prison and death as an example of His humility and patience. The Lord offered Himself as a sacrifice to the Father and made peace through His blood, both on earth and in heaven. But He awaited the time of His forerunnerâ€™s example. The completeness of this, according to the custom of the Scriptures, is signified by the number of seven days, until, namely, the same John, having undergone death by the wicked, showed what the Lord Himself would suffer.
