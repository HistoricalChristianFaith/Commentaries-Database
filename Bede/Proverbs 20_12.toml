He speaks of the hearing ear as the obedient listener of the word: the seeing eye as the learned teacher. Let no one who sees himself as trained in the knowledge of Scriptures and deemed fit to speak the word of God despise the simplicity of a brother who, though less learned in preaching, is no less eager to learn or to fulfill the good things he has learned. Let him recall that the One who gave him a greater grace of knowledge also bestowed the spiritual gifts upon the brother. And He grants the gifts, not solely on his account, but also for the benefit of the brother, giving each grace according to the measure of His donation.
