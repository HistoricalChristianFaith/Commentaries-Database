The Broad Wall in Jerusalem is the strength and protection of perfect love in the hearts of the elect at which its architects arrive through the process of building when, by advancing in works of charity, they can say to their Creator and Helper: We ran the way of your commands, for you were broadening our heart - that broadening, doubtless, of a mind that has been illuminated, which can love both a friend in God and an enemy for the sake of God.
