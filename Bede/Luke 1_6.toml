They were both righteous before God, walking blamelessly in all the commandments and statutes of the Lord. Truly righteous before God: for not everyone who is righteous before men is righteous before God. Men see differently, God sees differently. Men see the face, God sees the heart. And therefore, it can happen that someone appears just to me with an affected popular goodness, but before God, he is not just if justice is not formed from the simplicity of the mind, but is simulated with flattery. But blessed is he who is righteous in the sight of God. Blessed is he of whom the Lord deigns to say: Behold, truly an Israelite in whom there is no deceit. For a true Israelite who sees God, and knows himself to be seen by the Lord, reveals to Him the secrets of the heart.

Walking (he says) in all the commandments and statutes of the Lord. First is the commandment, second is the statute. For when we obey the heavenly commandments, we walk in the commandments of the Lord. When we judge, and judge rightly, we seem to hold the statutes of the Lord. Therefore, it is a full commendation that encompasses lineage, morals, office, deed, and judgment. Lineage in the ancestors, morals in fairness, office in the priesthood, deed in the commandment, in the statute judgment. And what he added: Without blame, this is what the Apostle says: Providing good things, not only in the sight of God but also in the sight of men (Rom. XII). And Ecclesiastes: Be not overly just (Eccl. VII). Because often a harsher justice provokes the complaint of men. But one which is tempered, by the grace of its own sweetness, avoids the resentment of envy.
