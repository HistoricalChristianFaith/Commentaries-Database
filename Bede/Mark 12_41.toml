And Jesus sat down opposite the treasury and watched how the crowd put money into the treasury. Because in Greek speech φυλάττειν is said to mean "to guard," and "gaza" in the Persian language means "riches," the treasury is customarily called a place where riches are kept. By this name both the chest in which the people's donations were collected for the temple's necessities and the porticoes where they were kept were called. You have an example of the porticoes in the Gospel. Jesus, He said, spoke these words in the treasury, teaching in the temple (John 8). You have about the chest in the book of Kings: And Jehoiada the priest took a chest, and bored a hole in the lid of it, and set it beside the altar, on the right side as one comes into the house of the Lord. And the priests that kept the door put all the money that was brought into the house of the Lord into it. And when they saw that there was much money in the chest, the king's scribe and the high priest came up and tied up and counted the money that was found in the house of the Lord (2 Kings 12). Therefore, the Lord, who warned that seekers of preeminence and vain glory should be avoided, who predicted with prolonged simulated prayers that judgment would be rendered, also judges those bringing gifts to the house of the Lord with a certain scrutiny, so that He may reward each according to their heart and deeds, because in the same manner the same internal judge always acts in the Church unceasingly.

And many rich people put in large amounts. But when a poor widow came, she put in two small coins, which is a quadrans. Mathematicians call a quadrans the fourth part of anything, namely of a place, of time, or of money. Thus, perhaps in this passage, it signifies a fourth part of a shekel, that is, five obols.
