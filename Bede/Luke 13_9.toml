And if it indeed produces fruit. But if not, in the future you will cut it down. When He said, "And if it indeed produces fruit," He did not add anything, but suspended the judgment. However, when He added, "But if not," He immediately attached the judgment of future condemnation, saying, "In the future you will cut it down," because evidently He saw the synagogue much more inclined to deny than to confess God. Hence, elsewhere, applying the same figure in facts as He does here in words, He condemned the unfruitful fig tree with the curse of eternal barrenness, showing that even if the apostles correct by digging and rebuke by heaping manure, it would never yield the fruit of repentance but must be cut down by the severity of the strict axe.
