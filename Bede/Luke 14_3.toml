And Jesus answering, spoke to the lawyers and Pharisees, saying: Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath day? But they remained silent. What is said of Jesus answering refers to what has been mentioned earlier: And they watched him closely. For the Lord knows the thoughts of men. But they rightly remain silent when questioned, seeing that whatever they say is said against them. For if it is lawful to heal on the Sabbath, why do they watch the Savior to see if he heals? If it is not lawful, why do they themselves provide care for animals on the Sabbath?
