These are those who are beside the way where the word is sown. And when they hear, Satan immediately comes and takes away the word that was sown in their hearts, etc. In this explanation of the Lord, the entire distance of those who could hear the word of salvation but cannot reach salvation is comprehended. For there are those who do not deign to grasp the word they hear with any faith, understanding, or even any opportunity for trying usefulness. In whose undisciplined and hard hearts the sown word is immediately snatched away by unclean spirits, like birds seizing the seed from the trampled path of life. There are those who both recognize the usefulness of the heard word and taste the desire, but they are hindered from reaching what they approve by others who terrifyingly oppose the way, while others by flattering prosperity delay. The Lord compares the former to rocky ground and the latter to thorny ground. Clearly, the Gentiles are excluded, who do not even deserve to hear the words of life. And it should not seem strange why the Lord compared riches to thorns, since thorns fight and riches delight. They are rightly called thorns, because they tear the mind with the pricks of their thoughts. And when they lead to sin, they wound it like an inflicted wound causing it to bleed. But even apart from the stings of vices, the desire for riches devastates the mind greatly and does not allow it to be secure. For when someone vigilantly and anxiously watches by what order or art to acquire what they do not yet have, or by what foresight to preserve what they have already acquired, or finally by what glory and dignity to enjoy the abundance of acquired things, how necessary is it that the miserable mind is ulcerated by the stings of cares every hour? Hence, the Lord aptly, intending to call riches thorns in the exposition, preceded with miseries, saying: "Others are sown among thorns, these are those who hear the word: and the cares of the world, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the desires for other things entering in choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful." "The cares," he says, "of the world and the deceitfulness of riches." For whoever is deceived by the vain desire for riches, it is necessary that the accompanying or even preceding continuous misery of cares afflict him. For what is more miserable than those who, the more they have, the more they need, and the less they seem to have of themselves? According to what a certain poet mocking the lovers of money said: "Love of money grows as much as money itself grows." (Juvenal) And how much happier are those not only in the desire for true riches but also in the very contempt of false ones, who truly confess themselves to be as having nothing and yet possessing all things? Well did he say: "And the cares of the world and the deceitfulness of riches," and added: "And the desires for other things." For the Scripture commands: "Desiring wisdom, keep the commandments, and God will provide it for you." And again it says: "Blessed is the man who fears the Lord, he greatly delights in his commandments." (Psalm 112) On the other hand, whoever, neglecting wisdom and despising the commandments of the Lord, wanders by desiring other things, can neither receive the fruit of wisdom nor attain the joy of true blessedness. For such desires choke the word because with their importunate thoughts they strangle the throat of the mind. And while they do not allow good desire to enter the heart, they kill as it were the passage of vital breath. Whence by just judgment it happens that as much as they desire other things, so much they are far from that poverty of spirit and desire by which they long to be dissolved and to be with Christ (Philippians 1). But rather, the wretched one fears that it will truly happen to him, to be dissolved from this life and to be with the devil.
