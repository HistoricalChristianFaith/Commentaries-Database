To be sure, from eternity you have reigned, although the wicked are in rebellion, but now their anger is suppressed and ceases to exist. For “the Lord reigns, let the people be angry.” “And the time for the dead to be judged and for the rewarding of your servants,” et cetera. This corresponds to the order we have in the Gospel narrative. First, all the nations are to be gathered before the judge; then those on the right will be placed in many mansions in the kingdom of the Father, while those on the left will be tossed outside the limits of the kingdom and cast into the flames of their condemnation.
