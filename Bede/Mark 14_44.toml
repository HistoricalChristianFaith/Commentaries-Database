Now the betrayer had given them a sign, saying: Whomsoever I shall kiss, etc. Indeed, an impudent and wicked confidence, to call Him Master and to give a kiss to Him whom he was betraying. However, he still had something of the disciple's shame, since he did not openly hand Him over to the persecutors, but by the sign of a kiss. The Lord received the kiss of the betrayer, not to teach us to deceive, but so that He would not appear to evade the traitor, and also fulfilling that which was written in David: I was peaceful with those who hate peace (Psalm 119).
