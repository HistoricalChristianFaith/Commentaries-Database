And Joiada son of Paseah and Meshullam son of Besodeiah built the Old Gate. They roofed it, and so on. The Old Gate is the one which John mentions when he says: Dearest friends, I am not writing a new command to you but an old one, which you have had since the beginning. This old command is the word that you have heard? The Old Gate, therefore, is built in Jerusalem when the word of faith and love, which has been passed on from the beginning of the Holy Church, has begun either to be restored in those who have gone astray or established in those who have recently come to believe.
