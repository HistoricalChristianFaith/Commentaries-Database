Rightly are seventy-two sent, for to so many nations of the world was the Gospel to be preached, that as at first twelve were appointed because of the twelve tribes of Israel, so, these also were ordained as teachers for the instruction of the foreign nations.

Now as the great harvest is this whole multitude of believers, so the few labourers are the Apostles, and their followers who are sent to this harvest.

The number of the twelve apostles marked the beginning of the episcopal rank. It is also apparent that the seventy-two disciples, who were also sent out by the Lord to preach the word, signify in their selection the lesser rank of the priesthood that is now called the presbyterate. For the same reason, it is appropriate that these seventy-two figured in the last part of the priestly clothing, as those twelve had been in the first. It was fitting that the type of those who would occupy a higher rank in the body of the High Priest (that is, in the church of Christ) should have a higher place in the typical clothing of the Old Testament high priest.
