Now the number of days that David lived in the land of the Philistines, etc. There was, is, and will be a time of Christ's dwelling in the Church of the Gentiles, until he fills the four corners of the world with the complete light of his heavenly grace, until he pours the light of the Gospel, which is contained in the unanimous variety of the four books, into the believing hearts of the Gentiles. And note that David, coming to the Philistines, begins to dwell in Geth; but soon, with Achis' permission, he turns to Siceleg: because, coming to the Gentiles in the disciples, Christ, first pressed by the winepress of pressures by the unbelievers, finally after many grapes of the martyrs pressed, he approached to instruct those who among the dregs and wine of intellectual innkeepers, that is, those teaching various senses, knew how to judge.
