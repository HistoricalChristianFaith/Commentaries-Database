“And Ezra said, ‘You yourself, O Lord, you alone made the heaven, the heaven of heavens, and all their host, the earth and all that is on it,’ ” and so on up until the end of his prayer or confession. It was said above that they were confessing their sins and the sins of their ancestors; here, when Ezra prays, it is shown more fully how this was done. But where he says at the end, “Because of all this, therefore, we ourselves are making a covenant and writing it down, and our leaders, our Levites and our priests are signing it,” and so on, it is shown more clearly with what gracious devotion all the various persons made a new assembly after the Feast of the Tabernacles, namely, so that after purging themselves with resolved purpose from the contagions of their wrongdoings, they might unite themselves to the divine covenant and confirm its terms by word and in writing. Thus separated from association with the ungodly, they would more confidently complete the work they began long ago, that is, to choose citizens from among the devout who were suitable to rebuild the city.
