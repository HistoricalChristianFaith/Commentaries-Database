The Chief Priests though they sought to take Him, feared the multitude, and therefore they endeavored to effect what they could not do of themselves, by means of earthly powers, that they might themselves appear to be guiltless of His death. And therefore it is said, “And they send unto Him certain of the Pharisees and of the Herodians, to catch Him in His words.”.
But this bland and crafty question was intended to induce Him in His answer rather to fear God than Caesar, and tosay that tribute should not be paid, so that the Herodians immediately on hearing it might hold Him to be an author of sedition against the Romans. And therefore they add, “And carest for no man: for thou regardest not the person of any.”.
A denarius was a piece of money, accounted equal to ten smaller coins, and bearing the image of Caesar; wherefore there follows: “And He saith unto them, Whose is this image and superscription? And they said unto Him, Caesar's. Let those who think that our Saviour asked the question through ignorance and not by an economy, learn from this that Hemight have known whose image it was; but He puts the question, in order to return them a fitting answer. Wherefore there follows: “And Jesus answering said unto them, Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and unto God the things that are God’s.”.
That is, tithes, first-fruits, oblations, and victims. In the same way as He gave tribute both for Himself and Peter, He also gave to God the things that are God’s, doing the will of his Father.
