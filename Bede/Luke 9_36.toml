And while the voice was being spoken, Jesus was found alone. When the Son began to be designated, the servants immediately departed, lest the paternal voice be thought to be addressed to them. Alternatively: as the voice was made over the Son, He was found alone, because when He reveals Himself to the chosen, God will be all in all (1 Cor. 15), indeed He with His own, Christ through all will be one, that is, the head will shine with the body. For which unity He said elsewhere: And no one has ascended into heaven, except He who descended from heaven, the Son of Man, who is in heaven (John 3).

And they were silent, and in those days told no one any of the things they had seen. The premeditation of the future kingdom and the glory of the conqueror had been shown on the mountain. Therefore the disciples are silent, and, at the Lord's command, tell no one of the vision until the Son of Man is risen from the dead, lest the magnitude of the matter be incredible, and after such glory, the subsequent cross creates scandal among unrefined minds.
