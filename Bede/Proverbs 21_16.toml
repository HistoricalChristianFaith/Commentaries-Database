The man who strays from the way of doctrine, etc. He says that the giants are unclean spirits, about which the blessed Job says, "Behold, the giants groan beneath the waters, and those who dwell with them" (Job 26:5), that is, proud and malevolent strong spirits of demons, together with the men whom they have deceived, tormented by inflicted punishments. For to this company will be joined those who have strayed from the way of truth, with the judge himself attesting, who predicted that he would say to them: "Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels" (Matthew 25:41).
