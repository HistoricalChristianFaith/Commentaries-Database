And he began to speak to them in parables: A man planted a vineyard, and set a hedge around it, and dug a pit, and built a tower. This man who planted the vineyard is the same who in another parable hired laborers into his vineyard. He planted the vineyard about which Isaiah speaks most fully in a song, ultimately saying: The vineyard of the Lord of hosts is the house of Israel. And in the psalm, it is said: You have transplanted a vineyard from Egypt; you expelled the nations and planted it. And he set a hedge around it, whether a city wall or the assistance of angels. And he dug a pit in it, whether a winepress, or an altar, or those winepresses whose titles are marked by three psalms, the eighth, the eightieth, and the eighty-third. And he built a tower, undoubtedly the temple about which it is said through Micah: And you, O tower of the flock, daughter of Zion.

And he leased it to husbandmen. Elsewhere, he called these workers of the vineyard, who had been hired at the first, third, sixth and ninth hours. And he went away on a journey, not by changing location. For where can God be absent from, since all things are filled by him? And he who says through Jeremiah: I am a God at hand, and not a God afar off, says the Lord? But he seems to go away from the vineyard to leave the vine-dressers free will in working.
