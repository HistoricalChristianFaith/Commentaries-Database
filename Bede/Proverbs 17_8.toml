A highly desirable gem is the expectation of one waiting, etc. Whoever faithfully awaits future rewards rejoices as if in the possession of a most splendid gem. For in the Gospel, the wise merchant sold all that he had for the acquisition of the precious pearl, that is, heavenly desire. Such a merchant, whether faced with adversity or prosperity, does not deviate from his intention; prudently understanding that all things work together for the good of those who love God (Rom. VIII, 28).
