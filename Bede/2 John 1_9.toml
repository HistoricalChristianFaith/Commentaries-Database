Note how carefully John phrases this. He says that those who do not abide in Christâ€™s teaching do not have God, whereas those who do have both the Father and the Son. By this he demonstrates that the Father and the Son are One and refutes the lie of those who assert either that the Son is not God or that he is inferior to the Father.
