They wished not for truth, but were contriving calumny. Because they expected that Christ would come only as man, of the root of David, they sought this of Him, that if He should say, &#8220;I am the Christ,&#8221; they might falsely accuse Him of claiming to Himself the kingly power.
For He had often , declared Himself to be the Christ; as when he said, I and my Father are one, and other such like things. And if I also ask you, you will not answer me. For He had asked them how they said Christ was the Son of David, whereas David in the Spirit called Him his Lord. But they wished neither to believe His words nor to answer His questions. However, because they sought to accuse falsely the seed of David, they hear something still farther; as it follows, Hereafter shall the Son of man sit on the right handof the power of God.
They understood that He called Himself the Son of God in these words, The Son of man shall sit on the right hand of the power of God.
