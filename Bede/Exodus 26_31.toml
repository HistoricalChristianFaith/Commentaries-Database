[[commentary]]
quote='''
The temple was divided by a veil [hung across] the wall in the center [of the building], and the outer [section of this part of the] building was called the sanctuary; the inner [section], where the ark of the covenant was placed, was called the Holy of Holies. The church is in part on pilgrimage on earth, [away from] the Lord, and in part it reigns with the Lord in heaven. The wall [across the] center is understood [as indicating] heaven, and the ark of the covenant [as indicating] the Lord, who alone is conscious of the Fatherâ€™s hidden mysteries and has passed into the inner reaches of heaven.
