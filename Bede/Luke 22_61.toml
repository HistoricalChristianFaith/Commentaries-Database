And the Lord turned and looked at Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how He had said: "Before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times." And Peter went out and wept bitterly. With the Lord looking upon him, Peter's heart was pricked, and he wiped away the stain of denial with the tears of repentance, as it is not only while repentance is performed but also for it to be performed, that the mercy of God is necessary. For His looking is to show mercy. Hence the Psalmist says: "How long shall my enemy be exalted over me? Look upon me and answer me, O Lord my God" (Psalm 12), that is, have mercy and help me. How harmful indeed are the sayings of the treacherous! Peter, among the Jews, denied knowing the man he had confessed as the Son of God among his fellow disciples. But could he do penance while detained in Caiaphas' courtyard? He went out, so that, separated from the council of the impious, he might wash away the stains of fearful denial with unrestrained weeping.
