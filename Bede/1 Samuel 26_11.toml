Now therefore take the spear that is at his head, etc. The spear either insinuates the power of the kingdom itself or the arms of spiritual virtues, by which the kingdom could be helped. However, it can be taken regarding the earthly kingdom they had and the heavenly kingdom they hoped for, which anyone among them knew to hope for. It is indeed established that both were rightfully taken away from the faithless. Moreover, the cup of water is the observance of carnal types; which, compared to evangelical perfection, is as a cup of water to a cup of wine, not inappropriately taken; whence also above Nabal, despising David who asked for water, did not give it. Abigail also gave wine because the people of the faithless, whether of the law or of the letter, refused to ascribe it to Christ; but everyone faithful knows and recognizes that all things are to be referred to Him, and these things filled with a spiritual flavor to be fervent. Therefore, the spear and the cup of water are taken away from Saul, when because of the crime of perfidy, the entire kingdom and the literal custody of the law are taken away from the Jews. This indeed is done by Abishai at the command of David; when at the command of the Lord, each of the apostles preaching the rights of the Gospel teaches that all old things are to pass away. However, when the spear and the cup were taken away, David added, saying, And let us go; it signifies that Christ was about to depart from the Jews and pass over to the Gentiles to be saved with His preachers. And He Himself, coming to the Passion, announcing it almost with the same word said: Rise, let us go hence.
