And when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was taken up. Mark, indeed, recounting another discourse of the Lord, says: And the Lord Jesus, after he had spoken to them, was taken up into heaven (Mark 16). But since Luke added more significantly, When he had said these things, he was taken up, indeed showing that when the words he had mentioned were fulfilled, the Lord ascended to heaven.

And a cloud received him out of their sight. Everywhere the creation obeys its Creator. The stars point out his birth, they cover him when suffering, the clouds receive him as he ascends, and they will accompany him when he returns for judgment.
