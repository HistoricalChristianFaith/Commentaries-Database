And I am no longer worthy to be called your son. Treat me as one of your hired servants. Indeed, he does not dare to aspire to the affection of a son, who does not doubt that all things which are of the father are his own, but he desires the status of a hired servant, now willing to serve for a wage. Yet he testifies that he can merit even this only by paternal grace. Where then are the Pelagians, who trust that they can be saved by their own virtue, against the very clear sentence of truth which says: Without me, you can do nothing?
