The grace of our Lord has softened the hard edges of the law, which prescribed such things as stoning and burning for various infractions. Our Lord, however, relaxed these rules and made it possible to purge sins by making reparations and by giving alms. But now, says Jude, these men have taken this relaxation to the point of license and sin all the more boldly when they think that they are not going to be punished for doing so.
