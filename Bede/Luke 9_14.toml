But there were about five thousand men. Because there are five senses of the outer man, the five thousand men who followed the Lord signify those who, still set in the secular state, have learned to use well the external things they possess. They are rightly nourished by five loaves, because such need still to be instructed by legal precepts. For those who renounce the world entirely are four thousand, and being nourished by seven loaves, that is, both elevated by the evangelical nourishment and taught by spiritual grace. For the sake of signifying this mystical distinction, I believe it was ordered to make five gilded columns at the entrance of the tabernacle, and four before the oracle, that is, the Holy of Holies. Because evidently beginners are chastised by the law so that they do not sin, but the perfected are admonished by grace to live more devoutly to God.

He said to his disciples, "Make them recline in groups of fifty," and they did so. The various groups of diners represent the various congregations of the Churches around the world, which compose the one catholic Church. They reclined not only in groups of fifty, but, as Mark attests, in groups of a hundred as well. Since the fiftieth psalm is one of repentance, and the number one hundred passes from the left to the right, those who recline at the Lord's banquet in groups of fifty are positioned in repentance and hearing the word. Those who recline in groups of a hundred, having already presumed upon the hope of forgiveness, yearn solely for eternal life.
