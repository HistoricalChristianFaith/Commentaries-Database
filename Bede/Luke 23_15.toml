But neither did Herod. For I referred you to him, and look, nothing deserving death has been done by him. Listen, blind Jew, listen, cruel pagan. Pilate himself confesses that neither he nor Herod found anything deserving death in Christ, but in putting him to death or mocking the innocent, they only obeyed the cries of others' cruelty. Therefore, let the writings perish that, composed so long after against Christ, do not show him accused of magical arts before Pilate, but demonstrate you are to be accused before the Lord of treachery and falsehood.
