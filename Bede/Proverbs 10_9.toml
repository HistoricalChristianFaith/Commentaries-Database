Whoever walks uprightly, walks securely, etc. He who knows he lives uprightly, easily disregards all adverse things, because he trusts he will come to joy through them, saying with the prophet: The Lord is the protector of my life; whom shall I fear? and the rest (Psalm 26). But he who walks in crooked paths, though unwilling, becomes exposed and receives due recompense. For there is nothing hidden that will not be revealed (Luke 12).
