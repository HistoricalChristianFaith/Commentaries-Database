He also went to Ramatha, etc. After Jewish doctrine did not prevail against Christ, both words and weapons were added to persecute the Son of Man who sits at the right hand of God the Father on earth. But even their earthly principality, when searching for the hidden things of the Scriptures concerning Jesus and His disciples, found nothing else in them as a response except that He, along with His own, dwells in Naioth in Ramah, that is, in the beauty of the paternal kingdom, in the heights of the heavens. And therefore, it must be certainly known to all the house of Israel that God has made Him both Lord and Christ. And it is fitting that the cistern, which by the depth and breadth of the waters of the Scriptures corresponds to the abyss, is remembered in Socho, that is, situated in humility; because holy Scripture, being contrary to the custom of secular doctrines, existing as the teacher of humility, produced by humble authors, is open only to humble listeners or readers. But the proud, having heard through these the heavenly glory of Christ, whom they could not follow with the step of the body, nor wished to attain with the step of love, began to pursue Him with the step of nefarious action, so that He Himself, saving a certain person from such and restraining their perfidy, might protest and say from Naioth, which is in Ramah, that is, from the height of the most beautiful seat above: "Saul, Saul, why do you persecute Me" (Acts IX)?
