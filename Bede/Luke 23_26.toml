And as they led him away, they seized a certain Simon, a Cyrenian, coming from the countryside, and they laid on him the cross to carry it behind Jesus. The evangelist John narrates that the Lord himself carried his own cross. From this it is understood that the cross was first carried by the Lord, and then laid upon Simon whom they perhaps met coming out, in a fitting order of the mystery. Because he suffered for us, leaving us an example so that we may follow his footsteps (I Peter II). He is well described as carrying the cross behind Jesus, according to what he himself commands: And take up his cross, and follow me (Matthew XVI). And because this Simon is said to be not from Jerusalem, but a Cyrenian, for Cyrene is a city of Libya, as we read in the Acts of the Apostles, it is rightly through him that the peoples of the nations are designated. Those who were once strangers and foreigners to the covenants, now, by obeying faith, are citizens and members of God's household. And, as it is said elsewhere: Heirs indeed of God, but co-heirs of Christ (Romans VIII). From which it is beautifully interpreted that Simon obediently translates Cyrene as heir. Nor should it be passed over that Simon is said to have come from the countryside. For the countryside is called πάγος in Greek, from which the term pagans is derived, because they are foreign to the city of God and almost ignorant of urban conversation. But Simon, coming out from the countryside, carries the cross behind Jesus, when the people of the nations, having abandoned pagan rites, obediently embrace the footsteps of the Lord's passion.
