The pagans despise the life, fellowship and teaching of those who believe in Christ, who are rightly called Hebrews, that is, “pilgrims.” For they know to pass over at the present time from vices to virtues, and in the future they hope to pass over from death to life. Looking from the summit of their heavenward mind, they know how to transcend the base desires of fleshly things and all the hostilities of the world. - "Four Books on 1 Samuel 4.29"
