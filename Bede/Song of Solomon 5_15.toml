His legs are marble columns, etc. By the term "legs of the Lord" are indicated the paths of His incarnation, by which He deigned to come to our salvation. These are well compared to marble columns, because they are both strong and straight. For what is stronger than marble? What is straighter than a column? Did the Psalmist not behold the strength of marble in His legs when he said: "And He, as a bridegroom coming out of His chamber; rejoiced as a strong man to run a race" (Ps. 89)? Did he not also see the straightness of the columns when he again said: "The Lord is righteous in all His ways" (Ps. 145:17)? Hence it is that when He was placed on the cross, His legs were not broken, although permitted by the governor, just as His garments could not be torn. For the seamless tunic remained intact, signifying the Church, which is His chosen garment, without spot or wrinkle, forever maintaining its unity. His legs remained unbroken, so that the mystery of His advent in the flesh, sacred and inviolable, might endure against every hammer of false doctrine. For Pilate, the judge, symbolizes the mallet. Yet the columns of marble stand firm and repel the blow, even if the impious mallet of heretical speech attempts to strike. Insane doctrine may say insane things about the Lord, but the truth of the gospel stands and prevails. Regarding these columns, it is aptly added, "which are founded on golden bases." For the golden bases are the counsels of divine providence, in which it was eternally decreed before the ages, that everything to be created temporally in the world would be; including the very incarnation of our Savior and our salvation in Him, as testified by the Apostle who says: "He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and blameless before Him in love" (Eph. 1:4), and Apostle Peter says that we were redeemed by the precious blood of Christ, as a lamb without blemish and without spot; and foreknown indeed before the foundation of the world, but made manifest in these last times (1 Pet. 1:19-20). Thus, the marble columns, to which the Lordâ€™s legs are compared, are founded upon His golden bases, since all the steps of our Savior, by which He willed to come from heaven to earth, to move upon the earth, to descend to the underworld, to rise from the tomb, and to return to heaven, are firm like marble, straight like the heavens, ordered to the rule of divine precept, as if founded upon golden bases. Concerning these bases, He Himself says: "For I have not spoken on My own authority; but the Father who sent Me gave Me a command, what I should say and what I should speak" (John 12:49); and if you wish to know why the bases are golden, listen to what follows: "And I know that His command is eternal life" (John 12:50).

His appearance is like Lebanon, etc. Why, he says, should I labor to describe each of his members individually? I will summarize it briefly. Just as Mount Lebanon, famous in Phoenicia, is notable for its height and grandeur, so our Lord rightfully surpasses all those born of the earth in a superior grace. As the same mountain is fertile with noble trees, thus he uplifts all the saints with his protection, lest they descend to the depths; and having them rooted in himself, he preserves them from being shaken by the winds of temptations. As the beauty, strength, height, and fragrance of cedars surpass all the splendor of forests, so my beloved is beautiful beyond the sons of men; grace is diffused on his lips, therefore God has blessed him forever (Psalm 44:3), and other such things as the following psalm, greatly transcending measure and companionship, describes about him. And it is to be noted that the same beloved is compared both to Lebanon, which produces notable trees, and to the cedar, which Lebanon itself produces among other trees, as if one and the same person both generates and carries trees, and is generated among trees and carried by himself. For our Lord Jesus Christ, who with the grace of his divinity generates, nurtures, and carries all the elect from the beginning of the world to its end to life, also made himself a man among men when he wanted, and filled that man with the grace of his Spirit, albeit far superior to others; indeed it is said of them: To each one of us grace was given according to the measure of Christ's gift (Eph. 4); but of him: For God does not give the Spirit by measure. For the Father loves the Son and has given all things into his hand (John 3). Therefore, the Lord was chosen like the appearance of the cedar, because the entire forest of the holy Church, in which he was born, surpassed in unique and singular dignity. His appearance is like Lebanon, which among remarkable trees also brings forth the cedar, because among his elect he created even himself, the kind of man he wished, as if a tree of life in the midst of paradise, like if a painter also depicts himself among others in his order with suitable colors, or any historian recounts many things of many people: for example, lawgiver Moses or evangelist John describing things worthy of memory about themselves as well. Thus indeed the mountain of whiteness (which the name Lebanon means), that is, our Redeemer among innumerable fruitful trees, which would praise the name of the Lord, also brought forth the cedar, a wood evidently more excellent than others, that is, himself, who not only would praise the name of the Lord, but also would come blessed in the name of the Lord.
