Now these are the children of the province, who went up from the captivity, etc. He calls them the children of the province of Judea, not of Babylon. For to this belonged not only those who were transferred from it to Babylon, but also those who were born in Babylon from their stock. Even though they were born physically in Babylon, they longed with their whole mind for Judea and Jerusalem. Their notable leader Zerubbabel bore their figure, who by name indeed indicates that he was born in Babylon; but by intention and actions shows that he is a citizen of Jerusalem. In another sense, they are children of the Church, children of the heavenly fatherland, not only those who are already imbued with the sacraments of the Church, but also those who, although wandering outside, that is among the impious for some time, are yet by divine election preordained to life before the ages, to be consecrated in their time by the mysteries of divine grace. About whom it is aptly added:

And they returned to Jerusalem and Judah, etc. For when those who have strayed from the faith are freed from the power of Satan, along with those who have recently learned the faith, they return to Jerusalem of desired peace and to Judah of devoted confession or praise. Soon each one enters and returns to his own city, that is, he devoutly performs the keeping and practice of virtues, which divine largess has bestowed upon him according to the measure of faith. And it is well said, with general reference, that they have returned to Jerusalem and Judah, he immediately added: Each to his own city, because indeed each individual dwelt in their own cities, yet all generally pertained to Jerusalem and Judah. Therefore, Jerusalem signifies the universal state of the holy Church, which is throughout the world. The cities pertaining to it designate each of the virtues of the faithful, in which, as if by the protection of cities, they are fortified against the temptations and incursions of evil spirits. The cities in which those who came from captivity to Jerusalem and Judah dwelt can also be understood as the various Churches of Christ throughout the world, from all of which one Catholic Church is completed. In these Churches, whoever resides, each one professes himself as a child of the Catholic Church, as a citizen of Jerusalem. Moreover, they were led before others by Zerubbabel and Jesus, one from royal lineage, the other from priestly lineage, as is shown in many places of sacred history; both of them represented one and the same person of our Redeemer, namely the true King and High Priest. For He alone is the one through whom we ought to come to salvation. Hence He says: No one comes to the Father except through me (John 14). He gathers each of the elect, either through His own hidden inspiration or through the manifest teaching by holy preachers, from the confusion of present life to the vision of eternal peace and the confession of divine praise, as if from Babylon to Jerusalem and Judah. This vision of peace and this confession of thanksgiving, given by Him, begin indeed in the present but are perfected in the future.
