And it happened on the second-first Sabbath, as he was passing through the cornfields, his disciples began to pluck the ears of corn, and rubbed them in their hands, and did eat. This is what Mark says, that because of the great number of those who came to be healed, the disciples did not even have time to eat, and thus were as hungry men. But that they plucked the ears of the crops with their hands, and comforted their hunger, is an indication of a more austere life, not seeking prepared feasts, but simple food. And note that the first apostles of the Savior break the letter of the Sabbath, against the Ebionites, who, while accepting the other apostles, reject Paul as a transgressor of the law. Wherefore Luke properly calls this day, when the letter of the Sabbath began to be dissolved, a second-first Sabbath, wishing to intimate that the observance of the legal Sabbath ought henceforth to cease, and the freedom of the natural Sabbath, which was similar to the other days up to the times of Moses, ought to be restored. So that just as the Church is saved not by circumcision or the ceremonies of the law, but by the faith of Abraham, who was justified while uncircumcised through love working, so also this ought to be commended as nothing other than a spiritual Sabbath, in which even Abraham always rested from servile, that is, sinful action, through the sevenfold grace of the Holy Spirit to God. Therefore, the Sabbath of this time, in which it is lawful to do useful things as on the other days, to distinguish it from the Jewish Sabbath, on which it was not allowed to travel, to gather wood, or to do other necessary things, is called second-first. Namely, this is preferred to the first in the order of time, because it was observed by the fathers in countless ages before the law, as it is now. Or certainly it signifies by the grace of the gift that nothing else is meant by second-first than that the superior Sabbath is understood to be above the inferior. For the first man is of the earth, earthy; the second man is the Lord from heaven, heavenly. Nor is it wrong to call the Lord Jesus Christ the second-first Adam, who by merit and grace certainly preceded the first Adam by no human birth order, according to what his precursor said of him: "He who comes after me is preferred before me, for he was before me" (John 1). It can also be understood that the second-first Sabbath, the same Sabbath of the New Testament, is both the second and the first. Second, because it is observed by us after the legal Sabbath. First, because it was observed by the ancient just ones before the decrees of the law. Mystically, the disciples pass through the cornfields, those of which the Lord said, "Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white already to harvest, and he that reapeth receiveth wages" (John 4). And it is better to hunger for this than to understand it as the salvation of men, for whom the foremost of the reapers, once hungering in prayers, shortly heard, upon the dishes being shown which he desired, "Arise, Peter, kill and eat" (Acts 10). And the wonderful concord of the sacrament is that there, beasts are ordered to be killed and eaten, and here the ears of corn are reported to be rubbed and nonetheless eaten. This means: Mortify your members which are upon the earth, and put off the old man with his deeds (Col. 3). For no one otherwise transitions into the body of Christ, nor does a teacher otherwise feed on the fruits of his advancement. Thus, to pluck the ears of corn is to remove men from an earthly intention, where they had only fixed the root of their mind, as it were. To rub them with hands is to strip the purity of mind from carnal concupiscence, like husks and chaff. To eat the grains is for each person cleansed from all filthiness of flesh and spirit to be incorporated into the members of the Church through the mouths of preachers. And it is well reported that the disciples did this before the Lord in Mark, preceding him, for it is necessary that the preacher's word precedes, and thus illuminates the heart of the listener by the grace of heavenly visitation.
