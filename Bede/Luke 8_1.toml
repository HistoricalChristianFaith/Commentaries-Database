And it happened afterward, that he was traveling through cities and villages, preaching and evangelizing the kingdom of God, and the twelve were with him. We see in Christ's disciples the fulfillment of what we read said about that ancient people of the Hebrews. Nor is it surprising, because the same God of both Testaments will give blessing through the Son, who gave the law through the servant. As it says, a (mother) eagle provoking her young to fly, and hovering over them, spreads her wings, takes them up, and bears them on her shoulders (Deut. XXXII). For just as the young birds, newly born, cannot yet conquer the air by flying until they become feathered: so all the faithful, to be able to fly to heavenly things, must first clothe themselves with the wing of virtues in the nest of faith. Thus the apostles themselves, teachers of the faithful, gradually ascend to the heights, so that they can also preside over the teaching of others. First indeed the Lord teaches in synagogues, performs miracles, spreads renown everywhere, receives the crowds coming to him, heals, instructs. Hence he makes disciples, refreshes at the wedding of the bridegroom, leads them through fields, and defends them from the bites of serpentine Pharisees, like the young eagles with the stone brought against the bites of serpents. From these he chooses twelve, whom he names apostles, but he first teaches them in the presence of the crowd, giving to the usual benefits to the wretched along with the threatening crowd. Afterward, however, as it has been read herein, preaching through cities and villages, he retains only those who might hear him more intimately, explaining to them alone the mysteries of the kingdom of God, which he had spoken to others in parables. As if finally, with the manifestation of his virtues, firm as with the protection of wings, he gives them the power to heal, and sends them out to preach the kingdom of God.
