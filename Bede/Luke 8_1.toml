But like the eagle, enticing its young ones to fly, our Lord, step by step, raises up His disciples to heavenly things. He first of all teaches in the synagogues, and performs miracles. He next chooses twelve whom He names Apostles; He afterwards takes them alone with Him, as He preached throughout the cities and villages, as it follows, And the twelve were with him.
Mary Magdalene is the same of whose repentance, without mention of her name, we have just read. For the Evangelist, when he relates her going withour Lord, rightly distinguishes her by her known name, but when describing the sinner but penitent, He speaks of her generally as a woman; lest the mark of her former guilt should blacken a name of so great report. Out of whom seven devils are reported to have gone, that it might be shown that she was full of all vices.
But Mary is by interpretation, &#8220;bitter sea,&#8221; because of the loud wailing of her penitence; Magdalene, &#8220;a tower, or rather belonging to a tower,&#8221; from the tower of which it is said, you art become my hope, my strong tower from the face of my enemy. Joanna is by interpretation &#8220;the Lord her grace,&#8221; or &#8220;the merciful Lord,&#8221; for from Him comes every thing that we dive upon. But if Mary, cleansed from the corruption of her sins, points to the Church of the Gentiles, why does not Joanna represent the same Church formerly subject to the worship of idols?.

For every evil spirit whilst he acts for the devil's kingdom, is as it were Herod's steward. Susanna is interpreted, &#8220;a lily,&#8221; or its grace, because of the fragrance and whiteness of the heavenly life, and the golden heat of inward love.
