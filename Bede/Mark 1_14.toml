After John had been arrested, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the Gospel of the kingdom of God, etc. With John having been arrested, it was appropriate that he himself began to preach. With the law ceasing, consequently the Gospel arises. If, however, the Savior preaches the same things which John the Baptist had previously said, he shows himself to be the son of the same God, of whom that one is a prophet. Let no one think, however, that the tradition of John into prison happened immediately after the forty-day fast and the temptation of the Lord. For anyone who has read the Gospel of John will find that before his arrest the Lord both taught and performed many miracles. After all, you have in his Gospel: "This beginning of miracles Jesus did in Cana of Galilee" (John 2). And again: "For John was not yet cast into prison" (John 3). They say, moreover, that when John read the books of Matthew, Mark, and Luke, he indeed approved of the text of the history and confirmed them as speaking the truth, but maintained that they narrated the history of only one year, in which he also suffered, after the imprisonment of John. Therefore, passing over the year whose events had been expounded by the three, he narrated the deeds of the previous time, before John was shut up in prison, as it will be clear to those who carefully read the four volumes of the Gospels. This matter also resolves the discordance that seemed to be with John compared to the others. When Mark had stated that Jesus came into Galilee preaching the Gospel of the kingdom of God, he added and said: And saying, "The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand. Repent, and believe in the Gospel." The time is fulfilled, he says. Namely, that which the Apostle says: "But when the fullness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law, to redeem those who were under the law" (Galatians 4). Therefore, the times are fulfilled, repent. How long it has been since this has been proclaimed, and may it someday be heard: The times are fulfilled, and the kingdom of God has drawn near! Repent and believe in the Gospel. Renounce dead works, believe in the living God. What does it profit to believe without good works? It was not the merit of good works that brought you to faith, but faith begins, so that good works might follow.
