And they led him out to crucify him. And they compelled a certain passer-by, Simon of Cyrene, coming from the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to carry his cross. Simon seems to have been of great repute then, as his sons also are named as already known to all. But it must be avoided lest anyone thinks contrary to what John writes, that the Lord himself carried his cross; for the other evangelists relate that this Simon of Cyrene carried it.
