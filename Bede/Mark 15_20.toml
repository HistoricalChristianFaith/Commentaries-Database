For since He had been called King of the Jews, and the scribes and priests had objected to Him as a crime that He usurped rule over the Jewish people, they in derision strip Him of His former garments, and put on Him a blue robe, which ancient kings used to wear.
But instead of the diadem, they put on Him a crown of thorns, wherefore it goes on, “And platted a crown of thorns, and put it about His head.” And for a royal sceptre they give Him a reed, as Matthew writes, and they bow before Him as a king, wherefore there follows, “And began to salute Him, Hail, King of the Jews!” And that the soldiers worshipped Him as one who falsely called Himself God, is clear from what is added: “And bowing their knees, worshipped Him,” as though He pretended to be God.
Or else, by the blue robe, with which the Lord is clothed, is meant His flesh itself, which He gave up to suffering, and by the thorny crown which He carried is meant, the taking upon Him of our sins.
But they smite the head of Christ, who deny that He is God. And because men are not to use a reed to write with, they, as it were, smite the head of Christ with a reed, who speak against His divinity, and endeavour to confirm their error by the authority of Holy Writ. They spit in His face, who spit from them by their accursed words the presence of His grace. There are some also in this day, who adore Him, with asure faith, as very God, but by their perverse actions, despise His words as though they were fabulous, and think the promises of that word inferior to worldly allurements. But just as Caiaphas said, though he knew not what it meant, “It is expedient for us that one man should die for the people,” so also the soldiers do these things in ignorance.
