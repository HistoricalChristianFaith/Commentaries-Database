[[commentary]]
quote='''
The house of the righteous contains great treasure, etc. The house of Christ, that is, the Church, has great strength; so that rain, winds, and rivers of frequent temptations cannot demolish it. And in the works of the devil there is continuous turmoil, because he attempts to overthrow the same house of Christ through false brothers or open adversaries.
