And behold, a certain lawyer stood up, tempting him, and saying: Master, what shall I do to possess eternal life? The lawyer, who tests the Lord by asking about eternal life, as I think, took the occasion of testing from the very words of the Lord, where he said: But rejoice, because your names are written in heaven. But by his very temptation he declares how true is that confession of the Lord, with which he speaks to the Father: You have hidden these things from the wise and prudent, and have revealed them to little children.
