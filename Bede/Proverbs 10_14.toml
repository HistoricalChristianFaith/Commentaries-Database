The wise hide knowledge. Knowing indeed, that there is a time to be silent and a time to speak (Eccl. III). Hence the prophet says, "While the sinner stood against me, I was mute and humbled and silent from good things" (Psal. XXXVIII). And the Apostle, "I decided to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ, and Him crucified" (1 Cor. II).
