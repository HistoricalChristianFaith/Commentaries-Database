The only ministers of the Lord’s Word through whom the Lord might teach and so break the arrogance of the devil are individuals whom the Lord himself has victoriously snatched away from the devil, for all are by nature sons of wrath, conceived in iniquity and given birth by their mothers in sin. Since this is the case, he unexpectedly appeared and overcame the enemy. Just like a strong man strips the armor of his weaker opponent, so he took away all his weapons in which he had trusted. As the enemy had used people as his weapons to slaughter the souls of the wretched, so now the Savior has transformed these very same people into weapons of righteousness and uses them to cut off the head of iniquity from its body. That is to say, he compels sinners who have been converted to the faith to condemn Satan and to renounce all his works and all his evil ways. Moreover, it is correctly said that David took the sword first with his hand and then drew it from its sheath to kill the Philistine. For first the Lord comes in his desire to snatch away each great and brave defender of the demonic realm; then he draws him from the hidden recesses of errors into the light of liberating grace; and thus through this convert he allows others to be snatched out of the devil’s realm and corrected. But even when we meet and dispute with the madness of the heretics and convince them that they are “fabricators and worshipers of lies and perverse doctrines” by using nothing other than the reasons of their argument and the testimonies of the Scriptures which they themselves had purposed to use to seduce us, we clearly cut down the arrogance of the giant with his own sword. - "Four Books on 1 Samuel 3.17"
