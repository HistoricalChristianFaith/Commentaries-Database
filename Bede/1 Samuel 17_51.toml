Seeing that their strongest man had died, etc. Seeing that the unclean spirits were defeated and prostrated by the incarnation and passion of the Lord, they fled from the hearts of the believers. And all the strong ones in the Church, gathered from both the circumcised and the uncircumcised, arose and lifted up a voice terrifying to the wicked of divine preaching and praise, and pursued them until they recognized that they were to be humbled by Christ, and as it were submerged in the valley of dejection, who had previously boasted of setting up their camp on the mountain of pride against Him; and the fugitives might withdraw to the hearts, which they had previously inhabited evilly, plundering completely every fruit of piety and faith. For the gates of Accaron, that is, of barrenness, the fleeing Philistines reached, when the malignant spirits, repelled from the minds of the faithful, once again referred to their teachers. They entered the walls of the city of vanity and falsehood itself, when they also compelled the ignorant crowd to increase their unfruitful work worthy of fire. But they also reached Geth, that is, the press, when they drew out the hearts of the deceived to torment the good ones with unjust persecution. All these can also be understood in the same order even about perverse humans.
