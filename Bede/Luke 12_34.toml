For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also. This is to be understood not only about money, but about all passions. The glutton's god is the belly. Therefore, there he has his heart where his treasure is. The luxurious man's treasures are feasts, the wanton's amusements, the loverâ€™s lust, hence each one serves from whom he is conquered.
