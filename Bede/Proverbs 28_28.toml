"When the impious rise, men hide themselves," etc. The same men whom he calls just, who indeed maintain the just and established order of human condition from God. Hence, in the book of the blessed Job, it is said of any penitent perverse person, "He will regard men and say, 'I have sinned'" (Job 33). This is openly to say, "He will regard those who rightly keep the nature of human creation, and recognize himself as having been likened to beasts by sinning." The sense is clear, therefore, that in the fervor of the impious persecution, the faithful often hide; either not daring or not permitted to go out publicly; the Lord saying, "When they persecute you in this city, flee to another" (Matthew 10). But where, after the destruction of the authors, the persecution has ceased, the glory of the faithful shines more brightly after the pressures. Yet many infidels, having seen the condemnation of infidelity, receive the grace of faith; as it is written, "When the pestilent is scourged, the simple becomes wiser" (Proverbs 19). You are proven to be naked of the ornament of virtues because what you promised to the Lord, you were unable to fulfill. However, this is said not so that you should not undertake the care of governing souls when it is regularly imposed upon you, but so that you should not rashly usurp the role of teacher and prelate, with no one commanding it.
