Your father bound the people by an oath, etc. He troubled, because he interdicted everything; had he interdicted in part and granted in part, the matter would have seemed to be conducted more conveniently. But because in these kinds of matters the commands of spiritual Fathers must be obeyed, Jonathan was apprehended by lot, and the oracle of the Lord was withdrawn from Saul consulting that very day, manifestly showing. For if the power of a worldly king prevailed so much with God, how much do you think the command of a spiritual master prevails? But even in the typological sense, it disturbs earthly hearts if someone commands these heavenly matters solely to be carried out, since the Lord testifies that new wine is not to be put into old wineskins. It troubles the sharpness of readers and compels them to falter, who believe that they must be prohibited entirely from reading secular literature, which wherever found, it is lawful to take useful things as if they were their own. Otherwise, neither Moses nor Daniel would have been allowed to be instructed in the wisdom or literature of the Egyptians and Chaldeans, although they abhorred their superstitions and indulgences. Nor would the master of the Gentiles himself have inserted some verses of poets in his writings or sayings: but it is much more cautious to grasp the rose amidst thorns than to gather the lily among the soft leaves; much safer it is to seek salutary counsel in apostolic writings than in Platonic pages. For even the bees themselves, which make honey of this kind, indeed present sweet sayings with their mouth which soothe, but in their rears they keep venomous stings that strike.
