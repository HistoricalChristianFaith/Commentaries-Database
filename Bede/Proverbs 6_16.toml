There are six things that the Lord hates, etc. He more fully indicates how detestable he is to God by sowing discord. But when the Lord says "soul," He does it in a human manner, to signify that He hates such people with full intention and not lightly. Thus it is in Isaiah: "Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hates" (Isaiah 1).
