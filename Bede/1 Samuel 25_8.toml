Now therefore let the young men find favor in your eyes, etc. Because, they say, you teach the people, which is to intellectually shear the flock, ensure that even the disciples of Christ preaching may find in you the grace of faith and good action. For indeed we come to preach uniquely good things in the light of grace, so remarkably good, that the previously unheard kingdom of heaven is proclaimed to mortals; and to this, the whole race of men is called, from which the Gospel also received its name in Greek due to this foremost goodness. Whatever virtuous obedience your strength finds, willingly bestow it upon those teachers rejoicing in serving your salvation, and upon the offspring from your lineage, to the truly strong and desirable hand of Jesus Christ.
