With him we came to Mytilene. We have written in the first book, following Pliny the Younger, that Mytilene is an island off Asia; but Pliny elsewhere writes that Mytilene is a city on the island of Cyprus. Both are believed to be true; however, it is said that now Paul and his companions did not come to the city of Cyprus, but to the island near Asia. For after a long journey and traveling through many regions, Cyprus appeared, but it is said they did not enter it.
