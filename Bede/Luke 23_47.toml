But when the centurion saw what had happened, he glorified God, saying, "Truly this man was righteous." Not only did the centurion glorify God, but also the soldiers who were with him guarding Jesus (as Matthew writes), having seen the earthquake and the things that were happening, were greatly afraid and said, "Truly this was the Son of God" (Matthew 27). Therefore, how great is the blindness of the Jews, who, though so many miracles were performed by the Lord, and so many signs appeared at His death, refused to believe, and were more insensitive than the Gentiles who scorned to glorify or fear God. Hence, rightly through the centurion the faith of the Church is designated, which, with the veil of heavenly mysteries torn open by the death of the Lord, immediately affirms Jesus as truly a righteous man and truly the Son of God while the synagogue remains silent. For even the sum of one hundred, which in the bending of the fingers, as was previously mentioned, from the left hand passes to the right, perfectly corresponds with the sacraments and faith of the Church, to which the Gospel is believed in place of the Law, and the heavenly kingdom is promised in place of earthly riches.
