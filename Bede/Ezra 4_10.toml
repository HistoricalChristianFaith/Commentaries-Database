'Rise up, it is your part to make a decision, and we will be with you, so take courage and do it', he very fittingly teaches how one should consult with superiors, namely that a person should say what he has understood is best according to his own reason, if he believes that he has understood well, and yet leave the prerogative of decision making to the person who is qualified to make it and be ready to submit to all that this person ordains should be done in accordance with the will and law of God.
