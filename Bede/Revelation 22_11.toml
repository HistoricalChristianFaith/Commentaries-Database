[Herod knew that John the Baptist was a just man and kept him safe]. But his love for the woman prevailed, and she forced him to lay his hands on a man whom he knew to be holy and just. Since he was unwilling to restrain his lust, he incurred the guilt of homicide. What was a lesser sin for him became the cause of a greater sin. By God’s strict judgment it happened to him that, as a result of his craving for the adulteress whom he knew he ought to reject, he caused the shedding of the blood of the prophet, who he knew was pleasing to God. Now this is [an illustration of] the divine dispensation of judgment, of which it is said, “Let the evildoer still do evil, and the filthy still be filthy.” But what follows, “Let the holy still be holy,” is appropriate to the person of blessed John. Already holy, he became more holy still when, through his office of spreading the good news, he reached the palm of martyrdom.
