Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you who kill the prophets and stone those sent to you, how often I wanted to gather your children together as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, and you were not willing. Jerusalem does not refer to the stones and buildings of the city, but to its inhabitants, whom he laments with a father's affection, as we also read in another place that upon seeing her, he wept. But in saying, "How often I wanted to gather your children," he testifies that all the prophets were sent by him. The similarity of the bird gathering its nest under its wings is also read in the song of Deuteronomy: "As an eagle protects its nest and desires over its chicks, spreading its wings, it took them and bore them on its feathers" (Deut. XXVIII). And fittingly, the one who had called Herod a fox pondering his own death, compares himself to a bird. For the deceitful fox never ceases to lay snares for birds.
