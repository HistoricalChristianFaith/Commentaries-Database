And when they had prayed, the place in which they were gathered was shaken. Those who sought the strength of firm hearts against the deceit of the enemy received the sign of their prayer being heard through the earthquake, so that they might understand that the earthly hearts were to yield to them. When the Holy Spirit came upon them, even the earth itself was struck with fear. Although it might be understood as the joyful fear of those who, by believing, were to be subjected to the apostles, and who, with their earthly heaviness shaken off, learned to rise with Christ and seek heavenly things.

And they spoke the word of God with confidence. In the Greek it is added: To everyone willing to believe. Also, in the following reading, when it was said: And the multitude of those who believed were of one heart and one soul, here too in the Greek manuscripts, which our Codices do not have, it is added: And there was no division among them. And then, which is also contained in our Codices in a subdued manner: Nor did anyone say that what they possessed was their own. Blessed Cyprian also placed this sentiment in the third book of Testimonies, saying: “But the crowd of those who believed were of one heart and soul; nor was there any distinction among them, nor did anyone consider any of their possessions to be their own.” This passage fits well and coheres aptly with what was said above, since those who received the Holy Spirit on the holy day of Pentecost, though all were Galileans, spoke in the tongues of all who were present from different parts of the world, both Jews and proselytes. For there indeed, through the uniting of different languages, it was beautifully foreshadowed that the holy Church, by the gift of the same Spirit, would have one heart and soul among the different nations and languages across the world. For it is not for all believers to speak in all tongues, but the unity of different tongues in the faith of Christ was a sign, because there is one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and Father of all (Eph. IV).
