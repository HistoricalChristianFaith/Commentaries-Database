But the Fish Gate the sons of Hassenaah built. He gives the name 'Fish Gate' to the gate which faced Joppa and Diospolis (i.e. Lydda). 'It was nearest to the sea of all of Jerusalem's roads; today it is said to be called the Gate of David and is the first of the gates to the west of Mount Zion. This view appears to be borne out in the Chronicles, in which it is written about Manasseh king of Judah: After this he built a wall outside the City of David, to the west of Gihon in the valley, from the entrance of the Gate of the Fish in a circuit as far as Ophel, and he erected it much higher.
