Now it came to pass in those days, that there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus, that all the world should be taxed. The Son of God, about to be born in the flesh, chose for Himself His parents as He willed, and the place of His birth as He willed, and brought them to that place before He was born as He willed. Thus, also, at the time which He willed, indeed, which He, with the Father and the Holy Spirit, had decreed from ages, and had foretold through the mouths of the prophets, He entered the world to save it. For, just as He was born of a virgin mother, demonstrating that the glory of virginity and the angelic honor of purity was most pleasing to Him, so also, born at the most peaceful time of the world, He showed that He sought and loved peace greatly. He indicated that He would always deign to visit the followers of peace and love. Concerning this, He Himself promised to the faithful, saying: For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them (Matt. XVIII). For what greater sign of the most perfect kingdom, and the most beautiful, as far as men are concerned, could there be of peace than that the whole world is encompassed by a single census, and that all the farthest reaches of the world are comprehended in the same monetary declaration? Whose author and ruler, Augustus, according to the faith of histories, reigned in peace for twelve years around the time of the Lordâ€™s birth, so that, with both foreign and civil wars being quieted throughout the whole world, he may be seen to have fulfilled even to the letter the spiritual prophecy of the prophet. The prophet indeed proclaimed with mystical voice the dispensation of Christ, saying: And in the last days the mountain of the house of the Lord shall be established in the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills, and all nations shall flow unto it (Micah IV). Shortly after, he also took care to describe the state of that most sacred time: And they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning hooks. Nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war anymore. O house of Jacob, come ye, and let us walk in the light of the Lord (Ibid.). Not only did this new census of the world testify to the advent of that supreme king who would enroll His chosen ones, gathered from all directions of the world, in the book of eternal happiness, but it also aided the leaders of his kingdom with the peace of his governance. For surely, with the nations subdued by the storm of wars, the shadow (so to speak) of the Roman name, terrible at that time, protected the disciples of Christ, who were to preach to the world, from the fervor of arising seditions wherever they might wish to go for the sake of the word. Therefore, the decree went out from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be enrolled, for the decree of Christ the King was impending, by which all the world would attain salvation. He who fulfilled the name of Augustus most perfectly, desiring his own to grow and himself sufficient to increase them, commanded that the censors sign those subject to his expedition not with the removal of money, but with the offering of faith. Go ye into all the world, and preach the Gospel to every creature. He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved (Mark XVI).
