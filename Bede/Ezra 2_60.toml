And from the sons of the priests, the sons of Tobiah, etc. The sons of the exiled act with the same caution towards the priests as they are reported to have acted towards the people. For they took great care that it would be openly revealed without confusion who truly belonged to the people of Israel or to the priestly lineage; but those who were suspected, or who were certainly begotten from the lineage of proselytes, that is, foreigners. Therefore, they removed the suspected priests from the office of the altar, until their origin could be more certainly clarified; but nonetheless preserved them in the society of the exiled with unanimous peace. According to the mystical sense, the sons of the priests, ascending from the Babylonian captivity, seek the record of their genealogy, and not finding it, are ejected from the priesthood; because they themselves, the ministers of the altar, fall into such crimes and such unspeakable doctrines that even if they return to salvation by repenting, they cannot become worthy to be promoted to the sacred rank which they lost, nor to resume the office of teaching the Gospel or administering the sacraments. For these, although they expect eternal life among the faithful, do not find the record of their rank, which they cannot regain, among the perfect priests.
