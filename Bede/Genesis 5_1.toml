This is the book of the generation of Adam. In the day when God created man, He made him in the likeness of God: He created them male and female, and He blessed them. This is the book of the first creation of man, which God made in His likeness, that he might be perpetually good, immortal, and happy by participation in His goodness. God created them male and female and blessed them with the grace of His blessing. Such was the generation of Adam with his wife on the day he was created. But alas! how grievous! He defiled the likeness of God by believing the enemy rather than the Creator; his firstborn contracted the heavier punishment of a curse by envying and killing his brother; the seventh from him, Lamech, corrupted the established law of male and female, of which it was said, "They shall be two in one flesh" (Gen. II, 24), by taking two wives and uniting three in one flesh. As evils increased everywhere, humanity so departed from the likeness of its Creator and the first blessing that by the tenth generation, except for a few whom the ark held, it deserved to be entirely destroyed. However, the Creator Himself granted that we might return to that likeness and blessing, being born and dying in the likeness of our nature, so that redeemed through Him, we might merit to say of Him: "We know that when He appears, we shall be like Him, for we shall see Him as He is" (1 John III, 2), and to hear from Him: "Come, you blessed of My Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world" (Matt. XXV, 34).
