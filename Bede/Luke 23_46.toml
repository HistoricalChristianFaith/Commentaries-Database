And crying out with a loud voice, Jesus said: "Father, into your hands I commend my spirit"; and saying this, he expired. By invoking the Father, he declares himself to be the Son of God. By commending his spirit, he does not suggest the weakness of his power, but demonstrates the confidence of the same authority as the Father. For he loves to give glory to the Father, so that he might instruct us to give glory to the Creator. Therefore, he commends his spirit to the Father, in accord with the words spoken with a joyful heart and lips exulting with the hope of resurrection, in another psalm: "For you will not abandon my soul to the netherworld, nor let your holy one see corruption" (Psalm 16).
