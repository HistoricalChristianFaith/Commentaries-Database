But Mary kept all these words, pondering them in her heart. What does it mean when it says, "pondering"? It should have said, "considered in her heart," and "kept in her heart," but because she had read the holy Scriptures, and knew the prophets, she compared those things that happened to her regarding the Lord with those things she knew were written by the prophets about the Lord, and having compared them with each other, she recognized as the cherubim of heaven the unity of her own vision. For Gabriel had said: "Behold, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son" (Luke 1). Isaiah had foretold: "Behold, a virgin will conceive, and bear a son" (Isaiah 7). Micah had foretold the daughters of Zion coming to the tower of the flock, and that the first dominion would then come. The shepherds said that the cohorts of the heavenly city appeared to them in the tower of the flock, who were singing that Christ was born. Mary had read: "The ox knows its owner, and the donkey its master's crib" (Isaiah 1). She saw in the manger the Son of God as a baby crying, who saves both men and animals; and in these individual things and such, she compared what she had read, and compared with what she heard and saw.
