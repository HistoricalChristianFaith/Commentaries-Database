The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave him, etc.
The Church, founded by the apostles, by what course it was to be spread and by what end it was to be completed, had to be revealed to strengthen the preachers of the faith against the adversities of the world. John, as is his custom, referring the glory of the Son to the Father, testifies that Jesus Christ received the revelation of the mystery from God.

And he signified it. He intertwined the same Apocalypse with mystical words, lest it be despised by being manifest to all.

Sending by his angel. For the angel used the figure of Christ to John, as will be more clearly apparent in the following.
