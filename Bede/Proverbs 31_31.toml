"Give her of the fruit of her hands," etc. These are indeed the words of that man of whom it was said: "Her husband, and he praised her," that is, of our Lord and Savior, who will command the angels at the end to lead the Church, after the struggle of this life, after the threshing of earthly afflictions, to the joys of the heavenly kingdom, and to gather it together as a companion of immortal life, according to that evangelical saying, "Gather the wheat into my barn" (Matt. 13). "Give her," he says, "of the fruit of her hands," because she has taken care to bear the fruit of the Spirit, love, joy, peace, kindness, goodness, modesty, self-control, faith, patience. For this, give her the due recompense, and let her works praise her in the gates, that is, in judgment or in the entry to the heavenly homeland. Not the superfluous praises of men, but the very works she has done, examining, approving, and rewarding him whose gracious gifts these are, so that we may deserve to be praised by him in the future, may he graciously grant us to praise him worthily in the present life with appropriate services. Amen.
