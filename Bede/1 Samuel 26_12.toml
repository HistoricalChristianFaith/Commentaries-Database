And there was no one who saw or understood, etc. There was no one among the reprobate who, hearing the Lord or His apostles preaching the future desolation of Judea, and the erasure of its ancient state from the land, understanding either their past misdeeds or future damnation, would awake to repentance; but they persisted in all impiety, because the Lord, due to preceding merits, blinded their senses. Alternatively, the sleep of the Lord fell upon them, that is, heavier than usual, which the Lord imposed on them particularly because of Davidâ€™s advent, not allowing them to awaken until He himself had gone back.
