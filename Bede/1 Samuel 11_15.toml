And Saul rejoiced there, etc. Saul rejoiced in Gilgal, which is called revelation. Jesus exulted in the Holy Spirit and said: I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and intelligent (Matt. XI; Luke X), that is, from those trusting in serpentine wisdom, as if fighting against Israel under King Nahash; and you have revealed them to little ones, that is, to those whom in the brightness of truth and in the poverty of spirit, as if in the city of Bezek, the fear of the Lord has gathered, strengthened, and helped. Again, he says, I will see you, and your heart will rejoice, and no one will take your joy from you (John XVI).
