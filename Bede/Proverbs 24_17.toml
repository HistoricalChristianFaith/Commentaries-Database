When your enemy falls, do not rejoice, etc. Earlier he forbade laying snares for the righteous; now, to perfect himself in all things, he also forbids insulting enemies when they sin or incur some adversity, lest perchance, if by the mercy of the Lord they return to repentance and the salvation of their souls and begin to have faithful friendship with you, you would then blush because you once despised those whom divine grace had reserved for life. But, as much as you can, commiserate with those who have fallen, and help them to rise again; and if your wish and endeavor follow through with success, you will rejoice over the one healed whom you had mourned for being ill; otherwise, however, you will not lack the fruit of your goodwill with God. Or certainly it should be said thus: Do not rejoice over the fall of your enemy, lest perhaps the Lord, casting down your pride, which undoubtedly displeases him, humiliates you by making you fall into sin while your enemy, repenting, gets healed.
