King Cyrus also brought forth the vessels of the temple of the Lord, etc. Nebuchadnezzar took the vessels of the Lord from Jerusalem, as any unclean spirit, snatching certain of the faithful from the Church, deprives them of the joy of internal peace. Moreover, he places them in the temple of his god, when he joins them to the company of the reprobates, who are the temple and city of the devil, namely the head of all evils, both angels and men. But King Cyrus brings them forth and numbers them for the prince of Judah to be returned to Jerusalem, when our Lord, who is the heir of all things, rescues those whom He has predestined to eternal salvation from the power of Satan, and offers them to the priests of the Church to be reconciled through repentance. And well does he say that the vessels are numbered for the prince of Judah; for the Lord knows the number of His elect, nor does any of His sheep perish who confess His great and terrible name; for Judah means confession.
