Now after these words in the reign of Artaxerxes king of the Persians, Ezra son of Seraiah, son of Azariah, and so on until his genealogy is completed and it says, son of Eleazar, son of Aaron the priest from the beginning - this Ezra came up from Babylon. He was a scribe swift in the Law of Moses, which the Lord God had given to Israel. This Artaxerxes, under whom Ezra came up from Babylon to Jerusalem, Josephus believes to be Xerxes son of Darius, who reigned after him. Moreover, the books of the chronicles hold that the successor of this same Xerxes, who also among them was called Artaxerxes, is designated here. Now Darius, under whom the temple was built, ruled thirty-six years; after him Xerxes ruled for twenty years; after him Artabanus ruled for seven months (which the chroniclers set down as a year); and after him Artaxerxes ruled for forty years.
