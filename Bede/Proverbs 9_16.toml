Whoever is simple, let him turn here, etc. Wisdom also seems to invite the little ones and the foolish to her feast with nearly the same words; but it differs, as she simply asks them to come to her, whereas this one urges them to turn aside to her. For wisdom summons those she sees wandering to the right path of action; this one teaches those walking rightly to deviate from their way and turn aside to her.
