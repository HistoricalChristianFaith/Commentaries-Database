But there were rocky cliffs on either side of the pass, etc. There are frequent dangers lying in wait from both the right and left for the holy teachers striving to ascend against the wiles of evil spirits, that is, in glory and ignominy, in prosperous and adverse situations; and just as teeth are accustomed to chew and deliver food to the stomach, so unclean spirits, formerly broken by the frame of the blessed, seek how to seduce the simple, corrupt the just, defile the chaste, and cast the fallen into the body of their wickedness.

One was called Bozez, etc. Bozez, "in it he blossomed": Sene, "distress" is said. The interpretation of which is evident, for not less in flourishing than in opposing, that is, bringing distress, the ascent of the saints is hindered, and by the tireless enemy they are struck so that they might fail either in body or in heart.
