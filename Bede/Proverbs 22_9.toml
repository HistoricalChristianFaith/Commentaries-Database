"He who is kind-hearted will be blessed," etc. This is similar to that of the same judge, who discerning the merciful from the impious, says: "Come, blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world; for I was hungry and you gave me food," and so forth (Matt. XXV, 34, 35). But the bread given to the poor can be understood not only as carnal nourishment, but also spiritual doctrine, by which the soul is refreshed.
