James, and John, Philip, and Bartholomew, Matthew and Thomas. Luke fittingly and reverently, in the catalog of apostles, uses the name Matthew, but in the account of the calling from the tax office, as I previously noted, he preferred to call him Levi. He indeed is Matthew himself, as it is written: “Declare your iniquities, that you may be justified”; and he clearly calls Matthew from the tax office, and classifies himself as a publican in the order of apostles, but he also places himself under his fellow Thomas, though he is placed before him by the other evangelists. Certainly, James and John, who for their eminent virtue and spirit’s peak, were called the sons of thunder, that is, Boanerges, or more correctly written, Banereem, by the Lord. Not in vain. One of whom, thundering from above, issued that theological voice, which none had known to utter before: “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God,” etc. (John 1). Which he left filled with such power, that if he had chosen to thunder more, even the world itself could not have contained it. Yet both frequently separately, and led up the mountain by the Lord, sometimes deserved to hear the terrible voice from the cloud: “This is my beloved Son.” They also bore ancient names most fitting to their merits. For James means supplanter. John, in whom there is grace, or is called the grace of the Lord. For he joyfully supplanted the care of the flesh, when called by the Lord, and rejoiced to disdain the flesh itself when murdered by Herod. He, for the grace of unique love deserved by virginal glory, reclined on the breast of his Redeemer at the supper. Philip is interpreted as the mouth of the lamp. And rightly so, because when called by the Lord, having found Nathanael he immediately proclaimed the light he had recognized, saying: “We have found him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, wrote, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.” (John 1). And later, feeling his knowledge of the light was less, he earnestly asked: “Lord, show us the Father, and it will suffice us.” (John 14). Bartholomew is a Syrian name, not Hebrew, and means the son of one who suspends the waters, that is, Son of God. Who suspends the minds of his preachers to contemplate heavenly things, so that the higher they freely fly, the more richly they inebriate the hearts of earthly things with the drops of their words. Hence well does Moses speaking mystically of the Church say: “For the land to which you are entering to possess is not like the land of Egypt, from which you have come, where when seed is sown water is led in irrigation, but looking up for rains from heaven, which God visits at all times.” For worldly wisdom crawls like a serpent on the ground, but divine wisdom thunders from above. Matthew is called given, namely, because by the great gift of the Lord he was delegated from being a tax collector and publican to the office of an apostle and evangelist. Thomas, meaning abyss or twin. Thus, he is called Didymus in Greek, because by doubting longer than the others, he learned more deeply the truth of the Lord’s resurrection. About whom Paulinus the Bishop of Nola beautifully sang: This Thomas, doubtful and named Didymus, lay down, Christ allowed him to doubt with a trembling mind, For our faith, so that, strengthened by this guide, And trembling, we may confess that the true Jesus Lives after death, showing the wounds on his living flesh.

James of Alphaeus, and Simon who is called the Zealot. These he placed with an addition, to distinguish them from James of Zebedee and Simon Peter, or even Judas the traitor. For John also shows that this Simon was called, who said: And when he had dipped the bread, he gave it to Judas the son of Simon Iscariot. And James indeed of Alphaeus, he is the one who in the Gospel is called the brother of the Lord, because Mary, the wife of Alphaeus, was the sister of Mary, the mother of the Lord, whom John the Evangelist also calls Mary of Cleophas. Perhaps because Alphaeus was also called Cleophas, or Mary herself, after the death of Alphaeus, married Cleophas after James was born. The ecclesiastical history records that she gave birth to a son Simeon, who being the cousin of the Lord, because Cleophas was the brother of Joseph, ruled the church in Jerusalem after James; whether this apostle Simon, or any other Simeon it may have been. Because indeed James, deservedly called the son of Alphaeus, that is, the learned one, the apostles testify, who immediately made him bishop of Jerusalem after the Lord’s passion. Because even before the shedding of blood, he himself is also shown to be a true supplanter of carnal desire, attested by Hegesippus, the historian near the times of the apostles. He says, James was received by the church of Jerusalem after the apostles, the brother of the Lord, surnamed the Just. Many indeed are called James, but this one was called holy from his mother's womb, he drank no wine or strong drink, ate no flesh, was never shaved, nor anointed with oil, nor used a bath. To him it was customary to enter the Holy of Holies. Indeed, he did not wear woolen clothes, but linen, and he alone entered into the temple, and with knees fixed, he prayed for the people. So much so that his knees were believed to have acquired the hardness of camels. But Simon the Zealot, he is also Simon the Canaanite from the village of Cana in Galilee, where the Lord turned the water into wine. For Cana indeed means zeal, and Canaanite interprets as Zealot.
