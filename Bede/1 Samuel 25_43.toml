But David also took Ahinoam of Jezreel, etc. Ahinoam means brother's beauty, Jezreel is interpreted as seed of God. Therefore, the Lord chose not only from the synagogue of the Jews those whom He would join to Himself with internal love, but also graciously took from the gentiles a people to be imbued with His sacraments, confirmed by His love. He who is rightly called brother's beauty, insofar as he delights in seeking the glory of his Redeemer, not his own. For He Himself deigned to become our brother, either because of the humanity of His nature similar to ours which He assumed; or because He gave the power to become sons of God to as many as received Him (John 1). Finally, in the Song of Songs, the Lord Himself is called the brother of the Church because of the communion of the same nature, and she is called His sister; whence this: You have wounded my heart, my sister, my spouse, you have wounded my heart (Song 4). And she, desiringly expecting His incarnation in the ancient faithful: Who will give you to me for my brother, sucking the breasts of my mother, that I may find you outside and kiss you (Song 8)? that is, that I may deserve to see and speak to you in the form of a man, whom I have always been accustomed to believe, love, and adore in the invisible nature of deity. He who is most beautifully called brother's beauty from Jezreel, that is, born of the seed of God, namely that seed that went out to sow, who sows (Matthew 13), that is, the word of faith; which, after He Himself entrusted to the Jews, the Lord also took care to evangelize to the foreign gentiles through His apostles; so that, according to the parable of the Gospel, there might be one fold and one shepherd (John 10).
