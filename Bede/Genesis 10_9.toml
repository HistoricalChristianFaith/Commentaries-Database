From him came the proverb: Like Nimrod, a mighty hunter before the Lord. It turned into a proverb because his deeds were unprecedented in his time; and the phrase before the Lord was added to magnify the crime, since it was evidently quite reckless and arrogant for a man on earth to dare live in such a way before the Lord, who looks down from heaven upon the children of men; whence it is clear that many at that time avoided doing such things due to fear of divine oversight, although another version has it that Nimrod was a giant hunter against the Lord. From the ambiguous Greek term, enantion, both can be interpreted. In fact, in the psalm where we sing let us weep before the Lord who made us (Psalm 95:6), the word is enantion Kyrion. This also appears in the book of Job, where it is written, You burst forth into rage against the Lord. The understanding about the giant is thus evident, that he was a mighty hunter of brute animals, as a powerful man; but because he was an impious man, he led a proud life against the will of the Creator.

From whom even today remains the proverb, so that it is said: Like Nimrod, a mighty hunter before the Lord. With those imitating the devil who are on his side, it can very truly be said, because such people, when they hunt the souls of men either by their word or example to destruction, follow the deeds of the ancient transgressor and deceiver.
