“For the Lord detests the perverse man.” The Lord detests every mocker. Indeed, every mocker, because a mocker either despises carrying out the words of God which he knows, or distorts them by understanding and teaching them perversely. A mocker is also one who despises His promises as small, and scorns His threatening as bearable: just as he who insultingly mocks the simplicity or poverty of others. Consequently, divine justice rightly detests such a mocker. It is well added: “And he is intimate with the upright.” For often the proud, while mocking the simple, judge themselves to be more prudent than those they mock. But their prudence, as James says, is earthly, unspiritual, demonic (James 3). The Lord, however, is intimate with the upright, because He illuminates them with the secrets of heavenly wisdom, which He considers those free from earthly pride and possessing simplicity. Hence, He says, “You have hidden these things from the wise and learned, and revealed them to little children” (Matthew 11; Luke 10).
