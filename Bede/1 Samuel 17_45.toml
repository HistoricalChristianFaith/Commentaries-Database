But David said to the Philistine: You come to me with a sword, etc. The Lord aptly showed both to all whom he helped and to the powers he subdued, that the devil of the air is armed solely with the weapons of pride and deceit, by which he either defends and protects his own little things or breaks the true thoughts. He showed that he himself is the one whom the Psalmist foretold: Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord (Psalm 117). Finally, reproaching some unbelievers, he said: I have come in my Father's name and you did not receive me (John 5).
