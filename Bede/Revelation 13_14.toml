seduces: &quot;His coming will be,&quot; as is said, &quot; after the working of Satan in all power, and signs, and prodigies of falsehood.&quot; And there is wont to be a question, whether these are called &quot;signs and prodigies of falsehood,&quot; because he is to deceive the senses of men by phantasms, so as to seem to do what he does not; or because these very things, even if they shall be true prodigies, will lead to falsehood those who shall believe, that they could only have been wrought by divine influence, being ignorant of the power of the devil. For it was not by a phantastical, but a true fire and whirlwind that he destroyed so great a household as that of the holy Job, with so great flocks. But whether they are called &quot;prodigies of falsehood&quot; in this way or that, it is in this that the temptation will appear to be greater than all the rest, that when the pious martyr submits his body to torments he too at the same time performs so many miracles before his eyes.
