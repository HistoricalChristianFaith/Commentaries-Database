These animals are all the nations, unclean in their error but cleansed by a threefold lowering, that is, by the mystery of the holy Trinity in baptism. Leaving behind the form of humans, they take on the shapes of beasts and serpents. Hence, because of his treacherous and wicked character, it is said of Herod, “Go and say to that fox”; and the Pharisees are referred to as “a brood of vipers.” Of the lustful it is said, “Horses made mad for their mares”; of the shameless, “Do not give what is holy to dogs,” and of the voluptuous, “Do not cast your pearls before swine.” Of those who are proud and at the same time treacherous it is said, “The foxes have dens and the birds of the air have nests.” And of all people in general it is said, “And man, when he was held in esteem” (that is, made in the image of God), “did not understand; he was like foolish cattle.” Solomon, however, shows man [humankind] as he truly is, that is, uncorrupted, when he says, “Fear God and keep his commandments, for this is all there is to man.”
