The chief priests and the scribes also stood, vehemently accusing him. With the chief priests and scribes accusing him, the Lord responded little to Pilate, and answered nothing to Herod, lest by refuting the accusation he might be released by the governor, and the benefit of the cross be delayed. For it was indeed just that he should respond in part to Pilate, who reluctantly delivered the sentence: but Herod and the other Jewish leaders whom he regarded as wholly unworthy of his words, since they condemned the innocent against the decrees of their own law. Because of these things, although he refused to answer, the likeness of the Lamb was given so that in his silence he might be considered not guilty, but innocent. For when he remained silent, he displayed the patience of a lamb about to be slaughtered for the whole flock; but when he answered, he fought like a good shepherd against the threats of wolves and robbers for the sheep entrusted to him.
