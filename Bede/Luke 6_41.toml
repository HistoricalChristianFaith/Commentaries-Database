Why do you see the speck in your brother's eye, but do not consider the beam that is in your own eye? And this looks back to the previous point, where it was warned that a blind man cannot lead a blind man, that is, a sinner cannot chastise another sinner. For many, out of pride, or hatred, or love of money, or greed, or any other crime, judging these things as trivial or nothing, very harshly rebuke those whom they see disturbed by sudden anger, as if the eye of the mind has changed from its usual state of purity, like a speck suddenly falling in, and forgetful of the Lord's precept, which says: "Do not condemn, and you will not be condemned" (Luke 6), they prefer to blame and condemn rather than amend and correct.
