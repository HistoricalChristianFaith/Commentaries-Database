When a certain servant girl saw him sitting in the light and looked closely at him, she said, "This man was also with him." Why is it that the servant girl is the first to betray him, when surely men could have recognized him more clearly, except that this gender also should appear to have sinned in the death of the Lord, and this gender should be redeemed by the Lord's passion? Therefore, a woman first received the mystery of the resurrection and kept the command, to abolish the old error of transgression.
