But the women who had come with him from Galilee followed, and saw the tomb, and how his body was laid. Above it is written that all his acquaintances stood at a distance, and the women who had followed him. Therefore, after his acquaintances of Jesus had returned to their own homes after his body was taken down, the women alone, who loved him more closely, followed the funeral to see how he was laid, so that at the appropriate time they might offer their gift of devotion to him. And even until now, holy women do the same on the day of Preparation, when humble souls, and those who are more conscious of their greater fragility, fervent with greater love for the Savior, diligently follow the footsteps of his passion in this world, where rest is to be prepared in the future, and carefully consider with diligent curiosity in what order the same passion was accomplished if perhaps they might be able to imitate it.
