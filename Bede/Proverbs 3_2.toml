For length of days, and years of life, etc. Lest the imposition of observing precepts should disturb the listener, he prefaces with certain rewards, and so enumerates the precepts. For by the length of days, he signifies eternal light; by the years of life, the transition from this mortality; by the increase of peace, he designates the very state of attained blessedness. Of which Isaiah says: His authority shall increase, and there shall be no end of peace (Isaiah IX). But it was also given to the previous people of God, and now in the present, that when they obeyed the law of God, they should live for a long time in the quiet of peace.
