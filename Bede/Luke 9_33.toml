And it happened, while they were departing from Him, that Peter said to Jesus: Master, it is good for us to be here, and let us make three tents, one for You, one for Moses, and one for Elijah, not knowing what he said. Oh, what great happiness it would be to be present perpetually at the vision of the Deity among choirs of angels, if the transfigured humanity of Christ and the company of two saints seen even momentarily delighted enough for Peter to want to hold them in service so they wouldn't depart! Though in human condition he did not know what to say, he nevertheless showed a sign of the fervor instilled in him. For he did not know what he was saying, who forgot that the kingdom promised by the Lord to the saints was not in some place on earth, but in the heavens, nor could he or his fellow apostles, still burdened with mortal flesh, enter the state of immortal life, nor was a house made with hands necessary in that age. But even now, ignorance is marked by anyone who wishes to make three tents for the law, the prophets, and the Gospel, since these cannot at all be separated from each other, having one tabernacle, that is the Church of God.
