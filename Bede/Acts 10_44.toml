Lest there might be any hesitation about conferring baptism upon the Gentiles, support was supplied by the testimony of the Holy Spirit, who in an unexpected sequence of events acted in advance of the waters of the baptismal bath, which are ordinarily the means of sanctification. This is reported to have happened once in testimony to the faith of the Gentiles but never in the case of the Jews.
