And Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the boy, and gave him back to his father. He does not rebuke the boy, who was suffering the attack, but the demon which was causing it, because one who desires to correct a sinner must drive away the vice by surely reproving and hating it, but ought to restore the man with love, until he can be returned healthy to the spiritual fathers of the Church.
