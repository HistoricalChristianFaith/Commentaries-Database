And when the Philistine had looked and saw David, etc. And when the devil had very shrewdly looked and saw the Son of God in the world doing and teaching things contrary to him, as if proceeding against him, since he found him humble, he, knowing nothing but pride, despised him. For he was full of new virtue and grace, reddened with the blood of passions, and beautiful in the action of great deeds.
