He himself knew their thoughts, etc. This is what we read: The Lord knows the thoughts of men, that they are vain (Psalm XCIII). And what follows: Blessed is the man whom you instruct, Lord, and teach him out of your law (Ibid.). This is said about those who have learned that the law fulfilled through Christ, not to be a carnal commandment for us, but a spiritual Sabbath.
