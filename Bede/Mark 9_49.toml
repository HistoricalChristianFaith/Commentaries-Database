For every one shall be salted with fire, and every sacrifice shall be salted with salt. For the stench of worms is usually born from the corruption of flesh and blood. Therefore, fresh meat is seasoned with salt so that, once the blood moisture is dried out, worms cannot breed. Thus, flesh and blood create worms, for carnal pleasure, which is not resisted by the seasoning of continence, generates eternal punishment for the luxurious. Whoever wishes to avoid this stench should strive to season both the body with the salt of continence and the mind with the seasoning of wisdom to restrain it from the stain of error and vice. It is remarkably said: "For every one shall be salted with fire." What is salted with salt wards off the decay of worms. But what is salted with fire, that is, seasoned with flames sprinkled with salt, not only drives away all contagion of worms but also consumes the very flesh that is so salted. The decrees of the divine law declare it to be usual in the matter of sacrifices that were burned on the altar, where in every sacrifice and offering it was commanded that salt be offered. Thus, salt signifies the sweetness of wisdom, and fire signifies the grace of the Holy Spirit. "For every one shall be salted with fire" because every chosen person ought to be cleansed from the corruption of carnal desire by spiritual wisdom, so that they may be made a fitting sacrifice for the divine altars. Thus it is fitting that, after saying "For every one shall be salted with fire," it added "And every sacrifice shall be salted with salt." For he truly exists as the sacrifice of the Lord who, by purifying his body and soul from vices through the love of the Holy Spirit, consecrates himself to God. Not only is such a sacrifice sprinkled with salt, but it is also consumed by fire when not only the contagion of sin is driven away, but even the pleasure of the present life, which is in the flesh, is taken away from the minds of the chosen, and they long with a focused mind for the conversation of future life. Was not the sacrifice salted with sacred fire who said, "But our citizenship is in heaven" (Phil. III)? From where also we expect the Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ, who will reform the body of our lowliness, conformed to the body of his glory (Ibid.). For those who, with the most certain hope of future immortality, looked upon their frail body as already reformed in the likeness of the Lord's resurrection, lived as consecrated victims to God through spiritual fire even in the present, according to the word of the same apostle: "I beseech you, brothers, by the mercy of God, that you present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and pleasing to God" (Rom. XV). We can rightly understand what is said: "For every one shall be salted with fire. And every sacrifice shall be salted with salt" (Mark IX), that the altar of God is the heart of the chosen, and the sacrifices to be offered on this altar are the good works of the faithful. In every sacrifice, salt should be offered because no good work exists that does not salt wisdom, cleansing it of all corruption of vain praise, and other perverse or superfluous thoughts. For the care of continence punishes the enticements of the flesh. The fire that consumes sacrifices on the altar is certainly the one of which John said: "He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire" (Ibid. III); through whom our good works are helped so they may either commence or be perfected, or surely the fire of tribulation through which the patience of the faithful is exercised so that it may have perfect work. Therefore, everyone shall be salted with fire, and the sacrifice shall be salted with salt (Ibid. IX), because every faithful person who wants to avoid the eternal worm of torment must be chastened either by the fire of spiritual grace or by the tribulations coming from outside, so they can become a worthy sacrifice to God. This passage relates to the preceding parts, where the command was given to cut off the scandalizing members: for this is also to be salted with fire, that is, to be exercised by temptations, to deny those close to us and loved ones for the love of Christ.
