Since you are content with mere faith, in vain do you seek to acquire the riches of righteousness. But, should you desire to be truly rich, forsake everything, and buy the fervor of love approved by the flame of afflictions, and anoint the eyes of the mind, not with the antinomy of deceitful boasting but with the eye salve of divine knowledge. To anoint the eyes with eye salve is to acquire an understanding of the holy Scriptures through the performance of a good work.
