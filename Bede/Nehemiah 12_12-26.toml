After the succession of the high priests has been described, a catalogue of the lesser priests and Levites who existed in their time is also added so that we may know that after a large number of citizens were gathered in Jerusalem, there was also an excellent and most noble assembly of priests and Levites sufficient to provide for the services of the temple and altar, to confess and praise God, for the guardianship of the temple and city and to educate the people. And it was not done without the understanding of a more sacred mystery that the rebuilt city of Jerusalem deserved a greater multitude of citizens in every rank and order that it is ever said to have lost when the enemy was attacking and destroying it. For in the same way the holy church often receives greater gains from its losses when, by one personâ€™s lapse through carelessness into sin, many are frightened by his example and become more careful to continue steadfastly in the purity of faith; often these same people who have sinned begin, after they have done penance, to bear greater fruits of good works than they used to bear before the invasion of sin; often, when the church has been ravaged by heretics and after it recovers the light of truth through the perseverance of catholic teachers, it has given birth to more children in order that they might come to know and uphold the reason of this same truth that has been restored.
