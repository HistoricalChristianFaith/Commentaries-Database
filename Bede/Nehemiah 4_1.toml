And when I heard words of this sort, I sat down and wept, and mourned for several days; and I began to fast and pray before the God of heaven, and I said: 'I ask you Oh Lord, God of heaven, strong, great and terrible, who keep your covenant and mercy with those who love you and obey your commands, let your ear be attentive and your eyes open to see the prayer of your servant, and so on until the end of this prayer when it says: 'And guide your servant today, and grant him mercy before this man'.2 For if a holy man, hearing that the buildings of stone and wood had been destroyed, rightly mourned, fasted and prayed and did this for a long time while sitting in sadness, how much more ought we to persist with continual laments, tears and prayers over the destruction and ruination of souls which is caused by sin? In this way those who, when the enemy was triumphing, wallowed for a long time in the filth and squalor of sins to the shame of their religion, may, by the Lord's mercy, be elevated once more to their former state of health.
