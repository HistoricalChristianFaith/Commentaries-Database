Indeed, health will be in your navel, etc. Solid works of virtues are in the bones, and in the navel, which is in the middle part of the inner body, is designed to signify the still weak and imperfect action of good deeds. Therefore, if you fear God, and rely not on your own strength but on heavenly protection, and strive to abstain from evil, there will be health for your navel, and watering for your bones, because through these both the weakness of the work is strengthened to a state of perfection, and all your strong acts receive reinforcement.
