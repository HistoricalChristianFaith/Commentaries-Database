So the sons of the singers gathered, etc. The sons of the singers are imitators of those who have striven to serve the Lord with a devout and cheerful mind, or even to sound forth His word by preaching to others; who build for themselves villages around Jerusalem, when they dwell in the vicinity of the heavenly homeland with a lofty heart, saying: "For our conversation is in heaven" (Philippians III). And they build these same villages in the plains around Jerusalem, when they humble themselves the more with a heart expanded in God, as much as they sweetly taste and touch the glory of His loftiness; who, indeed, all being gathered now and with the progress of good works, to the heavenly homeland of virtues, and in the very time of dedication - that is, of eternal reward - are found there together.
