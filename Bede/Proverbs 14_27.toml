The fear of the Lord is a fountain of life, etc. This then is the hope of those who fear the Lord, that turning away from the ruin of death, they may merit to come to Him who says, I am the way, and the truth, and the life (John XIV). But as it is said above, The law of the wise is a fountain of life, to turn away from the ruin of death, now it is said, The fear of the Lord is a fountain of life, to turn away from the ruin of death. From this it is clear that there is no earlier law of the wise by which one ought to avoid death and acquire eternal life, than to have the fear of the Lord. Wherefore it is also said elsewhere, The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom. In the multitude of people is the dignity of the king, and in the paucity of people the disgrace of the prince. Where there is a multitude serving God, there especially is the glory of Christ. Where only catechumens, or those preparing for baptism, or recently born infants are still held under the kingdom of the devil, and they hasten in due time to be reborn in Christ, there is the manifest disgrace of the prince of the world. Or certainly in the conventicles of heretics, which are always fewer than the churches of Catholics, the disgrace is evident of those who have separated these from the unity of the church.
