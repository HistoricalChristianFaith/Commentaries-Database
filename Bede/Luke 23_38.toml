There was also an inscription written above him in Greek, Latin, and Hebrew letters: This is the king of the Jews. Appropriately, the title which testifies to Christ as king is placed not below but above the cross, because although he suffered on the cross in human weakness for us, he shone above the cross with the majesty of the king. Who fittingly also, because he is both king and priest, as he offered to the Father the excellent sacrifice of his flesh on the altar of the cross, displayed the dignity of the title of king which he held, that it might be known to all who wished to read, that is, to hear and believe, that he did not lose but rather confirmed and strengthened his kingdom by the cross. Whence the Apostle, having described the ignominy of the cross, added: Therefore God also exalted him, and gave him the name which is above every name, etc. (Philippians II). For the fact that this name was written in Hebrew, Greek, and Latin, this is what the same Apostle subsequently added: And every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is in the glory of God the Father (Ibid.). As far as the letter is concerned, these three languages stood out above others. Hebrew for the Jews glorying in the law, Greek for the wisdom of the nations, Latin for the Romans who were then ruling over many and almost all nations. Therefore, whether the Jews like it or not, every kingdom of the world, every worldly wisdom, all the sacraments of the divine law testify that Jesus is the king of the Jews, that is, the emperor of those who believe and confess God.
