countenance: Such as the Lord appeared on the Mount, will He appear after the judgement to all the saints, for at the judgement the ungodly will behold Him Whom they pierced.

As he appeared to his disciples on the mountain, so will the Lord appear after the judgment to all the saints. For at the judgment the impious will see him whom they pierced. And this circumstance concerning the Son of man is true also of the church, with whom Christ himself was made one nature, since he gives to her the priestly honor and the power to judge that she also might shine as the sun in the kingdom of his Father.
