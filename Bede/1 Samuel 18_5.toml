And David went out to all, etc. Whether the people of the Jews wished to believe in Christ or to oppose Him, whether to make Him king or to crucify Him, He, coeternal with the Father's wisdom, always acted prudently, both by greatly rewarding the pious and by patiently enduring the impious. And the same people placed Him over the men of spiritual war, in some namely by believing and confessing that He alone helps those fighting for the salvation of souls to be able to conquer. In others, however, by exclaiming that He was guilty of death, by which death, finally accepted according to the will of the impious, having overcome the author of death, He grants us too the example of waging war and triumphing together with Him.

And he was accepted in the eyes of all the people, etc. The Lord was accepted by all who had those eyes, of which He Himself speaks: Blessed are the eyes that see what you see (Matthew XIII). Especially in the pure heart of the apostles, who by a special providence were commanded to serve by preaching the salvation of the Jews. For whomever the Lord was not accepted by, such are not to be considered as having open eyes; but to be of those of whom it is said: Leave them alone, they are blind guides of the blind (Matthew XV).
