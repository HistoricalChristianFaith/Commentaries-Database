And the Lord said to him: Now you Pharisees clean the outside of the cup and of the dish, but inside you are full of greed and wickedness. And Mark indeed reports that they are accustomed to observe the washing of cups and pots, couches, and vessels of bronze, but under the guise of such vessels, they themselves are accused of the pretense of hypocrisy, because they show one thing to men outwardly, and do another thing at home, having the form of godliness outwardly, but inwardly they are deformed by the filth of vices. For the Lord wishes to explain more fully what he had briefly stated above about cleansing the eye of the heart.
