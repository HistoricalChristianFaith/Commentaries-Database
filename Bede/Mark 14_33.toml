And He takes Peter, and James, and John with Him, and began to be afraid and to be very sorrowful. And He said to them: My soul is sorrowful even unto death. Christ is afraid, while Peter is not afraid. Christ is afraid; Peter says: I will lay down my life for you (John 13). Christ says: My soul is troubled. Both are true, and each is full of reason, because the one who is lower does not fear, and the one who is higher carries the emotion of fear. For he, as a man, does not understand the power of death. But He, being established as God in the body, exposes the frailty of the flesh, so that the impiety of those who deny the mystery of the Incarnation might be excluded. Indeed, He said this, and Manichaeus did not believe, Valentinus denied, and Marcion judged it a phantom. However, He equaled the human set forth in the truth of the body to such an extent by emotion, that He would say: Nevertheless, not as I will, but as You will (Matthew 26). Therefore He took up my will, took up my sorrow. I confidently name sorrow because I preach the cross. My will is what He called His own. Because as a man He took up my sorrow, as a man He spoke.
