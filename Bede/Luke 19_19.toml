And to him he said, "And you be over five cities." This means, from the faith and conversion of the souls whom he had instructed, shine forth as great and exalted. Concerning which Isaiah mystically says: "In that day there will be five cities in the land of Egypt, speaking the language of Canaan" (Isaiah 19). For the five cities in the land of Egypt are the five senses of the body, which we use in this world, namely sight, hearing, taste, smell, and touch. And, "whoever looks at a woman to lust after her" (Matthew 5); who "turns his ear away from hearing the poor" (Proverbs 21); who "gets drunk with wine, in which is dissipation" (Ephesians 5); who "enjoys crowning himself with roses before they wither" (Wisdom 2); whose "hands are full of blood, and his right hand is filled with bribes" (Psalm 26), the five senses of this person speak the language of Egypt, that is, all the senses perform works of darkness. For Egypt signifies darkness. But he who "stops his ears from hearing of bloodshed, and shuts his eyes from seeing evil" (Isaiah 33), who "tastes and sees that the Lord is good" (Psalm 34), who "disciplines his body and brings it into subjection" (1 Corinthians 9), who can say with the Apostle, "We are to God the fragrance of Christ" (2 Corinthians 2), the cities of this person speak with a changed language, which is interpreted as Canaan. And the one who had taught them away from the darkness rightly is remembered as being over five cities, because he is honored not only for his own progress but also for the progress of his listeners, whom he called to the light.
