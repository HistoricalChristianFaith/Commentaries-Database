[[commentary]]
quote='''
The light of the eyes rejoices the soul, etc. It rightly delights the human mind, when it recognizes, by the Lord's revelation, that it has perceived the light of heavenly mysteries. Which another translation more clearly says, The eye seeing good things delights the heart, certainly the good things of the Lord in the land of the living. Whoever contemplates these with the eye of the mind, rightly delights in the heart, though externally he seems to walk sadly, oppressed by an enemy. That most blessed fame, by which we have learned that not only our deeds and words, but also our thoughts are known in heaven by the reporting angels; offers the richness of love and faith to our virtues, lest they wither by failing. For the more surely we hold that the hidden things of our heart, and likewise our works, are open to divine views, the more we ought to inflame with the oil of His charity the strength of our good action, lest it grows weary.
