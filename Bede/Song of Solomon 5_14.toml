His hands are like cylinders of gold, etc. After the lips, the Church praises the hands of her Redeemer, that is, His deeds after His words, because He showed by His actions that what He taught with words was to be believed. For instance, while teaching on the mountain, the crowds were amazed at His doctrine. But to follow this amazement with faith, He descended from the mountain and cleansed a leper with a mere touch of His hand. This is also why, marveling at His deeds, His fellow citizens said, "Where did this man get this wisdom and these mighty works?" (Matthew XIII). For wisdom pertains to the lips, and virtues to the hands. Rightly does he declare His hands to be like cylinders, to denote both their easy power and their unfathomable knowledge of action. It is well known that turning (lathe work) is quicker and more inexplicable than other arts. For example, one who works with an adze, chisel, axe, or hammer, operates more laboriously and with frequent use of a ruler and careful scrutiny to avoid errors. But he who works with a compass does not need an external rule; rather, he can maintain the direction of his work within the instrument itself. Therefore, the Lord's hands are like cylinders because He readily accomplishes what He wills, because He speaks and they are made. Finally, He said: "Pick up your mat and walk." And immediately, rising, he took up his mat and walked, who had been paralyzed for thirty-eight years (John V, 8, 9). His hands are like cylinders because He holds within Himself the rule of all justice. Unlike our poverty, He does not need to learn from sacred writings lest His work deviate from the truth. Hence it is said of Him, "How does this man know letters, having never learned?" (John VII, 15). He knew because He was indeed older than the letters and the law, nay, the judge of the lawgiver Himself. His hands are like golden cylinders full of hyacinths. For in gold, which excels all metals, the excellence of divinity is signified as is evident from frequent exposition. Therefore, his hands are golden, because no faithful person is ignorant that the virtues which he exercised in man are accomplished divinely. These are rightly also said to be full of hyacinths, because they undoubtedly excite us to the hope and love of heavenly things. The hyacinth, indeed, is a gem of a sky-blue color. The Lord has hyacinths in his turned hands, so that he may adorn vessels of election, which he prepares for glory, with such gems, that is, he may gladden the hearts of his elect with the desire and expectation of celestial glory. If we take the pigments designated by this name in the hyacinths, it does not deviate from the appropriate significance of truth: for the hyacinth is a pigment of a purple color and a pleasant scent. Hence the poet, gathering precious things as an example of love, adds: The gifts are of laurel, and the sweetly red hyacinth. And the hands of the Lord were full of purple flowers, because dying for our life, he soaked them in the redness of his own blood at the nailing. But another translation teaches that gems rather than flowers are to be understood in this place by the name of hyacinths, which says: His hands are turned, golden, full of tharsis: for tharsis among the Hebrews is the name of a stone which among us is called chalcedony. His belly is ivory, etc. The belly holds the most fragile place in our limbs, because it lacks bones to protect it and it contains the vitals, all of whose wounds are dangerous. But ivory is the bone of the elephant, which is said to be an animal of great chastity and cold blood. Hence, its death is often sought by the dragon, as it desires to cool its burning entrails by drinking its blood. The sapphire is a stone, the color of which, the sacred history testifies, which says: And they saw the God of Israel under his feet, as it were the work of a sapphire stone, and as it were the sky when it is clear (Exodus XXIV, 10). Therefore, the belly of the beloved signifies the fragility of his humanity, by which he was conformable to us. The ivory indicates the beauty of chastity, by which in human flesh he remained undefiled by corruption of sin. The sapphires express the sublimity of heavenly virtues, with which he shone in the flesh. He says, his belly of ivory, adorned with sapphires. As if he openly says, the fragility of the mortal substance in him shall indeed be true, but this shall be utterly free from the lasciviousness of mortality and shall rather shine with the excellent glory of divine works. And beautifully did he say his belly was entirely of ivory, yet not wholly adorned with sapphires, but marked with sapphires, so that part appears ivory, part sapphires. For his belly was indeed of ivory, because the fragility which he assumed was free from all sin, just as no contagious heat can be found in the bone of a dead elephant. He was distinguished by sapphires, because amidst the passions of assumed humanity, he showed frequent signs of perpetual divinity: for it pertains to the frailty of humanity that the little child is born to us, to the power of divinity that he is born of the Virgin, and the same birth is proclaimed by angelic voices and celebrated with mysteries; to the power of divinity that he is shown by the indication of a star, to be adored by the Magi, to the frailty of humanity that he is fled from his homeland by the snares of a treacherous king; to the frailty of humanity that he could be led and tempted by the devil, to the power of divinity that, with him conquered and repulsed, he is honored by angelic ministries; to the frailty of humanity that he asks the Samaritan woman for water, to the power of divinity that he testifies that he can give the same the fountain of living water; to the frailty of humanity that he is wearied from the journey, to the power of divinity that he promises eternal rest to those who follow him; to the frailty of humanity that he sleeps in the boat, to the power of divinity that, when awakened, he commands the winds and the sea; to the frailty of humanity that he was crucified and died, to the power of divinity that at his death the elements trembled along with the earthly and even the heavenly beings; to the frailty of humanity that he was embalmed with spices and buried, to the power of divinity that he rose and ascended into heaven; it pertains to the frailty of humanity that Isaiah says: He has no form or comeliness, and we saw him despised (Isaiah LIII, 3). And shortly after: Like one from whom people hide their faces, he was despised, and we did not respect him (ibid.); to the power of divinity that John says: We saw his glory, glory as of the only begotten from the Father, full of grace and truth (John I). Therefore, the sapphire was distinguished as the ivory belly of Christ, because his immaculate and undefiled incarnation shone with frequent miracles of divine majesty. It should be noted that Scripture says of the sapphire color, that it is such in appearance as the sky when it is clear. By the name of the clear sky, the sublimity of divine majesty is not incongruously represented, as attested by the Psalmist, who, describing the incarnation of our Redeemer, says: His going forth is from the end of the heavens, and his circuit to their ends (Psalm XVIII). This is what he himself said to the disciples about himself: And you believe that I came from God; I came from the Father and have come into the world; again, I am leaving the world and going to the Father (John XVI, 28). But the bride herself saw the form of the sapphire in the ivory belly of her beloved when, with the voice of her first pastor, she said: You are the Christ, the Son of the living God (Matt. XVI, 16), because indeed, in the holy, innocent, undefiled Son of Man, separated from sins, she recognized the pure fullness of divinity.
