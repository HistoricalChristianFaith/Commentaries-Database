A good measure, pressed down, shaken together, and running over, will be poured into your lap. This is similar to what he says elsewhere: That they may receive you into eternal dwellings (Luke 16). For it is not the poor themselves, but Christ who will give the reward to those who have given alms. Nevertheless, they are said to give it into the bosom because they provided the occasion for that merit, either by being pitiable in need or by being harsh in insolence, the stronger enduring them with patience and supporting them with kindness, and sometimes calling them sweetly to the faith.

For the same measure you use will be measured to you. And the Apostle, urging the Corinthians to give alms, says among other things: "But this I say: He who sows sparingly will also reap sparingly. And he who sows bountifully will also reap bountifully" (2 Corinthians 9). It can also be understood of all things we do in mind, by hand, or with tongue. "Because you will render to each," he says, "according to their deeds."
