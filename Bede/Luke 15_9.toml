And when she has found it, she calls her friends and neighbors together, saying, "Rejoice with me, for I have found the drachma which I had lost." Who are these friends and neighbors but those heavenly powers previously mentioned? They are as close to heavenly wisdom as they approach it by the grace of continuous vision. But it should be noted why this woman is said to have had ten drachmas. For the Lord created the nature of angels and men to know Him, and when He willed them to stand for eternity, He undoubtedly created them in His own likeness. The woman had ten drachmas because there are nine orders of angels, but to complete the number of the elect, man was created as the tenth, who did not perish from his Creator even after sin, because eternal Wisdom, dazzling with miracles in the flesh, restored him from the light in the vessel.
