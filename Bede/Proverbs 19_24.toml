The slothful man hides his hand under his armpit, etc. No one is so slothful that he considers it labor to bring his hand to his mouth while eating. But for the slothful, it is labor to bring the hand to the mouth, for a lazy preacher does not even want to do what he says. To bring hand to mouth, indeed, means to align actions with words. A false witness mocks judgment, namely, that which is said, "You shall not bear false witness." Or certainly the future judgment, of which it is said above, "A false witness shall not be unpunished; and he who speaks lies shall perish; and the mouth of the wicked devours iniquity." As a hungry man desires to be filled with food, so the wicked eagerly seek to be satisfied with the excuse of iniquity.
