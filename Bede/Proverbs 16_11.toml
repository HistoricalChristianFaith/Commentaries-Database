A weight and balance are the judgments of the Lord, etc. He calls the stones of the age, just and strong in faith, such as the apostle Peter desired those to be whom he admonished, And you also, like living stones, are being built into spiritual houses. Therefore no one was chosen by his own virtue from the beginning of the world and fit for the heavenly building; but rather by His work, who, constituting all things by weight and measure and number, distributed to each as He willed, the measure of faith and graces.
