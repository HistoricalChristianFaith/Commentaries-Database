“By the signs which it is allowed to work, it deceives those who dwell on earth.” “For his coming,” it is said, will be “by the activity of Satan with all power and false signs and wonders.” It may be that these are called “false signs and wonders” because he will deceive the senses of people through phantasms, so that he seems to do what in fact he does not do. Or it may be that these signs, even though they will be astonishing wonders, will lead those to falsehood who, unaware of the power of the devil, will think that such things could not be accomplished apart from divine power. For it was not by a fake fire or storm that the devil destroyed the whole family of the saintly Job together with all of his flocks, but by a real fire and a real whirlwind.
