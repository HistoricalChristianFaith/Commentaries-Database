He calls the devil “the ruler of this world” because he rules over those who, in a perverse way, love the world rather than the world’s Maker. He was judged by the Lord when he said, “I saw Satan falling like lightning from heaven.” He was judged by [the Lord] when he was casting out demons and when he gave his disciples the power of treading on all the power of the enemy. Accordingly, the world is convicted of the judgment by which the devil is judged when human beings are frightened by the example of the archangel who was condemned because of his pride, lest they presume to resist the will of God. The Holy Spirit convicts the world of the judgment by which the ruler of the world has been judged when the apostle Jude, speaking in the Holy Spirit, in order to correct the wickedness of evil human beings records the punishment of the proud angels, saying, “The angels who did not preserve their place of leadership but left their dwelling place, he has kept in eternal chains in darkness for the judgment of the great day.”
