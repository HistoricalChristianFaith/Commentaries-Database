And when he had done this, they enclosed a large multitude of fish. However, their net was breaking. By the great number of fish, the net was breaking, for now even reprobates, together with the elect, enter in such a number at the confession of faith, who also tear the Church itself with heresies. The net breaks, but the fish do not slip away, for the Lord preserves his own even among the scandals of persecutors.
