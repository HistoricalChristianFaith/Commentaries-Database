These are also the parables of Solomon, etc. Hence, he begins to speak in a new order, not as before, as if he were addressing the listener, but rather he himself, discussing what the reason of truth contains. In which, however, anyone reading or hearing may very clearly discern what to seek, or what to avoid. These parables are said to have been translated by the men of Hezekiah, because perhaps until his time they were scattered among many, as they were once received from the mouth of the wisest king; but by his diligence collected into one, they were inserted into the body of this little book. It is indeed to be noted that in these parables much more is said allegorically than in the others, by comparison of things which seem to be fitting to figures.
