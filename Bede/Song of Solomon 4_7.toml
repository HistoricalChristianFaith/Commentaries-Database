You are entirely beautiful, my friend, etc. You are beautiful not only in the distinguished members of the elect, which I have specifically enumerated, but also in those who seem small and fragile, and you shine with the beauty of virtues, and you are free from the stain of vices. For He has blessed all those who fear the Lord, small and great alike (Psalm 113). Hence, in his Apocalypse, John speaks of the heavenly homeland of the same Church: "Nothing impure will ever enter it, nor will anyone who does what is shameful or deceitful, but only those whose names are written in the Lamb's book of life" (Revelation 13). These things are said not because in this life any of the saints can be entirely free from all faults or perfect in virtues; since it is written truly, "There is no one on earth who is righteous, who does what is right and never sins" (Ecclesiastes 7); but because the holy Church, as the Church of Christ, is pure in faith and conduct; if any defilement or depravity touches it, it does not belong to it, but must be quickly purged away with all effort, as something foreign. Similarly, Blessed John says, "Everyone born of God does not commit sin" (1 John 3); because His seed remains in him, and he cannot sin, as he is born of God. For in as much as the seed of God's grace, through which they are reborn, remains, they cannot sin; but in as much as they do sin, grace has temporarily left them, so that they may recognize what they are of themselves, who lived righteously through grace. This same grace, having cleansed them from all evil after this life, and shining with perfect beauty, will lead them into that city where, as it is said, nothing impure can enter; and then in the friend of the bridegroom, this will truly be fulfilled, for which she now strives with all the effort of virtue, that she may be entirely beautiful, without any stain.
