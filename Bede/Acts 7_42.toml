Although they may have made offerings to the Lord because of the necessity of offering him service, it is nevertheless true to say that their minds were turned aside to the service of idols “from the time when they had transformed gold into the head of a calf.” “For the things we read they afterwards offered to God they did not offer of their own free will, but,” as we learn from this passage, “they made them out of fear of punishment and because of the slaying of those who fell on account of the idols.” “The Lord, however, does not accept the things offered but the wills of those making the offering. Besides, whenever there was an opportunity they returned in their hearts to Egypt.”
