For I too am a man placed under authority, having soldiers under me. He declares himself a man and subject to authority, whether of a tribune or of a governor, yet able to command those lower, so that it is understood all the more that He, who is God, and powerful above all, has an innumerable host of angelic virtue to obey His commands.

And I say to this one: Go, and he goes, and to another: Come, and he comes, to my servant: Do this, and he does it. He wants to show that the Lord can accomplish what He wills not only through the coming of His body but through the ministry of angels. For either the infirmities of the bodies or opposing forces, to which man is often given over in weakness, must be repelled, both by the word of the Lord and by the ministries of angels. Alternatively. The soldiers and servants who obey the centurion are natural virtues. Many who come to the Lord bring with them no small abundance of these. Of which it is said in the praise of Cornelius the centurion: Because he was a just man and fearing God with all his house, doing many alms to the people, and always praying to God (Acts X).
