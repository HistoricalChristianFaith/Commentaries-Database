The wicked flee when no one pursues. He who is not strong in faith sometimes deserts faith of his own accord, even if no persecutor pursues him, when he renders himself similar to the infidel by thefts, perjuries, fornications, poisonings, and other such crimes.

But the righteous are as confident as a lion, etc. The lion does not tremble in the face of beasts because he knows he prevails over all. Thus, the security of righteous men is rightly compared to a lion, because when he sees anyone rising against him, he returns to the confidence of his mind, knowing that he surpasses all adversaries, for he loves only Him whom he cannot lose being invincible.
