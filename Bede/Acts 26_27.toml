Do you believe the prophets, King Agrippa? I know that you believe. This he speaks not in flattery, as some think, but truly. For Agrippa, as one versed in the rites and laws of the Jews, believed that the prophets spoke truth, but as a faithless man, he did not know to whom that truth referred, that is, the Lord Christ. Although it is recorded that in a certain council with the Jews, he said: But you rely on the help of religion, since the disciples of Jesus have already filled the Roman world, or do we think that this religion grows without God's will?
