And an angel appeared to him from heaven, strengthening him. Elsewhere we read that angels came and ministered to him. In the testament of each nature, it is described that both angels ministered to him and an angel strengthened him, since he who existed as God before the ages was made man at the end of the ages. Who, even before being exalted through the glory of resurrection, was above the angels in divinity, but nonetheless was made lower than the angels in humanity, as it is written (Psalm VIII), through which he was also subject to death. But after he trampled death by rising, he even placed his humanity above the majesties of the archangels. Certainly, if any heresy flatters itself by this, affirming that he was weak and needed the help of a strengthening angel, let it remember that the Creator of angels did not need the support of his creation. Indeed, if he wished, he could have led twelve thousand legions of angels from the heavens. Then subsequently he was necessarily strengthened in the same way that he was saddened. For if he was sad for us, that is, he was sad because of us, it is necessary that he was strengthened for us and for our sake.
