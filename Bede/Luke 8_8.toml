And others fell on good ground. And it yielded fruit a hundredfold. He speaks of fruit a hundredfold, perfect fruit. For the number ten is always taken for perfection, because the keeping of the law is contained in the ten commandments. For both the active and the contemplative lives are joined together in the mandates of the decalogue, because in it both the love of God and the love of neighbor are commanded to be kept. The love of God pertains to the contemplative, but truly the love of neighbor pertains to the active life. However, the number ten multiplied by itself rises to one hundred. Hence, a great perfection is rightly designated by the hundred, as it is said of the one who leaves his earthly possessions for the Lord: He will receive a hundredfold and will possess eternal life (Matthew XIX). For whoever despises temporal and earthly things for the name of God, both here receives the perfection of mind, so that he no longer desires those things which he despises, and in the next age he attains the glory of eternal life. Therefore the good ground is enriched with a hundredfold fruit, when a docile heart is endowed with the perfection of spiritual virtues.

Saying these things, he cried out: He who has ears to hear, let him hear. As often as this admonition is interposed, either in the Gospel or in the Apocalypse of John, it is shown to us more attentively that what is said is mystical and should be sought out by us more intently.
