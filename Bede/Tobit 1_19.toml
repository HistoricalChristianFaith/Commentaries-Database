Orders were given by the king that Tobit be killed and all his property confiscated on account of the good deeds he had done, but he with his son and wife fled naked and went into hiding because many people loved him. And the devil did his utmost to bring about the spiritual death of the people of God through idolatry and strip them of all the riches of their virtues but could not because there were many holy teachers among them who made provision for their life and salvation. However, he fled with his son and wife because the enemy could not rob them either of belief in the Lord’s incarnation or of the synagogue as an institution, however ferociously he persecuted them, as became evident in the tortures of the Maccabees.
