Amos too speaks of the glory of the humanity [Christ] had assumed: “He who builds a means of ascent in heaven and founds his promise on earth.” He built a means of ascent in heaven when he created for himself a human body and soul in which he would be able to mount up to heaven. He founded his promise on earth when by sending the Spirit from above he filled all the ends of the earth with the gift of his faith, as he had promised. The psalmist, foreseeing in his spirit that the gift of this promise would come and desiring that it come quickly, said, “Be exalted, O God, above the heavens, and let your glory be over all the earth!” Here he clearly means that before our Redeemer assumed a mortal body and demolished the kingdom of death, “God was known only in Judah, and in Israel was his name great.” But when the God-man arose from the dead and penetrated the heights of heaven, then the glory of his name was proclaimed and believed throughout the whole wide world.
