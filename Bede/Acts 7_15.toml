In fact, it is only of Joseph that Scripture reports his bones being transferred from Egypt and buried in Shechem. However, from these words of the blessed Stephen and from the writings of Jerome, who was a resident of these very places, it is to be observed that other patriarchs were also buried in the same place, although the memory of Joseph is rightly held more famous, since it was he who commanded that this be done with his bones, and it is to his tribe that this city belonged. Indeed, in his history of the blessed Paula, Jerome reports thus, “She passed through Shechem (not Sychar as many erroneously read), which is now named Neapolis, and she entered the church built on the side of Mount Garizim, in the neighborhood of Jacob’s well, upon which the Lord sat.” And a little further on he says, “And turning away from there, she saw the tombs of the twelve patriarchs.” Likewise, in his [Jerome’s] book on the best sort of translating, “But the twelve patriarchs are not buried in Arboc but in Shechem.”
