And Herod and Pilate became friends on that day. For previously they had been enemies to each other. This most nefarious pact between Herod and Pilate, which they made in killing Christ, is still maintained by their successors as if by hereditary right, when pagans and Jews, although differing in race and religion as much as in mind, nevertheless agree in persecuting Christians, and in trying to destroy faith in Christ within them.
