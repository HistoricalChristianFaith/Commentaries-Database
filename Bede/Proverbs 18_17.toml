The just man is the first to accuse himself, etc. Everyone who is truly just, when he observes the errors of sinners, first turns the eye of consideration upon himself, and while he anxiously accuses his own frailty, only then does he gently extend his tongue to rebuke others. But he who said to his faithful, 'But I have called you friends, because all that I have heard from my Father, I have made known to you' (John 15); it comes into his heart through the presence of divine contemplation, thus he perceives how the world is cleansed from the filth of iniquity, and he rewards its humility with a fitting recompense.
