“And Saul ate with Samuel on that day. And he went down from the high place into the city.” And the Lord preached with John [the Baptist] at a time when grace shone until John was cast into prison. The Lord said about those people who would believe in him, “I have a food to eat which you do not know.” John and the Lord did not hand down commands only to the perfect by ascending to the heights of virtues but also to the weak by condescending to general matters. To the perfect they said, “Sell what you own and give alms.” but to the weak they said, “You shall not murder; you shall not commit adultery.” - "Four Books on 1 Samuel 2.9"
