James says that we are tempted by our adversaries in order to learn the virtue of patience, and thereby to be able to show and to prove that in our hearts we have a firm belief in a future retribution. In interpreting this verse we must bear in mind what the apostle Paul said about the same thing: “Knowing that suffering produces endurance, and endurance produces character.”
