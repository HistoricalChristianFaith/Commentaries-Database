And he said to him: Fear not, etc. Although Jonathan, unaware of the fate and future destiny, as a man, made a false statement about himself under David's reign, yet according to the mystical meanings, he reveals the joys of Christ and the Church. Truly, he bore witness to that inviolable kingdom, to which he himself belongs, by asserting that the enemies are not to be feared, for they can never reach to extinguish the dominion of faith and truth; indeed, that he whose dominion was to be multiplied, and whose peace would have no end, would reign perpetually over the chosen angels and men; and that those who loved him faithfully and with their whole heart would be closest to him in all the heights of this same kingdom. With their enemies prostrate and defeated, and subjected entirely to the feet and dominion of Christ, as Paul says: "He must reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet; the last enemy to be destroyed is death. For he has put all things in subjection under his feet" (I Cor. XV; Psalm CIX); and when he says: "All things are put in subjection under him," undoubtedly except him who subjected all things to him (Psalm VIII), hence it is clear that the powers that have deserted him, empty and void, Christ will render, setting victory trophies against the rivals of our salvation, whom he had long since defeated by his own death, as it is written: "Because the children have shared in flesh and blood, he himself likewise partook of the same things, that through his death he might destroy the one who has the power of death" (Hebrews II), that is, the devil. Text: Thus he struck, and the rest.
