(1 Kings 18). And it happened as Saul completed speaking to David, etc. When the Savior, through the apostles, completed spreading the gifts of his incarnation by preaching in Judea, many indeed, having heard the word, believed. But the more perfect ones among these, overflowing with spiritual grace, which, as has often been said, is designated by the name Jonathan, were so bonded to him with such love that they did not hesitate to give their lives for him. Meanwhile, not a few others, especially those who rejoiced in earthly sovereignty whether by elevation or by desiring it, indeed received with lesser fervor of love but with the same acknowledgment of faith; believing and confessing with certainty in his sacrament. They by no means equated him with the merits of the fathers from whom he took flesh, however high they were, but followed the Apostle's sentiment where it says, Whose are the fathers, and from whom is Christ according to the flesh, who is blessed forever over all things (Rom. 9)."
