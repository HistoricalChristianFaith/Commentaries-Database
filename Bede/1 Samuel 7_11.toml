The men of Israel went out from Mizpah and pursued the Philistines, etc. The apostles went out from Mizpah, that is, the watchtower of their peaceful way of life, pursued the impious by reproving them; and struck them from their ancient, that is, impious life, gradually removing them with the sword of the word, until they led them to the fellowship of the Church, which is founded upon Christ. For Bethcar, which is interpreted as the house of the lamb, or the house of recognition, certainly signifies him, who, having innocently died in humanity, powerfully reveals the paternal secrets in divinity. Upon which house of divine recognition he found a place of beloved residence, who said: “Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal life” (John VI). Which he desired to enter, who humbly knocking, asked: "Lord, show us the Father, and it suffices us" (John XIV). For they had learned from him because no one knows the Son, except the Father: nor does anyone know the Father, except the Son, and to whom the Son will reveal (Luke X). And therefore, rightly it is called the house of recognition, through whom he alone and the Father are revealed.
