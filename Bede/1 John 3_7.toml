It goes without saying that we can never be righteous in the same full way that God is righteous. The difference between Godâ€™s righteousness and ours is the difference between the face of a man and its image in a mirror. There is a certain resemblance, but the two substances are completely different. The comparison is not at all the same as the vague resemblance between the Father and the Son, because they share a common substance.
