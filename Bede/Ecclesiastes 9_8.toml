Tropology (that is, a moral manner of speech) has regard to the establishment and correction of manners, pronounced in words that are either plain or figurative; in plain words, as when John admonishes, saying, “My little children, let us love not in word or speech but in deed and in truth,” or in figurative words, as when Solomon said: “Let your garments be always white and let not oil be lacking on your head,” which is to say openly, “At all times let your works be pure and let not charity be lacking from your heart.”
