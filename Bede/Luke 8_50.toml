But when Jesus heard this, he answered the father of the girl, "Do not be afraid. Only believe, and she will be saved." The father of the girl is taken as the assembly of the doctors of the law, about whom the Lord said: The scribes and the Pharisees sit on Moses' seat (Matt. XXIII). If they themselves would believe, the synagogue subjected to them would also be saved.
