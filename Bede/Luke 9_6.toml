But they went out and went about the villages, preaching the gospel and healing everywhere. What the Apostles preached, or how they healed, Mark explains more fully. He says, they preached that people should repent, and anointed many sick people with oil, and healed them. James also says: Is anyone among you sick? Let them call the elders of the church to pray over them and anoint them with oil in the name of the Lord, and if they have sinned, they will be forgiven (Mark 6). Hence it is clear from the apostles themselves that this custom of the holy Church was handed down, that with the oil consecrated by pontifical blessing, the sick are anointed. They preached that people should repent; and above, He says, He sent them to preach the kingdom of God (1 Cor. 1). For evidently they preached both, according to the example of John the Baptist, or the Savior Himself: Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is near (Matt. 3). For to draw near to the gates of the heavenly kingdom is to repent of those five sins from which one had departed from God.
