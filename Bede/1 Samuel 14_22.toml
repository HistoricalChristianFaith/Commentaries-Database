Likewise, all the Israelites who had hidden themselves in Mount Ephraim, etc. It is rightly a matter of discretion that he who can, should strive for the Church by teaching or arguing against the reprobate, avoiding that prophetic curse: Cursed is he who withholds his sword from blood (Jer. XLVIII). But he who is not effective in teaching should hide himself in the height of a fruitful mind, lest he be found by the deceitful enemy to be stripped of his virtues. For there are those who are not suitable for discovering and overcoming the cunning of heretics and the other snares of the ancient enemy, but do not fail to follow and detest these when exposed by others according to their strength: and this is what it means when the Israelites who had previously hidden in Mount Ephraim, that is, fruitful, join themselves to their own ranks upon hearing that the Philistines have been put to flight: yet the Church is always saved not by its own effort, but by divine aid.
