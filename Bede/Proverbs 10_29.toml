The strength of the simple is the way of the Lord, etc. He says, If you cannot understand the hidden meanings of Scripture, do not despair of salvation, but walk in the way of the Lord, do the good things you know, and you will be counted among the strong. But those who scorn doing the right things they know ought to rightly tremble, because certain evils remain for them to suffer.
