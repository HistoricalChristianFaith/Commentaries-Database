And he asked them: What are you discussing among yourselves? And one from the crowd answered: Teacher, I brought my son to you, who has a mute spirit; and wherever it seizes him, it throws him down, and he foams, and grinds his teeth, and becomes rigid. And I spoke to your disciples to cast it out, and they could not. It is noteworthy that the places always correspond to the circumstances. On the mountain, the Lord prays, is transformed, and reveals to his disciples the secrets of his majesty. Descending to the lower parts, he is met by the crowd and struck by the tears of the wretched. Above, he unveils the mysteries of the kingdom to his disciples; below, he reproaches the sins of infidelity of the crowds. Above, he reveals the Father's voice to those who can follow him; below, he expels evil spirits from those who are tormented. He still continues to do so now according to the quality of merits, letting some ascend while ceaselessly descending for others. For those who are still carnal and beginners, he strengthens, teaches, and chastises, seeking the low places. But he glorifies the perfect, whose conversation is in heaven, by exalting them more highly, instructing them more freely about the eternal matters, and often teaching them things that cannot even be heard by the crowds. As for this demoniac whom the Lord cured when descending from the mountain, Mark indeed recounts him as being deaf and mute, but Matthew recalls him as being a lunatic. It signifies those of whom it is written: The fool changes like the moon. They never remain in the same state, changing now to these, now to those vices, and growing and diminishing. They are mute for not confessing the faith: deaf for not even hearing the word of truth. They foam while they waste away in folly. For it is of fools and the languid and the dull to send foam of saliva from the mouth. They grind their teeth when they blaze with the fury of anger. They become rigid when they languish in laziness and live weakly without the zealous pursuit of virtue. But what he said: And I spoke to your disciples to cast it out, and they could not, secretly blames the apostles, since the inability to heal sometimes pertains not to the weakness of those healing, but to the faith of those who are to be healed, as the Lord says: Let it be done to you according to your faith (Matt. II).
