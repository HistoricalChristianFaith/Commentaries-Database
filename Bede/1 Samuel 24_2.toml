Saul, however, taking three thousand chosen men, etc. Just as in a good sense the number three is usually placed for a certain mysterious grace, clearly designating those who are either glorious by the confession of the Holy Trinity, or devoted by faith, hope, and charity, or perfect in thought, speech, and action, or something of the sort; so also, when it is placed in an evil army, it not undeservedly denotes those who are found to do everything contrary. Therefore, in this place, the three thousand armed men with whom Saul sets out to persecute David and his men are to be mystically understood as those who, with a threefold battle array against the Lord and against His Christ, meditating vain things (Psalm II), that is, going in the counsel of the ungodly, standing in the way of sinners, and sitting in the seat of pestilence, have done everything contrary to the Blessed Man; those namely whose will is in the law of the Lord, and who will meditate in His law day and night. Saul also proceeds to search for David even upon the most abrupt rocks, which are accessible only to the ibexes, as he sets the snares of deception and treachery to the kingdom of the Jews against the Lord; even in his highest sayings, which remain scarcely comprehensible to perfect listeners alone. For the ibexes, which are small quadrupeds and know how to stay and give birth only on rocks, and if at any time they fall from the high peaks of rocks, they catch themselves unharmed with their horns, symbolize the humble listeners of the word of God, who, the more they perceive themselves to be of lesser merit, wisdom, and virtue, the more they seek strong refuges of the Holy Scriptures, in which they ought to dwell mentally and place the fruits of good works, as ibexes seek refuge among the rocks, and whatever temporal ruin befalls them, sustaining themselves on the testaments of heavenly words, they are saved as if by the reception of their horns. The Lord remembers this animal, and has marked how it is not contemptible in its figure, speaking mystically to the blessed Job: "Do you know the time when the ibexes give birth among the rocks?" (Job XXXIX).
