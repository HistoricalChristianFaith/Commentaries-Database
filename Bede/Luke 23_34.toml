But Jesus said: Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they do. Because Luke, through the type of the calf, intended to write of the priesthood of Christ, rightly with him the Lord both intercedes as a priest for his persecutors and opens the gate of paradise to the confessing thief by the same office. For it is not to be thought that he prayed to the Father in vain, but that in those who believed after his passion he obtained what he prayed for. It should be noted that he did not offer prayers for those who, driven by envy and pride, preferred to crucify Him whom they understood to be the Son of God rather than confess Him, but certainly for those who, having a zeal for God, but not according to knowledge (Rom. X), did not know what they did (Luke XXIII). But also, the Apostle John says: There is a sin unto death, I do not say that he should pray for it (I John V). Therefore, imitate your Lord, intercede for your enemies, and if you cannot yet do so, at least take care not to presume to pray against them. For thus, increased by daily progress, and at some time, with the Lordâ€™s help, you will reach that point, where you can even intercede for them.

Dividing his garments, they cast lots. And the people stood watching. This Evangelist John expounds more fully, because, namely, the soldiers divided the rest of the clothes into four parts, according to their number, but for the tunic which was seamless, woven from the top throughout, they cast lots. The divided garment of the Lord, however, symbolized his Church divided into four parts, spreading over the entire earth, which consists of four parts, and equally, that is, harmoniously distributed in all these parts. However, that tunic which was cast lots for signifies the unity of all parts, which is held together by the bond of charity. For if charity, according to the Apostle, both has a more excellent way, surpasses knowledge, and is above all commands (Ephes. III), rightfully the garment by which it is signified is indicated to be woven from above. But what is commended in the lot if not the grace of God? Thus, indeed, it came to all in unity through one, since the lot pleased all, and the grace of God reaches all in unity, and when a lot is cast, it is attributed not to any person's merit, but to the hidden judgment of God.
