Deliver those who are being led to death, etc. It can be taken mystically. Deliver those who are deceived by heretics, by preaching the correct faith, by showing the examples of good works, liberate those who are being led to destruction by living evilly with Catholics. But also, if you see those fallen or about to fall in the struggle of persecution, strive to restore them to life with diligent exhortation; if you see those perishing from hunger, if you see those freezing, refresh them by giving food and clothing.
