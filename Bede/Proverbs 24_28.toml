Do not be a witness without cause against your neighbor, etc. This also pertains to the cultivation of our field, that is, to the pursuit of good action, namely, not to harm an innocent neighbor with false testimony, not to give any sinner the confidence of sinning further by flattery; not to return evil for evil; for in this way, when you have first well composed outward actions, you will then reach to the cultivation of the purity of the inner man as well, and, as after the exercise of the field, you will begin to adorn and establish the habitation of the mind with pious thoughts. Because the reprobate neglect to do this, it is rightly added: I passed by the field of the lazy man, etc. To pass by the field and vineyard of the lazy and foolish is to see the life of any negligent person, which nettles or thorns fill, because in the heart of the negligent sprout itching earthly desires and the stings of vices. As it is written: Every slothful person is in desires. And the stone wall in the vineyard or field of the fool is broken down, when the beginnings of the defenses of virtues, deceived either by the wickedness of evil men or by the clever persuasion of unclean spirits, any negligent person loses.
