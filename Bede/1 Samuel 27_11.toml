David did not bring to life a man and a woman, etc. Christ forbids those converted to Him from living in sins. Just as first showing this to the teacher of His Church, He commands the multitudes of impure hearts, saying: Rise, Peter, kill and eat (Acts X). And Paul teaches that they are not dead to sin, but living to God in Christ Jesus (Ephesians II). But neither does He now command believers to undergo martyrdom or deaths for His name from the impious.
