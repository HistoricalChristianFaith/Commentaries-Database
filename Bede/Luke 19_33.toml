And as they were loosing the colt, its owners said to them: Why are you loosing the colt? For it had many owners, being not devoted to one doctrine and superstition, but wretchedly carried off to various and diverse errors of idols at the whim of unclean spirits, proceeding as it was led. Finally, it is said to be common by a certain vernacular Scripture custom that which is unclean, as also a voice from heaven says to Peter: What God has cleansed, you must not call common (Acts XI). Because he who is holy is God's alone and is shared with no one else. But he who is sinful and unclean belongs to many. For many demons possess him, and therefore he is called common.
