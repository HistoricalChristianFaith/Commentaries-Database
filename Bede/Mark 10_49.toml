And Jesus stood still and commanded him to be called. Here stands He who previously was passing by. In this matter, the Lord intimates something from which knowledge of His humanity and divinity can be usefully understood. For He heard the blind man crying out while passing by, but standing, He exhibited the miracle of illumination. And they called the blind man, saying to him, "Take heart; rise, He is calling you." The Lord calls the blind man crying out to Him, when to the people of nations desiring the knowledge of truth, He entrusts the word of faith through holy preachers. Truly, those who call the blind man, tell him to take heart, to rise, and come to the Lord. When preaching the word to the untaught, they tell them to have hope of salvation, to arise from the lethargy of vices, and to equip themselves for the pursuit of virtues by which they may merit illumination. Saying with the prophet: "Approach him and be enlightened" (Psalm 34); and again: "Arise, you who sleep, and rise from the dead, and Christ will illuminate you" (Ephesians 5). And because the early Church from the Gentiles was so fervent with the desire for the promised light in Christ, that many, having forsaken the world's resources, followed the evangelical life naked, in order to merit to have eternal treasure in heaven, it is rightly added about the blind man being illuminated:
