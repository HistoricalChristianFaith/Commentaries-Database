Nor will they say, "Look, here it is!" Because neither angels nor humans can observe when it will come, just as the time of the Lord's Incarnation, predestined by the most certain prophecies of the prophets, and declared by the proclamations of angels, so that his conception, birth, baptism, preaching, death, resurrection, and ascension to heaven were incessantly accompanied by signs from either angels or humans or certainly miracles.

Behold, the kingdom of God is within you. The Kingdom of God itself says it is placed within them, that is, in their hearts, where they believed it reigns. Hence it is written: The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart, that is, the word of faith we preach (Rom. X).
