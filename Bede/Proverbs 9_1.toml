Because it had spoken sufficiently of the divinity of Christ, it goes on to speak of the humanity he assumed. “Wisdom has built her house,” therefore, because the Son of God created the man whom he received into the unity of his person.“She has set up her seven pillars.” She erected churches throughout the world by the sevenfold grace of the Spirit to be his home, that is, the mystery of his incarnation, lest the memory for believing, worshiping and preaching be destroyed by the wickedness of the faithless, as though they remained together by supporting each other. Or at least the house of wisdom is the church of Christ, while the pillars are the doctors of the holy church filled by the sevenfold Spirit, such as James, Peter and John. Wisdom undoubtedly “raised up these pillars because it elevated the minds of preachers who were detached from love of the present age for the purpose of bearing the work of his church.”
