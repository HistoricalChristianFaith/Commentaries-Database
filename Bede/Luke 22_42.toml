Father, if you will, remove this cup from me. Nevertheless, not my will, but yours be done. He asks that the cup be removed from him, not out of fear of suffering, but out of mercy for the earlier people, that they may not drink the cup offered to them. Hence also, significantly, he did not say Remove the cup from me, but this cup, that is, of the people of the Jews, who cannot have the excuse of ignorance if they kill me, having the law and the prophets, who daily proclaim me. And yet, returning to himself, he confirms by the authority of the Son of God what he timidly held from the perspective of man.

Nevertheless, not my will, but yours be done. He says, not let this happen because I speak with human feeling, but because by your will I descended to earth. Therefore, he says, if it can be that the multitude of the Gentiles can believe without the destruction of the Jews, I refuse the passion. But if those are to be blinded so that all the Gentiles may see, not my will, Father, but yours be done. Alternatively: Approaching the passion, the Savior took up the voice of the weaklings in himself, saying: Father, if you are willing, remove this cup from me, and he took on their fear to remove it. And again, through obedience, showing the strength of mind, he said: Nevertheless, not my will, but yours be done. When something looms that we do not want to happen, let us thus ask through weakness that it not happen, so that through strength we may be ready that the will of our Creator be done even against our own will.
