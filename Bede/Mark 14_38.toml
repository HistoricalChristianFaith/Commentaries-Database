Watch and pray, that you may not enter into temptation. It is impossible for the human soul not to be tempted. Hence, in the Lord's Prayer we say: And lead us not into temptation (Matthew VI); which we cannot endure: not rejecting temptation entirely, but imploring the strength to withstand in temptations. Therefore, in the present, he does not say: Watch and pray, lest you be tempted, but, lest you enter into temptation. That is, lest the ultimate temptation overcomes you and ensnares you in its traps. For example, the martyr who shed his blood for the confession of the Lord was indeed tempted, but he was not entangled in the snares of temptation. However, he who denies falls into the snares of temptation.

The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak. This is said against the rash, who think they can achieve whatever they believe. Hence, as much as we trust in the ardor of the mind, so much should we fear the frailty of the flesh. But nevertheless, according to the Apostle, let us mortify the deeds of the flesh by the spirit. This passage is also against the Eutychians, who say there was one operation, one will in the mediator of God and men, our Lord and Savior. For when he says: The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak, he shows two wills: namely, the human, which is of the flesh, and the divine, which is of the deity. Where indeed the human, because of the weakness of the flesh, refuses suffering. But the divine will is most willing. For to fear in suffering is of human frailty; but to accept the dispensation of suffering is of divine will and virtue.
