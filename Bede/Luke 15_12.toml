He said: A certain man had two sons, and the younger of them said to his father: Give me a portion of the substance that falls to me. And he divided the substance to them. As the scribes and Pharisees murmured about the acceptance of sinners, the Savior set forth three parables in order, the first two of which, as discussed, suggest how much He Himself rejoices with the angels over the salvation of the penitent. The third, which follows, not only demonstrates His and His peopleâ€™s joy but also reproves the murmuring of the envious. The man who is said to have had two sons is understood as God the Father, the begetter of two peoples, and as the author and creator of the two branches of the human race. For the elder son signifies those who remained in the worship of one God; the younger, those who abandoned God up to idol worship. The portion of substance that falls to the younger son is the rational sense in man. For to live, to understand, to remember, to excel in keen ingenuity, is a gift of divine substance. The younger son seeks this from the father when man, delighted with his own power, sought to govern himself by free will and to shake off the dominion of the Creator. And He divided the substance to them, imparting to the faithful the protection of His grace, which they desired, and granting to the unfaithful only the benefit of natural wit, with which they were content.
