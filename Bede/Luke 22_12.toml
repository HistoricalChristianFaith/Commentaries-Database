And he will show you a large upper room furnished; prepare it there. And going, they found it as he had told them, and they prepared the Passover. The large upper room is the spiritual law that, moving out of the narrow confines of the letter, welcomes the Savior in a high place. For he who still observes the killing letter and understands nothing else in the lamb but the animal, undoubtedly celebrates the Passover below, because he does not yet comprehend the majesty of the spirit. But he who has followed the water bearer, that is, the herald of grace, into the house of the Church, this one, transcending the roof of the letter through the life-giving Spirit, prepares a dwelling for Christ in the high chamber of the mind, because he understands all the mysteries of the Passover or other decrees of the law written about him.
