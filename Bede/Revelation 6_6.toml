Beware, he says, lest by an evil example you offend your brother for whom Christ died, for he bears the signs of the sacred blood and the chrism. For whether one has perfect merit or very little, all who have been instructed in the church in the faith of the holy Trinity have been redeemed by the same perfect price of the blood of the Lord. Nor without reason is the perfection of faith or works expressed by the measure of two quarts and not just one, since both at bottom consist of a twofold charity.
