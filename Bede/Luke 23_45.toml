And the veil of the temple was torn in two. This happened as the Lord expired, as Matthew and Mark attest, but Luke relates it in advance. For, wishing to add miracle to miracle, when he had said "The sun was darkened," he immediately considered it appropriate to add: "And the veil of the temple was torn in two." The veil of the temple is torn, so that the secrets of the covenant and all the sacraments of the law, which were previously covered, may appear and be accessible to the nations. For it had been said before: "God is known in Judah, in Israel His name is great" (Psalm 76). But now: "Be exalted above the heavens, O God, and let your glory be over all the earth" (Psalm 57). And in the Gospel, he first said: "Do not go into the way of the Gentiles" (Matthew 10). But after the passion: "Go and teach all nations" (Matthew 28).
