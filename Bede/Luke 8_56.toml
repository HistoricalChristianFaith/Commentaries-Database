And his parents, he says, were amazed, and he commanded them not to tell anyone what had happened. The young man was raised outside the gate, with a large crowd accompanying and watching. Lazarus, called forth from the tomb, became so widely known to the people that due to the witness of those who saw it, many crowds met the Lord with palms, and many from among the Jews went away and believed in Jesus. The Lord recognized a fourth dead man, as informed by the disciple; but since there were no living ones to beseech the Lord for his rescue: "Let the dead bury their own dead," he said (Matt. 13); that is, let the wicked weigh down the wicked with harmful praises, and since there is no righteous person present to correct in mercy, let the sin of the sinner anoint their head.
