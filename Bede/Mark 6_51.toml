And they were even more astounded within themselves. For they had not understood about the loaves. For their hearts were hardened. Indeed, the Lord showed that he was the creator of things in the miracle of the loaves: and in walking upon the waves, he taught that he had a body free from all the heaviness of sins: and in calming the winds and subduing the rage of the waves, he demonstrated that he ruled over the elements. But the disciples, still cardinal, did not yet recognize this to be God. And indeed, they were astonished at the magnitude of His virtues: yet they were not yet able to recognize in Him the truth of divine majesty.
