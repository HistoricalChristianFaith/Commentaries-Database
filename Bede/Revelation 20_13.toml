He indicates that the bodies and the souls are to be brought together, the bodies from the earth and the souls from their own locations. By death he indicates those good souls who endured only the separation of the flesh but would not suffer punishment, while by hades he indicates the wicked souls. It is also possible to interpret this literally to mean that all bodies that the waves of the sea carried away or that the beasts had devoured would be resurrected. Tyconius interpreted the passage this way: “Those nations that he shall find here still living are the dead of the sea; while ‘death and hades gave up their dead’ refers to the nations that are dead and buried.”
