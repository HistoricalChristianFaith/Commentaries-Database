[The passage] is speaking of those who are not judged by God to be living. For this reason, it seems to me that those are correct who say that the open books above are the thoughts and deeds of each person that have been made known. However, the Book of Life is the foreknowledge of God, which cannot fail concerning those to whom eternal life will be given. They are written in this book, that is, they have been foreknown [by God].
