This black horse is the troop of false brothers, who have the balance of right confession but harm their fellows through works of darkness. For, when it is said in the midst of the living creatures, “Do not harm,” it is clear that there is someone who is doing harm. And, concerning this running horse, the apostle says, “Outside there are wars, inside there are fears.”
