The number of men of the people of Israel, sons of Phares, two, etc. After the catalog of leaders, consequently the number of the people; after the sum of the people has been counted, the ranks dedicated to God follow in order. However, he speaks of the people of Israel, the tribe of Judah and Benjamin, and whoever had escaped from the hands of the Assyrians of other tribes once; but, captured by the Babylonians with these, they had nonetheless been led into captivity. Finally, it must be noted that within the very series of the catalog, and especially where the same catalog is repeated in the second part of the book, that is, in the words of Nehemiah, nearly fifteen names of cities are listed, which, unless I am mistaken, are all found only in the tribe of Judah and Benjamin. Hence it is likely that the people of Israel should be understood here, primarily from these very tribes, together with the priests and Levites who had their lot among them. However, the Nethinim, who are described in order after the priests, Levites, singers, and gatekeepers, were themselves then those who are now called subdeacons in the Church, obedient to the duties of the Levites, and receiving offerings in the temple from the people. Furthermore, the sons of Solomon's servants were called the builders of the temple, who were responsible for repairing the sacred structures, or whatever had been damaged, and restoring them again from the sacred money. What we said above about the vessels must now be said about the people; that Scripture so diligently distinguishes how many from each generation of the captives returned to their homeland; in order that we might be reminded with how much certainty the Lord inscribes the sum of His elect in the book of life and, as it were, records them in the register of heaven, how many souls each of the faithful, either by preaching or showing the examples of good works, have converted from error; for each of whom He rewards those who converted them with a certain recompense.
