And Jeshua son of Jozadak rose up, with his brethren the priests, and Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel with his brethren, and they built the altar of the God of Israel, that they might offer holocausts upon it, as is written in the law of Moses the man of God. For they employed Jeshua and Zerubbabel as the masters for the work of divine worship. Both men, as we have said above, fulfil one and the same figure of our Lord and Saviour - Jeshua in view of his priesthood, Zerubbabel in view of his kingship, since the former descended from priestly stock, while the other descended from royal stock. Now the true king of Israel (i.e. of all 'who see God') is our Lord. He is also the true priest according to the order of Melchizedek - a priest because he cleanses us from our sins through the sacrificial offering of his body and even now, after his passion and ascension, intercedes for us at the right hand of the Father; a king because even in the present life he arms us for spiritual warfare and helps us to prevail and grants an everlasting kingdom in the future to those who win the battle.
