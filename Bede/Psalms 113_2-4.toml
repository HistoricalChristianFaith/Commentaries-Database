There [on Sinai], after all the legal decrees had been heard, the entire people answered with one voice, “We will hear and do all the words that the Lord has spoken.” Here [in the upper room], after the assembly of the church, which was being born, had received the enlightenment of the Spirit, they spoke of the wonders of God in the languages of all countries. Doubtlessly it was thanks to a certain discernment that the observance of the law was given to only one nation, that of the Jews, while the word of the gospel was to be proclaimed to all nations throughout the world, and that the proclamations of the Christian faith were to be spoken in the languages of all peoples, fulfilling the prophecy that says, “From the rising of the sun to its setting, praise the name of the Lord; the Lord is high above all nations.”
