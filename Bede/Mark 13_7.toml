But when you hear of wars and rumors of wars, do not be troubled. For such things must happen, but the end is not yet. Wars pertain to enemies, seditions to citizens. Both of these abounded abundantly from the time of the Lord's Passion among the people of the Jews, who chose a seditious robber for themselves instead of the Savior Christ. However, the apostles, as these events draw near, are warned not to be terrified, not to abandon Jerusalem and Judea, because evidently the end, which should rather be deferred until the fortieth year, namely the desolation of the province and the ultimate destruction of the city and temple, is to follow.
