Those whom it calls “kings” are the apostles and other saints, like the lawmakers and authors of both Testaments and the subsequent writers of the church. They have learned first how to rule themselves, and then the church that was put under their care. Those whom it calls “rulers” are governors and other powerful leaders of the faithful. But none of these would have anything were it not through wisdom, for he says, “Without me, you can do nothing.” –.
