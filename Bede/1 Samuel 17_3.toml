And the Philistines stood on the mountain on this side, etc. And even to this day, unclean spirits contending against the Church stand lifted up with proud boasting, after the example of that first proud one, of whom it is written in the Revelation of John: And as a great mountain burning with fire, it was cast into the sea (Rev. VIII). And the soldier of righteousness stands, not relying on his own arms, but exalted by His help, who says: A city set on a mountain cannot be hidden (Matt. III). And there was a valley between them; the place of their conflict is the temporal life itself, in which the good and the wicked fight among themselves, and the tree of life in the middle helps and refreshes the worthy, condemns and casts out the wicked; and that same life of the world is common, and the just pass through it, hoping in Christ as the highest mountain, with diligent mind, saying: But our conversation is in heaven (Phil. III). And the reprobates through the devil, by swelling up, despise the society of their neighbors and transcend. Against this the Apostle admonishes the faithful, saying: Be not wise in your own conceits, but condescend to men of low estate (Rom. XII). For the Philistines represent no less the perverse men than the angels, serving in the one and the same kingdom of the devil.
