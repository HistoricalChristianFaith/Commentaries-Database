Because the Lord had taught us notto offend those who believe on Him, He now as next in order warns us how much we should beware of those who offend us, that is, who by their words or conduct strive to drag us into the perdition of sin; wherefore He says, “And if thyhand offend thee, cut it off.”.
That is, He calls by the name ofhand, our intimate friend, of whose aid we daily stand in need; but if such anone should wish to do us a hurt in what concerns our soul, he is to be driven away from our society, lest by choosing a portion in this life with one who is lost, we should perish together with him in that which is to come. Wherefore there follows, “It is better forthee to enter into life maimed, than having two hands to enter into hell.”.
And as the worm is the pain which inwardly accuses, so the fire is a punishment which rages without us; or by the worm is meant the rottenness of hell, by the fire, its heat.
A friend is called a foot, on account of its service in going about for us, since he is as it were ready for our use. A friend who is useful, and anxious, and sharp in perception, is called an eye.
But because the Lord had three times made mention of the worm and the fire, that we might be able to avoid this torment, He subjoins, “For every one shall be salted with fire. "For the stink of worms always arises from the corruption of flesh and blood, and therefore fresh meat is seasoned with salt, that the moisture of the blood may be dried off, and so it may not breed worms. And if, indeed, that which is salted with salt, keeps off the putrefying worm, that which is salted with fire, that is, seasoned again with flames, on which salt is sprinkled, not only casts off worms, but also consumes the fleshitself.For salt means the sweetness of wisdom; and fire, the grace of the Holy Spirit. He says, therefore, “Every one shall be salted with fire,” because all the elect ought to be purged by spiritual wisdom, from the corruption of carnal concupiscence. Or else, the fire is the fire of tribulation, by which the patience of the faithful is proved, that it may have its perfect work.
We may also understand the altar tobe the heart of the elect, and the victims and sacrifices to be offered on the altar are good works. But in all sacrifices salt ought to be offered, for that is not a good work which is not purged by the salt of wisdom from all corruption of vain glory, and other evil and superfluous thoughts.
Or the good salt is the frequent hearing of God’s word, and the seasoning the hidden parts of the heart with the salt of spiritual wisdom. But if it be without saltness, that is, if its virtue of drying up and preserving be gone, with what shall it be salted?
