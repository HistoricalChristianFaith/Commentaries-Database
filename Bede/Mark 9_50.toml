Good salt. But if the salt becomes insipid, with what will you season it? It is good to hear the word of God more frequently, to season the secrets of the heart with the salt of spiritual wisdom, indeed to become the salt of the earth with the apostles themselves, that is, to suffice for the minds of those still wise in earthly matters to be saturated. But if someone, once restored by the seasoning of truth, returns to apostasy, by what other teacher is he corrected, who rejected the sweetness of wisdom he himself tasted, either terrified by the world or enticed by its prosperity? To him aptly fits the saying of the wise man: Who will heal the enchanter struck by the serpent? Certainly, by this opinion, Judas Iscariot and his companions are not unreasonably believed to be specially designated, who, corrupted by greed, did not hesitate both to lose the rank of apostleship and to betray the Lord. Yet, because there are some who, while greater knowledge elevates them, are separated from the fellowship of others, and as if the more they know, the more they depart from the virtue of concord, it is rightly added:

Have salt in yourselves, and have peace among yourselves. For by salt indeed is designated the wisdom of the word. Therefore, he who strives to speak wisely should greatly fear lest his eloquence confound the unity of listeners. For salt without peace is not a gift of virtue, but an increase of damnation. For the better one knows, the worse he sins. And hence without excuse he will deserve punishment, who prudently, if he willed, could have avoided sin.
