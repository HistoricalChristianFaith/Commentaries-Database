[Gregory says,] “When holy people deliver a curse as a sentence, they pronounce it not out of a desire for vengeance but out of a just consideration of the case. For they interiorly perceive God’s unerring judgment and recognize that they must smite with a curse the evils that arise exteriorly. And in the curse they do not sin insofar as they do not depart from their interior judgment. Since the one who pronounces the curse remains innocent, and at the same time the curse swallows up to the point of destruction the one who is cursed, we conclude from what happens to both parties that the sentence that has been delivered is hurled at the offender by the sole judge of that which is within.” So it is that in the present passage Simon, who received a curse from Peter, perished in eternal damnation, and below19 [we read that] Bar-Jesus, when he had been rebuked by Paul, was presently deprived of the light of day.
