I am black, etc. Black evidently from the adversity of oppressions, but beautiful in the comeliness of virtues; truly, the more beautiful in the sight of the internal judge, the more harassed and seemingly defiled by the greater oppressions of the foolish. However, the daughters of Jerusalem, to whom she speaks, are called souls imbued with heavenly sacraments, longing for the home of the heavenly homeland. For consoling these in her tribulations, the holy mother says: I am black, but beautiful, daughters of Jerusalem. As if she plainly says, Indeed, I appear very vile in the eyes of the persecutors; but before God, I shine gloriously in the confession of truth. Therefore, it does not behove you to be saddened in this exile of labors, who remember that you are citizens of the heavenly homeland, who hasten toward the vision of eternal peace through the adversities of the fleeting world.

Like the tents of Kedar, etc. Kedar was the son of Ishmael, of whom it was said: His hand against all, and the hand of all against him (Gen. XVII). The truth of which prophecy is proven today by the nation of the Saracens, who are hated by all and descended from him: and the Psalmist, besieged by afflictions, affirms this when he says: I have lived with those who dwell in Kedar, my soul has been a long-time sojourner. With those who hate peace, I was peaceful (Psal. CXIX). For neither is it read that David suffered any hatred from the Ishmaelites themselves; but wanting to exaggerate the evils he suffered from Saul or his other adversaries, he lamented that he was vexed by the wickedness of the nation, which never sought peace with anyone. On the contrary, Solomon was peaceful both in name and in life. Hence, as Scripture testifies, all the kings of the lands desired to see the face of Solomon, to hear the wisdom that God had given into his heart. Therefore, he says: I am black but beautiful, like the tents of Kedar, like the curtains of Solomon; it is distinguished thus: she is black as the tents of Kedar, beautiful as the curtains of Solomon. For the holy Church, often darkened by the afflictions of unbelievers, seems as if it were an enemy to the entire world, fulfilling the word the Lord said, And you will be hated by all because of my name (Matt. X). Thus, she is always beautiful in the sight of her Redeemer, as if truly worthy to be visited by the King of peace himself. And it should be noted that Kedar, by its very name, which signifies darkness, hints at either wicked men or unclean spirits. Just as Solomon, who is interpreted as peaceful, also indicates by the mystery of the name itself; of whom it is written, His empire will be multiplied, and peace will have no end; upon the throne of David and upon his kingdom, and so on (Isaiah IX). And when it is said that the Church is black like the tents of Kedar, it is placed not for truth, but for the estimation of the foolish, who think it provides a dwelling for vices or evil spirits within itself. But when it is called beautiful as the curtains of Solomon, it is placed as an example of truth, because, as Solomon was accustomed to make tents for himself out of the skins of dead animals, so the Lord gathers the Church for himself out of those animals who have learned to renounce carnal desires. Hence he said to all: If anyone wishes to come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me (Matt. XVI). And the Apostle says, Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth (Coloss. III). Some, reading this sentence thus, Black am I but beautiful, say that the Church is black in her carnal members or false brethren, like the tents of Kedar; but beautiful in her spiritual members, like the curtains of Solomon. But if we pay attention to what is written about the Lord, We saw him, and he had neither form nor beauty (Isaiah LIII); which was said not about his sin, for he had absolutely no sin, but about his passion, it is evident that the Church too, not because of sins or the vices of sinners, but because of her temptations and her sufferings, with which she is constantly exercised, claims to be black. This sense is affirmed also by the following words, when it is said:
