But he turned aside, etc. For this is what the Psalmist says: "Man approaches a deep heart, and God will be exalted" (Psalm 63). For the more the human heart, purified by faith and prayer, is lifted up to contemplate the glory of the divine vision, the more it finds what it seeks to be higher, and to which it should ascend at the time of the promised reward. Ecclesiastes is similar: "I have said, I will become wise; and it moved further away from me, and much more than it was" (Ecclesiastes 7). It should not be overlooked that he does not simply say, "I opened my door," but he says, "I opened the lock of the door for my beloved." For he had closed the chamber of his heart with a lock lowered deeply, so that no profane or insidious person might enter it, according to Solomon: "With all keeping, keep your heart; for from it flows life" (Proverbs 4). He opened it again for his beloved, so that, with all the impure throngs repelled, he might provide a free space for the Creator. Nor should it be considered contradictory that we said before, that the bride opens to her beloved in the droplets of night and the dewy cold, when the Church or the faithful soul ignites the heart of neighbors to the praise of the Creator, whom they did not know or did not care for, and now we interpret that she unlocks the lock of her door for the same beloved, in that she, through the progress of compunction, more widely opened her mind to his entrance: for the same moment achieves both, because the internal aspiration that sets anyone to gather souls for God equally kindles him to love the same Creator more ardently. And no other cause rightly motivates anyone to teach than the love of God. And while anyone delights in opening the soul of a neighbor to receive the gifts of divine mercy through teaching, he necessarily renews his own mind by these actions and opens it more widely to the entrance of heavenly grace. Finally, it is clearly revealed by the following words to the bridegroom how much she progressed, as she cared to open the hearts of neighbors, which she saw darkened, to the Lord, grievously enduring that he whom she was burning for was weighed down, as if by dewy cold and drops of night, by the infidel torpor of others. For it follows:

My soul melted, etc. The sweeter, he says, that I received the voice and proximity of my beloved through the aperture of secret compunction, the more sublimely whatever coldness was in me heated up; whatever was rigid, melted; so much so that I found nothing sweet except to be resolved into tears; and he whom I was unable to retain, though touched by his grace at a moment, I now delight to seek in his departure with weeping and lamentation. And this also, while I was melting from my former rigidity and pouring out my soul within me, gave me no small increase: seeing how the charity of many grows cold, as he himself complains, that it is beset by the drops of the night, that is, the dark tumults of the wicked. And because the wicked have destroyed his law, therefore I have taken more care to love his commandments above gold and topaz.

I sought him, and did not find him, etc. This is the voice of those in the holy Church who are accustomed, having transcended the care of fleeting things, to walk only in the highest goods and to always love the entrance to the heavenly homeland: about whom there is no doubt that they cannot always be affected by the same power of sweetness with the desire for heavenly things as they will, because certainly this virtue is not in the will of the mind elevated to heavenly things, but only in the gift of the God who elevates and illuminates. Therefore, as often as the chaste soul either desires to depart to the Lord, or, while placed in the flesh, to be raised by the taste of future beatitude, and yet immediately does not obtain what it seeks, it must then say with a groan: Because I sought him, and did not find him; I called, and he did not answer me. For he is always found by those who seek well, to have mercy; he always responds to those who call well, to care for them for perpetual salvation: but he does not always respond to this end, or offer himself to be found, that what he promises to those arriving in the homeland, he extends to those still journeying on the road of this exile. Finally, let us say more often daily with bowed knee to the Father: Thy kingdom come; nor do we distrust that we are heard, nor do we immediately receive what we ask for, but we patiently and joyfully endure the effect of our prayer, until we obtain it at the end.
