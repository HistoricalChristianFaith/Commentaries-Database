He who works his land, etc. Who exercises his soul with spiritual studies will now be satisfied with virtues and then with the feasts of rewards. But he who refuses to labor for the salvation of his soul, will then be numbered among the foolish; even though now he may seem glorious with either divine or human wisdom.
