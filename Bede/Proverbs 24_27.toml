Prepare your work outside, etc. What is it to diligently cultivate the field with prepared labor, except to root out the thorns of iniquities and perfect our action for the fruit of retribution? And what is it to return to building the house after cultivating the field, if not that we often learn from good works how much purity of life we ought to establish in thought? For he builds well the house of the mind, who first clears the field of the body of the thorns of vices, lest, if the thorns of desires advance in the field of the flesh, the whole structure of virtues inside be destroyed as the famine of good increases.
