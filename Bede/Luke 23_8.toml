But Herod, seeing Jesus, was very glad. For he had wanted to see him for a long time, because he had heard many things about him, and he hoped to see some sign done by him. But he questioned him with many words, and he answered him nothing. He was silent and did nothing, because neither did his cruelty deserve to see divine things, and the Lord avoided boasting. And perhaps all the impious are signified in Herod, who, if they do not believe in the law and the prophets, cannot see the wonderful works of Christ in the Gospel.
