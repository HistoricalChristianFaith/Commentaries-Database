He who troubles his own house will inherit the wind, etc. He who does not fear his mind to be disturbed by the tumult of great thoughts, indeed opens it to the blasts of evil spirits by which it may be overwhelmed. And he who foolishly persecutes the wise, by this ruling over him serves him, because by pressing his patience, he makes him more approved, so that he evidently rewards the prize for which he strived, despite being condemned himself.
