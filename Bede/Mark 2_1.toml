And again he entered Capernaum, etc. The Savior of all, God, with saving step, surveys all things. And sometimes in deserts, now in the city, now by the sea, he ministers to the crowds the gifts of heavenly doctrine and virtues. Sometimes he alone prays on the mount, sometimes he assists those laboring at sea so that they may not perish. Everywhere, he imparts the gifts of salvation, so that he demonstrates all ranks and conditions pertain to his grace. According to the mystical understanding, after performing a miracle in the city, he withdraws to the desert, and there receives the crowds coming to him with kind piety, to show that he prefers a quiet life, remote from the cares of the world, and, due to this pursuit, takes care to heal bodies. Indeed, in a human manner, as if avoiding the crowd seeking him, he did not want to enter the city openly. But allegorically, it teaches that truth does not exhibit an open manifestation of itself to tumultuous carnal minds, but generously infuses the light of its gifts to those whom it sees to be detached from the allurements of temporal things. Yet because heavenly piety does not forsake even the carnal, but also grants them the grace of its visitation, through which also they may become spiritual, the Lord returns to the city after the desert: speaking the word to many converging there, and by healing the paralytic, he provides many the occasion for internal healing which is in faith. Now, teaching the Lord and the house being so full that they didn't have room, not even at the door, specifically designates our salvation who have come to faith from the Gentiles, that when the Lord preached in Judea, we were not yet able to enter to hear. But to us, nonetheless being outside, he made the words of his doctrine arrive, because he himself collected us through the mouths of holy preachers, and although found outside the synagogue where he preached, made us participants of his Gospel. And they came carrying a paralytic to him, because he was carried by four. The healing of this paralytic designates the salvation of a soul after a long inertia of carnal allure desiring Christ, which first of all needs ministers who uplift it and bring it to Christ, i.e., good teachers who suggest hope of healing and aid of intercession. They are rightly said to have been four, either because the strength of all preaching and every word is established by the four books of the holy Gospel, or because there are four virtues by which the confidence of the mind is raised to deserve health. Of these is said in the praise of eternal wisdom: "For she teacheth temperance and prudence, justice and courage, which are such things as men can have nothing more profitable in life" (Wisdom VIII). Some call them prudence, fortitude, temperance, and justice by different names. And when they could not bring him in through the crowd, they uncovered the roof where he was. They desire to offer the paralytic to Christ, but being obstructed on all sides by the crowd, they are shut off because often the soul, after the laziness of a sick body and desiring to be renewed by the remedy of heavenly grace, is hindered by the obstacle of ancient habit. Often even within the delights of secret prayer, and as it were sweet conversation with the Lord, a crowd of thoughts intervening obstructs the keenness of mind so that Christ is not seen. And what is to be done amid these things? Certainly not to remain below outwardly where the crowds rage, but ascend to the roof of the house where Christ teaches, that is, the loftiness of Sacred Scripture must be sought, and the law of the Lord meditated upon day and night as the Psalmist says. In what does the young man correct his way? In keeping your words, he says (Ps. 119). And uncovering it, they let down the bed on which the paralytic lay. When the roof is uncovered, the sick man is laid down before Jesus, because, with the mysteries of the Scriptures opened, one comes to the knowledge of Christ, that is, descends to his humility with the piety of faith. And indeed the house of Jesus is found covered with tiles according to another evangelist's narrative, because under the contemptible covering of letters, if there is one who uncovers, the virtue of spiritual grace will be found. The uncovering of the tiles in the house of Jesus is the revelation in the vileness of the letter of the spiritual sense and heavenly secrets. What indeed is laid down with the bed signifies that Christ ought to be known by man still constituted in this flesh.
