A wise man will hear and become wiser. Since Solomon was a lover of wisdom, who, having the option given to him, sought and received wisdom, he fittingly begins his Parables with wisdom. But when it is said: A wise man, when he hears the word, becomes wiser, it shows that no one in this life can become so wise that their wisdom cannot be increased, and it is always the custom of wise people to listen to the sayings of their elders, and sometimes even those younger than themselves; whatever utility they hear in them, they apply to themselves and remember in their heart. Indeed, a lesser wise man heard a greater one, the Queen of Sheba heard Solomon, and returned wiser (3 Kings 10). Moses heard his much lesser father-in-law, and he became more elevated and wiser (Exodus 18). The disciples heard Christ and were deemed worthy to receive the spirit of wisdom. Nicodemus heard, Gamaliel heard, and his disciple, then Saul, now the Apostle Paul, heard. Truly wise men heard the word of the Gospel and were made wiser. When Paul was caught up to the third heaven and heard unspeakable words which it is not lawful for a man to utter (Acts 22), nonetheless, he returned to earth saying: For we know in part, and we prophesy in part; but when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away (1 Corinthians 13).

And he who understands will possess governance. Let no one boast about their knowledge because if anyone often neglects to hear and understand the words of the wise, they do not know how to properly govern their life. How much more can such a person not be appointed to anotherâ€™s governance, who has despised subjecting themselves to paternal discipline! Therefore, he says, Hearing, the wise man will be wiser, referring to the knowledge of things that are known through wisdom; and when he adds, And he who understands will possess governance, it pertains to the rectitude of life that is learned or taught through the same wisdom. And the beginning of Proverbs beautifully matches the beginning of the title, which reads, The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel, for gaining wisdom and discipline.
