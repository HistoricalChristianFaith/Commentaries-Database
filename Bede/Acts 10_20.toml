He was ordered to descend from the roof and to go to preach in order to show that the church should not only watch for the Lord by climbing to the heights, but, returning to the active life as if rising from its bed, it should preach this same Lord to all the lowliest and to those still situated outside, as it were, but [who are] nevertheless knocking at the door of Simon, that is, at the door of obedience. As the Lord said, “You will see heaven opened and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man.” It is well that it is mentioned that Peter’s house was situated by the seashore, for the sea designates the wave-tossed tumults and frenzies of the world, where greedy people pursue and devour each other like voracious fish. The saints’ “way of life is in heaven,” and although “the earthly house in which they dwell may be destroyed, they have a building from God, an eternal house in heaven not made by human hands.”
