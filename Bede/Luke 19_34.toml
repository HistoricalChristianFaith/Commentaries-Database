But they said: Because the Lord has need of him. And they brought him to Jesus. Those who had resisted the loosing of the colt, upon hearing the name of the Lord, became quiet, for the masters of errors who opposed the teachers of the salvation to the Gentiles, defended their darkness until the power of the true possessor and Lord shone through with miracles to back it up. But after the power of the dominical faith appeared, with the complaints of the adversaries giving way all over, the liberated congregation of believers, carrying God in their heart, is brought forward.
