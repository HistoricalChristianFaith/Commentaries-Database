Will they be able to build with the stones out of heaps of dust, burned as they are? For burnt stones from heaps of dust are used for building and replaced in the work of the holy city when either those who have been conquered by the fire of persecutions and have denied the faith, or those who have been subdued by the pleasures of sins and have lost the purity of good works, regain their senses through the Lord's mercy so that by steadfast profession they may reacquire the integrity of the catholic faith and, once they have amended their ways, may obtain the adornments of the virtues.
