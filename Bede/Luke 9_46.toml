But a thought entered among them about who was the greatest among them. Because they had seen Peter, James, and John being taken up the mountain separately, and believed some mystery was revealed to them there; and also because the keys of the kingdom of heaven had been promised to Peter earlier, and that the Church was to be built upon him, they thought either these three were preferred over the others, or among all the apostles, Peter was preeminent. There are those who think this thought was stirred in the disciples by the fact that the Lord, according to Matthew, took a coin from the mouth of a fish and gave it to those who collected the tribute for himself and Peter, as if implying that they were superior to the others, since Peter was equated with the Lord in the obligation to pay the tribute. However, a diligent reader will find this question among them happened even before the tribute coin was collected. Matthew records this event in Capernaum. But Mark says: "And they came to Capernaum. When they were in the house, he asked them, 'What were you discussing on the way?' But they were silent. For on the way they had argued with one another about who was the greatest" (Mark IX). Whether this was the occasion or some other, or both, possibly prompted, Jesus, seeing their thoughts and understanding the causes of their error, wants to heal their desire for glory with the remedy of humility.
