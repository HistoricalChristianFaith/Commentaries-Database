“There was also a porch in front of the temple, twenty cubits in length to correspond with the width of the temple.” It had a door opposite the door of the temple and was ten cubits deep, facing the east. This porch represents the people belonging to holy church who precede the time of our Lord’s incarnation, yet were not empty of faith in his incarnation. This is [the meaning of] the door of the porch opposite the door of the temple, facing the east—that the faith of the people in Christ before his coming was the same as that of those who came after his arrival and that the hearts of all the faithful are illumined by the same light of the grace of the Orient.
