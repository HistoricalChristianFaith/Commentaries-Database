The Epicureans, following the stupidity of their teacher, put the happiness of humanity in the pleasure of the body alone, while the Stoics placed it solely in the virtue of the mind. Although indeed they disagreed with each other, they nevertheless were united in opposition to the apostle with respect to [his belief that] a human being subsists in soul and body. Thus he taught that [one] ought to be happy in both [body and soul] but that this will not be achieved in the present time or by human power but by the grace of God through Jesus Christ in the glory of the resurrection.
