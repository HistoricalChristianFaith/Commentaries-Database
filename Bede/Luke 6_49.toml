But he who has heard and not done is like a man building his house upon the earth without a foundation. The house of the devil, the world which is placed in the wicked one, is called not by the dignity of the Creator but by the magnitude of the delinquent. He builds it upon the earth because he drags those who obey him from the heavens to the earthly. He builds without a foundation because every sin does not have a foundation, so that it does not subsist by its own nature. For evil truly is without substance, which however in some way exists, coalesces in the nature of the good. Since the foundation is truly said to be from the bottom, we can also not unreasonably take the foundation as placed for the bottom. Just as hearing is said from the ear, and yet often the very ear itself is designated by the name of hearing. Therefore, just as he who sinks into a well is held by the bottom of the well, so the soul, as if it were standing in a certain place at the bottom when falling, would, if once fallen, retain itself in some measure of sin. But since it cannot be content with the sin in which it slips, while it is daily cast into worse, it does not find a bottom in the well into which it has fallen, as is figured. Hence it is well said elsewhere: When the wicked man has come into the depths of evils, he despises (Prov. XVIII). For he feigns to return because he despairs that he can be shown mercy. But when he sins more by despairing, he, as it were, removes the bottom from his well, lest he might find where he could be held. Therefore, he who hears the words of Christ and does not do them, whether initiated into the mysteries of Christ or wholly alien from Christ, because he builds himself badly, is like a foolish man of whom it is said: An enemy has done this (Matt. XIII).

Into which the river crashed, and immediately it fell. And the ruin of that house was great. It is clear that with the onset of any temptation, both the truly wicked and the falsely good soon become worse, until at last they slip into eternal punishment. Moreover, it should be said morally that each person is tempted by their own lust, drawn away and enticed. Then, when lust has conceived, it gives birth to sin. And sin, when it is full-grown, brings forth death. Also, the extreme judgment at the last day can be understood through the rush of the river, when, both houses having been completed, all who exalt themselves shall be humbled, and those who humble themselves shall be exalted; and the wicked shall go, not only people but also angels who belonged to the devilâ€™s house, into everlasting punishment, but the righteous into eternal life (Matthew 25).
