However, woe to you who are rich, for you have received your consolation. The fact that woe will come to the rich is better understood by contrast, where it is said that the kingdom of God belongs to the poor. Those who seek consolation here in every way alienate themselves from that kingdom, hearing from the just judge: "Children, remember that you received good things in your lifetime" (Luke 16). It should be noted here that it is not so much the riches, but the love of riches that is at fault. For not everyone who has riches, but as Ecclesiastes says: "Those who love riches will not benefit from them" (Eccl. 5), because those who do not know how to disdain temporal things or to give them to the poor, indeed delight in their use for the present, but will lack the benefit that could be obtained by giving in the future. And elsewhere we read: "Blessed is the rich person who is found without blemish, who has not gone after gold, nor hoped in money and treasures" (Eccl. 31).
