And when he had entered into the house from the crowd, his disciples asked him about the parable. And he said to them: Are you also without understanding? What had been said openly, and was clear to hear, the apostles thought was spoken in a parable, and in a manifest matter they seek a mystical understanding. And they are reproved by the Lord for thinking that what was spoken plainly was said as a parable. From this we observe that it is a fault of the listener who wishes to understand clearly spoken matters obscurely or obscure matters clearly.
