Wherefore girding the loins of your mind, etc. Because it is promised to you, he says, that you shall see the revelation of Jesus Christ after this life, which angels now see, the greater the grace promised to you, the more diligently you ought to strive to be worthy to receive it. He girds the loins of his mind, who also restrains it from wandering thoughts. And rightly he says: Hope for the grace which is given to you in the revelation of Jesus Christ, because he who with girded loins of mind, that is, chaste in mind and body, awaits the Lord's coming, rightfully, when He is revealed, hopes. For he who does not know how to please the Lord, rightfully, in the hope of good things, fears lest they come sooner in the flesh.
