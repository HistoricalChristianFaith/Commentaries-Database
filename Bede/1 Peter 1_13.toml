You must do this, Peter says, because you have been promised that you will see the revelation of Jesus Christ, which the angels now look upon, after your death. The greater the grace which has been promised to you is, the more you ought to make sure that you are worthy to receive it. You must be pure and chaste in your minds, waiting for the Lord to come, for if someone is unable to please God now, it is certain that he will not receive the reward promised to the righteous when Christ comes again.
