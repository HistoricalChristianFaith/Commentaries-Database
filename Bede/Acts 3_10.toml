And they were filled with wonder and amazement. Another Edition for amazement, which is a state of being beyond one's mind, does not properly place ‘admiration’; because greater amazement sometimes leads the mind to a state beyond, and transfers it to higher modes of thought beyond the usual manner of thinking.
