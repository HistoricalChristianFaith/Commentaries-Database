The proof of love is found in the works that we do. We truly love God if we bend our wills to his commandments, for whoever runs after his own illicit desires does not love God, because he contradicts that love in his own will. God’s commands are not onerous, for Christ himself said: “My yoke is easy and my burden is light.”
