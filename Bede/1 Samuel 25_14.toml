But one of the young men told Abigail, Nabal's wife, etc. When the chiefs of the Jews scorned the word of faith, the unity of Christ's disciples announced to the synagogue subject to them, saying: Behold, Jesus Christ sent apostles, namely messengers of truth, instructed in the divine Scriptures, to command eternal blessing to our elders, and they rejected them. These men, that is, Christ's apostles, were good apostles, were good enough for us by preaching the heavenly kingdom; and not troublesome, by imposing the burdens of the law on our necks anymore. Nor did anything ever perish of what we established during all the time we lived in their faith, living in deserts from the allurements of the world, and in a quasi-solitary life. At all times, I say, whether observing the rites of the law still, or celebrating the mysteries of the revealed and proclaimed grace, whoever joined themselves to the faith of Christ were saved from all destruction. They were helpful to us in teaching, both in investigating the obscure parts of the Scriptures, and in plainly bringing forth the clear ones, all the days in which we instructed our listeners according to their truly evangelical understanding.
