Therefore, Zacharias enters the temple because it is the duty of priests to enter the sanctuary of God and to understand the deep mysteries of the heavens. The multitude prays outside, because they cannot penetrate the secrets and mysteries, they must humbly attend to the teachings of the more learned. But while Zacharias places incense on the altar, he learns of the birth of John; for while teachers burn with a greater flame of divine reading, they find that the grace of God through Jesus Christ is to come and emerge from within the depths of scriptures, as from the womb of Elizabeth. And this rightly through an angel, because the law is ordered by angels in the hand of a mediator.
