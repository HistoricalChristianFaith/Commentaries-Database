And let him who hears say, "Come." Whoever has received the inner light of faith or charity in his mind, let him call others to the same.

Let him who thirsts come. Whoever desires, let him take the water of life freely. Thus free will is addressed by saying, "Whoever desires, let him take," so that grace is immediately proclaimed in what follows: "the water of life freely." Certainly without any preceding merits. For even the desire itself is a gift of God.
