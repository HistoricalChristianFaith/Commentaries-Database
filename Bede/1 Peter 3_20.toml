By pointing out that only eight people were saved from the flood, Peter reminds us that in comparison to the large numbers of Jews, heretics and unbelievers which there are in the world, the number of God’s chosen ones is very small. As Jesus said: “The gate is narrow and the way is hard that leads to life, and those who find it are few.”
