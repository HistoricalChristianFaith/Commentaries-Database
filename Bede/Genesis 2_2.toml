On the seventh day God rested from all his works, and sanctified and blessed it; and the seventh age is eternal rest in another life, in which God rests with his saints in eternity after the good works, which He accomplished in them throughout the six ages of this world. However, this age of the height of peace and rest in God, is and will be everlasting; but then it begins for mankind, when the proto-martyr Abel with his body entered the rest of the tomb, but with his soul [entered] the joy of eternal life. There that rich man saw the poor man resting, while he himself was twisted in hell [reference to ‘Dives and Lazarus’].This  sabbath of the holy souls will last until the end of the age; and when the last age of the world, after its evening about which we have already spoken, will have attained its end when the Antichrist has been killed by the Lord Jesus, then also that sabbath [rest] will be granted to the bodies rising to life eternal with greater blessing and sanctity. And therefore indeed it is right that no evening [is said to] follow the seventh day, because the way in which the seventh day was ended, it will not have sadness; indeed, rather it will be perfected by the greater happiness, so we have said, of the eighth age, which indeed, beginning then by the glory of the resurrection, when the whole of this life will have passed over, without any end, with no changeableness of things, will be transformed by contemplation of the face of God.
