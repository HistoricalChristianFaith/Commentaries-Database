Now the cause of the centurion's wonder is clear, that seeing that the Lord died in that way, that is, sent forth His Spirit, he said, “Truly this man was the Son of God.” For no one can send forth his own spirit, but He who is the Creator of souls.
He means by James the Less, the son of Alphaeus, who was also called the brother of our Lord, because he was the son of Mary, our Lord’s mother’s sister, whom John mentions, saying, “Now there stood by the cross of Jesus His mother and His mother’s sister, Mary ofCleophas, and Mary Magdalene.” And he seems to call her Mary of Cleophas,from her father or some relation. But he was called James the Less, to distinguish him from James the Great, that is, the son of Zebedee, who was called amongst the first of the Apostles by our Lord. Further, it was a Jewish custom, nor was it thought blamable after the manners of an ancient people, that women should furnish to teachers food and clothing out of their substance. Wherefore there follows: “Who also when Hewas in Galilee followed Him, and ministered unto Him. "They ministered unto the Lord of their substance, that He might reap their carnal things whose spiritual things they reaped, and that He might show forth a type for all masters, who ought to be content with food and clothing from their disciples. But let us see what companions He had with Him, for it goes on: “And many other women which came up with Him into Jerusalem.”
