And the angel answered him, saying: I am Gabriel, who stands in the presence of God, and I have been sent to speak to you and to bring you this good news. And behold, you will be silent and unable to speak until the day these things come to pass, because you did not believe my words. It should be understood that if a man were to promise such things, it would be permissible to demand a sign with impunity; but since it is an angel who promises, it no longer becomes appropriate to doubt. And he gives a sign that is requested, so that he who spoke in disbelief may now learn to believe by remaining silent. It is to be noted here that the angel declares that he stands before God and has been sent to announce the good news to Zechariah. Because even when angels come to us, they fulfill their ministry outwardly, yet they are never absent inwardly through contemplation. And so they are both sent and present, because although an angelic spirit is circumscribed, the highest spirit himself who is God is not circumscribed. Therefore, angels are both sent and stand before Him, because whenever they come sent, they run within Him.
