Remove the impiety from the face of the king, etc. Remove the impiety of persecuting Christians from the mind of Saul, or of any other zealots of the law, and when they begin to preach Christ, the justice of their doctrine will be established, which impiety previously drove to their ruin, as long as, opposing the justice of God, they strove to put their own first. Again, remove the impiety from the face of the king, and his throne will be established in justice. For those who rule over the people, if they want their throne to be firm, must always show faces full of cheerfulness and grace, lest, becoming more rigid through arrogance, they fall into the murmuring of the people.
