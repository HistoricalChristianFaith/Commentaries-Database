[The four angels] refer to the four principal kingdoms, namely, that of the Assyrians, of the Persians, of the Greeks and of the Romans.… Suffocating in some way all things by their might, these angels did not allow anyone to breathe freely of his own right. By “the earth” is indicated the various provinces, in “the sea” the various islands, and among “the trees” the various qualities and conditions of people. Another interpretation: These four angels are to be understood as those very four winds of which Daniel speaks in his prophecy: “Behold, the four winds of heaven stirred up the great sea, and the four beasts came up from the sea.”
