[God] said, “And you shall not call your wife Sarai but Sarah,” that is, “You shall not call her ‘my ruler’ but ‘ruler.’ ” [This change teaches] clearly that since she had become a companion and sharer of such great faith, he should call her [by a name that expressed what] he understood her to be: not exclusively the ruler of his own house but ruler absolutely, that is, the parent of all rightly believing women.

When a son was promised from Sarah, the names of the parents are also changed, everything resonates with newness, and the New Testament is foreshadowed in the Old. Sarai is interpreted as "My Princess," but Sarah as "Princess," and the reason for the change of the name is this: because she was previously called "My Princess," that is, the mother of one household only, but afterwards she is called "Princess" absolutely; for it follows:
