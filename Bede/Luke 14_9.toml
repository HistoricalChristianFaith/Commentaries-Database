Lest perhaps someone more honorable than you has been invited by him, and the one who invited both him and you comes and says to you, "Give this man your place," and then you begin with shame to take the lowest place. He gives place to the one invited after, who, made more secure by the confidence of his long conversation, is surpassed by the swiftness of those who have followed Christ. And with shame, he holds the lowest place when, recognizing better things in others, he humbles whatever high thoughts he had of his own works, saying with the Prophet, "I am poor and in labor from my youth, yet having been exalted, I am humbled and confounded" (Psalm LXXIII).
