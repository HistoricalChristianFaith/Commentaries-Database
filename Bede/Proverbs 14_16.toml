The wise man fears and departs from evil, etc. Just as it is foolish to trust in one's own eagerness and wish to leap a fast river or a wider abyss, but wise to turn to a plain or bridge, so he who avoids sins as much as possible, fearing he may be involved in evils, is wise. But that man is foolish who sins with disdain, flattering himself that either he will repent of his actions at a later time, or if he suddenly dies, that he will bravely endure the punishments of hell.
