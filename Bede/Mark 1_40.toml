And there came to him a leper beseeching him, etc. Concerning this leper who was cleansed, it connects that he should be understood as the one whom Matthew mentions as being cleansed when the Lord came down from the mountain after that discourse. For thus Matthew says: When he had come down from the mountain, great crowds followed him (Matt. VIII). And behold, a leper came and worshipped him, saying: Lord, if you will, you can make me clean, etc. And because the Lord said: I have not come to destroy the law, but to fulfill it (Matt. V), he who was excluded by the law, presuming to be cleansed by the power of the Lord, judged that grace exists not from the law but above the law, which could wash away the stain of the leper. However, just as the authority of power is declared in the Lord, so in him is the constancy of faith. He fell on his face, which is an act of humility and shame, as everyone should be ashamed of the blemishes of his life; but shame did not suppress confession. He showed his wound, requested a remedy, and it is a confession full of religion and faith. If you will, he says, you can make me clean. He attributed the power to the will of the Lord. But concerning the will of the Lord, he did not doubt not as one incredulous in piety but as one conscious of his own foulness, he did not presume. However, Jesus, moved with compassion, stretched forth his hand and touched him, and said to him: I will, be clean. And when he had said it, immediately the leprosy departed from him, and he was cleansed. There is nothing intermediate between the work of God and the command, because the work is in the command. Finally, he spoke, and they were made (Ps. XXXII). You see, therefore, that it cannot be doubted that the will of God is power? Therefore, if his will is power, they who assert the unity of will, assuredly assert the unity of power. Therefore, as one who has the power of healing, and the authority of commanding, he does not avoid the testimony of working. For he says 'I will' because of Photinus, he commands because of Arius, he touches because of Manichaeus. And indeed the law prohibits touching lepers; but since the Lord is the lawgiver, he does not obey the law but makes the law. Therefore, he did not touch because he could not cleanse without touching, but to prove that he was not subject to the law. He did not fear contamination as humans do, but because he could not be defiled who was liberating others, the leprosy flees at the touch of the Lord, which used to contaminate the one touching. Together with this wonder, he healed in the same manner in which he had been entreated. If you will, you can make me clean. He says, I will, be clean. You have the will, you also have the effect of piety. Therefore, (contrary to what many Latins think) it should not be joined and read "I will to make you clean," but separated, so that first he says 'I will', then he commands, 'be clean.'
