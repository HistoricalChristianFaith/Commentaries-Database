Therefore Jonathan spoke good of David to his father Saul, etc. The apostles spoke good of Christ to the Jews, recalling him as a man approved by God among them in the powers and signs and wonders which God had done through him in their midst; who not only could not be accused of sin, but also, being diligent in virtues, went around all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the Gospel of the kingdom, and healing every sickness and every infirmity.
