As the time of His Passion approached, the Lord wished to approach to the place of His Passion, in order to intimate that He underwent death of His own accord: wherefore it is said, "And Jesus entered into Jerusalem, and into the temple.” And by His going to the  temple on first entering the city, He shows us beforehand a form of religion, which we are to follow, that if by chance we enter a place, where there is a house of prayer, we should first turn aside to it.We should also understand from this, that such was the poverty of the Lord, and so far was He from flattering man, that in so large a city, He found no one to be His host, no abiding place, but livedin a small country place with Lazarus and his sisters; for Bethany is a hamlet of the Jews. Wherefore there follows: “And when He had looked round about upon all things, (that is, to see whether any one would take Him in,) and now the eventide was come, He went out into Bethany with the twelve.”Nor did He do this once only, but during all the five days, from the time that He came to Jerusalem, to the day of His Passion, He used always to do the same thing; during the day He taught in the temple, but at night, He went out and dwelt in the mount of Olives. It goes on, “And on the morrow, when they were come from Bethany, He was hungry.”.
Farther, He looks round about upon the hearts of all, and when in those who opposed the truth, He found no placeto lay His head, He retires to the faithful, and takes up His abode with those who obey Him. For Bethany means, the house of obedience.
