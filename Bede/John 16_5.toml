It is as if he were clearly saying, “By my ascension I shall return to him who determined that I was to become incarnate. And so great and so evident will be the honor of this ascension that there will be no need for any of you to ask where I am going, since all of you will see that I am on my way to heaven.” But it is good that when he had said regarding his ascension, “I am going to him who sent me,” he added, “And none of you asks me, ‘Where are you going?’ ” Earlier on, when he was testifying publicly about his passion and saying, “You are not able to come where I am going,” Peter questioned him saying, “Lord, where are you going?” He received the answer, “Where I am going you cannot follow me now, but [you will follow me] later on.” This was undoubtedly because they were not yet able to understand, not yet able to imitate the mystery of his passion and death. Yet they truly recognized the majesty of his ascension as soon as they saw it, and they wished with the entire capacity of their minds that they might deserve to follow [him].
