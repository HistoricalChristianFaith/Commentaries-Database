Open your mouth for the mute, etc. For the cause of the poor, who cannot speak for themselves in judgment, remember to speak, and take care to defend those who, with the view of the heavenly fatherland, strive to pass more quickly through this life’s way. Otherwise, it commands to open the mouth for the mute people of the nations to preach the word of faith, who previously did not know how to sound the divine words, and to expend care for the salvation not only of the Jews but also of all nations throughout the world.
