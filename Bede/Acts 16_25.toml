And at midnight Paul and Silas were worshiping God, saying a hymn, and so forth. The devotion of the apostolic heart and the power of prayer are expressed together, as both they sang hymns in the depth of the prison, and their praise shook the ground of the prison, and struck its foundations, and opened the gates, and finally released the chains of the prisoners themselves. Alternatively: Whoever among the faithful considers it all joy when he falls into various temptations (James 1), and willingly glories in his infirmities, that the power of Christ may dwell in him (2 Cor. 12), with Paul and Silas, hymns amidst the prison's darkness, and with the Psalmist sings to the Lord: You are my refuge from the oppression that surrounds me, my exultation (Psalm 31).
