And it will come to pass that every soul who does not listen to that Prophet shall be destroyed. Briefly and clearly, with the testimony of the prophets and the law, he teaches that the Lord must be listened to by all nations, condemning indeed the unbelievers and granting the faithful eternal blessing.

But it shall be, every soul who does not listen to that prophet shall be cut off from the people. Truly, it should be noted that blessed Peter here did not care to hold onto the words of the Mosaic sentence, but the sense. For it is written in Deuteronomy, with Moses speaking to the sons of Israel: The Lord your God will raise up for you a prophet from among your nation and from your brethren like me, you shall listen to him, as you asked of the Lord your God at Horeb (Deut. XVIII). And a little later: And the Lord God said to me, Well have they spoken all that they have said: I will raise up for them a prophet from among their brethren like unto thee, and I will put my words in his mouth, and he shall speak to them all that I command. And whoever will not listen to my words which he shall speak in my name, I will be the avenger (Ibid.). For which Peter placed: He shall be cut off from the people, more manifestly insinuating that this is the mode of divine vengeance, that those who scorn heavenly mandates are rendered exiles from the ranks of the elect. And also here, and in many other places, where the apostles and evangelists have taken examples from the Old Testament, it is clear that they sought the sense of the Scriptures, not the words, nor did they particularly care for the order of the speeches, so that the matter might be clear to the understanding.
