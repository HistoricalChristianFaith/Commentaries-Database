The wicked will lie down before the good, etc. In the last judgment, when the righteous are crowned, the reprobate who oppressed them in the present will be condemned. For what is said, Before, that is, before the good, and before the gates of the righteous, pertains not to proximity of place, but to the sight of the good, because they always see the torments of the wicked, so that they may endlessly give greater thanks to their Redeemer. Hence Isaiah says of them, And they shall go forth, and look upon the carcasses of the men that have transgressed against me. Their worm does not die, nor is their fire quenched; and they shall be an abhorring unto all flesh (Isaiah LXVI). But what he says, They shall go forth, does not denote a movement of feet, but a gaze of the eyes, which, placed within the kingdom to see the punishments of the wicked, they send out whenever they wish.
