The desire of the righteous is all good, etc. The righteous always desire justice to reign everywhere, but the impious, even when they seem to rest from the execution of impiety, yet with the purpose of a cruel mind, intend to inflict fury on anyone. And this is what is said above, Hand in hand, the evil will not be innocent; likewise, The expectation of the wicked is wrath, because often wrath enclosed in silence boils more vehemently within the mind.
