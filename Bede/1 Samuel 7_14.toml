There was peace between Israel and the Amorites. After the ascension of the Lord, with the Churches confirmed in faith, there was our peace, which made both one, between those from the Jews and those who believed from the Gentiles. There will also be in you, when you live as a true Israelite, that is, without deceit, peace with the former bitter enemy, which is interpreted as Amorite, when you have taught all vices conquered in you to favor virtues, and the members which were weapons of iniquity for sin, you will have made weapons of righteousness for God. For as long as the grace of the true Samuel lives and reigns in your mind, although you cannot completely be free from sin as a human, whatever filthy thoughts, as if ambushing the spiritual virtues, the hands of the Philistines may take from you, you will recover with his daily help, and you yourself will also free into the boundaries of your good works from the hand of the Philistines, because the patience of the poor will not perish forever. And although you may not be able to be invulnerable in the midst of battle, once the course is completed, you will be granted the crown of life.
