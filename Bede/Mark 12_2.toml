And he sent a servant to the tenants at the proper time to receive from the tenants some of the fruit of the vineyard. But they seized him, beat him, and sent him away empty-handed. Indeed, he set the time for the fruit, not for the harvest. For no fruit was found from the obstinate people, no yield of this vineyard was found, even though it was often and diligently sought. Therefore, the servant who was sent first is understood to be Moses, the lawgiver, who for forty continuous years sought some fruit of the law he had given from the cultivators, but they beat him and sent him away empty-handed. For they provoked Moses in the camps and Aaron, the holy one of the Lord. And Moses was vexed because of them, for they grieved his Spirit. This same servant also clearly declares in a song what he thinks about the fruit of this vineyard, saying, "For their vine is from the vine of Sodom, and their branching is from Gomorrah. Their grapes are grapes of gall, and their clusters are bitter. Their wine is the venom of dragons, and the cruel poison of asps" (Deut. XXXII).
