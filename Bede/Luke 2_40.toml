And the child grew and became strong, filled with wisdom, and the grace of God was upon him. The distinction of the words is notable, because the Lord Jesus Christ, in that he was a child, that is, had assumed the condition of human frailty, had to grow and become strong. But in that he was also the Word of God and the eternal God, he did not need to become strong nor did he need to grow. Hence, he is very rightly said to be full of wisdom and grace. Wisdom because in him dwells all the fullness of deity bodily. Grace because to the same mediator between God and men, the man Jesus Christ, great grace was given, so that from the moment he began to be man, he might be perfect and God. Similar to this is what John writes, that he is full of grace and truth, he himself setting forth that same excellence of divinity of truth, which Luke commends under the name of wisdom.
