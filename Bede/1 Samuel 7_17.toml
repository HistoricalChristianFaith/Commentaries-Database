And he returned to Ramathia, etc. The Lord returned to heaven in body by ascending once, the office of His dispensation having been completed; he returns daily in divine presence, by which he always and everywhere reaches entirety from end to end strongly, and arranges all things sweetly. For there is the flesh that he assumed for us and glorified; there is the hall of the blessed and of angels and men; there is the habitation promised to us by God, a house not made by hand, eternal in the heavens. Whence Ramathia is rightly called his height; and there, placed in body, he himself judges the Church, either chastising those still wandering on earth, until he leads them to the heavenly, or distributing worthy seats to those already dwelling with him according to merits, where in the house of his Father he has many mansions (John XIII), knowing that the Father has given all things into his hands, and has given him authority to execute judgment (John V). There also within the veil of heaven and the eternal holy of holies, he was building an altar for the hearts of the heavenly citizens to the Father. From this, the fire of his charity being ignited, the incense of everlasting praise rises, saying, Holy, holy, holy Lord God of hosts, the whole earth is full of his glory (Isaiah VI). And again: Salvation to our God, who sits upon the throne, and to the Lamb (Revelation VII); and other such things, which being brought thither in the Spirit, the beloved disciple heard, to be often repeated and always remembered. Thus far may it suffice to have briefly indicated in the first book of our exposition the change from the old priesthood to the new, prefigured in the guise of Heli and Samuel, so that we may freely investigate from another beginning the wider mysteries of the changing kingdom, which were prefigured through Saul and David, relying not on our ingenuity, but depending on the help of him through all things, to whom the whole Scripture of prophecy serves, whose kingdom shall have no end, and is a priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek.
