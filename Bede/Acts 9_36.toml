Now at Jaffa there was a woman disciple by the name of Tabitha, which means Dorcas, that is, “deer,” or “fallow deer,” signifying souls exalted by the practice of virtues although contemptible in the eyes of people. For the blessed Luke would not have provided the meaning of the name if he had not known there was strong symbolism in it. The deer and the fallow deer are animals that are similar in nature, though different in size. They dwell on high mountains, and they see all who approach, no matter how far away they may be. Hence in Greek they are called dorcades from the sharpness of their vision.So it is with the saints. As they dwell on high by the merits of their works, through mental contemplation they simultaneously direct their attention with wisdom toward things above, while always watching out for themselves with prudent discretion. Moreover, these animals are clean according to the law but timid and unwarlike according to their nature, as Martial depicts it: “The boar is feared because of his tusk; the stag’s horns defend him. What are we unwarlike fallow deer except prey?” Does not this clearly describe those who are content to live simply and with discretion in their course of action, as it were walking with split hooves and ruminating in continual meditation on the Word of God? A person who has met with spiritual death, if it was out of ignorance or infirmity, may nevertheless deserve to be revived for the integrity of his right intention, just as is shown to have happened through Peter to that woman to whom we can very rightly apply what is written [above] concerning the deer.
