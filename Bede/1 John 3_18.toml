If a brother or sister has nothing and cannot even find enough to eat, we ought to give them the basic necessities of life. Likewise if we notice that they are deficient in spiritual things, we ought to guide them in whatever way we can. Of course we must be sincere in doing this, not looking for praise from other people, not boasting, and not pointing out that others who are richer than we are have not done nearly as much. For someone who thinks like that is full of wickedness, and the gift of truth does not dwell in him, even if it appears on the surface that he is showing love to others.
