It happened therefore, when Samuel was offering a burnt offering, etc. It happened when the Lord offered himself as a sacrifice to God in the aroma of sweetness, that his persecutors, having set him on the cross, blasphemed or mocked him, and after his burial, attempted to obstruct the way of his resurrection, so that, as if he were condemned to eternal death, they would strip all hope of salvation from his faithful ones. But, with the earth shaken, rocks split, tombs opened, the dead rising, and other heavenly signs shining around his cross or burial, the enemies were terrified and scattered in different directions. Finally, at the tomb the guards were terrified and fell like dead men. And all the crowd that had gathered at the spectacle of the cross, and saw what was happening, beat their breasts and returned. Likewise also on the day of Pentecost, when the Lord thundered from above, and through the apostles, his own clouds, echoed the heavenly words, the enemies of the faith were confounded and struck by their words, with some being crushed by their impenitence and denial.
