But Jesus answered and said: Were there not ten cleansed? But where are the nine? If one is added to nine, a certain image of unity is completed. It results in such an embrace that the number does not advance further unless it returns again to one, so that this rule through the infinity of numbers is preserved. Therefore, the nine need one, so that they may be unified into a certain form of unity and become ten. But one does not need them to preserve unity. Therefore, as that one who gave thanks is approved and praised as a sign of the unique Church, so those nine who did not give thanks were made reprobate, excluded from the fellowship of unity. Hence, such will remain in the number of nine as imperfect. And rightly does the Savior inquire as if unknown, Where are they? For to know God is to choose; to not know is to reprobate.
