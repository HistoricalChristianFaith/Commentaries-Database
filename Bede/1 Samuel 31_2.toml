The Philistines attacked Saul and his sons, etc. The surrounding nations attacked with full intention to destroy the kingdom of Judea and to remove the sons of that kingdom from their midst, and they corrupted the priests, Scribes, and Pharisees with their corruption, namely the sons and teachers of that kingdom. They even prevented the heretics from preaching or worshiping the grace of the Holy Spirit with a simple heart, which is to strike Jonathan, that is, the gift of the dove. They forbade praising the Father, who made us his sons not by nature but by adoption, with worthy confession; which signifies the killing of Abinadab, that is, my voluntary Father. They opposed believing that salvation would come to the world in the kingdom of Christ; which indicates the killing of Melchisue, who is called My King Salvation, I believe. A philosopher, who seduced Arius, killed Melchisue as if; who Macedonius, Jonathan; who Manichae, Abinadab, because namely that one taught to deny the omnipotence of the true king Christ, that one to derogate from the gifts of the Holy Spirit, this one to blaspheme the goodness of the highest Father, master of corruption.
