And he said to them: Take heed what you hear. With the measure you use, it will be measured to you, and more will be added to you. If you diligently (he says) strive to do all the good you can, and to share it with your neighbors: divine grace will assist you, both presently, by giving you the understanding to grasp higher matters, and the ability to accomplish worthier deeds; and in the future, beyond what you know to hope for, it will truly add to you the gifts of eternal recompense.
