He who is wise in heart, etc. He who keeps the wisdom of the Catholic faith, which he learned, unblemished in his heart, deservedly receives the name of prudent; but he who knows also to preach the same wisdom learnedly and to defend it against heretics will receive greater rewards for greater labor.

The fountain of life is the instruction of the possessor, etc. When he said, of the possessor, he did not add, what the possessor holds. What then do we think was meant to be understood, except perhaps the very instruction itself? so that the full meaning is: The fountain of life is the instruction of the one possessing that very instruction; which is openly said to mean that the preacher truly opens the ways of life to his listeners who practices what he preaches himself; who possesses in his steadfast heart the love of the word, by which he instructs others, and does not scatter it like seed retained only in memory, as if gathered in a bosom, on the ground. But the teaching of fools is foolishness, because even if they have learned to say some good things by the practice of instruction, they themselves, foolish at heart, despise the same good things they speak.
