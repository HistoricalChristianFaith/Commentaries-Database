He also spoke a parable to those who were invited, noting how they chose the best places, saying to them, "When you are invited to a wedding, do not sit in the first place." Indeed, this admonition of the Savior is plain on the surface, teaching humility, which is praiseworthy not only before God but also among men, but since the evangelist does not call this a parable in vain, we must briefly consider what it also signifies mystically. In many passages, it appears that Christ and the Church's union are called a wedding. One such passage is: "Can the children of the wedding fast while the bridegroom is with them?" (Mark II). Another is: "The kingdom of heaven is like a king who made a wedding feast for his son and sent his servants to call the invited to the wedding" (Matt. XXII). Therefore, whoever having been invited attends these weddings, that is, unites himself to the members of the Church through the grace of faith, should not sit in the first place, that is, should not, by boasting of his merits, exalt himself as superior to others. Let him indeed strive, according to the parable of another place, to appear clad in the wedding garment, that is, shining with the splendor of virtues, but let him adorn the attire of these virtues with the place of devoted humility.
