And when he had said this, he showed them his hands and feet. Not only the hands and feet, which bore the marks of the nails, but also the side which had been pierced by a spear, as attested by John, he showed. So that by showing the scars of his wounds, he might heal their wound of doubt and unbelief. Indeed, just as after the resurrection he graciously revealed the places of the nails and the spear to strengthen the faith and hope of his disciples, so in the day of judgment he will come revealing the same signs of his passion and the very cross itself to confound the wickedness and unbelief of the proud. Clearly, that he might show to all, angels and men alike, that it is him who died for the impious and by the impious, and they shall see (as it is written) him whom they pierced, and all the tribes of the earth shall mourn over him (Rev 1:7). Certainly, it must be noted that the Gentiles are accustomed to raising a challenge in this place, and foolishly ridicule the faith in our hoped-for resurrection. For if your God (they say) could not heal the wounds inflicted by the Jews on himself, but as you say, took the marks of the scars with him to heaven, with what boldness do you believe that he will restore your bodies from dust to their entirety? To which the response must be that our God, who raised his flesh, glorified now with perpetual immortality, from the sepulcher when and how he chose, also restored it as he willed. For it does not follow that he who is proven to have done greater things would be unable to do lesser ones. But certainly, out of grace of his dispensation, he who did the greater chose not to erase the lesser, that is, he who destroyed the realms of death chose not to obliterate the signs of death. First, evidently, so that through these he might establish the faith of his resurrection for the disciples. Then, so that while interceding with the Father for us, he might always show what kind of death he endured for the life of mortals. Third, so that he might always renew the signs of the same death by which they have been redeemed, generously aiding them, so that they might never cease to sing the mercies of the Lord eternally, but let those say, who have been redeemed by the Lord, that he is good, for his mercy endures forever. Finally, so that, in the judgment, he might also demonstrate to the faithless how justly they are condemned, by showing, among other crimes, even the scars of the wounds he received from them. Just as if some most valiant man, by the command of his King, striving in singular combat for the salvation of the entire people, should receive many wounds but nonetheless kill the enemy, plunder his spoils, and bring victory to his people; and when asked by the physician tasked with his care whether he desires to be healed in such a way that no traces of the wounds remain or rather that the scars should remain while all deformity and filth are completely absent, he would reply that he prefers to be healed in such a way that, having fully recovered his former state of health and glory, he perpetually carries with him the signs of such a great triumph. Likewise, the Lord, for the perpetual sign of victory, preferred to bring the scars of the wounds of his passion with him to heaven, rather than to erase them. Yet, none of this detracts from the faith in our resurrection, concerning which it is prophesied with true promise: Not a hair of your head will perish (Luke 21:18).
