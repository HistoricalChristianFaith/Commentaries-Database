In the Gospel where the Lord is tempted by the devil these floors are called the pinnacles of the temple. But we also read that the apostle James, the brother of the Lord, was lifted to the pinnacle of the temple from which to address the people. Whether it was the practice of teachers to deliver their address to the people standing around below them while they sat on these floors is something we find nowhere in the Scriptures. So what the mystery obviously means is that these three floors denote the corresponding number of levels of the faithful, namely, married people, those who practice continence and virgins, levels distinguished according to the loftiness of their profession but all of them belonging to the house of the Lord and intently clinging to him by reason of their fellowship in the same faith and truth.
