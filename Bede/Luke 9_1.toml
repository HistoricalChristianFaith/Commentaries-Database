But Jesus, having called together the twelve apostles, gave them power and authority over all demons, and to cure diseases. And he sent them to preach the kingdom of God and to heal the sick. First granting them the power of signs, he sent them to preach the kingdom of God so that the greatness of the works would also attest to the greatness of the promises, and the power shown would give faith to the words, and they would do new things, who preached new things. Hence now also, as the number of the faithful has increased, there are many within the holy Church who maintain a life of virtues, but do not have the signs of virtues. Because a miracle is shown in vain externally if it lacks what is at work internally. For, according to the voice of the master of the Gentiles, tongues are a sign not to the faithful, but to the unbelievers.
