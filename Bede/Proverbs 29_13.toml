The poor man and creditor meet each other, etc. The poor man is the humble listener of the word of God; the creditor, however, is he who commits the money of the same word by preaching to him; they meet each other when they converge into the same grace of piety. And God is the illuminator of both, because neither that one could preach without divine piety, nor could this one believe. Indeed, the truthful sentence of Truth remains, which says, "Without me, you can do nothing" (John 15).
