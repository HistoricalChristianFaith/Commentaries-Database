For [if one] either refuses to show mercy on poor people or is not ashamed to demand from them, as if lawfully, what they do not have to give, this person is shaken from his house (namely, is cast and shaken out from the fellowship of the holy church in which he believed he would remain forever) and deprived of his labors, doubtless, that is, of the fruit of good works in which he believed that he had toiled admirably. For labors performed without piety cannot become fruitful before the Lord.
