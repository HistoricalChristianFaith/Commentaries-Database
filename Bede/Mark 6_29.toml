Ancient history relates, that Philip, the son of Herod the great, under whom the Lord fled into Egypt, the brother of this Herod, under whom Christ suffered, married Herodias, the daughter of king Aretas; but afterwards, that his father-in-law, after certain disagreements had arisen with his son-in-law, had taken his daughter away, and, to the grief of her former husband, had given her in marriage to his enemy; therefore John the Baptist rebukes Herod and Herodias for contracting an unlawful union, and because it was not allowed for a man to marry his brother's wife during his lifetime.
For Herodias was afraid, lest Hero should repent at some time, or be reconciled to his brother Philip, and so the unlawful marriage be divorced. It goes on: “For Herod feared John, knowing that he was a just man, and a holy.”.
His oath does not excuse his murder, for perchance his reason for swearing was, that he might find an opportunity for slaying, and if she had demanded the death of his father and mother, he surely would not have granted it.It goes on: “And she went forth, and said unto her mother, What shall I ask? And she said, The head of John the Baptist. "Worthy is blood to be asked as the reward of such a deed as dancing. It goes on: “And she came in straightway with haste”.
It is usual with Scripture, that the historian should relate events as they were then believed by all, thus Josephis called the father of Jesus by Mary herself. So now also Herod is said to be "exceeding sorry,” for so the guests thought, since the hypocrite bore sadness on his face, when he had joy in his heart; and he excuses the wickedness by his oath, that he might be impious under pretence of piety. Wherefore there follows: “For his oath's sake, and for their sakes who sat with him, he would not reject her.”.
Now Herod was not ashamed to bring before his guests the head of a murdered man; but we do not read of such an actof madness in Pharaoh. From both examples, however, it is proved to be more useful, often to call to mind the coming day of our death, by fear and by living chastely, than to celebrate the day of our birth with luxury. For man isborn in the world to toil, but the elect pass by death out of the world torepose.It goes on: “And he beheaded him in prison.”
