This stone has the luster of onyx yet shows the redness of carnelian, and therefore from both receives the name of sardonyx. There are many kinds of this stone. One has the likeness of red earth. Another has the appearance of two colors, as though it were blood shining through a human fingernail. Another consists of three colors, on the bottom is black, the middle is white, and the top is red. This stone represents those who are red in the passion of the body, white in the purity of the spirit, but in the humility of their mind examine themselves and say with the apostle, “Although our outer man is wasting away, our inner man is being renewed every day.” And again, “I am aware of nothing against myself, but in this I am not justified.” Similarly the psalmist says, “A man walks in the image of God,” that is, by the virtue of the mind, “however, in vain will he be disquieted,” that is, by the weakness of the flesh.… It is fitting that sardonyx is said to be the fifth foundation, since our bodies possess five senses.

Sardion has the color of pure blood and signifies the glory of the martyrs, of whom it is said, “Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his saints.” Rightly is it placed in the sixth position, for our Lord was both incarnated in the sixth age of the world and was crucified on the sixth day for the salvation of the whole world.

Chrysolite shines as though it were sparkling gold. Its appearance represents those who shine with the knowledge of the heavenly and true wisdom and who by the words of exhortation to their neighbors or even by signs of power sparkle as though sparks of fire.… Since this happens only by the gift of spiritual grace, it is most proper that chrysolite stands as the seventh foundation, for the grace of the Holy Spirit is often symbolized by the number seven, of whom it was said above, “and from the seven spirits who are before his throne.” It is in agreement with this meaning that a kind of this stone is found in the color of blue-green, for which reason the Hebrews call this stone “tharsis” because it has the color of the sea. The color green indeed corresponds to the reality of faith, which is said to be the beginning of wisdom, and water is a figure of the Holy Spirit, as the Lord indicates, saying, “He who believes in me, as the Scripture says, ‘out of his heart shall flow rivers of living water.’ Now this he said about the Spirit, which those who believed in him were to receive.”

Just as water reflecting the brightness of the sun, beryl gives off a beautiful reddish color. However, it does not shine unless it has been shaped and polished into a six-sided form, for its brightness is accentuated by the reflection of the angles. This stone represents those persons who indeed are wise by their natural disposition but who reflect even more the light of divine grace. Solomon indicates that water might symbolize the depth of understanding when he says, “The words of a man’s mouth are deep waters.” But neither human nor divine wisdom is perfect in its light unless the performance of works is joined to them. For often the completion of a work is represented by the number six, especially when in this number it is a finished work of this world. Without doubt it is clear why it is said that the hand of one holding [this stone] is burned, since one who is joined to a holy person is truly recreated by the fire of his good behavior.

Since topaz is rare, it is very valuable. It comes in two colors, one of purest gold and the other glittering with an ethereal clarity. In color it has a pure rosy and reddish hue and is similar to chrysophrase in the brilliance of its color. For it especially shines when it is struck by the splendor of the sun, surpassing the most costly brilliance of all other stones and in its appearance giving uniquely the greatest delight to the eyes. Should one polish this stone, however, it becomes dull; yet should one leave it alone, it shines by virtue of its own natural properties. Kings themselves regard this stone as marvelous and consider nothing else among their riches as its equivalent. This most beautiful quality of its nature is most fittingly compared to the contemplative life. For saintly kings, whose hearts are in the hand of God, display this nature by the riches of good works and by the gems of all of the virtues. Especially guiding in it the contemplation and keen vision of their pure minds, they shall be more frequently struck by the splendor of the heavenly grace, the more fervently they behold the sweetness of the heavenly life with their soul. Therefore, saintly people possess a golden color by the fire of their inner love, while they have also a heavenly color from the contemplation of a supernal sweetness. Sometimes these persons become worthless through the turmoil of the present world, as though they were rubbed by a file. For at one and the same time a soul cannot easily be agitated by the difficulty of earthly toils and by cares and sorrows and, having taken delight in the joy of the heavenly life, also contemplate this with a tranquil mind. Rather, in its groaning such a soul rather protests, “My eye is troubled because of anger; I have grown old on account of my enemies.” This stone is said to be found on the island of Thebaide, which is named Topazion, and from that it also receives its name. We can understand this in two ways. First, these regions, that is, of Egypt, are especially filled with crowds of monks, and whoever dwells near to the Son of righteousness is truly colored by the brightness of the heavenly light. And since the perfection of the active life is designated by the eighth place, this stone, which represents the delight of the contemplative life, is fittingly put in ninth place. [Topaz is in ninth position either] because there are nine angelic orders mentioned in the holy Scriptures, whose life is imitated, or because [the contemplative life] is removed from the ten of perfect bliss, as I shall put it, by the single step of death. Longing for this highest joy, the prophet said, “Therefore, I have loved thy commandments more than gold and topaz.” That is to say, above the glory for every approved work and above every height of contemplative joy that is possible in this life, I have delighted in your commandments with the sweetest love. And the first and greatest of these commandments is that “you will love the Lord your God with the whole heart, the whole mind and with all your strength.” It is most certainly true that this cannot be perfected in its completeness except in the height of the celestial kingdom.

Chrysophrase has a mixed color of green and gold and even brings forth a certain purple gleam intermingled with spots of gold. It is found in India. This stone symbolizes those who by the brightness of perfect charity deserve the verdant [garden] of the eternal fatherland and reveal it even to others by the purple light of their own martyrdom. Since those who despise the present life and prefer the eternal glory follow the example of the Lord who appeared in the flesh, they already display the brightness of their merits as though in India, that is, near the rising of the sun. And because they expect to shine as the sun in the kingdom of the Father and desire then to reign with their king for whom they are now suffering, rightly are they listed in the tenth place. For through the denarius by which the workers in the Lord’s vineyard were paid, the image of the eternal king is to be perceived. There—and this would not have been possible in the ninth position—the Decalogue will be in every way fulfilled by a perfected love of God and of the neighbor.

Hyacinth is found in Ethiopia and has a dark blue color. At its best it is neither of loose texture nor dull by density, but rather [it] shines moderately and gives a pleasant, pure gleam. But this stone does not gleam the same all the time. Rather, it changes with the appearance of the sky, for when the sky is fair and clear, it is transparent and pleasing, but when the sky is cloudy, it becomes faint and pale to the eyes. This stone suggests those souls that are always devoted to the purpose of heaven and who, to the extent possible for mortals, approach in some manner to the angelic life. These are admonished to preserve their hearts with every diligence, lest they grow callous by an excessive subtlety of their understanding and dare to seek after higher things and to examine that which is more powerful. “For the glory of God is to conceal a word,” that is, one is to intellectually scrutinize God and the human Christ only with caution. They are also to preserve their hearts lest through an idle torpor they fall back again to the weak beginnings of faith and to the rudiments of the words of God. Those rather who travel the royal highway advance protected on the left and on the right by the weapons of righteousness, and by apt observation of the times [they] change their style and form with the sky and say to their overseers, “If we are beside ourselves, it is for God; if we are in our right mind, it is for you.” As a hyacinth underneath a cloud, such a person says, “You are not restricted by us, but you are restricted in your own affection”;170 and again, “For I decided to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ and him crucified.” And as a hyacinth seen in the bright sun, he says, “We speak wisdom among the mature.”

Amethyst is purple, a mixture of violet and the luster as of a rose, and it gently gives off little sparks. But it has a certain glow that is not purple through and through, but rather it appears like the red of a wine. The beauty of purple suggests the deportment of the heavenly kingdom, while the rosy violet indicates the humble modesty and the precious death of the saints. For to be sure, their minds are chiefly concerned with things on high, and although externally they must endure misery, they remember among these adversities the Lord’s promise, “Fear not, little flock, for it is your Father’s good pleasure to give you the kingdom.” These persons do not extend the fire of love only toward one another but also toward their very persecutors, imploring on bended knee, “Lord, do not hold this sin against them.” Moreover, along with the wine of suffering that they must drink, by a continuous recollection they drink even more of that wine that gladdens the heart … and that the Lord promised that he would drink new with his disciples in the kingdom of the Father.
