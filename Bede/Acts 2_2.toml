And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind, etc. The Lord indeed appeared through fire, as Blessed Pope Gregory explains, but He made the interior communication by Himself. And neither was God the fire, nor was that sound, but by what He exhibited outwardly, He expressed what He made within. For He who made the disciples both fervent with zeal and instructed with the word inwardly, showed fiery tongues outwardly. Therefore, elements were brought in as a sign so that bodies might perceive fire and sound, while hearts were taught by invisible fire and soundless voice.

And suddenly there came from heaven a sound as of a violent rushing wind, and it filled the whole house where they were sitting, etc. And in the very giving of the law and grace, the most evident difference between the old and new testament is apparent. There, the people stood far off, there was fear, but no love. For they were so afraid that they said to Moses: Speak to us yourself, and do not let the Lord speak to us, lest we die (Exodus 20). Therefore, God descended, as it is written, on Sinai in fire, but terrifying the people standing far off, He wrote the law with His finger on stone, not with His spirit in the heart. But here, when the Holy Spirit came, the faithful were gathered together in one place; He did not terrify them on a mountain, but entered the house. Indeed, a sound came suddenly from heaven, and it sounded as if a violent wind was coming; but no one was afraid. You heard the sound, see the fire, because on the mountain there was both, and fire and sound, but there also smoke, here fire, divided tongues as of fire. Was He terrifying from afar? By no means. For He sat on each one of them, and they began to speak in tongues, as the Holy Spirit gave them to utter. Hear the tongue speaking, and understand the Spirit writing not on stone, but in the heart.
