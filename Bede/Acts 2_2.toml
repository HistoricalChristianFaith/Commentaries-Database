And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind, etc. The Lord indeed appeared through fire, as Blessed Pope Gregory explains, but He made the interior communication by Himself. And neither was God the fire, nor was that sound, but by what He exhibited outwardly, He expressed what He made within. For He who made the disciples both fervent with zeal and instructed with the word inwardly, showed fiery tongues outwardly. Therefore, elements were brought in as a sign so that bodies might perceive fire and sound, while hearts were taught by invisible fire and soundless voice.
