And all those who knew Him yesterday and the day before, etc. Jesus, teaching in His homeland, many hearing were astonished at His doctrine, saying: Whence has this man these things? And what wisdom is this which is given to Him, that such mighty works are performed by His hands? Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, the brother of James and Joseph, and Judas and Simon? Are not His sisters here with us? And they were offended in Him. And Jesus said to them: A prophet is not without honor, except in his own country, and among his own kin, and in his own house (Matthew 13).
