And when the hour was now late, His disciples came to Him saying: The place is deserted, and the hour is already past. Send them away so that going into the nearby villages and towns, they may buy themselves food to eat. The late hour signifies evening time, as Luke testifies, who says: But the day began to decline, and the twelve came to Him saying: Send the crowds away, etc. (Luke 9). When the day declined, the Savior refreshes the crowds, either because the end of times is near, or when the Sun of Righteousness set for us, we were saved from the long decay of spiritual famine.
