But you shall be baptized with the Holy Spirit not many days from now. The apostles had not yet been baptized, not with water, but with the Holy Spirit, whom we understand they had already been baptized, either with John's baptism (as some suppose), or (what is more credible) with Christ's baptism. For the ministry of baptizing had not been such that it had baptized servants through whom others would be baptized, for the ministry of that memorable humility was not lacking, when He washed their feet. Therefore, when the Lord said: For John indeed baptized with water, He did not add: But you shall baptize, but: But you shall be baptized with the Holy Spirit. For neither the apostles nor their followers, who baptize even to this day in the Church, can baptize otherwise than John, that is, with water, but only by invoking the name of Christ, the interior power of the Holy Spirit is present, which, with a man providing the water, purifies both the souls and bodies of the baptized, which was not done in John's baptism. For the Spirit had not yet been given, because Jesus had not yet been glorified (John VII).

For John indeed baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit. Baptisma in Greek is called tinctio in Latin. Wherefore, in some manuscripts we find it interpreted thus: For John indeed dipped with water, but you will be dipped in the Holy Spirit. Here the marvelous harmony of the words of the Lord and his precursor is evident. For he said to those whom he baptized, about the Lord: I baptized you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit (Mark 1:8). And the Lord himself: John indeed baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit. It should be noted as well that the baptism of the Lord in the Holy Spirit, which John had foretold, does not refer only to that time when the Apostles and other faithful of that time were baptized with water for the remission of sins, through the grace of the Holy Spirit given to them by the Lord; but also to this, when, with the Lord sending them, they received more fully the gifts of the same Spirit from heaven. But also now, whoever receives baptism for the remission of sins, is certainly baptized in the Holy Spirit, through whose gift they are both cleansed from all sins, and are aided so that they can progress in good deeds.
