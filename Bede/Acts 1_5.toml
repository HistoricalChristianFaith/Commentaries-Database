When the Lord said, “John indeed baptized with water,” he did not continue with “yet you shall baptize” but with “yet you shall be baptized in the Holy Spirit,” because neither the apostles nor their followers, who still baptize in the church to this day, had the power to baptize except as John did, that is, with water. However, when the name of Christ is invoked, the interior power of the Holy Spirit is present, which, with the human administration of water, simultaneously purifies the souls and the bodies of those being baptized. This did not happen in the baptism of John—“for the Spirit had not yet been given, since Jesus had not yet been glorified.”
