But you shall be baptized with the Holy Spirit not many days from now. The apostles had not yet been baptized, not with water, but with the Holy Spirit, whom we understand they had already been baptized, either with John's baptism (as some suppose), or (what is more credible) with Christ's baptism. For the ministry of baptizing had not been such that it had baptized servants through whom others would be baptized, for the ministry of that memorable humility was not lacking, when He washed their feet. Therefore, when the Lord said: For John indeed baptized with water, He did not add: But you shall baptize, but: But you shall be baptized with the Holy Spirit. For neither the apostles nor their followers, who baptize even to this day in the Church, can baptize otherwise than John, that is, with water, but only by invoking the name of Christ, the interior power of the Holy Spirit is present, which, with a man providing the water, purifies both the souls and bodies of the baptized, which was not done in John's baptism. For the Spirit had not yet been given, because Jesus had not yet been glorified (John VII).
