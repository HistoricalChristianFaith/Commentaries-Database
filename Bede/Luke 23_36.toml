But the soldiers also mocked him, approaching and offering him vinegar, and saying: If you are the king of the Jews, save yourself. The vinegar itself was the Jews, degenerating from the wine of the patriarchs and prophets. With this vinegar, indeed, the soldiers gave the Lord to drink, whom they handed over to death at their suggestion. And it is to be noted, that the Jews, blaspheming, mockingly rejected the name of Christ and the Son of God, credited to them by the authority of Scripture. But the soldiers, being ignorant of the Scriptures, mocked not Christ the chosen of God, but the king of the Jews.
