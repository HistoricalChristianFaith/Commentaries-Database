We read in Pliny of how a householder managed to tame an immense asp, so that the snake emerged each day from its hole and brought the day’s food to the man’s table. We also read in Ammianus Marcellinus of a domesticated tigress which was sent to the emperor Anastasius from India. James emphasizes that that kind of thing is child’s play compared with the art of taming the tongue, because the tongue is much wilder and more ferocious than any animal.
