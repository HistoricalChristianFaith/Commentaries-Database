My son, do not let these depart from your eyes. Beware lest, wearied by temporal discipline, you lose the grace of wisdom, which is so great.

Observe law and counsel. The law of wisdom is, as it says, If you wish to enter into life, you shall not kill, you shall not commit adultery, you shall not steal, you shall not bear false witness, and the rest (Mark 10). The counsel of wisdom is when it immediately adds: If you wish to be perfect, go, sell all that you have, etc. (Ibid.).
