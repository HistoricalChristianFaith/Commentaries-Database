Now the disciples, each according to what they had, decided to send aid to the brothers living in Judea. And they did so, sending it to the elders by the hands of Barnabas and Paul. Here the disciples seem, to those who understand poorly, not to have kept the command of the Lord, where He says: Do not be anxious about tomorrow (Matthew VI), or what Paul often testifies about himself, that he worked with his own hands, so as not to burden anyone, does not seem to have followed the Lord's command to imitate the birds of the air and the lilies of the field. But from these and similar passages of Scripture, it is clear enough that our Lord does not disapprove of someone providing for these things in a human manner; but if someone serves God for the sake of these things, so that in their works they seek not the kingdom of God but the acquisition of these things. Therefore, this entire precept is reduced to this rule: that even in the provision of these things we should think of the kingdom of God, but in the service of the kingdom of God, we should not think of these things.
