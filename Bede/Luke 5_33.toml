But they said to him, "Why do the disciples of John fast often, and make supplications, likewise also the Pharisees; but yours eat and drink?" Matthew reports that the disciples of John themselves said this to the Savior, whence it is clear that both groups combined to question him with this. Here, the disciples of John are especially to be reproved, not only for the boastfulness of their fasting but also because they malign what they knew to be taught by their master, and they joined with the Pharisees who they knew were condemned by him. Spiritually, however, the disciples of John and the Pharisees fast, but the disciples of Christ eat and drink, because whether one follows the works of the law or the traditions of men, or even receives the preaching of Christ with the ear of the body alone, abstaining from spiritual goods, they waste away with a fasting heart. But he who faithfully incorporates with the members of Christ out of love cannot fast, because he feasts on his flesh and blood.

Alternatively: John drinks neither wine nor strong drink; the Lord eats and drinks with publicans and sinners, because he increases merit through abstinence, where there is no strength of nature. The Lord, however, to whom it naturally belonged to forgive sins, why would he avoid those whom he could make purer by the abstainers? But Christ also fasted, so that you might not avoid the commandment. He ate with sinners, so that you might see grace and recognize power.
