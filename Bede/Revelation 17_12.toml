horns: The kingdoms of the world have not yet fully displayed their power in persecuting the Church. For although these even now have rule over the greatest part, yet there will be the stronger power of insane boasting when they have also deceived such by signs. Some understand it, that when the last persecution draws near, there will be ten kings who are to divide the world between them; according to the prophecy of Daniel also, who said of the fourth beast, &quot;And he had ten horns; and behold another little horn came up from the midst of them, and three of the first horns were plucked up before his face;&quot; and that Antichrist who should arise from Babylon, should subdue the king of Egypt, and of Africa, and that after they were slain, seven other kings should also submit their necks to the conqueror. But others say that Antichrist is placed in the number eleven, to signify prevarication. For eleven indicates a departure from the perfection of the number ten.

In persecuting the church, the kingdoms of the world have not yet fully demonstrated their power. For although now they indeed rule over most, nevertheless the power of their insane boasting will be the more acute when they will deceive most through signs. Some interpret this to mean that when the last persecution draws near, there will be ten kings who divide the world among themselves, according to the prophecy of Daniel, who said concerning the fourth beast: “It had ten horns, and behold, there came up among them another horn, a little one, before which three of the first horns were plucked up.” [These interpreters further say] that the antichrist would arise from Babylon and would overcome the kings of Egypt, Africa and Ethiopia, and that when these had been killed, seven other kings would submit their necks to the conqueror. However, others say that the antichrist is placed as the number eleven, as an indication of his collusion. For they think that eleven is a departure from the number ten, which is perfect. [They receive power] “as kings,” for those who oppose the kingdom of Christ rule as though in a dream.
