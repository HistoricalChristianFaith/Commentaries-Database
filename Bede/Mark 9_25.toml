And when Jesus saw the crowd running together, he rebuked the unclean spirit, saying to it: You deaf and mute spirit, I command you, come out of him, and never enter him again. The rebuke of the Lord is the power of the divine command. But he rebuked not the boy who was suffering harm, but the demon who was inflicting it. For whoever desires to correct a sinner must indeed exterminate the vice by rebuking and cursing it, but nourish the man by loving him. And well did the Lord who drives out the unclean spirit from the man at the same time command it not to enter him again. For he is truly freed from demonic domination, who avoids returning to the sins from which he was once cleansed by repenting by living poorly.
