Jonathan and David made a covenant, etc. Christ and the Church made a covenant of mutual charity and peace. For the Church loved Him in its more perfect members, so much so that it was ready to die for Him; deeming it just to give its body and soul for Him, who, for its redemption, though He was true God from true God, deigned to clothe Himself in human flesh and soul. For the Word was made flesh (John I), and the Lord is the protector of my soul (Psalm LIII). Finally, He stripped himself in the martyrs of the flesh with which He was clothed, and gave it to Christ's services; and similarly, whatever else it possessed of talent, virtue, and deeds, it devotedly expended to His will, even to the extent of skill and expertise in speaking, and to the industry of emitting arguments true in faith and reason, against the wiles of the ill-counseled, and to the glory of chastity and unblemished purity, kept for His love.
