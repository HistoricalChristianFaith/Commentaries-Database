[The prophet will be] like myself in being visible in the flesh, but surpassing me in being terrible in majesty. Stephen says, “Lest the teaching about Christ be said to be new and strange, Moses himself, whom your fathers were unwilling to obey, proclaimed that he would have the form of a man and give precepts of life for all souls.”
