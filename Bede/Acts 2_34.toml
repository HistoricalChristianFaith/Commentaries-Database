For David did not ascend into the heavens. He himself says: "For these latter things, blessed David predicted, not about himself, but about his Lord's ascension, who would be sent forth from Zion, that is, from David's royal lineage, and would rule in the midst of his enemies;" so also understand those previous things he mentioned, which pertain not to David, but to Christ's death and resurrection.

The Lord said to my Lord, "Sit at my right hand." The first name of the Lord among the Hebrews is the Tetragrammaton, which is properly used for God; the second, which is common to mortals, is that by which both kings and other men are called. If the Arian heresy wishes to oppose us with this difference, making the Son lesser, and the Father greater, we will respond that the inferior name belongs to him to whom it is commanded to sit. As blessed Peter explained: "For God made Him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom you crucified." For it was not the divinity that was crucified, but the flesh. And this indeed can be done, which could be crucified.
