We sailed in an Alexandrian ship, which had wintered on the island and had the insignia of Castor and Pollux. I believe that at first the insignia of Castor was placed, but due to the mistake of the scribes, letters were added, just as “frustra panis” is written instead of “frusta,” and “appropriat” instead of “appropiat,” which we find often written in the oldest manuscripts. For in Greek instead of the insignia of Castor, it is written παρασήμῳ διοσκούροις, but Διόσκουροι, the twin Castors, that is, Castor and Pollux, are called in Greek. The city of the Colchians is a witness, which, made by the charioteers Amphitus and Cercyon, is called Dioscuria from their name. For this reason, the pagans invoke them as gods at sea, because in the omens of sailors, if solitary stars appear on the ship or on the masts, they are dangerous; but if twin stars, they are harbingers of a prosperous voyage. At their arrival, they say the dreadful star called Helen is driven away. In another translation, we saw written for παρασήμῳ διοσκούροις, "bearing the emblem of Jupiter's sons." For the fables say that Jupiter, transformed into a swan, ravished Leda, the wife of Theseus, and Helen was born from that. Hence it is said: That melodious bird sought Leda’s embrace, and similarly, he transformed into a star and fathered Castor and Pollux as twins.
