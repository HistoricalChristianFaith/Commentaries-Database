But Jesus said, "Leave her alone. Why do you trouble her? She has done a good deed to me. For you always have the poor with you, and whenever you want, you can do good to them; but you will not always have me." Another question arises, why did Jesus say after the resurrection to the disciples, "Behold, I am with you always, to the end of the age" (Matthew 28), and now says, "But you will not always have me." But it seems to me in this place he speaks of his bodily presence: because he will not be with them after the resurrection as he is now in all associations and familiarity. Remembering this, the Apostle said, "Even though we have known Christ according to the flesh, yet now we know him thus no longer" (2 Corinthians 5).
