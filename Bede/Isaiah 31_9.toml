If the breads of the furnace that were baked in secret signify the interior devotion of the mind of the faithful confirmed by the fire of charity, breads which were also commanded by the law to be offered in the sacrifice of the Lord, it is most fitting that the hearts which were made to burn constantly with the flame of intimate love and virtue and to beget words are symbolized through the furnaces in which the same breads were baked. The prophet spoke beautifully about these things when he referred to “the Lord whose fire is in Zion and whose furnace is in Jerusalem.” It is also written: “Did our hearts not burn within us when he spoke along the way and opened the Scriptures to us?”
