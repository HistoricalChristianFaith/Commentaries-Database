Woe when all men speak well of you. This is what the Psalmist laments, because the sinner is praised in the desires of his soul, and he who does unjust things is blessed (Psalms Hebr. X). For whom it is not the least part of the punishment that his crimes are not only not censured, but are moreover praised as well done. Hence the Lord prudently does not say: Woe, because men speak well of you, as if the fault should be followed by the punishment at some other time, but woe (he says) when all men speak well of you. Because the flattery itself is the nurse of sin; just as oil to flames, so it is usually the fuel supplied to those burning in guilt, and certainly it is the greatest punishment of sinners. For just as the hungry and weeping poor ought to be weighed down by the wickedness of evildoers, so those indulging in riches, feasts, and laughter are by the anger of a strict judge more fueled by their courtiers to greater punishment.

For such things indeed did their fathers do to the prophets. He means false prophets, who are also often called prophets in sacred scripture, because they seek the favor of the people by predicting the future, that is, by attempting to foretell it. Hence Ezekiel says: Woe to the foolish prophets, who follow their own spirit and have seen nothing. Like foxes in the deserts, your prophets were, O Israel (Ezek. XIII). Therefore the Lord on the mount sets forth the blessings only of the good, but in the plain he describes also the woes of the reprobate. Because as yet uncultivated listeners must necessarily be driven to good through threats and fears, but the perfect may be sufficiently invited by rewards.
