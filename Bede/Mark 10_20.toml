And he, answering, said, "Teacher, I have observed all these things from my youth," etc. This man should not be thought to have tempted the Lord with any vow (as some have thought), nor to have lied about his life when he said that he had kept the commandments of the law, but simply to have confessed how he lived. Because if he were held guilty of lying or hypocrisy, by no means, having looked into the secrets of his heart, would Jesus be said to love him. For the Lord loves those who keep the commands of the law, although lesser; but nonetheless, he shows them what in the law was lesser, to those who wish to be perfect because he did not come to abolish the Law or the Prophets, but to fulfill. To which indeed pertains what is consequently joined here.
