What Peter writes here may refer to what has gone before, because in having written to these people only briefly he was exhorting them rather than ordering them to keep the faith. But it may also refer to what follows, not only because he is writing to bear witness to the truth of the grace which he is preaching to them, namely, that there is no other way in which we can be saved, but also to exhort them to make the grace which they have received in Christ a reality in their lives. For the grace of Christ is only real to those who receive it with a pure heart.
