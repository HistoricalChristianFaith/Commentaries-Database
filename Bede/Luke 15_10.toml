Thus, I say to you, there will be joy before the angels of God over one sinner who repents. To repent is both to lament the wrongs committed and to refrain from committing those that should be lamented. For he who laments some wrongs yet commits others still either does not know how or pretends to repent. For what does it profit if one mourns the sins of lust but still pants with the fires of avarice? Or what does it profit if one already laments the faults of anger yet still wastes away with the torches of envy? But it is much less than what we say, that he who laments his sins at least does not commit those that should be lamented. For it must be seriously considered that he who remembers he has committed unlawful acts should strive to abstain even from some lawful things, so that in this way he may make amends to his Creator, that he who has committed forbidden acts should also cut off himself even from permissible ones.
