And when those who had been sent returned home, they found the servant, who had been sick, well. The faith of the master is proven, and the health of the servant is restored. Therefore, the merit of the Lord can also benefit the servants, not only by the merit of faith but also by the zeal of discipline. Matthew explains this more fully when the Lord said to the centurion: Go, and let it be done for you as you have believed (Matthew 8), and the boy was healed from that hour. But it is the custom of blessed Luke to abbreviate what he has seen fully explained by other evangelists, or even intentionally to pass over; what he knows to have been omitted or briefly touched upon by them, he elucidates more diligently. Mystically, as I have said, the centurion, whose faith is preferred to that of Israel, undoubtedly represents those chosen from among the Gentiles, who, as if surrounded by a centenary military contingent, are exalted in the perfection of spiritual virtues and seek nothing earthly from the Lord but only the joys of eternal salvation for themselves and their own. For the number one hundred, which is transferred from the left to the right, is customarily placed in the signification of heavenly life. Hence it is that Noah's ark is built in one hundred years, Abraham received the son of promise at one hundred years; Isaac sowed, and found a hundredfold in that year; the courtyard of the tabernacle is one hundred cubits long; in the one hundredth psalm, mercy and judgment are sung to the Lord, and other things of this kind. Therefore, men of such merit must pray to the Lord for those who are still oppressed by the spirit of servitude in fear, so that as they are gradually advanced to higher things, perfect love may cast out fear (1 John 4).
