Where there is no knowledge of the soul, it is not good, etc. The knowledge of heavenly life is indeed necessary for the human soul, because without it, it surely cannot be blessed forever. But yet, those who desire to know more than what is proper with unrestrained senses of the mind, often fall into the offense of heretical foolishness through their rash pursuits, which was mystically signified in the first parents of the human race, who, in their desire for greater knowledge, hastened to touch the forbidden, deviating from the state of blessedness in which they were created, and fell into the punishment of misery and mortality.
