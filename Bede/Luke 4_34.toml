And he cried out with a loud voice saying: Leave us alone; what have we to do with you, Jesus of Nazareth? Pause a little (he said), cease tormenting me, to whom there is no fellowship with our deceit. And indeed: For what partnership has light with darkness? Or what fellowship has Christ with Belial? (II Cor. VI.)

Have you come to destroy us? I know who you areâ€”the Holy One of God. This is not a confession of will, for which the reward of confessing follows, but an extortion of necessity which compels the unwilling. And just as if runaway slaves, after much time, see their master, they plead for nothing but to be spared the lashes, thus also the demons, seeing the Lord suddenly dwelling on earth, believed that he had come to judge them. The presence of the Savior is torment for the demons.
