This is not to be understood as meaning that he said that this offspring was to be mistreated or subjected to slavery for four hundred years. Rather, by hyperbaton it should be read in the sense that his offspring would be wanderers for four hundred years, and during part of that time slavery too would fall to their lot. “Because it is written, ‘In Isaac your offspring will be called,’ there are counted from the year of Isaac’s birth to the year of the departure from Egypt 405 years (which Scripture according to its usual practice calls 400), during which that offspring would be wanderers, either in the land of Canaan or in Egypt.” It can thus be understood that the hardship of 400 years may be counted from Isaac’s fifth year, during which he began to be ill-treated by the son of the slave girl.
