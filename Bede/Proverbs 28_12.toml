When the wicked rule, the people fall. Just as many begin to give glory to God when they see the righteous rejoicing in the progress of virtues, so whenever the wicked hold power, they expose many as accomplices in their infidelity. Which can rightly be understood of pagans, heretics, and evil Catholics.
