Now the city was exceedingly wide and great, and there were few people in the midst of it, and the houses had not been built. Typologically, these details correspond to that time when, as a result of God's word being spread far and wide by the apostles, the whole world received the new seed of the faith, and when churches had not yet been built but the peoples, as yet uninstructed, had merely begun to hear and receive the sacraments of the word.
