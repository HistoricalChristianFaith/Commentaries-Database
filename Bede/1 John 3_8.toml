We do not resemble the devil because of the way we were created, as the Manichaeans blasphemously assert, but because we have followed him into his sinful ways.… John describes the devil’s sinfulness in the present tense, because he is just the same now as he was in the beginning, when he first fell into sin. This verse also implies that the devil was created before anything else. There is no reason to doubt that the angels were made before any of the other creatures or that the one who was the highest among them became proud and rebelled against his Maker. It was by pride that he sinned from the beginning and was transformed from being an archangel into being a devil.
