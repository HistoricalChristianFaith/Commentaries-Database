The seven days suggest the light of the grace of the Spirit, which is received in sevenfold form. The reason why his son’s wife arrives seven days after Tobit is given the light of vision is that after Judea is given the light through faith, after it receives the grace of the Holy Spirit, the church will come in to it so that there may be “one fold and one shepherd” and one house of Christ supported on one cornerstone.
