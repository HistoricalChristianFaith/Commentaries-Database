Then he said to the vinedresser: Behold, for three years I have come seeking fruit on this fig tree and find none. By the vinedresser is expressed the order of apostles and teachers, whose prayers and admonitions suggest the constant care of the people of God. For the Lord very often complained about the unfruitful people of the Jews, that through the three years of his visitation, that is, in the legal edicts, in the prophetic attestations, and in the very grace of the shining Gospel, it remained negligent.

Cut it down therefore, why does it even occupy the land? Not by the apostles, but by the Romans the Jewish nation was cut down and cast out from the land of promise. But he says, cut it down, proposing to it the impending downfall with the counsel of repentance. Which by just judgment lost the land with the kingdom, out of love for which it did not fear to persecute the citizens of heaven, and to kill the King of heaven and earth, saying through its chief priests and Pharisees: If we allow him thus, all will believe in him, and the Romans will come and take away both our place and our nation. Also, by the land occupied by the barren fig tree can be figured the crowd of the Jewish people, who, pressed under the shadow of wicked rulers, could not receive the light of truth, and hindered by their bad example from being warmed by the sun of heavenly love. As the Saviour elsewhere says to them: Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, who shut the kingdom of heaven before men. For you do not enter, nor do you allow those to enter who are going in (Matthew 23).
