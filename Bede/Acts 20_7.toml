We can speak allegorically here, for the upper room is the loftiness of spiritual gifts; night is the obscurity of the Scriptures; the abundance of lamps is the explanation of the more enigmatic sayings; the Lord’s day is the remembrance of either the Lord’s resurrection or our own. And [this passage serves] to warn the spiritual teacher that if he is ever attracted by the sweetness of the resurrection and the joys of the life to come, and he arouses his listeners to the heights of virtue, and if in a lengthy discussion he touches upon any enigmas of the Scriptures, he should very soon, for the sake of weak listeners, shed light on those same [enigmas] by the lamp of plain explanation, just as the apostle did. When he said, “Abraham had two sons, the one by a slave girl and the other by a free woman,” he soon added by way of explanation, “These are the two covenants,” and so forth.
