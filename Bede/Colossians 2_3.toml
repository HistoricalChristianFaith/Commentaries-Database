The disciple’s leaning upon the master’s breast was a sign not only of present love but also of future mystery. Already at that time it was prefigured that the Gospel which this same disciple was going to write would include the hidden mysteries of divine majesty more copiously and profoundly than the rest of the pages of sacred Scripture. For because in Jesus’ breast “are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge,” it was fitting that the one who leaned upon his breast was the one to whom he had granted a larger gift of unique wisdom and knowledge than to the rest.
