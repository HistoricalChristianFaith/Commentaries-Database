He who deceives the righteous onto an evil path, etc. He who deceives the lovers of justice through heretical doctrine so that they deviate from the truth incurs the punishment he deserves for his evils; yet whatever good he was doing, whether by writing useful things or by living temperately, benefits others: to those, indeed, who, reading or hearing these things, take examples of salvation even from him whom they know to have perished.

In the exultation of the righteous, there is much glory. Certainly, they exult not over present riches, but over the eternal goods in the future. They rejoice not in the things of the world they see, but in the Creator of the world, whose vision they hope for; as the Psalmist says, Rejoice in the Lord, and exult, you righteous (Psalm 31). Or certainly, in the exultation of the righteous, there is much glory; because whenever the elect in this life exult for the prosperous events of the Church, much glory is given by the Lord from the faith and pious works of many.
