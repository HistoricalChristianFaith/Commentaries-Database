For he will be great before the Lord, and he shall drink neither wine nor strong drink, and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit even from his mother's womb. It is a great virtue before the Lord to scorn earthly delights entirely while preaching heavenly joys in the desert. But also this stands out greatly before the Lord, even though it seems to be despised by men, that he, of whom no one among those born of women is greater, was beheaded by the whim of a wanton girl. The angel, who proposed his rank of greatness, explained afterwards, "And he shall drink neither wine nor strong drink." Sicera signifies drunkenness, a term used by the Hebrews for any drink that can cause inebriation, whether made from fruits, grains, or any other material. It was a specific rule in the law of the Nazarenes to abstain from wine and strong drink during the time of consecration. Thus, John, Samson, and Jeremiah, and others like them, strive to abstain from these things always, so that they may remain perpetual Nazarenes, that is, holy. For it is fitting that a vessel dedicated to heavenly grace be restrained from worldly enticements and not be inebriated with wine, in which is debauchery, but rather be filled with the new wine of the Holy Spirit. Therefore, correctly, as the inebriation of wine is taken away, the grace of the Spirit is accumulated. He showed himself to be filled with this grace (as it was foretold), when he leapt in the womb of his mother at the entrance of the blessed Mary, recognizing his office of forerunner and, as much as he could, proclaimed the coming of the Lord.
