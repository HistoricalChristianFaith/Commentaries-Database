"She opened her hand to the needy," etc. This can indeed be understood concerning works of alms which are generally done for the poor, but it is better understood concerning the word of the Lord, which confers the garment of salvation upon souls. Of this the blessed Job boasts, saying: "I put on righteousness, and it clothed me; my judgment was like a robe and a diadem" (Job XXIX). The Church opened her hand to the needy when she revealed the mysteries of faith to the ignorant through the workers of truth; she extended her palms to the poor when she sent preachers far and wide to teach nations in need of eternal salvation.
