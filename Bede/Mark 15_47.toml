What is called “parasceue” in Greek, is in Latin “praeparatio”; by which name those Jews, who lived amongst Greeks, used to call the sixth day of the week, because on that day they used to prepare what was necessary for the rest of the sabbath day. Because then manwas made on the sixth day, but on the seventh the Creator rested from all His work, fitly was our Saviour crucified on the sixth day, and thus fulfilled the mystery of man’s restoration. Therefore it is said, “An honourable counsellor, which also waited for the kingdom of God.” He is called in Latin, “decurio”,because he is of the order of the “curia”, and served the office of aprovincial magistracy; this officer was also called “curial is”, from his care of civic duties. Arimathaea is the same as Ramathain, the city of Elkanah and Samuel.
But it was not an obscure person, nor a man of mean rank, who could come to the governor and obtain the body. There follows: “And he brought fine linen, and took Him down, and wrapped Him in the linen.”.
We read in Luke, that His acquaintances and the women who had followed Him stood afar off. When these then who were known to Jesus returned home after the burial of His body, the women alone, who were bound to Him with a closer love, after following the funeral, took care tosee how He was laid, that they might be able at a fitting season to offer Him the sacrifice of their devotion.
