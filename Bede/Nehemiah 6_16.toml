It happened... that all the nations feared, etc. Those who previously sought to terrify the builders of the holy city, to delay them from working, now fear themselves with the construction of the same city completed, and they are disheartened, recognizing that this building was begun and completed by the authoring of God. Thus also in the holy Church, when a firm structure of charity, continence, peace, and other virtues has risen, the unclean spirits fear, and the temptation of their strength is repelled by our forces, and rather promotes our victory. This can also be received concerning heretics as well as false Catholics; who, by the constant faith of the good working through love, either are corrected and amended, or being exposed are guarded against and expelled from the boundaries of the Church.
