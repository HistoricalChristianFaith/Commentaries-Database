[As an ancient writer says,] “The betrayer, out of his mind, found the punishment that he well deserved, namely, that the knot of the noose slew the throat through which the word of treachery had gone out.” He also got the death place that he deserved, for “in hatred of both heaven and earth” (as though he would be associated only with the spirits of the air), he had betrayed the Lord of men and angels to death, and so “he perished in the middle of the air,” following the example of Ahithophel and Absalom, who proceeded against King David. For him death itself surely followed by a well-deserved termination, inasmuch as his bowels, which had conceived the evil scheme of treachery, fell torn asunder, and his bodily cavities were exposed to the wind.
