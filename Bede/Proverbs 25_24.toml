"It is better to dwell in a corner of the housetop," etc. A housetop is a high and secret place. For what in Greek is called doma, in Latin is called a roof. Accordingly, in the Acts of the Apostles, where it is written that Peter went up to the upper parts to pray, in Greek it is written doma for the upper parts. Therefore, it is better to remain in the height of virtues, free from the bonds of a wife, and the secret desires of this world, than to be afflicted by the daily insults of a wicked woman through the use of carnal pleasure.
