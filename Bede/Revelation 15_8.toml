When she is about to preach to the nations, the church herself is first set aglow with the fire of love and emits the smoke of a pious confession, “giving thanks to God for his inexpressible gift.” “No one could enter the temple until the seven plagues of the seven angels were ended.” No one may be incorporated among the members of the church except one who hears the mysteries of the faith and is taught by our teachers that Jesus is “ordained by God to be the Judge of the living and the dead.” However, if one interprets the smoke to be the hidden mysteries of the judgments of God, these remain impenetrable and closed to mortal beings until the plagues of the present age are ended and the Lord then shall come, who both illumines what has been hidden in the darkness and makes manifest to what extent the coming of the antichrist will be useful either for the testing of the faith of the church or just for the blinding of the Jews, who have not received the love of the truth that they might be saved.
