The reason for this is rather obvious. It clearly offers the enemy an opportunity to devastate the land, that is to say, to corrupt the virtues of the church, if there is no teacher and smithy of the spiritual arms which the apostle teaches we must employ against the fiery darts of the evil one. For the wicked tempters take care with all their might to keep us from putting on the armor of God so that the two-edged sword might not appear in our hands and exact vengeance upon them.

Today some also leave the heights of Godâ€™s Word to which they ought to have ascended and listened to. Instead they go down and hear worldly fables and doctrines of demons. Deprived of all spiritual knowledge, they meet to read logicians, teachers of rhetoric and the poets of the Gentiles to exercise their earthly talents, just as the unarmed men of Israel went to the smiths of the Philistines to sharpen their iron tools for use in the woods or fields.
