But Saul, while he remained in Gibeah, etc. The people, persecutors from the Jews, when they remained at that time in Gibeah, that is, on the hill of prophecy, not evidently of understanding, but of reading only, and were delighted in the shadowy eloquence of the law and the prophets, which is in Ramah, that is, in the high place of spiritual sense, incomparable to other Scriptures, lifted up from the glory of an earthly kingdom, which in those times of the Antichrist is not doubted to be future, and all his associates in the same persecution surrounded him, watching, standing in perfidy, acting strongly to overthrow all the defenses of faith and charity.
