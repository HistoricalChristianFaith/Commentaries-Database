And Saul said to Ahijah, "Bring the ark of God here." Ahijah, also called his brother or his relative, is thus named. Therefore, the good leaders of the Church say, all the faithful daily waging war against the powers of the air, say to their brothers endowed with the reading of sacred Scripture and with greater exercise of virtues, daily offering themselves to God through the royal priesthood as a living sacrifice: they say, I say, to such who still see themselves agitated by temptations or behold the Church generally troubled by heresies, that, having revealed the mysteries of divine words, they should elucidate more manifest testimonies, by which they ought to use against the fabricators of heresies, by which they can overcome other struggles of temptations, with clear reasoning. But it often happens that the enemies of the Church (I mean the heretics or pagans) have so many and such great conflicts and battles of words or doctrines among themselves, that it is better that they be refuted by their own dispensation outwardly, than by the assertion of spiritual pages, proving that what they teach is false and what they do is impure: and it must be done as the leaders of the heavenly army, just as it is described that Saul did, who, when tumult arose in the camp of the Philistines and it increased more and more, no longer consulted God through the priest, but himself, with the hand of the soldiers taken up, hastens to pursue and urge to flight the enemies he had found to be discordant among themselves. However, Ahijah the priest, the keeper of the ark of the Lord, can also fittingly represent the very authors of sacred Scripture; who, whenever piously requested, bring forth the ark of the divine oracle they keep: they also bring forth examples of good works they performed; which was symbolized above, where the same Ahijah is said to have carried the ephod. Nor is it without reason that it is mentioned that he was the son of Ahitub, the brother of Ichabod, the son of Phinehas, who had been born from Eli, the priest of the Lord, in Shiloh. Ahitub indeed means "good brother." For many of the authors of the sacred letters also traced their lineage from priests: and being instructed by good brothers, as Scripture itself attests, also had some brothers who were not good: and today's readers of the same, equally instructed by good ones, yet cannot lack the company of the wicked, whom Ichabod, both by birth and by name, signifies as inglorious.
