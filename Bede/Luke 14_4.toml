He himself, after taking hold of him, healed and dismissed him. By provident dispensation the Lord heals the dropsical man before the lawyers and Pharisees, and soon disputes against avarice, so that through the sickness of this body, the sickness of their heart might be expressed. After many exhortations in his disputation, it is added: "But the Pharisees who were lovers of money heard all these things, and they derided him." Indeed, the dropsical man, the more he drinks, the more he thirsts. And every greedy person multiplies his thirst, who, when he has obtained the things he desires, pants for others even more.
