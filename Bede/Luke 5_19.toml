And not finding by what way they might bring him in because of the crowd, they went up on the roof through the tiles. They desire to offer the paralytic to Christ but are excluded on all sides by the interposed crowd. Often, a soul, after the sloth of the lowly body, turns back to God and desires to be renewed by the remedy of heavenly grace but is delayed by the obstacle of old habit. Often, amidst the sweetness of secret prayer and a seemingly pleasant conversation with the Lord, a crowd of thoughts intervenes, blocking the gaze of the mind so that Christ is not seen. What should be done in such instances? Surely not remain in the lower parts where the crowds tumultuously gather, but ascend to the roof of the house where Christ teaches, that is, strive for the sublimity of Holy Scripture, and meditate on the law of the Lord with the Psalmist day and night. For how indeed does the young man correct his way? By keeping, he says, your words (Psalm 119).

And they let him down with the bed into the midst before Jesus. When the roof was opened, the sick man was let down before Jesus, because with the mysteries of the Scriptures revealed, one arrives at the knowledge of Christ, that is, one descends to His humility through the piety of faith. And well is the house of Jesus described as covered with tiles, because under the contemptible covering of letters, if there is one who uncovers this, the divine spiritual power of grace will be found. But the fact that he is let down with the bed signifies that Christ must be acknowledged by a man still established in this flesh.
