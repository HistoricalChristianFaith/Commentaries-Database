A golden ring in its nose, etc. Even if you fix a golden ring in its nose, it will still turn the earth with its nose and hurry to immerse itself in a wallow of mud; so, if a foolish woman receives the beauty of the face or dress, she nonetheless turns her face to low things, spreads her beauty everywhere to overthrow the flowers of chastity, and loves to stain herself with the mud of pleasure. Otherwise, he who attains the ornament of divine words by meditation but follows it with a bad life has a golden ring in his nose; but like a pig, he does not cease to turn the earth, because what he perceived by the scent of knowledge, he defiled by an impure action. Therefore, such a soul is considered a beautiful and foolish woman, because, given over to carnal enticements, she is beautiful through knowledge but foolish through action. Otherwise, he who sees heretical doctrine shining with all the brilliance of eloquence, yet does not fit it with the understanding of wisdom, says here that a golden ring in its nose means a beautiful and circumflexed speech in the senses of a foolish mind; to which gold hangs from the speech, yet due to the weight of earthly intention, like a pig, it does not look upwards. Which he then explains by saying, A beautiful and foolish woman, that is, heretical doctrine: beautiful through word; foolish through understanding.
