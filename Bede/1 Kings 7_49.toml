For just as the tables are rightly used as a type of holy Scripture because they both minister righteousness to those hungering for the bread of the word and bear the vessels of the heavenly ministry, that is, they propose for our imitation the actions of the righteous, so also by these lampstands the words of God are symbolized, that is, because they give the light of wisdom to the erring. That is why the psalmist says, “A lamp to my feet,” and so forth; that, too, is why Solomon says, “Because the commandment is a lamp, and the law a light.” Moreover, the reason why five lampstands were placed on the right and five on the left is quite easy to see from our discussion of the tables. But when he said five on the right and five on the left, he added fittingly: “over against the oracle.” For the oracle, where the ark was, as has often been said, stands for the way to the heavenly homeland: “where Christ is seated at the right hand of God,” privy, that is, to his Father’s secrets. And the temple lampstands of gold were placed opposite the oracle because the words of God always have in view the abode of the heavenly city that they may instill into our hearts the knowledge and desire of it and inflame those who take their fleshy origin from the earth to long for and to merit a place of everlasting abode in heaven. - "On the Temple 2.24.1"
