Therefore all Israel descended to the Philistines, etc. And today, some descend, leaving behind the elevation of the word of God, to which they ought to have ascended to hear, and they listen to worldly fables and doctrines of demons, and by reading philosophers, rhetoricians, and poets of the Gentiles, to exercise earthly intelligence, as if going to the blacksmiths of the Philistines to sharpen tools for wild or rural cultivation, they come unarmed, that is, deprived of spiritual knowledge.
