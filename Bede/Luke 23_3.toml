But Pilate asked him, saying: Art thou the king of the Jews? And he answering said, Thou sayest it. By the same word, he replies to the governor, as he did to the chief priests, so that they might be condemned by their own judgment. And it is to be noted that of the two charges brought against the Lord, namely that he forbade giving tribute to Caesar and that he claimed to be Christ a king, Pilate thought it necessary to inquire only about the word concerning the kingdom. For it could have happened that that judgment of the Lord, where he said, Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's; and unto God the things that are God's (Matt. XXII), also came to Pilateâ€™s hearing, and thus deeming this accusation a manifest lie born of envy, he considered only the one concerning the kingdom as worthy of inquiry.
