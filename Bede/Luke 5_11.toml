And having drawn the ships to land, leaving everything behind, they followed him, which can signify the end of time, during which those who cling to Christ will entirely depart from such a sea. However, it should be known that this reading is not the same as the one in which Matthew and Mark narrate that two fishermen from their boats, first Peter and Andrew, then the sons of Zebedee, were called by the Lord. For Luke does not now suggest that they were called by the Lord, but only indicates that it was foretold to Peter that he would catch men. This was not said in such a way as if he would never catch fish again. For even after the resurrection of the Lord, we read that they went fishing. Whence it is given to understand that they returned to fishing as usual, so that what Matthew and Mark narrated would happen later, when he called them two by two. For then, not drawing their ships to land as if concerned with returning, but thus they followed him, as one who was calling and commanding them to follow.
