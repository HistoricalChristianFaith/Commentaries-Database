Now the day of Unleavened Bread came, on which it was necessary to sacrifice the Passover. And he sent Peter and John saying: Go and prepare the Passover for us, that we may eat. The day of unleavened bread of Passover refers to the fourteenth day of the first month, when, with leaven cast out, the Passover, that is, the lamb, was usually sacrificed in the evening, as has already been said above. Explaining this, the Apostle says: For Christ our Passover is sacrificed (1 Cor. 5). This Passover then had to be sacrificed, that is, it was decreed by the paternal counsel and definition. Although he was crucified on the following day, that is, the fifteenth moon, yet on this night when the lamb was slain, he both handed over to his disciples the mysteries of his flesh and blood to be celebrated, and, being caught and bound by the Jews, consecrated the beginning of his own immolation, that is, his passion.
