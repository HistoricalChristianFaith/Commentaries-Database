The prophet Gad said to David: Do not remain in the stronghold, etc. Prophecy speaks to Christ, which has not omitted to sing of his sacraments, that, with the fullness of the Gentiles entering, his faith should no longer strive to protect itself with the weakest safeguard from the insidious believing Jews of the Church but rather should see fit to save the remnants of the Israelite people according to the election of grace; who, fulfilling the prophecies of the prophets, will come at the appointed time to the long desolate hearts of proud people, but now to be exalted by itself, whose name Hareth fittingly means skepticism. Therefore, it is she to whom her author, as to a virgin betrothed to him but long deferred from the nuptial joys, speaks through the prophet: You will wait for me many days; you will not be a harlot nor be with a man, but I will wait for you (Hosea III). As the same prophet consequently explained what he said: Because the children of Israel will sit many days without a king, without a prince, without a sacrifice, without an altar, without ephod, and without theraphim. And after this, the children of Israel will turn back and seek the Lord their God and David their king, and they will fear the Lord and his goodness in the last days.
