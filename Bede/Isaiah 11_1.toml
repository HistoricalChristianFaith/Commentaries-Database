The prophet Isaiah bears witness that our Redeemer had to be conceived in Nazareth when he says, “A nazareus will ascend from his root.” The term nazareus has the meaning of “flower” or “clean.” The Son of God made incarnate for us can properly be named by this term, both because he adopted the nature of a human being clean from all vices and because in him the font and origin of spiritual fruits came forth for all believers, since to them he both pointed out examples and granted the fruits of living properly and blessedly.

Now [Mary] saw that she herself, who had arisen from the stock of Jesse, had conceived God’s Son of the Holy Spirit.

For it is history when something is reported as having been done or said in plain discourse according to the letter; for example, the people of Israel, after they had been delivered from Egypt, are said to have made a tabernacle for the Lord in the wilderness. It is allegory when the presence of Christ and the sacraments of the church are designated by mystical words or things; by words, certainly, as when Isaiah says, “A shoot [virga] shall come forth from the root of Jesse, and a flower shall rise up from his root,” which is to say openly, “The Virgin Mary will be born from the stock of David, and Christ will proceed from his lineage”; and by things, as when the people delivered from Egyptian slavery through the blood of the lamb signifies the church freed from the devil’s domination by the passion of Christ.

The seven lamps are the seven gifts of the Holy Spirit, all of which remain in our Lord and Redeemer forever and are distributed in his members (that is, in all the elect) according to his will. Therefore the seven lamps are set upon the lampstand because upon our Redeemer, the firstborn “from the root of Jesse,” rested “the Spirit of wisdom and of understanding, the Spirit of counsel and of fortitude, the Spirit of knowledge and of godliness,” and he was filled “with the Spirit of the fear of the Lord.” As he himself also says through the same prophet, “The Spirit of the Lord is upon me because the Lord has anointed me.”

The prophet Isaiah testified that it was necessary that our Redeemer be conceived in Nazareth when he said, “There will come forth a rod out of the root of Jesse, and a nazareus will go up from his root.” Nazareus can be translated either as “flower” or as “pure.” The Son of God who was made flesh for us can rightly be called by these names because he assumed a human nature which was pure of every vice and because he is the font and source of spiritual fruit for all who believe in him, to whom he also both showed an example and granted the gift of righteous and blessed living.
