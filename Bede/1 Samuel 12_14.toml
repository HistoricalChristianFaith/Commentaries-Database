If you fear the Lord and serve Him, etc. It is understood of all that he noted; because evidently by their merits, as the rule of their first king, so the entire kingdom which they demanded against the will of God, would have worse times in its latter days than in its earlier ones: and meanwhile, as long as they feared God, they would be blessed with good kings; and as often as they neglected Him, they would be punished with evil kings: and finally, when wickedness increased, they would exchange the kingdom itself, along with freedom and homeland, for captivity or death. Likewise, the sign of transgression and the hard-heartedness of the people was no small matter, and the more terrible because it manifested itself in a way unfamiliar to those regions: voices and rain during the wheat harvest, which in the promised land throughout the entire summer only come by great miracles, to thus signify that all who desire to rule themselves against God’s long-recognized will, and to serve their own desires, are acting in an improper order: in a time when after receiving the Word they ought to bear ripe fruits of good works, they demonstrate by their disordered morals that they still need the correction or exhortation of the divine voice to teach them the elements of the beginnings of God’s words. What if someone seeks to explain this reading allegorically? It easily occurs, considering that Samuel, as the king walked before Israel, declared that he was now old, but from his youth he had lived innocently before them with witnesses from the Lord and His Christ. Because now, with the prophetic foretellings reigning in the Church Lord Jesus Christ, the books of the law and the prophets indeed bear witness to Him; and everywhere affirm, that, with the witness of the Father and the Son, and indeed the Holy Spirit, the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just and good. Let no place be given to a Manichaean or his associates, in which they might blame the other writings of Scripture, not even one jot can pass from it, nor the giver of the same: nor does anyone who knows himself to be redeemed by the grace of new light doubt that the figures of the prophets have not aged. What is it then when he says he did not take anyone's ox or donkey? Because evidently the prophetic and legal Scripture did not deprive anyone of the triple duty of rightly dealing with a neighbor, or of the duty of correcting and instructing a neighbor, by suggesting anything evil. For the donkey, which by its innate gentleness is accustomed to carrying necessary loads and even people, signifies the love suitable to brotherly utility. The ox, which not only carries the imposed burdens of flesh but also prepares the fields by plowing furrows for the seeds, signifies those who, indeed, not only bear the weaknesses of their brethren but also by chastising uproot their sluggish hearts and cultivate them to receive the seed of the word. These two types of people, if I am not mistaken, encompass the entire company of workers of the Church. Thus Samuel took neither an ox nor a donkey from anyone; because old holy Scripture deprived neither the learned of the skill of teaching nor the simpler ones of the modesty of living piously with brethren. Furthermore, what it means to say: If you fear the Lord, and you and your king who rules over you follow the Lord: but if not, the hand of the Lord will be against you. And what he concluded with: If you persist in wickedness, both you and your king will perish together. For he who properly keeps the sacraments of faith, will follow the warnings of that God and Lord, of whom the only true king of Israel said: As I have kept my Father's commandments and remain in His love (John XV). But he who hears and does not heed the voice of the Lord, the divine hand remains on him until he repents. But he who persists obstinately till death, such a person, since he belongs to the most evil king Antichrist, will be damned to eternal perdition with him. For not only those who attach themselves to Antichrist in the end times, visibly rising against God, are considered to serve his kingdom: but even today, many who have been initiated into the mysteries of faith, when they immerse themselves in various crimes, are found to be serving his kingdom impiously: and it is said to them from prophetic reading: If you fear the Lord and serve Him, both you and your king who rules over you, that is, the Lord Jesus Christ, follow the Lord God, the Father of the same our God and Lord Jesus Christ; but if you persist in wickedness, both you and your king Antichrist (then you will have him as king) will perish together. However, what is mentioned among other things, and you will know and see that you have done a great evil in the eyes of the Lord, asking for a king over you; it does not seem easy to refer this to Christ the king, whom anyone who humbly seeks to reign over himself, does not do any evil, but a great good, so much so that anyone who neglects to do this one thing, cannot do any other good; unless it is said that, with the increasing sin of men, it happened that the Son of God came in human flesh to suffer; who if man had never sinned, would never have fought against the enemy in man: and therefore, after sending angels, patriarchs, and prophets many times to educate the human race, in the fullness of time, since He foresaw that men would sin more grievously, reserved His own coming to reveal, that where sin abounded, grace more abounded: and rightly it is understood, because those who did not want to listen to Moses and the prophets, but compelled the Son of God to come in the flesh by the enormity of their sins, did a great evil. Neither does the parable of the vineyard in the gospel contradict this sense, whose wicked tenants, refusing to give fruits in due season and after wickedly beating, stoning, and mistreating the servants of their Lord, caused Him to send His only Son to them. But what is said about voices and rains from heaven in the time of the wheat harvest can also be interpreted in a good sense; so that we understand the voice of evangelical preaching as spiritually thundered from the heavens, in a time when hearts yielding fruits to the law should be gathered into the granaries of the early Church. And it can be said thus that the apostles themselves were reapers in those who already knew the law and made it, in calling them to the grace of the Gospel: irrigators in those who had not yet known the words of the law, and of whom it is said: Lift up your eyes and see the fields, that they are white already to harvest (John IV). But concerning those, I planted, Apollos watered, but God gave the increase (1 Cor. III): it should be understood more diligently, and drawn to the imitation of virtue, that blessed Samuel, being rejected by the people and expelled from leadership, nonetheless did not cease to bring the word of zealous exhortation and the help of pious intercession. Far be it from me, he said, to sin against the Lord by ceasing to pray for you, and I will teach you the good and right way. O remarkable example of fraternal love, he, innocent of leadership, even a most holy prophet and priest, is expelled, and he considers it a sin against the Lord if he does not strive to elevate those who rejected him to eternal joys, equally by praying and admonishing.
