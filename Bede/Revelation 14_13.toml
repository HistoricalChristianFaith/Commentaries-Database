voice: Beautiful is now the agreement of those who speak. For behold, this one proclaims that the kingdom of the Lord is at hand, that one that the city of the devil is fallen, a third announces the flames of the ungodly, another the rest of the blessed; and he both utters his voice from heaven, and commands it as worthy of eternal memory, to be committed to writing.

The harmony of those who speak is beautiful. For observe how the one announces that the kingdom of the Lord is come, the other announces the fall of the city of the devil. One indicates the flames of the wicked, while another announces the rest of the blessed. This last one projects his voice from heaven and commands that it is worthy to be committed to writing to be eternally remembered. For the righteous rejoice that their names are written in heaven, while the impious are blotted out of the book of the living. “Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord.” I thank you, Jesus, that you bless those in heaven who on earth die in you. How much more, then, those who place their happy souls both in you and in your faith?… Just as he had said that the impious never have any rest, so he teaches … that the faithful, assisted by their previous works, will rest “from henceforth,” that is, from the time of death. For “when he shall have given sleep to his beloved, this is the inheritance of the Lord.” However, “the sluggard would not plow in the cold, therefore he will beg at the time of harvest, but nothing will be given him.”
