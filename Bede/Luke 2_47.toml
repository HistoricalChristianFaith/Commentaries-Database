And all who heard him were astonished at his wisdom and answers, and seeing him, they were amazed. Note the distinction of words, and diligently examine the mysteries of your salvation and faith. They were astonished at what they heard from him, and seeing him, they were amazed. And they were all the more astonished at the wisdom of his answers, the more they despised the fewness of his years seeing it. His tongue revealed divine wisdom, but his age pretended human infirmity. Truly, let these things astound the doctors of the Jews as if they were new, and let them be disturbed by a doubtful amazement among the high things they hear and the weak things they see. But let us, knowing that this is he of whom the Prophet once rejoiced, saying, "A child is born to us, a son is given to us, and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counselor, Mighty God" (Isaiah 9); let us in no way wonder at him, who has been made a little child and yet has always remained what he was, namely, God and mighty, displaying at times signs of his divinity, at times signs of his humanity to those he wished to instruct. But let us give thanks to him with faith, hope, and charity, because he who was great and exceedingly praiseworthy, though we did not know him, was born as a little child for us, so that by growing and advancing among the little ones, he might gradually lead them to embrace the secrets of his virtue and greatness.
