But the whole crowd shouted together, saying: Away with this one, and release to us Barabbas, who for a certain sedition made in the city and for murder, was thrown into prison. The Jews' request remains with them until today, which they obtained with so much effort. For given the choice, they chose a robber over Jesus, a killer over the savior, a taker of life over the giver of life, and deservedly lost salvation and life, and immersed themselves so much in robberies and seditions that they lost their country and their kingdom, which they loved more than Christ, and until now they have not deserved to receive the freedom of either their soul or their body which they sold.
