The priests and Levites, therefore, dwelt among the people, etc. The whole of Israel is mentioned, not only the ten tribes that were once called Israel, to distinguish them from the two tribes that were called Judah; but all who generally ascended from captivity, whether from Judah and Benjamin or tracing their origin from other tribes. For when the ten tribes were taken into captivity by the Assyrians and the Samaritans replaced them in their land, whoever remained broke and destroyed all idols, and with a whole heart began to serve the Lord and to offer their sacrifices in the temple, as clearly shown by the words of the Chronicles where it is written: So Josiah removed all the abominations from the land of the children of Israel and made all who were left in Israel serve the Lord their God; all his days they did not depart from following the Lord God of their fathers. And a little earlier under the same king, when the house of the Lord was being restored, it says: After the money that had been brought into the house of the Lord, which the Levites and the doorkeepers had gathered from Manasseh and Ephraim and all the remnant of Israel, from all Judah and Benjamin, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, they delivered it into the hands of those who were over the work in the house of the Lord. Therefore, those who remained, along with the tribe of Judah and Benjamin with whom they had been joined, were taken captive to Babylon together and then released to their homeland together, and each one returned to their cities, which they found empty with the fields and small villages. For no colonist had entered these lands while they served in Babylon, just as no one entered the lands of the two tribes, as Scripture says: If anyone had escaped the sword, he was taken to Babylon and served the king and his sons until the king of Persia came to power, and the word of the Lord was fulfilled through Jeremiah, and the land enjoyed its Sabbaths. For all the days of its desolation it kept Sabbath until seventy years were completed (2 Chronicles 36). So after this very long Sabbath, the land of Judah along with the rest of Israel received back its inhabitants. However, the greater part of the ten tribes, who had been taken by the Assyrians beyond the mountains of the Medes, never returned home; even if they did return, they could not have entered their cities because the Samaritans possessed them. About these, the Jews today make many Jewish and unbelieving claims that when their Christ comes and reigns, these too will return with the rest of their nation to Judea and reign over the entire world; not understanding the words of the prophets, who promised the kingdom and riches of the city of Jerusalem, not to one carnal nation of the Jews, but to all nations in Christ spiritually, which is now happening throughout the world. These things are said on the surface level of the text. But in a spiritual sense, the priests, Levites, singers, doorkeepers, and Nethinim dwell in their cities, and all Israel in their own cities, returning from Babylon; when both the ministers of the holy altar and the teachers, and the people of God themselves, each in their respective ranks, serve God faithfully; whether those who in the same rank have once been defiled or lost through sins but are corrected through repentance; or who, coming newly from the kingdom of the devil to the Church, have acquired a good rank by serving well. For the Levites or the children of Israel entered into their cities, not only those who had once been taken captive and lost these cities, but also those who were born from the lineage of captives and learned that they belonged to those cities by paternal succession. Thus, in a spiritual sense, the Levite receives his city, from which he had been exiled by the Chaldeans when a deacon of the holy Church, having once lost the virtue of perfection seduced by the devil, is restored by the grace of the Lord. For example, one who through drunkenness, lust, or pride had become unworthy of the rank he had received, and then again through continence, frugality, humility, and other marks of a better life, returns to the same rank more worthily. Again, a Levite born in Babylon enters his city in the land of Judah when someone regenerated in Christ sheds the guilt of original sin and, newly instructed in the Church, keeps the rank of deacon which he once received with regular moderation. For as he has been freed from the bondage of Chaldea through the grace of his Redeemer, so also through the execution of good works, in which the predecessors of the same rank have lived, he ascends to the walls of his own city. But those sons of Israel who were led away captive in such a way that they never returned to their homeland but left their cities and lands for others to possess; they certainly signify those who, by sinning so leave the Church that they never return by repentance, but rather leave the promised rewards to others who are worthy of them; to whom, in fact, the Lord in the Apocalypse, urging repentance says: Remember therefore from where you have fallen, and repent and do the first works. Or else I will come to you quickly and remove your lampstand from its place, unless you repent (Apocalypse 2). And again, suggesting to another who stands firm in faith not to fall: Behold, I come quickly; hold fast what you have, that no one may take your crown (Apocalypse 3).
