But a contention also arose among them, regarding who seemed to be the greatest among them. Just as it is customary for good morals in the Scriptures to always look to the examples of the preceding Fathers, by which they might progress to better things, and having recognized these, humble themselves about their own actions, so on the contrary, the reprobate, if by chance they find something reprehensible in the elect, as if they would cover their own wickedness by this or defend it as just, are most willing to gladly accept it. Therefore, they read with much more ardor that a contention arose among the disciples of Christ about who seemed to be the greatest among them than that the multitude of believers were of one heart and one soul (Acts IV). They much more tenaciously recall that a dissension occurred between Barnabas and Paul, to the point where they separated from each other, than what Paul himself said: For while there is jealousy and contention among you, are you not carnal and acting like ordinary men? as if the weakness of the saints should be proposed for our imitation, and not rather that, because they recovered from their weakness, they became strong in battle, especially in this place where even the cause of their contention is unknown to us. For it is not unbelievable that, according to what is commanded elsewhere: Strive to enter through the narrow gate (Luke XIII), they might have vied with one another, outdoing one another in showing honor. Indeed, for whatever reason they might have contended, let us look rather at what the spiritual master commanded than at what the not yet spiritual disciples did.
