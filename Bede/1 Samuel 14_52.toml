There was indeed a mighty war against the Philistines, etc. The primary cause of the mighty war against the Philistines was this, because Saul was gathering all the strong and fit men for battle to himself. For if the king himself were not encircled by the hand of a stronger military, by no means would he be terrifying to the neighboring enemies, nor would he powerfully incite them to war; but as in the former times Israel had served them most disgracefully without any hope of freedom; thus surely, thus in the Church, all who are dissolved from good works, nor are endowed with the army of spiritual virtues; because being idle and neglectful we sin, we pay the enemy's tributes of evil conversation with weak languor from the hostile ones. But when we recover from servitude to sin, we resume the hope of victory, the enemy rises, and attacks us with more frequent and sharper stings of temptations, so that if possible, he may recall us to the servitude of crimes; or, if not possible, at least avenge by fiercely raging the injury of his own contempt. But let us pass from our morals to view the allegorical deeds of the ancients; and in the very beginning of the nascent Church, the more the stronger and more fit men for spiritual battle Christ was gathering to himself, the more spoils of souls at that time and they were frequently taking from unclean spirits; but also they were enduring greater struggles of martyrdom from the same.
