Tobias asks the angel to take animals or servants, go to Gabael in Rages of the Medes, give him his promissory note, and receive the money from him, and invite him to his wedding, and he agrees. The faithful, namely the members of Christ, ask the Lord to take some of the believers and entrust them with the duty of preaching the word, and that He Himself might come in them to gather into His faith the nations that have not yet received the mysteries of faith, but have only heard of it by reputation; and He might graciously grant that they, through obedience of faith, return the talent of the word they learned by reputation; and they too might be gathered to the wedding of the holy Church, in which Christ is the bridegroom, in which He made new wine from water, that is, gave the spiritual understanding of the law, by believing and living rightly. And the Lord does not refuse, but receiving the prayers of those who ask well, daily gathers new peoples into the Church. It can be understood spiritually, as said above, about those nations which received the letter of the law through the seventy translators: and therefore they could sooner accept the faith, as they held it in known books.

Therefore, Raphael, taking four of Raguel’s servants and two camels, went to Rages of the Medes; and, informing him about everything concerning Tobias, received the money and brought him with him to the wedding. Raguel’s servants and camels are preachers chosen from among the Gentiles, through whom the Lord also gathers others. Servants, because they serve the necessity of those to whom they preach the gospel. Camels, because they bear the burdens of their weaknesses with fraternal submission of charity. Why there are four servants and two camels was shown above, where two cows and four rams are killed. Such, with the help of Raphael, bring Gabael to Tobias's wedding when holy preachers, with divine assistance, gather new peoples into the unity of the Church of Christ.
