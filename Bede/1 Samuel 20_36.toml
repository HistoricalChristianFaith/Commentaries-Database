The boy Jonathan collected the arrows, etc. The humble discipleship of the pious learned the deeds in order, learned also the sayings of the teachers, and attributed all praise to the Church; or, as we expounded above, he saw the disciples of Christ, whether still vigorous with life or already snatched by death, widely dispersed from Jerusalem, from where the word of the Lord had gone out, and recognized that all should be gathered into one heavenly Jerusalem; yet he could not know the divine secret, that salvation was to be given to the nations through repentance. For only those greater in the Lord, to whom it is said; But I have called you friends, because all that I have heard from my Father, I have made known to you (John 15), and he himself, strong in hand, and desired by all nations, knew this secret thing.
