Guardians of souls must not be appointed from recent converts or from the common crowd but from those who, freed by the grace of God from the battle of vices, have already trained themselves to keep their mind in Jerusalem (that is, in the “vision of serene peace”) and who can say with the apostle, “But our dwelling is in heaven.” About this people is well said that they appointed “each in his own turn,” namely, so that when their course has been completed and they have been removed from this light, others may immediately be chosen in their place to rule over the faithful; and that there may at no time be a shortage of those who make an effort to keep watch on behalf of the peace of the holy church “because of night-time fears,” since the truth of prophetic words, in which it is said to the same church, “In the place of your fathers, sons are born to you,” runs continuously to the end of the age. It is also well added, “and each opposite his own house.” For the guardianship of the holy church is duly achieved only if everyone shows concern for all the faithful but makes a particularly diligent effort to take care of those over whom he has been put in charge by God’s authority.

And I appointed watchmen from the inhabitants of Jerusalem, etc. The watchmen of souls are not from the neophytes, nor from the common crowd, but they are to be established from those who, having been liberated by the grace of God from the struggle with vices, have accustomed their minds to Jerusalem, that is, to the vision of tranquil peace, who can say with the Apostle: “But our conversation is in heaven” (Philippians 3). Of whom it is well said that He has appointed each in his own turn; so that, after completing their course, being withdrawn from this light, others immediately are preferred in their place for the governance of the faithful. Nor at any time are there lacking those who strive to keep vigil for the peace of the holy Church on account of night terrors, while the truth of the prophetic word always runs to the end of the age, in which it is said to the same Church: “Instead of your fathers, sons are born to you” (Psalm 45). It is also well added, “And each against his own house.” For in this way the guardianship of the holy Church is rightly perfected, if each one carries the concern of all the faithful in such a way that he is especially placed over them, to whom, by the authority of God, he devotes more diligent care.
