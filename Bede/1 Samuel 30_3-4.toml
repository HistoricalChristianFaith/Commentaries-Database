When the Lord came among his elect and the catholic teachers and saw the towers and roofs which once gleamed but now lay razed to the ground by the firebrand of heretical talk, he first moved his father with his prayers that the church be restored (as was fitting for him to do) and then he immediately attended to the undertaking of restoring it. The teachers lament the churches and souls entrusted to them, which they had begotten for God and nourished by the help but which had become corrupted from the simplicity of their faith when Christ’s help was delayed for a time. This corresponds to how David’s wives and children were led away captive, when his arrival was delayed for a time. But if his grace and aid had been present, they would not have been able to seize everything.
