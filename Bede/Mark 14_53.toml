And they led Jesus to the high priest. The high priest means Caiphas, who (as the evangelist John writes) was the high priest of that year. Josephus also testifies in agreement about this, saying that he obtained the high priesthood without merit from the Roman ruler. Therefore, it is not surprising if an unjust high priest judges unjustly.
