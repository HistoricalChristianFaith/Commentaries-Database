A certain Demetrius, a silversmith, etc. This Demetrius, who tries to disturb the way of the Lord, fulfills his name by his actions. For it means "excessive persecutor." Hence, accordingly, the temples he makes for Diana are built of nothing else but silver metal since silver in the Scriptures is usually indicated by eloquence, just as gold signifies understanding. And the cunning gentiles try to defend their religion not with any reason of understanding but with the mere elegance of words.
