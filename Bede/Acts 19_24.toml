This Demetrius, who strove to make trouble for the way of the Lord, acted in accord with his own name, for it means “persecuting greatly.” Hence it is appropriate that the shrines of Diana that he made were constructed of no other metal than silver, for in the Scriptures eloquence is customarily indicated by silver, just as true knowledge is indicated by gold, and the craftiness of the Gentiles customarily constructed its religion not out of any consideration of meaning but out of the empty brilliance of discourse.
