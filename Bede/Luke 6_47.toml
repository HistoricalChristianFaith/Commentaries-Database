Everyone who comes to me and hears my words and does them, I will show you whom he is like. He is like a man building a house. The Lord has spoken much above about openly good or evil things and has discussed much about truly and hypocritically good things, by which three persons I think the whole class of humans is comprehended. He concludes his whole speech with a simultaneously terrifying and delightful parable, by which he likens some listeners of the word to the devil, others to Christ, each of whom never ceases building his own house in the subjection of men throughout the whole time of this age. Therefore, whoever hears and does Christ's words will be compared to Christ. Because just as Christ builds, instructs, and governs one universal church for himself out of various persons, dedicating it sometime to eternal life, so too does the useful listener, according to his own measure, advance towards the heights through various pursuits of virtues, building for himself a dwelling of eternal habitation, in the present busily working to shape, polish, and bind together the stones with the glue of charity, but in the future rejoicing in the dedication with Christ.
