The apostles said to the Lord: Increase our faith. The Lord had said earlier: He who is faithful in a very little is also faithful in much. And if you have not been faithful in that which is another's, who will give you that which is your own? And so the apostles, who were already faithful in what is another's and in the very little, that is, in the contempt of earthly things, ask that faith be increased in what is their own and in what is greater. For no one becomes supreme suddenly, but in good conduct each one begins with little things, so that he may reach great things. For the beginnings of virtue are one thing, its progress another, its perfection yet another. Hence, earnestly seeking, they say to the Lord: Increase our faith.
