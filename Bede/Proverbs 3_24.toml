“If you lie down, you will not be afraid,” etc. It is clear according to the letter, since he who remembers to live innocently and justly before God, sleeps securely, wakes securely, rests and walks securely. But also, when the just man sleeps in death, he not only does not fear the powers of evil spirits, but also rests in peace and safely awaits the day of resurrection, because he has God everywhere as his protector and keeper. This is like in the Psalm: “Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for you are with me” (Psalm 22).
