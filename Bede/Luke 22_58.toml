After a little while, another saw him and said, "You also are one of them." But Peter said, "Man, I am not." In this denial by the blessed Peter, we learn that not only is Christ denied by him who says he is not Christ, but also by him who, although he is a Christian, denies being a Christian; the Lord, however, did not say to Peter, "You will deny that you are my disciple," but "You will deny me." Therefore, he denied him when he denied being his disciple.
