"However, what remains, give as alms, and behold, everything is clean for you. What remains necessary for food and clothing, give to the poor. According to what John also commands: He who has two tunics, let him give to him who has none (Luke 3). For he is not commanded to do almsgiving in such a way that you consume yourself in poverty, but so that after fulfilling the care of your own body, you sustain the needy as much as you can. Or it should be understood in this way: 'what remains,' what is the only remedy left for those preoccupied with so much sin, give alms. This speech applies to all things done out of useful mercy. For not only does he who gives food to the hungry, drink to the thirsty, clothing to the naked, shelter to the stranger, and similar things, give alms, but also he who forgives the sinner gives alms. And he who corrects with a rod him over whom he has authority, or disciplines in some way, and yet forgives from the heart the sin by which he was harmed or offended, or prays for it to be forgiven to him, not only in that he forgives and prays, but also in that he rebukes and punishes with some corrective penalty, gives alms, for he shows mercy. There are indeed many forms of alms, which when we do, we are helped so that our sins may be forgiven to us, but there is nothing greater than that by which we forgive from the heart what anyone has sinned against us. Or truly what he said: 'Give alms, and behold, everything is clean for you,' are we to understand it such that to the Pharisees who do not have faith in Christ, even if they do not believe in Him, nor have been reborn of water and the Holy Spirit, everything is clean, only if they give alms, as some think they should be given, since all those whom the faith of Christ does not cleanse are unclean, about which it is written: 'Purifying their hearts by faith'? And yet it is true what they heard, 'Give alms, and behold, everything is clean for you.' For he who wants to give alms properly must begin with himself, and give it first to himself. For alms is a work of mercy, and it is very truly said: 'Have mercy on your soul, pleasing God' (Sirach 30). Because of this we are reborn, so that we may please God, to whom what we contracted by being born displeases with reason. This is the first alms we gave to ourselves, because we sought ourselves miserable by the mercy of the merciful God. For this order of love it was said: 'You shall love your neighbor as yourself' (Mark 12). Therefore, when he rebuked them for washing themselves outwardly, but being full of plunder and wickedness internally, admonishing them of a certain alms that a man should first give to himself, and to cleanse the interior: 'However,' he says, 'what remains, give as alms, and behold, everything is clean.' Then to show what he had admonished and what they did not care to do, lest they think he was unaware of their alms."
