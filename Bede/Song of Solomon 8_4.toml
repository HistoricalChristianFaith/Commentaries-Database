I adjure you, daughters of Jerusalem, not to awaken, etc. For such souls are rightly called daughters of Jerusalem, because they are united to the body of the holy Church through the bath of regeneration, because they aspire to the heavenly kingdom, although on the foundation of right faith, they build not gold, not silver, not precious stones, but wood, hay, and stubble. Therefore, do not awaken, he says, the beloved with the tumult of carnal disturbances, and do not make her watch from the rest of her calm devotion, with which she delights to stand before the sight of her Creator. Until she herself desires, that is, until, having duly completed the services of divine worship, she herself, urged to return to the common care of human frailty, consents.
