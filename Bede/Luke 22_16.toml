For I tell you, I will not eat it again until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God. To the same extent Joshua's words agree, who said: Nor did the children of Israel eat that food any longer, but they ate from the fruits of the land of Canaan (Joshua V). -- I will not eat it, He says, until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God, that is, I will no longer celebrate the Mosaic Passover until it is spiritually understood and fulfilled in the Church: For that itself is the kingdom of God. Of which He elsewhere said to the disciples: The kingdom of God is within you (Luke XVII). In which kingdom the Lord still today eats the old Passover fulfilled, when He spiritually exercises in His members, that is in the Church itself, what Moses commanded the rude people to observe carnally.
