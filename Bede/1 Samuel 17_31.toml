The words that David spoke have been heard, etc. The words spoken by Christ about the glory of the coming kingdom were trusted and spread by fame even to the leaders of the Judean empire. And when many of these also came in part to hear the word, He spoke to them; lest they be troubled by the soon-to-be-weakened power of the old deceiver, lest they be disturbed by his soon-to-be-nullified fraud, lest they lose hope in the redemption of the human race, which was already about to come. I, He says, who for this very reason assumed the form of a servant, progressing to greater works of virtue, will conquer the ancient enemy of the world, the devil.
