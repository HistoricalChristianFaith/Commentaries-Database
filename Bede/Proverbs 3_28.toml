“Do not say to your neighbor, ‘Go, and come back,’ etc. This command is given not only about someone asking for alms but that we should be willing and ready to give generously and promptly. Likewise, all the commands of Christ, who said: ‘You are my friends if you do what I command you,’ we are ordered to do immediately and not defer until tomorrow.
