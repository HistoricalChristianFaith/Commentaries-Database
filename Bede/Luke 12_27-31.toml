It must however be observed, that He says not, Do not seek or take thought about meat, or drink, or raiment, but what ye shall eat or drink, in which He seems to me to reprove those who, despising the common food and clothing, seek for themselves either more delicate or coarser food and clothing than theirs with whom they live.

For He declares that there is one thing which is primarily given, another which is superadded; that we ought to make eternity our aim, the present life our business.
