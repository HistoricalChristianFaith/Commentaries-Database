But he said to him: A certain man made a great supper, and called many. Who is this man, but he of whom it is said by the prophet: "And he is a man, and who knows him?" He made a great supper, for he has prepared for us the fullness of internal sweetness. Because he calls many, but few come, because sometimes those who are subject to him through faith contradict his everlasting feast by living badly.
