And he said to them: Which of you shall have a friend, and shall go unto him at midnight, and shall say to him: Friend, lend me three loaves, for a friend of mine has come from a journey to me, and I have nothing to set before him. When asked by his disciples, the Savior not only gave the form of prayer but also the perseverance and frequency of praying. The friend, therefore, to whom one comes at midnight is understood to be God Himself. To whom we must pray in the midst of tribulation and beg for three loaves, that is, the understanding of the Trinity, by which the labors of this present life are comforted. The friend who comes from the journey is our own mind, which departs from us each time it wanders outside to pursue earthly and temporal things. He returns and desires to be refreshed with heavenly nourishment when he, having turned back to himself, begins to meditate on higher and spiritual things. It is fitting that the one who asked adds that he has nothing to set before him. For the soul, longing for God after the darkness of the world, wants to think of nothing, speak of nothing, look upon nothing except Him, and only contemplate the joy of the supreme Trinity which it has recognized and strives to more fully understand.
