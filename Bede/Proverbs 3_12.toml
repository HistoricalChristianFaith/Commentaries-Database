For the Lord disciplines the one He loves, etc. Therefore, we should murmur the less about the scourging with which we are corrected, the more certainly we hold in it the pledge of paternal love. Wherefore, he also says: "Those whom I love, I reprove and discipline" (Revelation III). It should be noted that the seventy interpreters said for this word, "And He scourges every son whom He receives" (Hebrews XII). This is remarkable, why the Apostle writing to the Hebrews in Hebrew would rather follow it.
