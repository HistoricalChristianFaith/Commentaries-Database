But when they came to the land of Zuph, Saul said to his servant, etc. From the fifth place of failed inquiry, Saul intends, as it were, to return. And the Lord seemed, due to the enormity of human transgression, as if he wished to turn back from caring for the salvation of the impious, when, in the fifth age of the world, the oracles of the prophets were withdrawn, the frequent communication with angels was withdrawn, and only the wicked deeds of depraved men increased. And indeed, the world was pressed by so many and such great crimes before the coming of the Lord, that the Creator of the human race seemed to be more concerned with protecting the just than acquiring the salvation of the impious. However, for the sake of the adversities of his chosen ones, the provident Creator wished both to prove the invincible patience and to sharpen desires by deferral more and more.
