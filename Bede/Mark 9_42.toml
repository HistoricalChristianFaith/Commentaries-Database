And whoever shall cause one of these little ones who believe in me to stumble, it would be better for him if a heavy millstone were hung around his neck, and he were cast into the sea. Although this general sentence can be applied against all who cause someone to stumble, yet according to the context of the speech, it can also be understood as said against the apostles, who, disputing among themselves over who was the greatest, seemed to be contending over dignity with each other. And if they had remained in this vice, they could lose those whom they called to faith through their scandal, while seeing the apostles fighting among themselves over honor. What he said: It is better for him if a millstone were hung around his neck, speaks according to the custom of the province, where among the ancient Jews the punishment for greater crimes was that they were drowned in the deep with a stone tied around them. And indeed it is better for an innocent person, however atrocious the temporal punishment, to end his bodily life, than by harming a brother, to deserve eternal death of the soul. And rightly, someone who can be scandalized is called little. For whoever is great, whatever he may see, whatever he may suffer, he does not depart from the faith. But whoever is little in mind and small, he seeks occasions to be scandalized. Therefore it is necessary for us especially to take care of those who are small in faith, lest by our occasion they are offended and withdraw from the faith, and fall from salvation. It is to be noted certainly, that in our good work, sometimes the scandal of our neighbor must be avoided: but sometimes it is to be utterly disregarded. For in as much as we can avoid the scandal of our neighbors without sin, we ought to. But if scandal arises from the truth, it is more useful to permit scandal to arise, than to abandon the truth. Also, by the millstone, the circular and laborious nature of secular life is expressed, and by the depth of the sea, final damnation is designated. Therefore, whoever has been brought to the appearance of holiness, or destroys others by word or example; truly, it was better for this person to be bound to earthly deeds under an outward appearance until death, than to demonstrate to others the sacred duties in fault as something to imitate. For certainly if he alone fell, somehow the more tolerable punishment of hell would torture him.
