The Savior’s name, because of which he is called “God with us” by the prophet, signifies both natures of his one person. For he who, born before time from the Father, is God himself in the fullness of time, became Emmanuel (that is, “God with us”) in his mother’s womb, because he deigned to take the weakness of our nature into the unity of his person when “the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us.” In a wonderful manner he began to be what we are, while not ceasing to be what he had been, assuming our nature in such a way that he himself would not lose what he had been. - "Homilies on the Gospels 1.5"
