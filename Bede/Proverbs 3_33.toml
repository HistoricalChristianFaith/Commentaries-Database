“The curse of the Lord is on the house of the wicked,” etc. According to the example of the rich man clothed in purple, who in this life lacked spiritual goods, and in the future came to such poverty that he sought a drop of water from the finger of the once poor Lazarus and did not deserve to receive it (Luke 16).

“The tents of the righteous will be blessed.” As the apostle says to the faithful, speaking of God: “Who has blessed us in Christ with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places” (Ephesians 1). And they are to hear in reward from Him, “Come, you who are blessed by my Father, inherit the kingdom” (Matthew 25). According to the letter, it often happens that those who for a long time prey on the property of others are finally consumed by poverty. But those who give their own generously often abound even in earthly goods.
