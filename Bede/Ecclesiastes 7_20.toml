There are less serious sins about which it has been written that “there is not a righteous person on earth who does what is good and does not sin,” and, “No living person will be made righteous in your sight.”

The Lord himself gives us sure confidence of obtaining what we properly ask when he adds, “Therefore if you, although you are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father from heaven give his good Spirit to those who ask him?” His disciples were good, as far as human judgment can see. He calls them “evil” because there is surely no one in this life who is capable of being free from moral faults, as Solomon states when he says, “There is not a just person on earth, who does good and does not sin.”
