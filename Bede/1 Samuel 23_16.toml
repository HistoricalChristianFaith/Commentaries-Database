And Jonathan, the son of Saul, arose and went to David, etc. And the dove-like and simple spirit of the elect, progressing amid the adversities of persecutions, often called to the grace of faith from the very number of the persecutors, approached Christ with steps of growing virtues, and strengthened the workers, that is, the teachers of his word, always in the divine assistance which comes opportunely (Psalm IX).
