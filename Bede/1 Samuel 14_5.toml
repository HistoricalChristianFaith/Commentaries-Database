A prominent rock towards the north, etc. Gabaa represents a hill, that is, the height of virtues; Magmas indicates the humility of the mind, from which virtues arise. And rightly Magmas is considered towards the north, while Gabaa is situated to the south, because in the coldness of temptations, humility is especially learned and proven; in the light of the grace of the helping Spirit, it is prospered and perfected. But since the ancient enemy tries both to hinder the prosperous course of granted virtue, and to take away the humility of the acquired virtue from teachers and disciples during adversities, rightly the ascenders against the Philistines, Jonathan and his armor-bearer, are impeded by the prominent rock to the north opposite Magmas, and the rock extending to the south against Gabaa. Yet, with the Lord acting on behalf of His own, all the savage efforts of the enemies soon fail. For, as the words of Jonathan testify, full of no less faith than virtue, it is not difficult for the Lord to save, whether by many or by few.
