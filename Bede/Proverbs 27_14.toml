He who blesses his neighbor with a loud voice, etc. He who blesses his neighbor with a loud voice extols him with the favor of excessive praise; either by favoring his evil deeds against justice, or by praising his good deeds more than is just. But he is likened to one who curses, because he greatly harms him, to whom by praising he either gives confidence in an evil action or diminishes the simplicity of a pure heart in a righteous work: namely that the good, which he had begun with an eye to the heavenly reward, he completes for the love of transitory praise.
