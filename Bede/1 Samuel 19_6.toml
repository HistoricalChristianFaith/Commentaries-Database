When the people of the Jews heard the voice of the apostles preaching, they were calmed down from the anger of their earlier fury and declared in a true affirmation of faith that the church of Christ would never be able to be wiped out from their midst and that the memory of him who is before all ages and endures for eternity would never perish. - "Four Books on 1 Samuel 3.19"
