When Saul heard this, placated by the voice of Jonathan, etc. When the people of the Jews heard the voice of the preaching apostles, they were placated from the wrath of former fury; and by the true assertion of faith, they testified that the Church of Christ can never be exterminated from the midst, never can his memory perish, who is before the ages and remains forever. This same people said these things in those who heard the voice of the doctors of spiritual matters, which Jonathan and his merits signify. For in whomever they did not say these things, they are those of whom it is written: And their ears were hard of hearing (Acts XXVIII). And elsewhere: And who is deaf, except to those whom I have sent my messengers?
