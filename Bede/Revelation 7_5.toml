Judah: With good reason, he begins with Judah, from which tribe our Lord sprang; and has omitted Dan, from whom, as it is said, Antichrist is to be born; for it is written, &quot;Let Dan become an adder in the way, a horned serpent in the path, biting the horse-hoofs, that his rider may fall.&quot; For he has not proposed to set forth the order of earthly generation, but according to the interpretation of the names the powers of the Church, which from present confession and praise is hastening to the right hand of eternal life. For this is the meaning of the name of Judah, who is placed first, and of Benjamin, who comes last. So, then, Judah is placed first, who is interpreted &quot;confession,&quot; or &quot;praise;&quot; for before the first step of confession no one reaches the height of good works, and unless we renounce evil deeds by confession, we are not fashioned in such as are good.  The second is Reuben, who is interpreted, &quot;seeing the son.&quot; That works are denoted in &quot;sons,&quot; the Psalmist testifies, when among the benedictions of the man who is blessed he says with the rest, &quot;Thy sons like olive-plants;&quot; and below, &quot;That thou mayest see thy son's sons.&quot; For it is not, that he who fears the Lord cannot be blessed, unless he has begotten sons, and raised up grandsons, since a better reward awaits the faithful virgins; but in &quot;sons,&quot; he designates works, and in &quot;son's sons&quot; the fruits of works, namely, an eternal reward. Accordingly, after Judah there follows Reuben, that is, after the commencement of divine confession and praise, the perfection of action.  But because &quot;we must through many tribulations enter into the kingdom of God,&quot; after Reuben follows Gad, who is interpreted &quot;temptation,&quot; or, &quot;girt.&quot; For after the beginning of a good work, it is needful that a man should be proved by greater temptations, and be girt about for greater conflicts, that the strength of his faith may be approved. And so Solomon says, &quot;My son, when thou comest to the service of God, stand in righteousness and fear, and prepare thy soul for temptation;&quot; and the Psalmist also, &quot;Thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle.&quot;  And because &quot;we esteem the blessed who have maintained sufferance,&quot; for this reason, after Gad is placed Asher, that is, &quot;the blessed,&quot; an order which is not unsuitable. For &quot;blessed is he who endures temptation, for when he has been proved, he will receive the crown of life.&quot; But, inasmuch as they who rely upon the sure promise of this blessedness, are not straitened, but &quot;rejoicing in hope, patient in tribulation,&quot; sing with the author of the Psalm, &quot;In tribulation Thou hast enlarged me,&quot; and also &quot;I ran in the way of Thy commandments, while Thou didst enlarge my heart;&quot; and say, exultingly, with the mother of the blessed Samuel, &quot;My heart is enlarged above mine enemies, because I rejoiced in Thy salvation;&quot; therefore, Nepthali succeeds, that is, &quot;enlargement.&quot; Moreover, he is followed by Manasseh, who is interpreted &quot;forgetting,&quot; or, &quot;necessity.&quot; And by the mystery of this name we are admonished, that being taught by the anguish of the present temptations, and &quot;forgetting the things which are behind,&quot; we should so &quot;reach forward,&quot; as the Apostle says, &quot;to the things which are before,&quot; as &quot;not to make provision for the flesh in lust,&quot; but as compelled by the necessity of human nature alone. And concerning this the Psalmist prayed, when sighing for better things, &quot;Deliver me out of my necessities.&quot;  Next to him is placed Simeon, that is, &quot;he heard of sorrow,&quot; or, &quot;the name of his habitation;&quot; in order that, by the character of this name also, he might more plainly inculcate both what is to be possessed here, and what is to be profitably expected. For the joy of the heavenly habitation will be given to those whose mind is here made sorrowful by a fruitful repentance; to whom it is also said, &quot;Your sorrow shall be turned into joy.&quot; In the next place follows Levi, that is, &quot;added,&quot; in whom we either understand those who by temporal obtain eternal things; as Solomon says, &quot;The ransom of a man's life are his riches;&quot; or those who, by following the counsel of God,&quot;receive in this world a hundredfold with tribulations, but in the world to come, eternal life .&quot; And to these, also belongs this that is written, &quot;He who adds knowledge, adds grief.&quot; For to this end also the bitterness of tribulation was added to the blessed Job, that having been proved, he might receive a greater recompense of reward. And so, not without reason, there succeeds him in direct order, Issachar, who is interpreted &quot;reward,&quot; because, as the Apostle teaches, &quot;The sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the future glory which shall be revealed in us,&quot; inasmuch as we fight with better success when there is hope of a sure reward. But God operates and perfects this in the habitation of strength, which Zabulon means, when &quot;strength is made perfect in weakness.&quot; So that the body, which is considered weak by its enemies, and through the material substance of which they also strive to bring destruction to the soul, is found to be invincible through God Who strengthens it; and there succeeds a happy increase in this. This is also denoted by the word Joseph, for it signifies, gifts and graces to be added, whether thou understand the increase of spiritual gain from the double return of the talents, or whether thou take it in respect of the offerings which are made to God the Redeemer by the devotion of the faithful. Now, in order that thou mayest perceive that all these, who both by the succession and interpretation of the names are shewn not to be placed without significance, will be at the right hand of Christ, the eternal King, in the judgement to come; Benjamin, that is, &quot;the son of the right hand,&quot; is set last, as said before, as the end of the line. For, after the last enemy, death, has been destroyed, the bliss of the eternal inheritance will be given to the elect. And this, whether each one of the faithful is rightly called the son of the right hand, or the whole assembly of the Church, of which it is sung: &quot;Upon Thy right hand stood the queen, in a vesture of gold, clothed in variety.&quot; So, then, from each tribe are sealed ten thousand. For in whatsoever virtues each one of the faithful has made progress, he must needs be ever strengthened by the faith, and instructed by the examples of the fathers of old. And it is most certain that frequently the body of doctors, frequently that of the whole Church, is designated by the number twelve, because of the sum of the Apostles, or patriarchs. For whether each one is counted worthy of praise from confession, as in Judah; or is illustrious from the progeny of works, in Reuben; or is strong from the discipline of temptations, in Gad; or is happy from victory in conflicts, in Asher; or is enlarged by abundant works of mercy, in Napthali; or is forgetful of the things which are behind, in Manasseh; or is still sorrowful, as in the valley of tears, but always rejoicing in the name of his habitation, while sighing for the heavenly Jerusalem, in Simeon; or is rejoicing together in the promises of the life that now is, and of that which is to come, resting upon temporal good things, added to the eternal good, in Levi; or is strengthened by the contemplation of the future reward, in Issachar; or is laying down his life for Christ, in Zabulon; or is labouring earnestly for an increase of spiritual substance, and offering something more beyond the commands of God, either in virginity, or from the abundance of his means, in Joseph; or is expecting the right hand of eternal bliss, with unwearied prayer, in Benjamin; it is fitting that each should be sealed in his own profession by the rule of the preceding fathers, as by the number twelve, and that from the merits of individuals, should the most perfect beauty of the Church, as the sum of a hundred and forty-four thousand, be made up.     &nbsp; &nbsp;   &nbsp;  THOSE FROM THE GREAT TRIBULATION          <a
