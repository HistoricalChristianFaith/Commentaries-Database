And he blessed God and said: Now you dismiss your servant, Lord, according to your word in peace. You see that not only the just of the New, but also of the Old Testament had the desire of future life in hope, to be released from the body, indeed they considered the way of peace to be laying down the earthly burden, as they did not doubt that they would have perpetual rest in the bosom of Abraham. Finally even Idithun, that is, the one who leaps over secular desires, after he had long silently contemplated many evils of the world, and had become fervent with internal meditation of the heart, finally spoke with his tongue, disclosing what he had done inwardly: Make known to me, O Lord, my end, and the number of my days, what it is, that I may know what is lacking in me. Behold, you have made my days old (Psalm 38). With these words, without a doubt, he reveals how greatly he hopes to attain solace in the end from the present calamities, which he desires to arrive as soon as possible.
