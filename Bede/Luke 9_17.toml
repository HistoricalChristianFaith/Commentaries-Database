Twelve baskets of fragments were taken up that were left over. What was left over by the crowds is gathered by the disciples, because the more sacred mysteries, which the unrefined cannot grasp, should not be neglected but sought by the perfect. For by the twelve baskets, the apostles are symbolized, and through the apostles, all the subsequent choirs of teachers, who, though outwardly despised by men, are inwardly filled with the remnants of the saving food to nurture the hearts of the humble. For it is known that service works are commonly carried out with baskets, but it was he who filled the baskets with fragments of bread, who chose the weak things of this world to confound the strong.
