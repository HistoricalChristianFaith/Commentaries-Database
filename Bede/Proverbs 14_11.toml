quote='''
The house of the wicked will be destroyed, etc. He indeed uses a house in dwelling, but tents on a journey; thus the house of the impious will be destroyed because they lose the habitation of the present life, in which they always desired to remain, as they die reprobate, and in the exile of perpetual damnation, which they did not foresee, they will undergo. But the tents of the righteous will flourish, because their present conduct, in which they are sojourners with God and strangers, with their merits constantly increasing, will reach up to the most delightful fruition of the heavenly homeland.
