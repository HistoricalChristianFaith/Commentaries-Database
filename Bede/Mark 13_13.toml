The Lords shows how Jerusalem and the province of Judaea merited the infliction of such calamities, in the following words: “But take heed to yourselves: for they shall deliver you up to councils; and in the synagogues ye shall be beaten. "For the greatest cause of destruction to the  Jewish people was, that after slaying the Saviour, they also tormented the heralds of His name and faith with wicked cruelty.
For when we are led before judges for Christ’s sake, all our duty is to offer up our will for Christ. As for therest, Christ Himself who dwells in us speaks for us, and the grace of the Holy Ghost shall be given us, when we answer. Wherefore it goes on: “For it is not yet hat shall speak, but the Holy Spirit.”.
This has often been seen in time of persecution, nor can there be any firm affection amongst men who differ in faith.
