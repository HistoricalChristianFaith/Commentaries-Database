And the multitude of believers was of one heart and one soul. Those who had completely abandoned the world did not boast of their noble lineage, preferring one another, but being as if born from the womb of one and the same mother, the Church, all rejoiced in the same love of brotherhood.

But they had all things in common. In Latin, "common" is said as "communia," which in Greek is called κοινὰ, from which it is understood that the perfect servants of God are called κοινοβίται in Greek, that is, those living in common, and their communal dwellings are called κοινόβια; for in their language, βίον is understood to mean life, not that life which is contrary to death, but the way of life someone leads in their conversation, whether in the military, or in agriculture, or in any honorable or dishonorable art, whether one is a monk, layperson, or cleric. However, the life by which we are distinguished from the dead is called ζωὴ by the Greeks. Therefore, those who live in such a way that all things are common to them in the Lord are rightly called κοινοβῖται, a name composed from two words. This life is certainly so much happier than other ways of living in this world, as it imitates the state of the future world even in the present, where all good things are common to the blessed, who see His glory from whom all good things come; and because there the highest grace of peace and security reigns, the city in which this way of life was first typified was rightly called Jerusalem, that is, the Vision of Peace. Hence, the distance of things and places is noteworthy, seeing that in the work of the prideful tower, the language and mind of the human race, when they were one, were deservedly scattered due to iniquity, so that although people spoke all languages there, no one could understand the will or words of their neighbor. However, in Jerusalem, the same languages were united by the merit of humility, and there was one language, one will, and one soul among all. This indeed continues to this day throughout the whole world, while the elect serve the Lord with one and undivided heart and intention amidst the manifold division of languages; but indeed the reprobates all serve the devil in such a way that the same service is carried out with mutual conflict and contention, because of which their city is rightly called Babylon, that is, confusion.
