Behold, your house is left to you desolate. The same city which he had called his nest, he now calls the house of the Jews. Which, not undeservedly, is left to its own dominion, stripped of the Lord’s help, because it not only despised being protected by that almighty bird—which Matthew names a hen under its wings—but also handed over that same bird, who wished to protect it, to be devoured by foxes, that is, to be crucified by Herod and Pilate. Without delay, the realm of those same foxes, that is, the kingdom of the earth, is given to plunder. For after the Lord was killed, the Romans came, and like stripping an empty nest, took their place, people, and kingdom.

But I say unto you, you will not see me until the time comes when you say, “Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.” The crowd indeed said this to the Lord coming to Jerusalem, but since Luke does not state that the Lord departed from here to not come except at the time when that would be said (for he continues on his journey until he reaches Jerusalem), it must certainly be understood mystically, that is, about that coming of his in which he will come in glory, especially since Matthew testifies that the Lord said this after the crowd's praises were sung to him. Otherwise, what he says, this is: Unless you repent and confess that I am he of whom the prophets sang, the son of the almighty Father, you shall not see my face. The Jews have been given the time for repentance; let them confess the blessed one who comes in the name of the Lord, and they will see the face of Christ.
