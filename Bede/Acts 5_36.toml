This Theudas, as Josephus relates, by his power over them persuaded many who were brought out of the city to throng to the banks of the Jordan. And, since he was a magician, he said that he was a prophet and that he could provide a way across when the waters of the river were parted by his command. Under the command of the procurator Fadus a throng of horsemen overtook him, and after the slaying and capture of many they brought his head back to Jerusalem.
