Descend therefore quickly, etc. That is, on the day when it was allowed to work up to the Kalends, he would go; so that through the Kalends, on which he said all should be silent, he would sit quietly. Jonathan therefore says to David that the Kalends will be tomorrow, and that he will be sought by Saul until the day after tomorrow. The early Church, having learned from him what to say to him, says to Christ; that the time is at hand when the Sun of righteousness will renew in the light of truth those believing or about to believe from the Jews; and that unbelievers will seek him, and in the rising of the new light, which happens through the hearing of the word, and in the increase of the same light, which happens through the operation of the heard word. For to those listening in the Church, and to those performing the commandments of the Gospel, they contrived deceits, of which the Lord speaks: Let my enemies be confounded and ashamed, who seek my soul (Psalm 35, 36, and 69). Jonathan was advising David to descend quickly, and come to the place where he should be hidden, and that on the day when it was allowed to work; and he should sit next to the stone Ezel, which is interpreted as departing, or going. The elders of the early Church were praying to the Lord that by the grace of his inspiration he would descend quickly into the hearts of the faithful, that is, into the place always receptive to his love, of which it is sung in the Psalms, And his place has been made in peace (Psalm 75). Where he should be hidden by faith from those who, disbelieving in Christian peace, would resist, and being given over to external things, would not deserve to view the mysteries of their Creator. The devout were also praying that he would deign to make his dwelling among those strong in faith, who were ready in spirit either to always advance to virtue or, having been perfected in virtues, to depart to behold the joys of heavenly life. But they desired these things in the light of grace for those present, at a time namely of doing good to all, and of running in the way of light, lest anyone be unknowingly overtaken by exterior darkness. These things also today as then, and as long as today is called today, the desires of the saints wish the Lord Savior to accomplish with insatiable prayers.
