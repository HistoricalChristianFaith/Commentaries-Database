The beloved is white because, when he appeared in the flesh, “he committed no sin, nor was a lie found in his mouth.” And he is red because “he washed away our sins with his blood.” He is rightly called white first, then red, because the holy one first came into the world from blood and later departed from the world through his bloody passion.
