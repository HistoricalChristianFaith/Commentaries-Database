My beloved is white and ruddy, etc. White, because appearing in the flesh, he committed no sin, nor was deceit found in his mouth (1 Peter II); ruddy, because he washed us from our sins in his blood (Revelation I). And white well first, then ruddy, because first he came into the world holy, and afterwards, through his passion, he left the world bloodstained. Chosen out of thousands, because from all humanity there is one Mediator between God and men, through whom the world was reconciled, alone among mortals was he worthy to hear from God in heaven: This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased (Matthew III), that is, in whom nothing offensive to me is found, and all the weight of virtue in which I rejoice. Hence Ecclesiastes rightly says of him: One man among a thousand I found; a woman among them all I have not found (Ecclesiastes VI): understand one shining with perfect justice. This needs to be understood in these words, the subsequent sentence declares, which says: Only this I have found, that God made man upright, but he has sought out many schemes. His head is the best gold. The Apostle says, because the head of the woman is the man; the head of the man is Christ; and the head of Christ is God (1 Corinthians II); which indeed head is the best gold, because just as gold is considered nothing more precious among metals, so the unique and eternal goodness of God justly surpasses all the good things which He Himself made.
