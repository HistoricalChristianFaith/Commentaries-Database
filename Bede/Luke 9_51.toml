But it came to pass, when the days of his assumption were accomplished, he steadfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem. By 'day of assumption,' he means the time of his passion, which drawing near, he gradually approaches Jerusalem. Let the pagans cease, therefore, to mock as if he were merely a crucified man, as the time of his crucifixion was foreseen as God, and determined to go to the place where he was to be crucified with a firm face, that is, with resolute and fearless mind.
