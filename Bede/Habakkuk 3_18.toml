“And [Joseph] called his name Jesus.” “Jesus” in Hebrew means “saving” or “Savior” in Latin. It is clear that the prophets most certainly call upon his name. Hence these things are sung in great desire for a vision of him: “My soul will exult in the Lord and take delight in his salvation.” “My soul pines for your salvation.” “I, however, will glory in the Lord; I will rejoice in God my Jesus.” And especially that [verse]: “God in your name save me!” as if [the prophet] would say, “You who are called Savior; make bright the glory of your name in me by saving.”
