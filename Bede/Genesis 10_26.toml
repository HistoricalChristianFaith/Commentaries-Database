Joktan begot Almodad, and Sheleph, and Hazarmaveth, Jerah, and Hadoram, and Uzal, and Diklah, and Obal, and Abimael, Sheba, and Ophir, and Havilah, and Jobab. All these are the sons of Joktan. Jerome testifies that he could not find the later names of these nations. "But until the present," he says, "because they are far from us, either they are called the same as at first, or those that have been changed are unknown." We read above that Pishon, one of the four rivers of paradise, which our people call the Ganges, and it is not doubted to be in India, surrounds all the land of Havilah; this land seems to have taken its name from this Havilah. Josephus narrates that he, with his brothers, possessed the whole region of India called Hiera, but the Chronicles also tell that Solomon's servants went to Ophir by the Red Sea, and brought from there gold, and almug wood, and precious stones, which are believed to be from the region of India, and to have taken their name from Ophir, the son of Joktan.

All these are the sons of Joktan. And their dwelling was from Mesha as you go toward Sephar, the mountain of the east. We previously said that Shem, the first-born of Noah, signifies those believing from the ancient people of God, Japheth signifies those believing from the gentiles; Ham, mocking the nakedness of his father and for this cursed, insinuates that part of the same people which, as remaining in the middle, neither firstly with their fellow tribesmen, nor afterwards wanted to be associated with the gentiles in faith. Therefore, the figures and places of habitation of these are most fittingly congruent; surely the sons of Eber, who is shown to be predominant among the descendants of Shem, are said to have extended their habitation from Mesha to the eastern mountain called Sephar. Now Mesha is a region of India which, when interpreted, is called Elevation, which signifies not a reprehensible pride, but rather that elevating of the mind to which the Apostle exhorts us saying: If you have risen with Christ, seek the things that are above, where Christ is sitting at the right hand of God; set your mind on things that are above, not on things on the earth (Colossians 3:1). But what is the eastern mountain, if not that of which Isaiah says: Come, let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the house of the God of Jacob (Isaiah 2:3)? which is rightly called a mountain because it raises all those climbing up it from the desire for lowly things to the longing for heavenly things. It is rightly called the Eastern Mountain, because it reveals the rising of the true light to all those flocking to it. It is also rightly named Sephar, that is, Book. For it is the book of life, in which all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge are hidden, in which the names of all the elect are written. Therefore, the dwelling of the sons of Joktan, who is interpreted as Little One, was from Mesha, that is, Elevation, going towards the eastern mountain which is called Book, because all the saints following the humility of the earlier just ones, of whom it is said: The Lord preserves the simple (Psalm 114:6), at the beginning of a religious conversation uplift their minds from earthly contagions, so that they may be deemed worthy to ascend to see the brightness of the eternal Sun, and to be instructed from the very book of life, which is the Lord Christ, with the pages of eternal wisdom revealed. Similarly, concerning the sons of Japheth, when it is said, from these the coastlands of the nations were divided in their lands, does it not most manifestly indicate by this very name the churches of the gentiles throughout the world, which, like islands, are continually beaten by the waves of the sea, that is, the swollen and bitter storms of the world, yet are not overcome; and now indeed, with the world flattering, they glide as if on gentle waves, now with it raging, they are struck by the upraised waves of adversities; but in the state of their faith, they nonetheless endure invincible? But on the other hand, the sons of Ham have the beginning of their kingdom in Babylon, that is, Confusion, which is in the land of Shinar, that is, their stench; and this on a plain, because neither do the reprobrates ascend the mountain of contemplation to seek the higher things, nor do they reach the tranquility of the intellectual islands, by which they might transcend with higher freedom of spirit the cares of the passing world; but they rather delight in being carried around in unrestrained wantonness in earthly desires alone; where indeed a fitting end follows this beginning, when it is said that the borders of Canaan were from Sidon as you go towards Gerar as far as Gaza until you enter Sodom and Gomorrah and Admah and Zeboiim as far as Lasha. For Sidon is called the Hunting of Sorrow, because nothing else ought to be understood here than that by which the ancient enemy hunts souls to destruction; hence it is rightly called the Hunting of Sorrow, because all those whom he captures, he subjects to eternal pains: such a one indeed is Nimrod the giant, who is called a mighty hunter against the Lord. Concerning Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighboring cities, there is no doubt that they portend the eternal torments of the impious.
