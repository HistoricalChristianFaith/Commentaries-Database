Nevertheless, I must walk today and tomorrow, and the next day, for it is not possible for a prophet to perish outside of Jerusalem. Therefore, what he says, I cast out demons, and accomplish healings today and tomorrow, and on the third day I am perfected (Luke XIII), is referred to his body which is the Church. For demons are cast out, when the Gentiles believe in him, forsaking ancestral superstitions: and healings are accomplished, when life is lived according to his precepts, after renouncing the devil and this world until the end of the resurrection. By which, as if on the third day, it will be perfected to fullness like the angels, that is, the Church will be perfected through the immortality of the body.
