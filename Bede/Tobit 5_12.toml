Azarias means “the Lord is my helper,” Ananias, “the favor of the Lord.” And the Lord intimates to those who believe in him that he is the one whom the prophet longed for when he sang, “Lord, you are my helper and liberator; do not delay,” and of him too the Evangelist says, “And we saw his glory, the glory as it were of the Only-begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth.” - "On Tobit 5.18"
