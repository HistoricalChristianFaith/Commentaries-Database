And we shall set upon us the precepts, etc. All these things contained in this chapter pertain to the care of the house of the Lord and its ministers and ministries. And the best order of religious conversation, to be spiritually imitated now for us too, is that first the children of the transmigration chastise themselves from the defilements of the nations; then, by the observance of the Sabbath, which stood out among the foremost commandments of the law, they are sanctified; and thus henceforth they turn all care of acting to the service of divine worship. For first it is necessary for us to be cleansed from evils, and thus to be adorned with good acts. However, it is long enough to discuss each of these allegorically, in what order we should spiritually act towards the worship of the Lord, and this more so in the very volume of the law.
