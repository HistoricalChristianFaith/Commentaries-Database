The wealth of the rich is his strong city, etc. Earthly wealth cannot always defend; indeed, many are captured or killed because of riches. Thus Ecclesiastes also says, Riches kept to the harm of their owner; for they perish in a terrible affliction. Therefore, it is better understood to praise the wealth of virtues, with which whoever abounds wards off all the plots of enemies as with an impregnable wall.
