Better is a dinner of herbs where love is, etc. Everyone who shows examples of good works to others, which they may imitate, invites them as to a feast by which they are refreshed. It is better to be invited to a dinner of herbs with love, than to a fattened calf with hatred, because certainly it is much more useful to keep the innocence of a simple life with love, than to shine outwardly with greater miracles of virtues and not purge the inner mind of the filth of hatred. Hence to certain ones saying in faith, Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name? And in your name cast out demons? And in your name perform many powerful works? The Lord himself will say, I never knew you; depart from me, you who practice lawlessness (Matt. VII).
