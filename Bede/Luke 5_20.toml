When He saw their faith, He said, "Man, your sins are forgiven you." The Lord, about to cure the man of paralysis, first dissolves the bonds of sins, to show that he was condemned to the loosening of his limbs by the bonds of faults, and that the members could not be restored to health unless these were relaxed. Likewise, to that paralytic who long awaited the stirring of the water by the pool of Bethesda in vain, when he was healed by the Lord, it is said: "Behold, you are made well; sin no more, lest something worse happen to you" (John 5). And well is he whose sins are forgiven called a man, for by this very thing that he was a man, he could not say, "I have not sinned," and at the same time so that He who forgave the man might be understood as God. Indeed, we must consider how much each one's own faith is worth before God, when the faith of another was worth so much that the whole man, that is, being saved externally and internally, suddenly arose, and by the merit of others, the errors of others were forgiven.
