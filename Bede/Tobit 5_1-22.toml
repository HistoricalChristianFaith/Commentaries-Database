The angel appeared to Tobias and offered himself as a companion, through whom he would accomplish great things for the people to whom he was sent. And the Son of God assumed a man, in whom, visibly conversing with men, he would save the human race.

Tobias brought the angel to his father, who greeted him, saying: "May joy be with you always." To which he replied: "What joy will there be for me, who sit in darkness and do not see the light of heaven?" He said, "Be of strong spirit, it is near that you will be healed by the Lord." And our Lord, through the miracles he performed in the flesh, showed the people of the Jews, from whom he had taken flesh, that he himself is the Son of God, and the angel, that is, the messenger of the Father's will. To whom he also proclaimed the joy of eternal salvation, saying: "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand" (Matt. III). And to those despairing of acquiring the heavenly light: "I am," he said, "the light of the world; he who follows me will not walk in darkness but will have the light of life" (John VIII).

The angel promised Tobias to lead his son to the city of Rages in the Medes, and to bring him back to him. The Lord promises to the believers from the Jewish people, although the same people are in large part blinded, that he will reveal the mysteries of his incarnation to the Gentiles, and again at the end of times, he will more broadly open the same to his people from whom he had taken flesh, accompanied and effected everywhere by the faith in his divinity. He speaks of the leading to the Medes: "And I have other sheep that are not of this fold; I must bring them also, etc." (John X). The Apostle speaks of the return: "Until the fullness of the Gentiles comes in, and so all Israel will be saved" (Rom. XI).

When Tobias asked the angel where he was from, he said: "I am Azarias, the son of the great Ananias." Azarias means "the Lord is my helper," Ananias means "grace of the Lord." And the Lord intimates to those who believe in him that he is the one whom the prophet, desiring his coming, sang: "Be my helper and my deliverer, O Lord, do not delay" (Psalm LXIX). Of whom also the evangelist says: "And we saw his glory, the glory as of the only begotten from the Father, full of grace and truth" (John I).

Then, having prepared everything to be carried on the way, Tobias said goodbye to his father and mother, and they both walked together. With the Lord appearing in the flesh, all things that pertained to the redemption of the world and by which the faith and life of the holy Church would be nourished and strengthened, until the end of the way of this age, were prepared; that is, his virtues, doctrine, temptation, passion, resurrection, ascension, sending of the Holy Spirit, faith of believers, and persecution by unbelievers. Having accomplished these in Judea, the Mediator of God and men preached through the apostles to the people and the synagogue, from whom he had taken the origin of the flesh, the joys of heavenly salvation and peace. And to those who wished to believe and receive, he granted these things through himself, and thus he came to the salvation of the Gentiles in those same his teachers.
