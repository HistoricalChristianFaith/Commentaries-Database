The God of our fathers glorified His Son Jesus, whom you indeed delivered, etc. In Greek it is more appropriately stated: The God of our fathers glorified His servant Jesus. For it was fitting for a wise teacher, when addressing those who had killed Him, first to recall His humanity, which could be delivered up and slain; then gradually revealing the glory of His resurrection, to declare that He is also God and God's Son. Finally, shortly after, he calls Him the Author of life. And at the conclusion of the speech, more openly: To you first, he says, God, raising up His Son, sent Him blessing you, that your sins may be blotted out, that when the times of refreshment shall come from the presence of the Lord, then your sins may be blotted out. The times of refreshment, however, signify the distinction of the universal judgment and the redemption of the just, of which they themselves, having indeed suffered tribulations but made safe in hope, say to the Lord in the psalm: We went through fire and water, and you brought us into refreshment (Psalm 65). For then indeed our sins will be fully blotted out when, by the power of the resurrection, the last enemy, death, shall be destroyed (I Corinthians 15). In a certain translation, we find this verse positioned this way for the explanation of the sense: That when the times of refreshment come, they may come to you from the face of the Lord. And indeed it is thus written in Greek, with the addition of that pronoun: That when the times of refreshment shall come from the presence of the Lord to you.
