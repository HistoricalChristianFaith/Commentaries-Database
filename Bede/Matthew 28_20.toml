Hom. Aest. in Fer., vi., Pasch. And they that are Christ’s follow Him, and pass in their order from death to life, contemplating Him as He appears with His proper Divinity. And it agrees with this that Galilee is interpreted ‘revelation.’.
This He speaks not from the Deity coeternal with the Father, but from the Humanity which He took upon Him, according to which “He was made a little lower than the Angels.” .
Beda in Hom. non occ.: He who before His Passion had said, “Go not into the way of the Gentiles,” now, when ris ing from the dead, says, “Go and teach, all nations. "Hereby let the Jews be put to silence, whosay that Christ’s coming is to be for their salvation only. Let the Donatistsalso blush, who, desiring to confine Christ to one place, have said that He is in Africa only, and not in other countries.
Beda in Hom., non occ.: It is made a question how He says here, “I am with you,” when we read elsewhere that He said, “I go unto him that sent me.” What is said of His human nature isdistinct from what is said of His divine nature. He is going to His Father in His human nature, He abides With His disciples in that form in which He is equal with the Father. When He says, “to the end of the world,” He expresses the infinite by the finite; for He who remains in this present world with His elect, protecting them, the same will continue with them after the end, rewarding them.
