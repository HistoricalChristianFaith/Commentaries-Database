I tell you that there will be joy in heaven over one sinner who repents, more than over ninety-nine just persons who do not need repentance. There will be more joy in heaven over converted sinners than over just persons standing still, because often those who know they are not oppressed by the weight of sins indeed stand in the path of righteousness, commit no unlawful deeds, yet do not long anxiously for the heavenly homeland. And they allow themselves to use lawful things as much as they remember not committing any unlawful acts, and often they remain sluggish in performing the foremost good deeds because they are very secure in that they have committed no grievous evils. But on the other hand, sometimes those who remember having committed some unlawful acts burn with love for God from their very sorrow, and strive in great virtues. There is therefore more joy in heaven over a converted sinner than over a standing just one, because even a leader in battle loves more the soldier who, after fleeing, returns and strikes the enemy bravely than the one who never turned his back and never did anything valiantly. But among these things, it must be known that there are many just ones in whose life there is so much joy that no repentance of sinners can in any way be placed before them. For many are aware of no evil within themselves, and yet they exercise themselves in the affliction of such great fervor, as if they were anguished by all sins, reject even all lawful things, are sublimely girded for the contempt of the world, rejoice in lamentations, humble themselves in all ways; and just as some bewail the sins of their works, so these lament the sins of their thoughts. Hence it must be concluded how much joy it brings to God when the just humbly mourn, if it makes joy in heaven when the unjust condemns through repentance what he has wrongly committed.
