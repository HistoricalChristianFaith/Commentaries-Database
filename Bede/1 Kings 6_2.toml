The temple was built of Parian marble, a white stone, to represent the brilliance of chastity in the church, concerning which the Lord says in the canticle of love: “Like a lily among thorns, so is my love among maidens.” [The temple] “was sixty cubits long, twenty cubits wide and thirty cubits high.” The length of the temple designates the faith of the holy church, through which it bears with long-suffering patience, in the midst of its good works, the adversities brought against it by the wicked. The width designates the charity by which [the church] expands inwardly through the essential working of piety. The height designates the hope with which it awaits the rewards of the heavenly life, [which it will receive] as a result of the good deeds it performs through charity.

Why is it said in the book of Kings [1 Kings 6:2] that the temple had a height of 30 cubits, while in the book of Chronicles [2 Chronicles 3:4] it is stated as 120 cubits? What is said regarding the construction of the temple in the book of Kings, that it had a height of 30 cubits, while in the books of Chronicles it is written: "Moreover, the height was 120 cubits" [2 Chronicles 3:4], is by no means contradictory, but both are to be understood as true. For, as Josephus narrates in his History: there were 30 cubits from the floor to the middle chamber, another 30 from the middle to the third, up to where the height of the porticos, which were attached to the temple on the southern, western, and northern sides, extended—that is, together 60; then another 60 up to the roof of the house: thus, the total height of the temple was completed at 120 cubits (Antiquities of the Jews, Book VIII, chapter 3).
