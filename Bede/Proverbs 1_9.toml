"That grace may be added to your head," etc. It was a custom among the ancients that those who competed lawfully would receive a crown on their head and a torque on their neck. Therefore, for us too, if we keep the discipline of our Creator, if we observe the decrees of the mother of grace, the greater clarity of spiritual virtues is increased from there. For grace is added to the head when charity, which adorned the principal part of the mind, is inflamed more ardently. And a torque is added to the neck when, with the splendor of perfect action, the word of preaching, which proceeds through the neck, is confirmed; and lest it be despised by the hearers, it is taught with an unbroken connection of virtues. But also in those who kept the decrees of the Mosaic law, when the Lord came, the grace of the New Testament was added with the hope of the heavenly kingdom. Whose exceptional splendor will never be enclosed by any end, like a crown or a torque. To us also, when the light of eternity is granted for our acts, which divine grace has bestowed, indeed grace is added to the head, and a torque to the neck, according to the Gospel saying: "For we have all received from his fullness, grace upon grace" (John 1); grace, namely, of blessed retribution, for the grace of righteous action.
