But He, rebuking them, commanded that they should not tell anyone about this, saying; because it is necessary for the Son of Man to suffer many things, and so on. Therefore, He did not want to be preached before the passion and resurrection, so that, after the sacrament of blood was completed, He might more opportunely tell the apostles: Go and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit (Matt. 28). Because it would be useless to publicly preach Him, and to make His majesty known among the people, whom they will see in a little while being scourged and crucified, suffering many things from the elders and scribes, and the chief priests. And it should be noted that the one who must suffer many things and be killed and rise again, is called the Son of Man: because while Christ suffered in the flesh, divinity remained impassible. It should also be noted that He calls Himself the Son of Man, but Peter confesses Him as the Christ, the Son of God, so that from both sides He is proven to be true God and true man.
