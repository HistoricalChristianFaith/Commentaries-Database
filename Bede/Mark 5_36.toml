“But Jesus, overhearing the word that was spoken, said to the synagogue leader, ‘Do not be afraid; only believe.’” The synagogue leader is understood as the teacher of the law, about whom the Lord says, “The scribes and the Pharisees sit on Moses’ seat” (Matthew 23). For if he himself is willing to believe, the Synagogue subject to him will also be saved.
