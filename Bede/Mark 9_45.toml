And if your foot causes you to sin, cut it off. It is better for you to enter eternal life lame than with two feet to be thrown into hell, the unquenchable fire, etc. In the foot, as in the hand, he teaches that dear ones who are incorrigible should be alienated from us, lest through the uncleanness of those whom we cannot correct, we too are polluted and perish. But just as the hand is necessary for us for our work, so such people are called feet because of their service and usefulness in our engagements.
