But that servant who knew his master's will and did not prepare or act according to his will, will be beaten with many blows. Many, misinterpreting this sentence, do not want to know what they should be doing and ostensibly think they will be beaten less if they are ignorant of what they should have done. But it is one thing not to know, another to be unwilling to know. For he who wishes to learn but is unable does not know; but he who turns his ear away from the voice of truth so that he may remain ignorant, this one is condemned not for ignorance, but for contempt.
