Riches add many friends, etc. The riches of the kingdom of heaven, which are preached to be given to the faithful by the holy doctors, gain many friends both for the preachers themselves and for the Lord, their Giver. But by the philosophers and other teachers of the Gentiles, since they know to promise nothing of certain blessedness in the future, even those whom they had are separated, namely, converted to the faith and the most certain hope of the Lord's promise.
