We are taught by their testimonies that “it is God himself and not we ourselves who made us”—not only to be human beings but also to be holy and blessed human beings. If by the gift of his grace we pursue him eagerly, always with a pure and untiring heart, he will be propitious toward all our iniquities, according to the promises made to our ancestors. He will satisfy our desire with good things, he will crown us unto eternal life not as a reward for the works of justice that we have done of ourselves but in the compassion and mercy9 that he has given us, for he lives and reigns in the unity of the Holy Spirit, throughout all ages. Amen.
