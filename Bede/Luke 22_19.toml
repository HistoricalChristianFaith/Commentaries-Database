And having taken the bread, he gave thanks, and broke it, and gave it to them, saying: This is my body, which is given for you. Do this in remembrance of me. With the old solemnities of the Passover having been completed, which were celebrated in memory of the ancient liberation from Egypt, he moved to the new, which the Church desires to celebrate in memory of his redemption. That namely, instead of the flesh of the lamb or its blood, substituting the sacrament of his flesh and blood in the figure of bread and wine, he showed that he himself was the one to whom the Lord swore and will not repent, you are a priest forever, according to the order of Melchizedek (Psalm 109). He himself breaks the bread which he hands out, to show that the breaking of his body would not be without his own will, but, as he says elsewhere, he has the power to lay down his life and to take it up again. And just as he had acted to end the old, so also to begin the new he gave thanks to the Father, giving us at the same time an example that in every beginning or completion of a good work, the Father who is in heaven should be glorified. But what he says: Do this in remembrance of me, the apostle Paul explains. For when he set forth the words themselves saying: Do this in remembrance of me, this is my body which is broken for you, and again: This cup is the new testament in my blood, do this as often as you drink it, in remembrance of me, he added by explaining, and said: For as often as you eat this bread, and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lordâ€™s death until he comes. (I Cor. XI).
