The marriage supper of the Lamb occurs when the church will be united with her Lord in the wedding chamber of the heavenly kingdom. “And his bride has made herself ready.” By always persisting in the works of righteousness, [the church] has shown herself worthy of the spiritual banquet and the eternal kingdom. One can also interpret this according to the parable of the Gospel, which speaks of the virgins who, when the bridegroom was coming, rose up to prepare their lamps, that is, among themselves to consider their deeds for which they hope to receive eternal blessedness.… It was granted to [the church] to be clothed with her own deeds. But it is not so with the wicked who, according to Isaiah, “weave a spider’s web and will not be covered by their works, for their works are without benefit.”
