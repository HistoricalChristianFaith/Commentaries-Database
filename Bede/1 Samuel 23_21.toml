And Saul said: Blessed be you of the Lord, etc. They promise the blessing of the Lord to themselves and their Jewish supporters when, having a zeal for God, but not according to knowledge, they either pursue the name of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, with hatred, or with arms. And as the Lord says elsewhere about them and their accomplices: "The time is coming that anyone who kills you will think he is offering a service to God" (John 16). But woe to their blessings, who, plotting against the Church, or at least against any of the Church's members, to scandalize anyone of the little ones of Christ, are proven to harm in the place of persecutors. Woe to those who, reaching to that flower rising from the root of Jesse only in name, seek with all their mind the withering and quickly perishing comforts of the present life; forgetting the blessing of Him, which is to be seen and hoped for by all, of which it is written: "The Lord hath been mindful of us and will bless us. He will bless the house of Israel, he will bless the house of Aaron" (Psalm 113). But blessing both, he blessed all who fear the Lord. You ask: Whom both? It is answered, the small with the great, that is, the house of Israel with the house of Aaron; those indeed who from that very nation have believed in the Savior Jesus, because not all those pleased God; but if indeed not all of them believed, has their unbelief made the faith of God without effect? By no means. For not all who are of Israel are Israelites; nor are all children of Abraham's seed; as it is written, "The remnant shall be saved" (Isaiah 10). By that oracle of Isaiah, some of the Jews are foretold to attain this heavenly blessing, so that the greater part of them is blinded; whose type and figure Saul, rejected by God, bore, and in whose place the gentiles were appointed; for other sheep joined which were not of this fold, so that there might be one flock and one shepherd (John 10); the faith of all nations joined, and the number increased not only of wise shepherds but also of obedient peoples; to whom many blessings of God have been promised, as it is said: "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Christ" (Ephesians 1); but God has blessed us, not with one blessing, but with all. Not that we all attain everything, but while each of us possesses one or several from all, we all possess through each one. And not in earthly blessings, imitating the Jews, of whom Isaiah said: "If you are willing and obedient, you shall eat the good of the land" (Isaiah 1), but in spiritual ones. For there are indeed earthly blessings, to have children; to overflow with wealth, to rejoice in honor and health; which earthly blessing extends even to irrational animals, it is said of them: "And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the earth" (Genesis 1). But the spiritual blessings are in heavenly places, for the earth does not hold a spiritual blessing. For even those blessings which in Leviticus are promised to those observing God's precepts, for instance, to lend to foreign nations, to have barns full of grain, to be blessed in cities, to be blessed in fields, and the like, we do not see fulfilled in the prophets, who wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins, being destitute, afflicted, tormented; of whom the world was not worthy, wandering in deserts, and in mountains, and in dens and caves of the earth. Therefore, all things are to be understood spiritually; and spiritual things are to be awaited not in earthly places, but heavenly.
