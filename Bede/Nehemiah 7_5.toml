And I rebuked the nobles and officials and said to them, 'Are each of you to exact interest from your own brethren?' And I called together a large meeting against them, and said to them: 'We, as you know, have bought back /850/ our brethren the Jews who were sold to the Gentiles, according to our means, and now you are selling our brothers, and we are buying them?', and so on until it says: 'I and my brethren and my servants have lent money and grain to very many people.
