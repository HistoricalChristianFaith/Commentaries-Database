This wailing of the kings, of the merchants and of the seamen of Babylon may be interpreted in a twofold sense. On the one hand, it may mean that on the day of judgment when all the glory of the world is passing away, only penitence for their former life will remain for the impious, who will then say, “What has pride profited us? Or what has the vaunting of riches brought us? All these things will pass away as a cloud.” On the other hand, it may mean that when in the present age an abundance of things ceases and the downfall of various nations is approaching, the opportunity for carnal pleasures, which was everywhere present for the sating of the desires of the wicked, will have been taken away. “They see the smoke of her burning.” That is, when they see the evidence of its destruction, for smoke arises from fire. Indeed, what else is the rioting of this world and its crumbling other than the smoke of Gehenna, which is close at hand?
