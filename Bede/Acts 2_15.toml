In order to proclaim to the world the glory of the indivisible Trinity, the Holy Spirit descended appropriately at the third hour. And since it was said above, “They were persevering in prayer,” they quite rightly received the Holy Spirit at the hour of prayer, so that it might be shown to readers that it is not easy to receive the grace of the Holy Spirit unless the mind is raised from material things by concentration on the things that are above. Now we read that three times a day Daniel bent his knees and prayed, and the church understands these to have been the third, sixth and ninth hours. Also the Lord sent the Holy Spirit at the third hour, he himself ascended the cross at the sixth, and he yielded up his soul at the ninth. He thus saw fit to enjoin these same hours preeminently upon the rest of us and to sanctify them.
