For these are not drunk, as you suppose, seeing it is but the third hour of the day. The Holy Spirit, about to proclaim the glory of the indivisible Trinity, came down fittingly at the third hour. And because it is said above: They were persevering in prayer, they rightly receive the Holy Spirit at the hour of prayer, to show readers that the grace of the Holy Spirit is not easily received unless the mind is elevated from carnal intentions to those of the heavens. For the three times at which Daniel is read to bend his knees and pray in the day, that is the third, sixth, and ninth hour, are understood by the Church. Because the Lord, sending the Holy Spirit at the third hour, ascending the cross at the sixth, and laying down His soul at the ninth, deemed fit to make known and to sanctify these hours for us more excellently than the others.
