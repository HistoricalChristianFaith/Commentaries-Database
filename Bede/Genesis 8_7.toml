He went out and returned, until the waters were dried up from the earth. It does not say he went out and returned to the ark; but he went out and returned, it says, until the waters were dried up from the earth, because obviously he was turning here and there with uncertain flight, now beginning to go away, now returning as if about to enter the ark, but not really seeking the window he had left, but rather wandering outside until, the waters being removed, he would find rest and a place for himself outside the ark; his going out and journey are rightly compared to those who, although initiated and imbued with heavenly sacraments, do not lay aside the blackness of earthly delight, but rather love the broad paths of the world more than the confines of ecclesiastical conversation.
