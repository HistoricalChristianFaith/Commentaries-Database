To give prudence to the simple, etc. He calls simple those who have recently begun to listen to wisdom; the youth, who has already made some progress in listening to it. And perhaps he calls the simple in the plural number and youth in the singular, because the teaching of wisdom receives characters devoted to various emotions and manners of living, and leads them in the way of becoming more perfect in virtue. Of such it is rightly said: The multitude of those who believed were of one heart and one soul (Acts IV). To give, he says, prudence to the simple. This indeed is necessary for the untrained and the beginners, so that by determining and avoiding the craftiness of sophisms, they can be prevented from being drawn away from the simplicity of true wisdom, which leads to life. To the youth, knowledge and understanding, because one who prudently avoids falsehood will consequently receive the understanding of the truth. So far the preface; hence the text of the Parables begins.
