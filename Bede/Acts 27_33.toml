A most beautiful allegorical sense is evident in this passage, when Paul persuaded the men he had promised would be saved from shipwreck to take food; also in the fact that in the middle of the night they were kept from going wrong by four anchors in the violence of the waves; and that with the coming of day they climbed out onto a point of land. No one escapes the tempests of this world except those who are nourished by the bread of life, and one who in the night of present tribulations depends for all his strength on wisdom, fortitude, temperance and justice will soon, with the shining forth of divine help, reach the port of salvation which he had sought, provided that, unencumbered by things of the world, he seeks only the flame of love with which he may warm his heart.
