Tobit’s relatives taunted him, and even his wife upbraided him as if he had served God in vain. But he rebuked and instructed them and turned to God in prayer. There were some among that people who with foolish temerity treated with derision the misfortunes of his people because they were already far from the original happiness of their holy ancestors who once nobly served God in their midst. But the same people earnestly took care to correct these through all their more learned and chosen ones and turned to imploring God’s mercy to obtain eternal life. Nor should it seem absurd that this Tobit, blind as he was and preaching God’s word, is said to signify both reprobate and elect alike. For the patriarch Jacob too, while wrestling with the angel, was both lamed and blessed, signifying, that is, by his limping the unbelievers of his nation and by his blessing the believers.
