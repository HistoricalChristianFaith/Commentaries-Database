hundred: That is, through all the four parts of the world. For quaternity is multiplied by itself, as in the four faces with four sides, and the wheels. Tichonius interprets the reaper and the grape-gatherer of the Church, as it becomes glorious after the flames of persecution, and holds the power of binding and loosing. The angel from the temple, or the altar, proclaims the empire of the blood-red Lord, not with open voice, but by the suggestion of the Holy Spirit, Whose operation is in His body, and shows that it is now the time for the bad to be accursed; and he has power over the fire, namely, that which went forth from the mouth of the witnesses, and devoured their adversaries. Thus far concerning the conflict of the Church, and the perfect end of either contest.                 <a

blood: There went forth vengeance, even to the rulers of the people. For in the last contest there went forth vengeance even to the devil and his angels, because of the blood of the saints which was shed; as it is written, &quot;In blood thou hast sinned, and blood pursueth thee.&quot; Concerning the horses, it has been spoken above.

Should this harvest and vintage pertain only to the evil, the winepress signifies punishment. However, should they also pertain to the good, then the treading of the winepress and the threshing of the floor grinds down that which is useless and tests that which is useful. For it is as the apostle said, precious metals are tested by fire, but wood, hay and stubble are consumed by fire. And both are accomplished outside the heavenly Jerusalem. The winevat of wrath is so called by a manner of speaking, as it is said: “On the evil day the Lord delivered him.” … Tyconius interprets the harvester and the vintager to be the church, which shines after the fires of persecution and holds the power of binding and loosing. He says that the angels from the temple and the altar announce the kingdom of the Lord, not with an audible voice but by the suggestion of the Holy Spirit who works in [Christ’s] body and teaches that now is the time for the evil to be accursed. And he has power over the fire, that is, that which comes out of the mouth of the witnesses and consumes their enemies.
