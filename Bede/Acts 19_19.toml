In the Gospel, too, debtors are forgiven debts that number fifty and five hundred denarii because, I believe, while we are subsisting with the five senses of the body in this life, we transgress the commandments of the Decalogue. Here, however, because of the enormity of the crime of magic, the number [fifty] is increased a thousandfold. Alternatively, “the number fifty is” often “related to repentance” and to the pardon of sins. Hence also the fiftieth psalm is the psalm of repentance, and the fiftieth year is the year of pardon.
