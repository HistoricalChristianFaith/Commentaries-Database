Let us strive with all our strength of soul to arrive there. Let us make our way there by the inward affection of our heart. Let us long [to arrive] there. Let us beg all together, and let us beg individually, of the Maker of that house, that we may dwell in his house all days of our life.

The Lord, born a human being among human beings, did what God, by divine inspiration through [his] angels, prescribed for human beings to do. He himself kept the law that he gave in order to show us, who are human beings pure and simple, that whatever God orders is to be observed in everything. Let us follow the path of his human way of life if we take delight in looking on the glory of his divinity, if we want to dwell in his eternal home in heaven all the days of our lives, if it delights [us] to see the Lordâ€™s will and to be shielded by his holy temple. And lest we be forever buffeted by the wind of wickedness, let us remember to frequent the house, the church of the present time, with the requisite offerings of pure petitions.
