Her ways are beautiful ways, etc. His actions and teachings contained in the Gospels are beautiful because they are divine and pure, far surpassing the manner of man, and all his commands lead to eternal peace. All that he did in the flesh pertains to reconciling mortals to God, to making peace with the angels for humankind, and to demonstrating to his followers examples of maintaining mutual peace and love.
