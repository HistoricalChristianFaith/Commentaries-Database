All the days of the earth, seedtime and harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter, night and day, shall not cease. For when he had said all the days, he immediately added of the earth, so that you may understand that during all the days in which the earth will have its present state, men should be free from the threat of a universal flood; yet the time will not fail when, ceasing this succession of fleeting events which is carried out annually, the whole world with its living things will perish by fire, as Peter attests, who says: For the heavens existed long ago, and the earth was formed out of water and by means of water by the word of God, by means of which the world that then existed was deluged with water and perished. But by the same word the present heavens and earth are stored up for fire, being kept until the day of judgment (2 Peter 3:5). It should be noted here that the heavens which he says were destroyed by water or will perish by fire are none other than this turbulent air which is nearest to the earth, from which the birds of the air are named because they fly in it. For the ethereal or starry heavens are not to be consumed by fire, just as they were not consumed by water.
