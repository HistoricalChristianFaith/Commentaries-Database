And with many such parables he spoke the word to them, as they were able to hear it. But without a parable he did not speak to them. But privately he expounded all things to his disciples. This is not said as if he spoke no plain words to the crowds, but that he spoke to them only in parables: rather, it is because almost no speech of his can be found in which something of parables is not interwoven.
