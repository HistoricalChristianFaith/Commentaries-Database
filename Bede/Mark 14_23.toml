And taking the cup and giving thanks, he gave it to them, and they all drank from it. As he is said to be approaching his passion, he is reported to have given thanks when he took the bread. Therefore, he gives thanks, who bears the lashes of another’s iniquity. And he who showed nothing worthy of being struck, humbly blesses in the beating, to show by this what each person should do under the lash of their own fault, if he bears the lashes of another’s fault with equanimity; to show by this what a subject should do in correction if, placed under the lash, he gives equal thanks to the father.
