wonders in heaven:
when with the Lord's birth a new star appeared, and when his ascending of the cross the sun was dimmed and heaven itself was covered with darkness (Mt. 2:2; 27:45). 

Signs on the earth:
when, with the Lord's breathing forth of his spirit, the earth trembled violently, broke open tombs, split apart rocks, and brought forth alive again the bodies of many of the saints who had fallen asleep (Mt. 27:51-52).

[The blood is] of the Lord’s side; the fire of the Holy Spirit; the vapor of compunction and tears, because just as smoke is produced from fire, so vapor is produced from the ardor of the Holy Spirit. And as for blood flowing in a vigorous stream from [the Lord’s] dead flesh, because this is contrary to the nature of our bodies it remains [for us] to believe that this was done for a sign. A sign of what, to be sure, if not of our salvation and the life that is born from his death? It is also possible to understand the fire as the enlightening of the faithful, and the vapor of smoke as the blindness of the Jews who did not believe. Similarly when about to give the law the Lord descended in fire and smoke because through the brilliance of his manifestation he enlightened the humble, and through the murky smoke of error he dimmed the eyes of the proud.
