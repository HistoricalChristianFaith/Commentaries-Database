Blood and fire and vapor of smoke. The blood of the Lord’s side, the fire of the Holy Spirit, the vapor of compunction and weeping. For as from fire comes smoke, so from the ardor of the Holy Spirit proceeds compunction. For it remains to believe that blood flowed from a dead body in a living stream, which is against the nature of our bodies, was done as an indication of a sign. For what other purpose, unless for our salvation and life, which indeed springs from His death? The illumination of the faithful can also be understood in the fire, and the blindness of the Jews who did not believe in the vapor of smoke. Hence, the Lord, about to give the law, descended in fire and smoke, because He illuminates the humble through the brightness of His manifestation, and darkens the eyes of the proud through the obscurity of error.

Blood, and fire, and vapor of smoke. About fire and smoke it has been said in the previous book: he speaks of blood not only of the Lord’s wounds, but also of the Lord’s sweat, when, praying before the betrayal, His sweat became like drops of blood falling to the ground. This is numbered among the divinely wrought signs, because it is proved not to be found in the custom of human nature. It is therefore a sign, because it signified that the whole world would be cleansed by the blood of the Lord, so that just as the tabernacle or temple was at some point consecrated to the Lord with the blood of victims, so now through the whole world the faithful people would be dedicated to Him as a holy house by His own blood, and not only in Jerusalem would be a place for prayer, but in every place of His dominion, the elect would lift their hands through pure prayers to the Lord.
