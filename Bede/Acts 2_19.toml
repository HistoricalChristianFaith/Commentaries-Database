wonders in heaven:
when with the Lord's birth a new star appeared, and when his ascending of the cross the sun was dimmed and heaven itself was covered with darkness (Mt. 2:2; 27:45). 

Signs on the earth:
when, with the Lord's breathing forth of his spirit, the earth trembled violently, broke open tombs, split apart rocks, and brought forth alive again the bodies of many of the saints who had fallen asleep (Mt. 27:51-52).
