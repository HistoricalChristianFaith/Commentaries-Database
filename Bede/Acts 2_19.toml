Blood and fire and vapor of smoke. The blood of the Lordâ€™s side, the fire of the Holy Spirit, the vapor of compunction and weeping. For as from fire comes smoke, so from the ardor of the Holy Spirit proceeds compunction. For it remains to believe that blood flowed from a dead body in a living stream, which is against the nature of our bodies, was done as an indication of a sign. For what other purpose, unless for our salvation and life, which indeed springs from His death? The illumination of the faithful can also be understood in the fire, and the blindness of the Jews who did not believe in the vapor of smoke. Hence, the Lord, about to give the law, descended in fire and smoke, because He illuminates the humble through the brightness of His manifestation, and darkens the eyes of the proud through the obscurity of error.
