Or if he asks for an egg, will he offer him a scorpion? In the egg hope is indicated. For the egg is not yet a perfect offspring but is hoped by nurturing. He opposed a scorpion to this, whose venomous sting is feared from behind, just as looking back is contrary to hope, since hope for the future stretches to what is ahead.
