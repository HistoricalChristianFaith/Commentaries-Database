When, as related above, He was about to refresh the believing multitude, He gave thanks, so now, on account of the foolish petition of the Pharisees, He groans; because, bearing about with Him the feelings of human nature, as He rejoices over the salvation of men, so He grieves over their errors. Wherefore it goes on, “And He groaned inspirit, and saith, Why doth this generation seek after a sign? Verily I say unto you, If a sign shall be given to this generation. "That is, no sign shall be given; as it is written in the Psalms, “I have sworn once by my holiness, if I shall fail David,” that is, I will not fail David.
For a sign from heaven was not to be given to a generation of men, who tempted the Lord; but to a generation of men seeking the Lord, He shows a sign from heaven, when in the sight of the Apostles He ascended into heaven. It goes on, “And He left them, and entering into a ship again, He departed to the other side.”.
Or, the leaven of the Pharisees is making the decrees of the divine law inferior to the traditions of men, preaching the law in word, attacking it in deed, tempting the Lord, and disbelieving His doctrine and His works; but the leaven of Herod is adultery, murder, rash swearing, a pretence of religion, hatred to Christ and His forerunner.
