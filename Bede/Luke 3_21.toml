Because though all sins are forgiven in baptism, not as yet is the weakness of this fleshly substance made strong. For we rejoice at the overwhelming of the Egyptians having now crossed the Red sea, but in the wilderness of worldly living there meet us other foes, who, the grace of Christ directing us, may by our exertions be subdued until we come toour own country.
For not then were the heavens opened to Him whose eyes scanned the innermost parts of the heaven, but therein is shown the virtue of baptism, that when a man comes forth from it the gates of the heavenly kingdom are opened to him, and while his fleshis bathed unharmed in the cold waters, which formerly dreaded their hurtful touch, the flaming sword is extinguished.
As if He said, In You have I appointed My good pleasure, i.e. to carry on by You what seems good to Me.
