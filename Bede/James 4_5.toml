Some think that this refers to Godâ€™s Spirit, which does battle inside us against envy and tries to rid us of it. Others, however, think that it refers to the human spirit and is a warning to us not to desire or to attach ourselves to the lusts of this world, because as long as the spirit of our mind desires earthly things it does so with envy, because it envies the fact that others have what it wants to obtain.
