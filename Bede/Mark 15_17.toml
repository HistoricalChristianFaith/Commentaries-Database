It is to be noted, however, that for what Mark says: And they clothed Him in purple, Matthew puts it thus: And stripping Him, they put on Him a scarlet robe (Matthew XXVII). From which it is understood that what Matthew says: They put on Him a scarlet robe, Mark states as: Clothed in purple. For that scarlet robe was used in mockery as royal purple, and it is a kind of red-purple similar to scarlet. It is also possible that Mark mentioned purple, which the cloak had, although it was scarlet. Mystically, therefore, in the purple with which the Lord is clothed, His very body, which He subjected to sufferings, is indicated. Concerning this, prophecy had already said: Why then is Your apparel red, and Your garments like one treading in the winepress? (Isaiah LXIII).

In the crown of thorns He wore is shown the taking up of our sins, for which He deigned to become mortal. As His forerunner bearing witness to Him said: Behold the Lamb of God, who takes away the sins of the world (John I). For the Lord Himself bears witness that thorns are customarily placed as a sign of sins, who said to the first man fallen into sin: Your land will bring forth thorns and thistles for you (Genesis III). Which is to say openly: Your conscience will constantly generate for you the stings and thorns of vices. But according to the Gospel of Luke, the Lord is clothed in a white robe before Herod, while in the other Gospels He is mocked by the soldiers of Pilate under a scarlet or purple garment. Comparing both narratives, in one the innocence and chastity of the assumed humanity are expressed, while in the other, the truth of the passion through which He was to attain the glory of the immortal kingdom is expressed. For just as purple mimics the color of the blood shed for us, so also the habit of the kingdom, into which He entered after the passion and which is open to us to enter, is insinuated. But since the Apostle says: For as many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ (Galatians III); and Isaiah instructs the Lord about all the elect: These, he says, will be clothed as with an ornament (Isaiah XLI), in this double attire of the Lord, contemptible indeed in the view of enemies but most glorious in the election of the Lord Himself, the entire multitude of His elect, divided into the venerated martyrs and the remaining faithful, can be most aptly designated. For He is clothed in a white robe when He is surrounded by the pure confession of the righteous. He is dressed in purple or scarlet, when he glories in the triumph of victorious martyrs.
