And Jesus, answering, said to them: "Have you come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs to capture me? etc." He said, it is foolish to seek him with swords and clubs who freely surrenders to your hands; and to search for him at night as if he were hiding and avoiding your sight, who teaches daily in the temple. But you gather against me in the dark because your power is in the darkness.
