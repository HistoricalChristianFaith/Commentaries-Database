And they will say to you: Look, there. Do not go, do not hurry. Although this sentence can be understood not only for a time, but also for a person. And indeed for a time, because there arose some who, calculating the courses of ages, would say they had found the certain year, day, and hour of the end of the world, against the authority of the Lord saying: It is not for you to know the times or the moments (Acts I). As for the person, because many heretics came against the Church, and many will come, who assert themselves to be Christs, the first of whom is Simon Magus, and the last, greater than others, is the Antichrist. Therefore, if anyone says to you, Look here, look there, that is, that in this or that person, or hour, the kingdom of God is coming or is going to come, they are not to be followed, who do not fear to seek higher things and to say unspeakable things.
