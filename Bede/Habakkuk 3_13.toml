Concerning [his] companions in the anointing, the apostle says, “To each of us grace is given according to the measure of Christ’s bestowal.” Both the priests and kings are called “christs” in the law, undoubtedly as figures of this king and high priest, our Lord and Savior, and as a type of him they were also anointed with the earthly oil. Not only they, but also the faithful of our own time, as they are called “Christians” from Christ, so also are they rightly called “christs”—from the anointing with the sacred chrism, from the grace of the spirit with which they are consecrated. The prophet testified to this when he said, “You went forth for the salvation of your people, so that you might save your christs.” He did indeed go forth for the salvation of his people, so that he might save his christs. “On account of us human beings and on account of our salvation, he descended from heaven and became incarnate” so that he might grant to us who have been thoroughly anointed and healed by spiritual grace to be sharers in his holy name.
