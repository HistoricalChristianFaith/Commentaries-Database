Haughty eyes, a lying tongue, etc. He enumerates six capital crimes, which yet, in comparison to the one who sows discord, he somewhat diminishes as lesser, because indeed the greater crime is that which disrupts the unity and fraternity connected by the grace of the Holy Spirit. For anyone can proudly lift up their eyes, lie with their tongue, be polluted with murder, plot evil against their neighbor, subject their members to other crimes, bear false witness against someone. This should not be thought to be the same as what he previously called a lying tongue. For a lie can be spoken, but not against a neighbor. For even blessed Augustine teaches that there are eight kinds of lies in the book he wrote on Lies. Anyone who is lost can inflict such evils on themselves or others, while maintaining the peace of the Church. But Donatus and Arius and their followers did something graver, who tore apart the concord of fraternal unity by sowing discord.
