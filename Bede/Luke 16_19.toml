A certain man was rich and was clothed in purple and fine linen, and feasted sumptuously every day. Few doubt that purple is the color of royal attire, dyed from marine shells. For shells, when cut with iron, emit tears of purple color, with which wool is dyed. But byssus, indeed, is a type of flax, exceedingly white and very soft, which the Greeks call πάπατιν. Therefore, the Lord had advised to make friends from the mammon of unrighteousness, that when we fail from this life, they may receive us into the eternal tabernacles: the Pharisees, hearing this, mocked. But he, supporting what he proposed with examples, showed that the rich man clothed in purple was tormented irredeemably in the infernal regions because he neglected to make an ally of the poor Lazarus, who might have received him into the tabernacles of life. Some, however, think that the precepts of the Old Testament are stricter than those of the New, but these indeed are surely deceived by inconsiderate reflection. For in that one, not holding nothing but rapine is penalized, where an unjustly taken thing is punished by a quadruple restitution, here indeed this rich man is not faulted for having taken from others but for not giving his own; nor is it said that he oppressed anyone, but because he elevated himself in the possessions received. Hence, thus, it must be gathered with great earnest what punishment one who rips from others deserves, if he is struck with damnation of hell, who does not share his own. And there are some who do not think it sinful to wear fine and precious garments; which evidently if it were not a fault, the Word of God would by no means express so vigilantly that the rich man who is tormented in the infernal regions was clothed in byssus and purple. For no one seeks fine garments unless for vain glory, evidently to seem more honorable than others. This fault we can better perceive in contrast, for if the rejection of humble clothing were not a virtue, the evangelist would not have vigilantly mentioned concerning John: He was clothed with camel's hair (Matt. III). But it should be greatly noted by us, in the mouth of Truth concerning the proud rich man and the humble poor man, how great the order of the narrative is. Behold, indeed it is said: A certain man was rich. And immediately it is added:
