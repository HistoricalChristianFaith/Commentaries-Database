Her house is the way down to Sheol, etc. But also concerning the Church, it says: The gates of hell will not prevail against it (Matt. XVI). Indeed, the innermost parts of death, the most severe torments of hell, are said to be sharper and darker, by which it is evident that heretics and fornicators are to be submerged. Just as it is said concerning the saints suffering adversities for the Lord in this life: And the jailer put them in the inner dungeon, that is, a more atrocious, fouler, and darker place.
