Having said that the church was afflicted in many ways in the present age, he also speaks of the glory of the souls after the punishment of their bodies. “I saw them,” he says, “under the altar,” that is, in the secret place of eternal praise. For the altar that is of gold and is placed within and is near the altar of the Lord’s body does not present, as does the altar without, flesh and blood to the Lord, but only the incense of praise. And those who now present their bodies as a living sacrifice, then, when the chains of the body have been broken, sacrifice to him the offering of praise.
