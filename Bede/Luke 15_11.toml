But to feed swine is to work those things in which the unclean spirits delight. It follows, Andhe would have filled his belly with the husks which the swine did eat. The husk is a sort of bean, empty within, soft outside, by which the body is not refreshed, but filled, so that it rather loads than nourishes.
For to be sent to the farm is to be enthralled by the desire of worldly substance.
