pale: Heretics who assume the garb of Catholics, are worthy to have death abide in their midst, and they draw after them the army of the lost. For the devil and his servants are, by a metonymy, called death and hell. It may also be taken simply, that there eternal punishment follows those who here are spiritually dead.

This image is of the heretics who clothe themselves as though they were Catholics but are worthy to have death abide within them and who draw the army of the lost after themselves. For the devil and his ministers are, by metonymy, called “death” and “hell,” since they are for many the cause of death and of hell. The passage may simply be interpreted to mean that eternal punishments there [in hell] follow those who are here spiritually dead. “And there was given to him power over the four parts of the earth.” Behold the insanity of Arius, which arose in Alexandria and extended itself even to the Gallic ocean, pursuing the pious not only by a dearth of the word of God but also, as though by beasts, with the physical sword.
