But one of the criminals hanging there blasphemed him, saying: If you are the Christ, save yourself and us. Some may be troubled by how the other evangelists say that the criminals who were crucified with him reproached him. Indeed, one of them, according to the testimony of Luke, rebuked him, but then looked at him and believed in God. But let us understand that they, briefly covering this matter, used the plural number for the singular. Just as we read in the Epistle to the Hebrews: They shut the mouths of lions (Heb. XI), although Daniel alone is meant. And it is said in the plural: They were sawn asunder (ibid.), even though it is handed down about Isaiah alone. Also in the psalm where it is said: The kings of the earth stood up, and the rulers gathered together (Psalm II), the plural number is used for the singular, as found in the Acts of the Apostles. For kings is understood to mean Herod, and rulers to mean Pilate, who applied the testimony of the same psalm. But what is more common (for example) than for someone to say, The peasants mock me, even if only one mocks?
