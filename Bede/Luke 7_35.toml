"And wisdom is justified by all her children," shows that the children of wisdom understand that righteousness does not consist in abstaining or in eating, but in the equanimity of enduring lack, and in not corrupting oneself with abundance through temperance, and in suitably partaking or not partaking of those things whose misuse, not their use, is to be condemned. For the kingdom of God is not food and drink, but righteousness and peace, and joy. And because people are accustomed to take much pleasure in carnal feasts, he added, "In the Holy Spirit." Otherwise. "Wisdom is justified by all her children," that is, the dispensation and doctrine of God, which resists the proud but gives grace to the humble (James IV), is proved just by his faithful. Among their number are those of whom it is said above: "And all the people hearing, and the tax collectors, justified God. Amen."
