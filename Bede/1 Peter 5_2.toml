Just as the Lord gave the entire church to Peter as his flock, so Peter subdelegates his responsibility to the pastors of the church and commands them to fulfill their task conscientiously. He himself looks after his flock even though he has nothing to live on. That is why he preaches the gospel, so that he might earn a living by it. But he preaches not for earthly rewards but rather for heavenly ones, and he does so eagerly, following the commandments of the Lord.
