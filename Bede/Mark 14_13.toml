And he sends two of his disciples and says to them: Go into the city, and a man carrying a jar of water will meet you. This is indeed a sign of divine foresight, because while speaking with the disciples, he knows what will happen elsewhere. When, however, the disciples are preparing for Passover, a man carrying a jar, or according to another Gospel, a pitcher of water, meets them, to show that the mystery of this Passover is to be celebrated for the perfect cleansing of the whole world. For water signifies the washing of grace, the jar indicates the frailty of those through whom the same grace was to be administered to the world. Hence, they say: “But we have this treasure in earthen vessels” (II Cor. IV). Therefore, the disciples prepare the Passover where the jar of water is brought, to signify that the time is here when the typical blood on the doorposts of the true Passover will be removed, and the baptism of the life-giving font will be consecrated to take away the sins of the world.
