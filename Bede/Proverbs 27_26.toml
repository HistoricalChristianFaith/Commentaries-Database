Lambs for your clothing, etc. He calls the innocent lambs, the penitent kids. You will be clothed with the fleece of the lambs, while you, the pastor, improve by the good manners of obedient disciples, and seeing their laudable deeds, you yourself will be more glorious both in the adornment of virtues and in the warmth of love. You will buy the field with the kids, while calling sinners to repentance, you acquire a higher place for yourself in the land of the living.
