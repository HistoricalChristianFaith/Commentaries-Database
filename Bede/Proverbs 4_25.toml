Solomon, advising the wise hearer, says, “And let your eyes anticipate your footsteps,” which is to declare clearly that in all our actions we should take care to foresee with earnest intent what outcome awaits us, we should examine skillfully what is done according to the will of God and what opposes it.

Let your eyes look straight ahead, etc. Learn diligently the path of justice on which you ought to enter, and cautiously foresee in all things you intend to do what end they are destined to reach. This means that the eyelids of your eyes looking straight ahead should precede your steps, anticipating the good work you are going to do with diligent thought, and, considering that it is according to God, foresee it by meditating.
