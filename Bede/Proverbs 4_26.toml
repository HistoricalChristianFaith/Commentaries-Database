Make straight paths for your feet. Namely, that you do not err in actions or faith. And all your ways will be established. May you not be swayed from your good purpose by fickleness of mind. Hence also the Apostle: Be steadfast and immovable, always excelling in the work of the Lord (1 Cor. 15:58).
