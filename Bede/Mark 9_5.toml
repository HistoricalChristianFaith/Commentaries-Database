And responding, Peter said: Rabbi, it is good for us to be here. Let us make three tents, one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah. For he did not know what he was saying. They were indeed terrified with fear. Oh, how great is the happiness to be present to the vision of divinity among the choirs of angels perpetually, if only the transformed humanity of Christ, along with the company of the two saints seen for a moment, delights so much that Peter wishes to establish them, lest they depart, though in his awe of human fragility, he doesn't know what he is saying, but the affection planted in him gives an indication! For he did not know what he was saying, who forgot that the kingdom of God was promised by the Lord to the saints, not somewhere on earth, but in the heavens. Neither did he remember that he and his fellow apostles, still surrounded by mortal flesh, could not yet attain the state of immortal life, as he exceeded in mind, which in the house of the Father that is in heaven, necessarily is not a house made by hand. But even now, he is noted for incompetence, whoever desires to make three tents for the law, the prophets, and the Gospels, when these cannot be separated from each other at all, having one tabernacle, that is, the Church of God.
