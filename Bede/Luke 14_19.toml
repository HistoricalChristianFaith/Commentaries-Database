And another said: I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I go to prove them. I pray thee, have me excused. What do we understand by the five yokes of oxen, if not the five senses of the body? Which are rightly also called yokes, because they are doubled in both sexes. These bodily senses, namely, since they are unable to comprehend what is internal but only know externals, and forsaking inner things touch only what is outside, rightly signify curiosity through them. For curiosity is indeed a serious vice, which, while leading anyone’s mind to investigate the outward life of another, always hides its own inner things from him. For this reason, it is also said of these same five yokes of oxen: I go to prove them, because indeed sometimes examination pertains to curiosity. But it should be noted that both he who excuses himself from the supper of his inviter on account of the farm, and he who excuses himself on account of proving the yokes of oxen, mixes words of humility, saying: I pray thee, have me excused. For while he says “I pray,” and yet scorns to come, humility sounds in his voice, pride in his action. And behold, the wicked each judge this when they hear it, yet do not cease to do the things they judge. For when we say to anyone acting perversely: Turn, follow God, leave the world, where do we call them if not to the Lord's supper? But when they respond: Pray for me, for I am a sinner, I cannot do this, what else do they do but request and excuse themselves? For saying, “I am a sinner,” indicates humility, but adding, “I cannot turn,” demonstrates pride.
