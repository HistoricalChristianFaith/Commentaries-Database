There are many kinds of jasper. Some are green in color and have the appearance of being dipped in the color of living plants. Some have the appearance of the wetness of an emerald but of an uncultured type. These are said to have the power to chase away phantasms. Another has the appearance of the gray foam of great waves with a misty color over it. The jasper stone, then, symbolizes the unflagging vigor of faith. Such faith arises in the sacrament of the Lord’s passion through the living water of baptism, and, with assisting aid, it grows into the blossoms of spiritual graces. For he who has this faith chases away all fear, as the blessed apostle Peter reminds us: “Your adversary, the devil, prowls around like a roaring lion seeking whom he might devour. Resist him, firm in your faith.” Such a person is able to say with the bride, “My beloved is radiant and blushing red.” Therefore, with good reason is both the structure of the wall built up with this stone and as Isaiah says, the fortress of the city is also adorned by it.

Moses explains both the color and the significance of this stone when he describes the dwelling of God: “Under his feet was a work of sapphire stone, clear as the sky.” Ezekiel also says that the place where the throne of God is has the appearance of sapphire and that the glory of the Lord, who bears the image of highest heaven, consists of that color. Therefore, whoever is such a person is able to declare with the apostle: “Our commonwealth is in heaven.” As if struck by the rays of the sun, sapphire glows in itself with burning brightness. So also the thoughts of the saints are always occupied with heavenly things, and so they are daily renewed by the rays of divine light. Therefore, they continually and ardently, in whatever way, search after eternal things and urge others as well towards those things for which they ought to seek. For what happened in the Red Sea is said to occur again when through the passion of the Lord and through the laver of holy baptism, the minds of mortals are raised high to taste beforehand heavenly things.

Chalcedony shines like the pale fire of a lamp out of doors in the daylight. By this is shown those who, supported by heavenly desires, remain hidden [by their humility] to people as they practice in secret their fasting, almsgiving and prayers. But when they are commanded to demonstrate their teaching or other acts of saintly service in public they quickly do so in order that their inner glory might be shown forth. For that which remains after the sculptor has done his work draws dross to itself by the working of the sun’s rays or by the handling of warm hands. This property of chalcedony rightly agrees with those who do not permit their own strength to be conquered by anything but rather by their own light and ardor draw to themselves the more fragile, joining them to their own strength. Concerning one of these it was said, “He was a burning and shining lamp.” Clearly he was burning with love, and he was shining in speech. For in order that their own virtues might never go dark, they are always refreshed by the oil of internal charity. The fact that among the Nasmoneans, which is a region of Ethiopia, this stone is produced indicates those who are under the ardent fervor of love. However, there is an obscure opinion that this stone is dirty as with a dark skin.

The emerald has the quality of very deep green to the point that it surpasses all green plants, branches and buds. It is colored all around with the green of reflective copper. It also fittingly produces a green oil, to the extent that its nature allows. There are many different types of this stone, but the more noble are the Scythian, the second is Bactrian and the third Egyptian. This stone further signifies those souls who are always growing in faith and when tested more and more by the adversities of this world (indicated by the coldness of the Scythian climate) the more fully do they hold on to that unfading inheritance kept in heaven. These souls advance to a contempt of this world through the chalice of the Lord’s passion and by the fullness of the inner charity given to them by the Holy Spirit. Also, the very beautiful ancestral homeland of these stones is fitting. It is a rich but uninhabitable land. The ground there abounds with gold and gems, but griffins hold all of them. These griffins are very ferocious birds or, rather, flying beasts, for they are four-legged and have the body of a lion while their heads are similar to birds. When these griffins fight the Arimaspi, who carry the mark of one eye in the midst of their forehead, the griffins take these stones and with amazing ferocity and fierce snatching, take the Arimapsi captive. The psalmist refers to this land filled with an abundance of virtues when he says, “Behold, I have fled afar off, and I remain in solitude.” That is, I have withdrawn my soul from the enticements of the world. He then strikes out at the hostile beasts when he prays, “Let the lying lips be dumb that speak iniquity against the righteous in pride and contempt.” He shows himself to have found desirable riches when he says with remarkable affection, “How abundant is your goodness, O Lord, which you have laid up for those who fear you,” and on to the end of the psalm. Against the desire of such birds to snatch away the seed of the divine word, some of the saints with a heavenly desire keep watch with undivided attention, as though wondering with one eye, in order that they might discover and unearth the precious jewel of faith and other virtues. Where the [need for] strength is greater, there are fewer laborers and fewer of those who bear the terrible persecution by unclean spirits. As the dreadful earthly griffins fight for riches by violence, these few struggle tirelessly for spiritual riches, not to possess the riches for themselves but to offer them to others. And since such an exalted faith is made known throughout the whole world through the gospel, it is fitting that as there are four books of the gospel, the emerald is placed in the fourth place.
