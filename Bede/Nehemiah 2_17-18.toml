These words are plain and exceedingly adaptable to a spiritual meaning because holy teachers—indeed, all who burn with zeal for God—are in the greatest distress as long as they discern that Jerusalem (that is, the “vision of peace” that the Lord has bequeathed and commended to us) lies deserted due to wars of disagreements, and they behold that the gates of the virtues (which, according to Isaiah, “praise” should occupy) have been destroyed and subjected to insults while the gates of hell prevail. Hence they work hard to unite the ministers of the word in a single purpose so that those buildings of faith and good action that seemed to have been destroyed can rise again.
