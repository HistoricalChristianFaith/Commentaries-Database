He appeared in the breaking of bread to those who, supposing that he was a stranger, invited him to share their table. He will also be present to us when we willingly bestow whatever goods we can on strangers and poor people. And he will be present to us in the breaking of bread, when we partake with a chaste and simple conscience in the sacrament of his body, the living bread.
