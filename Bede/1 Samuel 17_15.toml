Therefore, with three major ones following Saul, David went, etc. Because we all stumble in many ways, the only one conceived in sanctification, (James V), Anamartitos, that is, without sin, could live in the flesh, is rightly understood as God; because even teachers, certain lawgivers in Judea, prophets, and psalmists, as some interpret, priests, scribes, and Pharisees, sweating in the spiritual struggle against the law of sin opposing the law of their mind, only our Creator and Redeemer remained free from the conflict of all assaulting faults, who exceedingly also, with the generous mercy of eternal divinity, although humble in mortal flesh, refreshed the faithful flock of His Father; for He indeed agreed with mortals in the truth of nature, but differed from them in the power of sinning, imbuing men with spiritual gifts, but committing no vices among them. Rightly, David the Psalmist is brought forth to heal Saul, but in fighting the Philistines, he returns as if free from the enemy. Furthermore, like a good shepherd, with others placed in the readiness of war, he himself, free from war, invites his most gentle lambs to the pastures of Bethlehem.
