And the Lord added, and called again Samuel the third time. The Lord calls Samuel the third time, he himself rises the third time and comes to Eli and tells who has called him. The Father showed the Son visible in the flesh, signs of the invisible God, for the third time; namely, in infancy, in boyhood, and in youth. For in infancy, He shone through the angel to the shepherds and with the star to the Magi. In boyhood indeed, when He at twelve years old, showed divine wisdom in the temple, where He Himself said among other things: Because it is necessary for me to be in what is of my Father (Luke II). Moreover, in youth, when the Father Himself from the heavens marked Him after baptism with His voice, saying: This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased (Mark I). But in each of these moments, in which the Son of God is declared by God the Father, He Himself, offering Himself as a mortal man to mortal men, indicated that He was present, who had been long sought, awaited, and desired.

Eli understood that the Lord had called the boy, etc. Finally, after many great deeds and words done and spoken by the Lord, after John the Baptist's proclamations were fulfilled, the priests, scribes, and Pharisees understand that Jesus, who in the reality of the flesh was born as a boy to us, is the true contemplator of the highest mysteries of the eternal deity of the fathers; and soon, agreeing to the recognized faith, they desire to behold the divine joy, which is never absent, and wish to hear from God the Father in divinity what must be told to humans in a human way, and, like those who love and know what ought to be done, they admonish Him to do so, just as we often urge God Himself and the angels to show the devotion of our mind, as if agreeing when we know what will be done, to do it quickly and earnestly. For we say to people on earth: Arise, God, and defend your cause (Psalm 74). Stir up your power, and come (Psalm 79). Bless the Lord, all His angels (Psalm 103); and countless similar phrases.
