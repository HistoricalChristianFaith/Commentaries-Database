And behold, a man from Ethiopia, a powerful eunuch. He is called a man for the virtue and integrity of his mind; and not undeservedly, as he had so much zeal for the Scriptures that he did not cease to read them even on the way; and he bore so much love in religion that, leaving the royal court, he came from the farthest parts of the world to the temple of the Lord. Hence, while justly seeking an interpreter of the reading, he found Christ whom he was seeking; and, as Jerome says, found more in the desert fountain of the Church than in the gilded temple of the synagogue. For there, as Jeremiah in amazement proclaims, the Ethiopian changed his skin, that is, washed from the filth of sins, he ascended whitened from the washing of Jesus.

The queen of the Ethiopians, Candace. And in the Book of Kings, we read that the Queen of the South came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon. For, indeed, it was the custom of that nation always to be ruled by women, and to call them Candace.

Who was over all her treasures. The queen of the Ethiopians, sending her treasurer to Jerusalem, designates the Church of the nations, which will offer the Lord gifts of virtues and faith. The etymology of the name also fits. For Candace can be interpreted as changed from Hebrew. It is indeed she to whom it is said in the psalm inscribed: For those who will be changed: Hear, O daughter, and see, and incline your ear, and forget your people and your father's house (Psalm 45), and the rest.
