He is called a man because of his virtue and integrity of mind, and not undeservedly, for he devoted his study solely to the Scriptures, and he did not stop reading them even when he was on the road. Also, he showed so much love in [his] religion that, leaving behind a queen’s court, he came from the farthest regions of the world to the Lord’s temple. Hence, as a just reward, “while he sought the interpretation of something that he was reading, he found Christ whom he was seeking.” Furthermore, as Jerome says, “He found the church’s font there in the desert, rather than in the golden temple of the synagogue.” For there [in the desert] something happened that Jeremiah declared was to be wondered at, “an Ethiopian changed his skin,” that is, with the stain of his sins washed away by the waters [of baptism], he went up, shining white, to Jesus.

The sending by the Ethiopian queen of treasures of the nations to Jerusalem signifies that the church would bring gifts of the virtues and of faith to the Lord. The etymology of her name is also appropriate, for in Hebrew Candace means exchanged. In the Scriptures (in the psalm “For those who will be exchanged”) it is she to whom it was said, “Hear, daughter, and see, and incline your ear. Forget your people and your father’s home, and so forth. ”
