But when the king was assassinated by his sons, all Tobit’s belongings were restored to him because often after the devil had been overcome and condemned by reason of his crimes which he spawned like a thoroughly wicked brood, prosperity returned to the people of God. In these vicissitudes we can see the church too as an institution being tossed to and fro like the waves after the Lord’s incarnation. - "On Tobit 1.22–23"
