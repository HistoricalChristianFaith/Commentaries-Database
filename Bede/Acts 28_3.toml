When Paul had gathered a great bundle of sticks and laid them on the fire. The Apostle, having come out of the sea, kindled a fire because of the cold, as he warmed the hearts of those he had rescued from the tempests by his teaching with the ardor of love. The sticks are called any exhortations, which, capable of kindling charity, are as if cut from the integrity of the Scriptures, like branches cut with leaves.
