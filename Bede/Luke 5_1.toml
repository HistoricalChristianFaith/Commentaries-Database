Now it happened that while the crowd was pressing upon Him to hear the word of God, He was standing by the lake of Gennesaret. The lake of Gennesaret is said to be the same as the Sea of Galilee or the Sea of Tiberias. But it is called the Sea of Galilee from the adjoining province, the Sea of Tiberias from the nearby city, which was formerly called Chinnereth, but restored by Herod the tetrarch and named Tiberias in honor of Tiberius Caesar. Furthermore, Gennesar is said to derive from the nature of the water itself, as it is reputed to generate a breeze for itself with its rippling waves, being almost called in Greek "generating breeze for itself." For the water is not spread out as in the manner of a pond, but is stirred by frequent winds, sweet to drink, and suitable for drinking. But by the custom of the Hebrew language, any gathering of waters, whether sweet or salty, is called a sea. This lake, with the Jordan flowing through it, extends one hundred forty stades in length and forty in width. Therefore, since the present age is designated by the lake or the sea, the Lord stands by the sea, after overcoming the mortality of the fleeting life, having attained in the same flesh in which He suffered the stability of eternal rest. The gathering of the crowd to Him is a type of the nations running together in faith. Concerning which Isaiah says: "And all nations will flow to Him, and many peoples will go and say: Come and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord" (Isaiah 2).
