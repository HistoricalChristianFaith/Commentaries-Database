John is looking for a confession of faith which involves the heart, as well as confessing in both word and deed. He is saying the same thing as the apostle Paul when he wrote: “No one can say that Jesus is Lord, except by the Holy Spirit,” which means that unless the Holy Spirit gives us the power to do so, we cannot serve Christ with perfect faith and action.
