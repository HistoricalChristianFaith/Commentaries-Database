Swords and arrows in the way of the perverse, etc. This is to be understood in two ways, because the perverse are always armed to harm their neighbors, either by word or wicked deed, and they themselves are always awaited by the prepared retribution of the divine judgment. But he who seeks to save his soul for eternity, far avoids such swords and arrows, for he restrains his mind and hand from harming his neighbors, and lest he be struck by the punishment of the strict judge, he cautiously avoids it with an attentive mind.
