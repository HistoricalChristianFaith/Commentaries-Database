That the blood of all the prophets that was shed from the foundation of the world may be required of this generation. The question arises how the blood of all the prophets and the righteous may be required of one generation of the Jews, since many saints, both before the incarnation and after the death and resurrection of the Savior, were killed by other nations, and the Lord Himself was crucified by a Roman governor and Roman soldiers, though with the Jews shouting. But it is the custom of the Scriptures often to reckon two generations of men, namely, the good and the evil, that is, those who are born not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God (John 1); and those to whom it is said: You are of your father the devil (John 8). And elsewhere: Serpents, generation of vipers (Matt. 23).
