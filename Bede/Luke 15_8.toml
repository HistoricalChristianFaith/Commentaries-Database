Or what woman having ten drachmas, if she loses one drachma, does not light a lamp, and sweep the house, and search diligently until she finds it? He who is signified by the shepherd, he also is signified by the woman. For He Himself is God, He Himself is the Wisdom of God. And because the image is expressed on the drachma, the woman lost the drachma when man, who had been created in the image of God, by sinning departed from the likeness of his Creator. But the woman lights a lamp because the wisdom of God appeared in humanity. Indeed, the lamp is light in a vessel. The light in the vessel is divinity in flesh. When the lamp is lit, the house is swept, for as soon as His divinity shone through the flesh, our whole conscience was shaken. The house is swept when human conscience is disturbed by considering its own guilt; when the house is swept, the drachma is found, because as the conscience of man is disturbed, the likeness of the Creator is restored in man.
