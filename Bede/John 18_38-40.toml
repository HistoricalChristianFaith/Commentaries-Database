This custom was not commanded in the law, but had been handed down by tradition from the old fathers, viz. that in remembrance of their deliverance out of Egypt, they should release a prisoner at the passover. Pilate tries to persuade them: Will ye therefore that I release unto you the King of the Jews.

Inasmuch then as they abandoned the Saviour, and sought out a robber, to this day the devil practises his robberies upon them.
