You have answered correctly: Do this, and you will live. Then, after introducing a parable responding that the one who showed mercy to the wounded was the neighbor, He adds: Go, and do likewise, that is, remember to love and support your neighbor who needs such mercy. Very clearly declaring that love alone, and not merely shown in word but proven by the execution of deeds, leads to eternal life.
