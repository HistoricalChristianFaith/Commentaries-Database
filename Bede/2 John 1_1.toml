John is writing against the heretics who have departed from the truth. He rightly recalls that there is a love in the Holy Spirit which is common to all who know the truth. By mentioning the unanimity and the large number of catholic Christians he frightens those few who have separated themselves from their number. Look how all catholic Christians everywhere follow a single rule of truth, whereas heretics and unbelievers do not all agree on what they reject and attack each other just as much as they attack the truth.
