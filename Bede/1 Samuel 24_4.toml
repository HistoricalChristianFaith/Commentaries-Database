And David's servants said to him: Behold the day, etc. Christ's carnal disciples, still of a servile spirit, said to him when they saw the power of the crucified and the madness of those who crucified: Behold, the time is at hand, of which God the Father spoke to you through the mouth of his holy prophets from of old, that he would make all your enemies a footstool for your feet (Psalm 109). But they said this with their whole heart, although not in words, whomever of them desired the death of those who, releasing a thief, condemned the Savior to death, because it was proven by him who cut off the ear of the servant of the high priest, unwilling for the Lord to drink the cup which the Father gave. It was proven in those who sought fire from heaven to descend upon the impious, not knowing of what spirit they were, for the Son of Man did not come to destroy souls, but to save. But with the appropriate moderation of his piety, he did not completely kill the wicked, but withdrew from them, in no small part, the habit of the kingdom, so that even thus confounded, they might come to the recognition of their madness and correction.
