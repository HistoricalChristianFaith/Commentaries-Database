For these prophets had predicted that if they persisted in building the temple, soon, with the Lord’s assistance, they not only would complete the work itself but also have a more abundant supply of all good things as a reward for their devotion. Among their proclamations are Zechariah’s words: “The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house, and his hands will complete it, and you will know that the Lord of Hosts has sent me to you,” which is to say, “When you see that the temple has been completed by Zerubbabel, by whom it was begun, then you will understand that I was sent by the Lord and that what I have said I have said at his command.” And Haggai says, “From this twenty-fourth day of the ninth month, from the day when the foundations of the Lord’s temple were laid, store it in your heart. Is the seed as yet to sprout? Or have the vine, the fig tree, the pomegranate and the olive tree not blossomed? From this day on I will bless you.” What happened in the event shows that this prediction was correct. But all the prophets, indeed all the writers of sacred Scripture, promise good things for the builders of the holy church (i.e., teachers) if they do not tire from adversities and cease from their holy labor. For divine help will be present, by which the Lord’s house that has been begun may be brought to completion in the heart of their listeners by their believing and living well; and to the architects themselves will come the blessing of crops, the vine, the fig tree, the pomegranate and the olive [i.e., more abundance of spiritual gifts], which without any doubt will be more copiously granted to us by the Lord the more diligently we have endeavored to establish the abode of his glory either in ourselves or in the hearts of our neighbors.
