Just as those eighteen upon whom the tower in Siloam fell, and killed them. Do you think that they were worse debtors than all the men who live in Jerusalem? No, I tell you, but unless you repent, you will all likewise perish. And these Jerusalemites, like those Galileans, were not the only sinners, but they were punished to serve as a warning to the rest. Those who were crushed by the fall of the tower predict that all Jews who refuse to repent will perish with their cities. The number eighteen is not without reason, which in Greek is represented by ι and η, that is, the same letters with which the name Jesus begins. For they indicate that they especially deserved to be condemned for preferring to reject rather than accept the name of the Savior. Mystically, however, the tower of Siloam is such as the Psalmist sings: Thou hast led me because thou hast become my hope, a tower of strength in the face of the enemy (Psalm 60). For the very name Siloam, which is interpreted as "sent," where the man blind from birth received light, clearly signifies him who says: I am the light of the world (John 12). And again: And he who sent me is with me (John 8). Concerning whose fall, under the metaphor of a stone, it is said elsewhere: Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces. But on whom it falls, it will grind him to powder (Luke 20). Otherwise: each of us must build a tower of virtues after having first calculated the costs, lest he be mocked by passers-by if he cannot finish it. This tower will stand firm if properly built. But if erected in pride, lacking a solid foundation, it will fall upon the one who built it.
