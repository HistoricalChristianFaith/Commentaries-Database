Paul also says: “The unspiritual man does not know the things which come from the Spirit of God.” Contentious and proud wisdom is rightly described as earthly, unspiritual and devilish because as long as the soul seeks earthly glory it is deprived of spiritual grace and remains cut off from God. For now it thinks only what comes naturally to it since it originally fell. It is persuaded by the delusion of an evil spirit to do things which are wicked and harmful.
