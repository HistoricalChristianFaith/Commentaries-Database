But Jesus asked him, saying: What is your name? And he said: Legion, because many demons have entered into him. He does not inquire the name as if ignorant, but so that the confessed fury endured in front of witnesses, the power of the healer might more gratiously shine forth. But also priests of our time, who know to cast out demons through the grace of exorcism, are accustomed to say that those suffering cannot otherwise be cured unless they can confess everything that they have endured from unclean spirits in sight, hearing, taste, touch, and in any other sense of body or mind, waking or sleeping. And especially when, appearing either to men in the form of women or to women in the form of men, the demons, whom the Gauls call Dusii, falsely pretend by monstrous miracle to seek and accomplish intercourse with the human body. They command the name of the demon by which he has said he is known, and the bonds of their mutual pact of love by which they have sworn, to be exposed in confession. This matter, very much like a lie, is so true and well known by the testimony of many, that a certain priest, my neighbor, related to me that he began to cure a certain nun afflicted by a demon, but as long as the matter was hidden, he could achieve nothing with her. However, once she confessed which phantom tormented her, he soon drove it out with prayers and other necessary purification methods, and healed the woman's body, afflicted with sores contracted by the demonâ€™s touch, with blessed salve as a medical remedy. But while one of the sores, deeply embedded in the side, could not close without continuously opening, he received advice from the very same woman he sought to heal on how she could be healed. "If," she said, "you sprinkle consecrated oil for the sick on the same wound and anoint me thus, I will immediately be restored to health. For I once saw in spirit, in a certain distant city I have never seen with bodily eyes, a certain girl suffering from a similar distress, being healed in this manner by a priest." He did as she suggested, and immediately the sore accepted the remedy it had previously resisted. I have cared to explain these things against the frauds of demons briefly, so that you may understand why the Lord did not ask for the name of the spirit He was going to expel in vain. But that many demons are remembered to have entered the man signifies that the people of the nations are enslaved not to one, but to innumerable and diverse idolatries. To which it is written, that the heart and soul of the multitude of believers were one (Acts IV). Hence it is well that the unity of tongues was scattered in Babylon, and the variety of tongues was united in Jerusalem; that confusion is interpreted as vision of peace: because evidently, among many tongues and nations, the chosen ones are confirmed in one faith and piety by peace, while the reproved are confused by even more sects than tongues, being dissociated.
