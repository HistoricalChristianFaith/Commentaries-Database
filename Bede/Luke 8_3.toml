And Joanna, the wife of Chuza, Herod's steward. If Mary suggests the Church cleansed from the filth of sins among the nations, why should not Joanna designate the same Church, once indeed subject to the worship of idols, but now redeemed by the piety of Christ? For any evil spirit, prompt to deceive the human race, while it acts for the kingdom of the devil, is almost like the steward of most impious Herod.

And Susanna, and many others, who were ministering to him from their resources. It was a Jewish custom, nor was it considered blameworthy, according to an ancient custom of the nation, that women should minister food and clothing to teachers from their substance. Because this could cause scandal among nations, Paul mentions that he refrained: "Do we not have the right to be accompanied by a believing wife, as the other apostles do?" (1 Cor. IX). They ministered to the Lord from their substance, that they might reap their carnal things, whose spiritual things they were reaping. Not because the Lord of creation needed food, but to show a type of teachers, that they should be content with food and clothing from their disciples. Susanna is interpreted as lily, or her grace. But better, if the female name is symbolized by the lily, I believe on account of the fragrant whiteness of heavenly faith and the golden ardor of inner love. Joanna, the Lord is her grace, or the Lord is merciful; namely because all that we live is from him. Maria, bitter sea, doubtless because of the implanted wailing of repentance, by which either Mary herself, or each of us, bewails the old vices, that we may deserve to attain eternal grace and splendor. Magdalene, tower; but better, just as from mountain comes montanus, so from tower comes turrensis. That is, to whom the Psalmist sings: "You led me forth, for you have been my hope, a tower of strength from the face of the enemy" (Psalm LX).
