And Saul clothed David with his garments, etc. The people of the Jews applied to the incarnate Lord the figures of legal observations, by circumcising him on the eighth day, then carrying him to the temple on the thirty-third day, offering a sacrifice for him, teaching carnal sabbaths, and annually providing examples of the sacrifice of the Paschal Lamb, and other such things, which in their time were most beneficial, and the spiritual teachers in the law of the Jewish people armed them very usefully against all the fiery darts of the wicked one, almost as the head and body of Saul.
