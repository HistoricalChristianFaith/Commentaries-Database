For which reason I also did not consider myself worthy to come to you. And we, who from the Gentiles have believed, cannot come to the Lord ourselves, whom we are now by no means able to see in the flesh, but whoever has recognized the passions of our servitude, ought now through faith to approach Him who is seated at the right hand of the Father, now to send the elders of the Jews, that is, the chief men of the Church, who have gone before us to the Lord, to earnestly beseech to acquire patrons, who, bearing witness for us, that we love the Church, and as much as it is in us, strive to edify it, interceding with the Lord for our sins and those of ours.

But say the word, and my servant will be healed. Great is the faith of the centurion, who professes the work of the word in Christ, and apt for the mysteries of our healing, who, if we knew Christ according to the flesh, but now no longer know Him (II Cor. V).
