And he sent gifts from the spoil to the elders of Judah, etc. The Lord loves and urges all the members of His Church, in various persons, conditions, and ages, to always rejoice in His victory, in the perpetual increase of His kingdom, and whenever they see souls previously corrupted by the devil's sedition restored to the Church, to glorify and bless the Father who is in heaven. He especially delights to see those doing this who have preserved their love in a pure heart and have held on to the sayings or examples of the saints in the diligent memory of a chaste conscience. For this is the true David exulting and either hosting or defending his men. Likewise, any catholic teacher, when investigating, exposing, and conquering the thorns of heretics, must not delay revealing these things to other brothers, whether by conversing or even writing, for the sake of the knowledge of avoiding and overcoming such things. And note, not only in believing in God but also in loving neighbors, the heretics greatly differ from the catholic and gentiles greatly from Christian perfection. The Amalekites leave behind their tired and dying companion of their journey and expose him as if to be torn apart by wild beasts and birds. But David prepares his tired companions in a safe place for battle and enriches them with abundant peace and blessing upon his return. The title of the fifty-second psalm also recalls this lesson, which reads, "To the end for Amalech, the understanding of David," signifying Christ, who is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes (Rom. X), for the understanding of the figurative David in bearing with, persecuting, and fighting the Amalekites, what the city of the true David is to suffer from the faithless and what he himself is to repay to them. But the text of the psalm, very easy to understand, throughout rejoices in the mysteries of this lesson; because it begins with the endeavors of the wicked faithless saying, "The fool says in his heart, 'There is no God' (Psalm LII)," either claiming there is no God who cares for human affairs or considering within a foolish heart that any person in the holy Trinity is not truly God; and it ends in the triumph of the true David, "When the Lord restores the fortunes of His people, Jacob will exult and Israel will rejoice (Psalm XIII)."
