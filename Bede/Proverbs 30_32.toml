And the fool who appears after he has been raised on high, etc. For he indeed will be lifted on high when he will falsely claim to be God. But raised on high, he will appear as a fool, because in his very exaltation, he will fall by the advent of the true judge; if he had understood this, he would have put his hand over his mouth, that is, if he had foreseen his own punishment when he began to grow proud, he perhaps would not have been lifted in such boasting of pride. Let it not disturb you what was said earlier, the fourth one that walks successfully: for he said that three walk well, and the fourth successfully; for not everything that is successful is good; nor in this life is everything that is good, successful. For the lion, the rooster, and the ram walk well, but not successfully here, as they endure wars of persecutions; but the fourth one walks successfully, and not well, because the Antichrist walks in his deception, but for the short time of the present life, that deception prospers for him.
