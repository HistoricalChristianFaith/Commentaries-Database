"He who disparages something," etc. He who disparages a good thing binds himself in the future because, by doing what he ought not to, he prepares a punishment for himself by which he may be bound. But even he who disparages an evil thing obliges himself in the future, not so that he may suffer punishment for such slander, but so that after the slander he may act more cautiously, for clearly, what he justly rebukes in others, he does not admit with impunity himself, as the Apostle shouts, "You who preach against stealing, do you steal? You who say that one should not commit adultery, do you commit adultery? You who abhor idols, do you rob temples?" (Romans 2).

"But he who fears the command," etc. It is better, therefore, for anyone to fear concerning his own weakness so that he may not transgress the divine commands, than to foolishly tear apart the errors of others with his mouth, as the Apostle says, "Even if a man be overtaken in a fault, you who are spiritual restore such a one in the spirit of meekness, considering yourself, lest you also be tempted" (Galatians 6).
