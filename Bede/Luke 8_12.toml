But those by the wayside, they are the ones who hear. Then the devil comes and takes away the word from their heart, lest they should believe and be saved. Of this seed, Mark writes thus: "These are they by the wayside where the word is sown. But when they hear, immediately Satan comes and takes it away." Matthew says it thus: "Everyone who hears the word of the kingdom and does not understand it, the evil one comes and snatches away what was sown in his heart." From this it is clearly taught that those sown by the wayside are those who hear the word but are not worthy to comprehend it, lacking faith, understanding, or even the attempt at any utility. Furthermore, on rocky ground and among thorns (as the Lord explains), are sown those who indeed approve of the usefulness of the word they have heard and taste desire for it: but so that they may not attain what they approve, the adversities of this life or its prosperities delay them, either by frightening them or by alluring them. Against both these damages, the one who received the seed took care to protect it by saying, "Through the weapons of righteousness on the right and on the left; through glory and dishonor, through evil report and good report; as deceivers, and yet true" (2 Corinthians 6). So know that in these three types of ground are designated all those who do not do the word they have heard. From all these, however, the good ground is the one who keeps the received seed. The Jews and Gentiles, who are not even worthy to hear, are certainly excluded.
