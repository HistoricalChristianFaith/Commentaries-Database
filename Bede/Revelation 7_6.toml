And since we bless those who have endured suffering, after Gad is rightfully placed the tribe of Asher, which means “blessed.” For blessed is the one who endures trial, for “when he has stood the test, he will receive the crown of life.” Because those who are made safe by a sure promise of this blessedness are not placed in distress but rejoicing in hope and patient in tribulation, they sing with the psalmist: “In tribulation you have given me room,” and again, “I have run in the way of your commandments, while you enlarged my heart.” And exulting with the mother of blessed Samuel, they say, “My mouth is made wide over my enemies, for I rejoice in your salvation.” And for this reason, Napthali comes next, for it means “breadth.” And Manasseh, meaning “forgetting” or “necessity,” follows him. For by the mystery of this name we are exhorted that, taught by the troubles of present temptations, we ought to forget that which is behind and as the apostle says, strive for that which is ahead. And in this way we might not make provisions for the flesh in its desires but be constrained by the sole necessity of the human condition, concerning which the psalmist, sighing for better things, prays, “Bring me out of my distresses.”
