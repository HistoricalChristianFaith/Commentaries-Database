And it happened that as he was praying in a certain place, when he ceased, one of his disciples said to him: Lord, teach us to pray, as John also taught his disciples. After the story of the sisters who signified the two lives of the Church, it is not without reason that the Lord is described as having prayed and having taught his disciples to pray. For the prayer he taught contains the mystery of both lives in itself, and the perfection of these lives is not to be attained by our own strength, but by prayers. And because Luke often described the Savior as praying, he suggests what he did in prayer, who surely supplicated not for himself, but for us, when, after finishing his prayer, he reports that the disciples asked him how they should pray.
