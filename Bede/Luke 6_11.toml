But they themselves were filled with foolishness and conversed among themselves about what they might do to Jesus. Great foolishness indeed, consorting about the death of the Savior, when they themselves were in great need of salvation. Their devotion to wickedness is shown when they consider it a crime that a person restored his withered hand at His word. As though not each of them committed greater tasks on the Sabbath, by carrying food, extending a cup, and performing other necessary acts for sustenance. For neither could He who spoke and they were made be proven to have labored on the Sabbath.
