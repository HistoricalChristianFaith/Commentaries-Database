They were all trying to frighten us, scheming that our hands would cease from the work and that we would rest For this reason, I strengthened my hands all the more. Thus in the spiritual edifice too, because the cunning enemy tries always to obstruct our hands, let us always take care to strengthen them ourselves in good action with divine help.
