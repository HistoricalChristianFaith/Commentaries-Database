And it came to pass about eight days after these sayings, that he took Peter and James and John. On the eighth day, the Lord manifests to the disciples the glory of the promised future blessedness, so that, with the sweetness of heavenly life shown, he may refresh the hearts of all who can hear these things, and with the number of eight days, he may teach that the true joy of the resurrection is to come. For he himself rose from the dead on the eighth day, that is, after the sixth day of the Sabbath, on which he ascended the cross, and the seventh day of the Sabbath, on which he rested in the tomb. And we too, after the six ages of this world, in which we rejoice to suffer and labor for the Lord, and the seventh age of the rest of souls, which is meanwhile in another life, will rise again in a kind of eighth age. For that which Matthew and Mark say of the Lord being transfigured after six days does not result in the order of time, nor in the reason of the mystery. Because they only place the intermediate days, therefore they say absolutely that it happened after six days: he here includes both the first and the last, and thus more fittingly mentions about eight days.

Because indeed after the six ages in which it is permitted to work, it is necessary to insist in prayers that in the eighth time of retribution we are not rebuked by an angry judge.

And he went up into the mountain to pray. He indeed went up into the mountain to pray, and thus to be transfigured, to show that those who expect the fruit of the resurrection, who desire to see the king in his beauty, ought to dwell in mind in the heights and devote themselves to continuous prayers. He takes only three disciples with him, because many are called, but few are chosen (Matthew XX). And those who here keep the faith with which they are imbued, with an incorrupt mind of the Holy Trinity, deserve to rejoice there in its eternal vision.
