But David, taking the head of the Philistine, etc. I think it should be understood, according to the letter, that David took care to bring the head of such a strong adversary, which had been cut off, to the rebellious city of Jerusalem, still inhabited by the Jebusites, for no other reason than to terrify those who, trusting in the impregnable firmness or height of the walls, presumed that they could not be overcome by anyone. As a result, in its capture, which was achieved through David himself, we read that they rose to such a level of arrogance that they said: Even if only the blind and the lame, who might possibly be found in the city, were set in the strongholds, they would be sufficient both in number and strength to preserve it. Therefore, the triumphant boy hung the head of the defeated giant against the adversary city so that the citizens, however fierce, would not doubt that they could also be conquered by the same. But according to the rules of allegory, it should be said that the Lord hastened to show the victory over the ancient enemy, received by the apostles preaching and performing miracles, to the still faithless nations, so that He might convert them to the completion of the sacraments and dogmas of life and truth by this sign of victory, whose arms He also placed in His tabernacle; because He united the men snatched from the devil to the holy Church, and exposed his snares (for these too can be understood in the arms). There is no doubt to anyone that the tabernacle of David indicates the house of Christ, which is the Church of the faithful.
