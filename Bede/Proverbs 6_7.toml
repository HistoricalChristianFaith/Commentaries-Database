Which, having no guide, etc. If such a small animal, lacking a leader and devoid of reason, foresees things for itself by nature as its guide for the future, much more so should you, created in the image of God, called to see His glory, aided by the teaching of doctors, having the very Creator as your guide, in the present time gather the fruits of good works, by which you may live eternally. For indeed, this life is compared to harvest and summer because now, amidst the fervors of temptations, is the time to gather the rewards of future good deeds. But the day of judgment is likened to the cold of winter, because then, assuredly, no opportunity is left for working for life, but everyone is compelled to bring forth from the storehouse of past actions what he has reserved. Therefore, the Lord commands, saying: "But pray that your flight may not be in winter or on the Sabbath" (Matthew 24). For in winter, the opportunity, and on the Sabbath, the permission by law is lacking to gather the fruits of life, and to escape perpetual poverty.
