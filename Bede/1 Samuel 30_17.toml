And David smote them, etc. Christ smites heretics in two ways: either by chastising them to receive the faith or by anathematizing them to endure eternal punishment. Both of these forms of smiting extend from evening to evening, because they reach from the recognition of the error darkening the hearts, to either the bitterness of the same error's repentance for a time or eternal punishment. Indeed, the four hundred men, who with camels escaped the sword of David and as many of his soldiers by fleeing, are surely those who, despising the voice of Catholic teachers, neither agree to be corrected by them nor fear to be condemned; but, relying on the height of their virtues, or rather, on their swelling pride and boastfulness, just as on a camelâ€™s hump, they boast that they equally hold the name and number of evangelical perfection, and hope to obtain the joys of the heavenly life.
