She put her hand to strong things, etc. By strong things are meant the perfect works in the charity of Christ, to which the Church joyfully subjected herself in the expectation of certain heavenly reward; for example, "You have heard that it was said, You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy. But I say to you, Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you," etc. (Matthew V); and concerning the preservation of virginity: "He who can accept this, let him accept it" (Matthew XIX); and concerning the disdain of riches: "If you wish to be perfect, go, sell what you have," etc. (Ibid.). For the people of the Synagogue, to whom it was said, "If you are willing and obey me, you shall eat the good things of the land" (Isaiah I), were much weaker in the work of justice, the less they were elevated by the hope of eternal reward. But the Church, which heard from the Lord, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is near" (Matthew III), rightly endures anything difficult for the sake of receiving it. Therefore it is again said of her strength, "The kingdom of heaven suffers violence and the violent take it by force" (Matthew XI). And her fingers, he says, grasp the spindle. Women are accustomed to hold the spindle in the right hand and the distaff in the left. For the wool wound on the distaff, which must pass into the spindle to be spun into thread, is often referenced in the Scriptures as the right hand signifying eternal life, and the left hand signifying the present gifts of God, namely, the abundance of things, peace of times, health of bodies, knowledge of the Scriptures, and understanding of heavenly sacraments. When we receive these and similar goods from the Lord, it is as if we carry the wool wrapped on the distaff in the left hand. But when we begin to practice them wholesomely for the love of the heavenly, we transfer the wool of the spotless Lamb from the distaff to the spindle, from the left to the right, because from the gifts of our Redeemer, from the examples of His works, we make for ourselves the robe of heavenly glory and the wedding garment of charity. The fingers, by which it is said she grasps the spindle, signify the very intent of discretion with which one works, for there is no part of our body more divided by joints and apt for flexing than the fingers. Therefore, whoever can truly say with the Apostle, "Our citizenship is in heaven" (Philippians III), from where also we eagerly await our Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ, surely the fingers of his right hand grasp the spindle, for by careful discernment, he has learned to labor for eternal goods. And well does he say "grasp," to emphasize more vivaciously with how much zeal and haste we must act during this uncertain life for the sure rewards with the Lord. What the strong woman, that is, the holy Church or any perfected soul, has wrought by the intellectual spindle is subsequently revealed:
