Noah then understood that the waters had subsided from the earth, and he waited another seven days, and sent out the dove, which did not return to him again. The dove, which left the ark once the waters subsided and did not return, signifies the souls of the saints departing from this life into the free light of the heavenly homeland, and no longer returning to earthly way of life: in which very homeland prophecy will cease, knowledge will be destroyed, tongues will stop, and thus the water of baptism will dry up; but charity will never fail, through which truth and immutable life will be perpetually present and praised. And because the gift of heavenly favor is necessary not only to do good works, but also to attain eternal life after good works, it is fitting that the dove left not only after seven days to bring back the olive branch to the ark, but also after another seven days left again to enjoy the free sight of the sun and the new world as it were. For the grace of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus, and from his fullness we have all received, grace upon grace, namely the grace of reward for the grace of good actions.
