From these have divided the islands of the nations into their regions, each according to his language and family in their nations. 'Let us read the histories of the ancients, and we shall see almost all islands, and the shores of the whole world, and lands near the sea, occupied by Greek settlers, who, as we said above, possessed all maritime places from the Amanus and Taurus mountains to the British Ocean.' And while it is said 'each according to his language and family in their nations,' it clearly shows that according to the common opinion, each of the sons of Noah mentioned here, or the grandsons of the sons of Noah, formed separate nations or families of different languages. For the same statement, after recounting the descendants of Cham or Shem, also infers concerning the variety of generations and languages."
