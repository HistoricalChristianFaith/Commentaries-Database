Those who signed it were Nehemiah, Athersatha son of Hacaliah. /1350/ Another translation1 has 'Nehemiah who is Athersatha', for Nehemiah had two names, which is why it is also specifically added, son of Hacaliah. This same point is suggested more clearly above when it is said: And Nehemiah (he is Athersatha), Ezra the scribe, and the Levites who interpreted to all the people, said, 'This day is sacred to the Lord our God'.2
