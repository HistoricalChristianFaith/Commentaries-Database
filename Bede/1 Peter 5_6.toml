God gives grace to the humble in such a way that the more they have been humiliated for his sake while here on earth, the more he will exalt them on the day of reckoning. The word humiliation can be understood in many different ways. It may be self-induced, as when someone who is starting out on the way of virtue humbles himself in repentance for the sins which he has committed. It may be what one sees in those who are closer to perfection when they voluntarily agree not to pursue their rights but to live in peace with their neighbors. And of course, it may be what we see when a person is caught up in the whirlwinds of persecution and his spirit is unbowed thanks to the power of patience.
