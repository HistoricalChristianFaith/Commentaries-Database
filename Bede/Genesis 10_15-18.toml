Canaan became the father of Sidon, his firstborn, Heth, and the Jebusite, the Amorite, the Girgashite, the Hivite, the Arkite, the Sinite, the Arvadite, the Zemarite, and the Hamathite. "From Sidon, the firstborn of Canaan, comes the city in Phoenicia called Sidon, formerly the northern boundary of the Canaanites. The Arkite founded Arca, a town situated against Tripoli at the foot of Mount Lebanon, near which was another city named Sim, which was later destroyed by various wars but retained its original name for the site. The Arvadites possessed Aradus Island, separated by a narrow strait from the Phoenician coast. This island, situated near Tyre, is today seen as a safe city and across from it lies the town of Antaradus. Samara is the noble city of Emesa in Syria. Emath, up to our time, is called by both the Assyrians and Hebrews as it was of old. The Macedonians, who ruled the East after Alexander, named it Epiphania, and some think it was called Antioch. Indeed, there were two cities named Emath: one was Great Emath, now called Antioch, and it was called great to distinguish it from Lesser Emath, which is called Epiphania, where the eyes of Zedekiah were blinded by Nebuchadnezzar.
