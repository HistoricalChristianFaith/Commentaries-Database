Therefore David left the vessels he had brought, etc. The Lord, leaving with the memory of His faithful ones the heavenly signs or the tokens of His earthly birth which He brought to the world as soon as He was born, so that these among their good treasures of virtues may be diligently kept; He Himself, ready to battle the prince of the world, does not delay to hasten, but also concerned for the salvation of His own, through performing and teaching works of righteousness, inquires openly, as it were, about His brothers, whether their works are right or if they still seem in need of correction.
