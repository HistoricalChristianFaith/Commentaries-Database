For I tell you that this which is written must still be fulfilled in me: "And he was numbered with the transgressors." For indeed, the things concerning me have an end. Behold why the disciples are advised to take a purse, a bag, and a sword, namely because the Lord was to be numbered with the transgressors, which Isaiah describes among other things (Isa. 53), either with robbers, between whom he was to be crucified, or with the dead to whom he was to descend by death, implying that. And then indeed he was numbered with the transgressors, when he descended to the dead and brought those he found there, who were his, back to the living. As another prophet sings about this: "By the blood of your covenant, you have released your prisoners from the pit wherein is no water" (Zech. 9).
