But ascending into one of the boats, which was Simon’s, he asked him to put out a little from the land. And sitting down, he taught the crowds from the boat. Simon’s boat is the early Church, about which Paul says: "For he who worked through Peter for the apostleship of the circumcised worked also through me for the Gentiles" (Galatians II). It is aptly called one, because the heart and soul of the multitude of believers were one (Acts IV). From which he taught the crowds, because he teaches the nations today through the authority of the Church.
