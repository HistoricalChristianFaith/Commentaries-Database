And behold, there are the last who will be first, and there are the first who will be last. The main sense of this sentence indeed is clear from the preceding statements: because the peoples of the Gentiles, living without faith for a long time, would be called to faith, and the Jews, holding the head of faith and justice through many generations, would be turned to the tail. But it can also be understood in this way, that some who are regarded as despicable in this age will have great glory in the future, and others who are glorious among men will be condemned by the strict judge. It can also be understood that many who come late to the service of God will excel in great merits of life, while others who are fervent in spiritual zeal from the earliest age will wear out in the end due to idle sloth.
