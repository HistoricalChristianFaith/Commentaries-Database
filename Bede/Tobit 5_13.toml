And our Lord through the miracles he wrought in the flesh showed the Jewish people from whom he had taken flesh that he was the Son of God and the angel, that is, the messenger, of his Father’s will. He also announced to them the joy of eternal salvation saying, “Do penance, for the kingdom of heaven will draw near”; and to those who despaired of obtaining heavenly light he said, “I am the light of the world; the one who follows me will not walk in darkness but will have the light of life.” - "On Tobit 5.11–13"
