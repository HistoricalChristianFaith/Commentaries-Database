The Lord said: "Simon, Simon, behold, Satan has asked for you, that he might sift you as wheat. But I have prayed for you, that your faith may not fail." Lest the eleven apostles should glory and attribute to their own strength what was said almost alone among so many thousands of Jews to have remained steadfast with the Lord in trials, he shows that they too, if they had not been protected by the aid of the Lord helping them, could have been crushed by the same storm as the others. But while Satan seeks to tempt them, and, as who winnows wheat, to shake them by ventilating, he teaches that no one's faith is tested by the devil unless God allows it. For Satan desires to sift the good men, and he breathes with the heat of malice to their affliction. For as much as he covets their trial by envy, so much he perishes as if seeking their seemingly trial. But when the Savior, praying for Peter, does not ask that he not be tempted, but that his faith should not fail, that is, that after the fall of denial he should rise again to his former state by repenting, he insinuates that it is beneficial for the saints to be tested by the flames of temptations, so that either they appear strong because they have been tempted, or having recognized their own weakness through temptations, they may become stronger, and thus, when they have been tested, they also may receive the crown of life which God has promised to those who love him (James 1).
