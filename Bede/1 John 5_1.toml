Who is it who believes that Jesus is the Christ? It is the person who lives according to Christâ€™s commandments. Let no heretic or schismatic say that he believes that Jesus is the Christ, for even the devils believe and tremble, because they too know that much. But those who do not have his love or the works of truth are not of God.
