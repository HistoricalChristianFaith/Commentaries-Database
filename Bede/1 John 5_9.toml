There are many great testimonies to the Son of God, for example: “The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at my right hand,” and “The Lord said to me, You are my Son.” This testimony is great and true and worthy to be received by everyone, but the testimony of God to his beloved Son is much greater still. For the Father himself spoke from heaven, saying: “You are my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.”
