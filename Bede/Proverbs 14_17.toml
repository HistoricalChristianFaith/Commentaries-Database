An impatient man works folly, etc. Certainly an impatient man is reprehensible, but far worse and more hateful to God is the cunning man, although he is considered better among men. For the former openly shows his folly to all, while the latter, in his perverse heart, often feigns simplicity and righteousness, and is pleased to be called holy in human judgment, while in the divine examination he is considered among the reprobate.
