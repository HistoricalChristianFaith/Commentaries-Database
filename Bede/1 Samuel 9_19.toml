And Samuel answered Saul, saying: I am the seer, etc. John responded, with the Lord bestowing heavenly gifts upon him, saying: I am the friend of the Bridegroom; I am your forerunner; I ought to be baptized by you, who, coming before me, have been made ahead of me. And indeed you will now receive baptism from me with the people of believers, together we will serve the feast of the word, and in turn, we are refreshed by the faith of the listeners. But when the splendor of your grace has shone upon all, with my role as forerunner completed, I will leave you to preach, and having joined the chorus of preceding prophets, I will take care to reveal all the mysteries of your temporal dispensation to the crowds of the faithful, indeed your members.
