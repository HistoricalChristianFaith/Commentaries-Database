The stars on the day of judgment will be seen obscurely, not because of a gradual waning of their own light but due to the overwhelming brilliance of the true light, who is the supreme Judge coming in majesty, and the light of the Father and the holy angels. Nevertheless, nothing should prevent us from understanding that the sun, the moon and other stars will be deprived temporarily of their own light, as happened to the sun at the Lord’s passion. But because the moon, which should have been full at that time, lay hidden behind the earth, Joel’s prophesy remains unfulfilled still today, for after he had said “the sun will be turned to darkness,” he added, “and the moon to blood before the great and magnificent day of the Lord comes.” Isaiah also spoke about the day of judgment, saying, “The moon will be ashamed and the sun confounded when the Lord of hosts reigns on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem and is glorified in the presence of Jerusalem’s elders.”
