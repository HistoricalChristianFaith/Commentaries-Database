Now those who ate were five thousand men. Because there are five senses of the outer human being, the five thousand men who followed the Lord signify those who, though still in a secular condition, know how to use well the external things they possess. They are rightly fed with five loaves, because such people must still be instructed by legal precepts. For those who completely renounce the world and are four thousand, and are fed with seven loaves, that is, they are elevated by the evangelical perfection and are inwardly taught by spiritual grace.
