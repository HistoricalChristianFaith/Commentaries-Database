And to the angel of the church in Smyrna write. He suggests to this church to endure persecution, to which the name also agrees. For Smyrna means myrrh, which signifies the mortification of the flesh.

These things says the first and the last, who was dead and came to life. Who both created all things and restored all things by dying. A fitting preface for urging patience.
