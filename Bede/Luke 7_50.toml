Your faith has saved you; go in peace. Indeed, faith has saved, because she did not doubt she could receive what she asked for, but had already received the certainty of hope from him from whom she sought salvation through hope. She is commanded to go in peace so that she might not be diverted from the path of truth to the way of scandal. These words may be understood historically, but let us now examine the mystical secrets. Whom does the Pharisee, presuming on false righteousness, represent if not the Jewish people? Whom does the sinful woman, coming to the feet of the Lord and weeping, signify if not the converted gentiles? Now, the Pharisee asked the Lord to dine with him because the same people who did not want to believe in His coming never stopped hoping for His arrival, indeed praying fervently that He might come, saying: "Stir up Your power and come to save us" (Psalm 79). To dine with the Pharisee is, for the Lord, to accept the devotion of the believing people. Hence, elsewhere, directing his speech to the believing Samaritans, He says: "I have food to eat that you do not know about" (John 4). And when they were mystified by His words, He explained: "My food is to do the will of Him who sent me and to accomplish His work" (Ibid.).
