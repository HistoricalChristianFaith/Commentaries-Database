By the disciple whom Jesus loved, the Evangelist means himself; not that the others were not loved, but he was loved more intimately on account of his estate of chastity; for a Virgin our Lord called him, and a Virgin he ever remained.
Another reading is, Accepy eam disciplus in suam, his own mother some understand, but to his own care seems better.
