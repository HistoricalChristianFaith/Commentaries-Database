"Like cold water to a thirsty soul," etc. The Psalmist says: "As the deer longs for the water brooks, so my soul longs for you," and so forth (Psalm XLI). Therefore, cold water which quenches the thirst of the ardent, and the messenger who brings any new and unexpected joys from afar, is likened to it, because the sweetness of the divine vision consoles the soul long desiring, and renders it free from the heat of present tribulations; and angels daily come from a far country, that is, descending from the heavenly homeland into the world, and either strengthen the righteous in temptations with the hope of heavenly things, or lead the righteous through temptations to the palm of eternal reward.
