And they signaled to their partners in the other boat to come and help them. The other boat (as we have said before) is the Church of the Gentiles, which also, with one little boat not being sufficient, is filled with elect fish, because the Lord knows who are his, and with him the number of the elect is certain. And when he did not find as many in Judea as he knew to be predestined to faith and eternal life, as if seeking receptacles for his fish in another boat, he also fills the hearts of the Gentiles with the grace of faith. And it is well that, with the net being broken, the partner boat is called, for before Judas the betrayer, before Simon Magus, the abominable fish, were caught, before Ananias and Sapphira tried to deceitfully enter the net of faith, as John testifies, many of his disciples went back and walked no more with him (John VI). And then Barnabas and Paul were set apart for the apostleship to the Gentiles (Acts XIII).

And they came and filled both boats, so that they began to sink. The filling of these boats increases up to the end of the age. But that being filled they begin to sink, that is, they are pressed down in submersion (for they are not submerged, but are, however, endangered), the Apostle explains, saying: In the last days perilous times will come, and men will be lovers of themselves, etc. (II Tim. III). For boats sinking means that people, having been lifted up through faith, fall back into corrupt behavior in the world. This is also demonstrated by Peter himself in this place, still in a state of weakness.
