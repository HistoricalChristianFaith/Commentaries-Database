Moreover, David was in the wilderness of Ziph in the forest. The Lord saw, whose eyes see all things naked and open (Hebrews IV), that he had gone forth from the inner guard of the assembly of traitors, to seek and persecute the church of his faithful, whose heart and soul are one (Acts IV). He remained in the wilderness, in the Church taken from the Gentiles, which often generates fruitful trees, as hearts pregnant with the seed of varied virtues; about which the Psalmist, singing about building a house of remission and life after captivity, says: Then shall all the trees of the forest rejoice before the Lord, for he comes (Psalm XCVI). Now, these trees of the widely fruitful Church, spiritually fecundated with the flower or seed of good works (for Ziph is said to interpret both), are prominent to the extent that they diligently abandon all the enjoyments of this world.
