What is easier to say, "Your sins are forgiven," or to say, "Rise and walk"? Whether the paralytic's sins were forgiven, only He who forgives them knows. But "rise and walk," both he who rises and those who see him rising can confirm. Therefore, a physical sign is performed to prove the spiritual one.
