Then [Paul] goes down, lies down on him and embraces him; this is what he [Paul] himself said, “My little children, again I am in labor with you until Christ is formed in you.” It is harder to revive those who sin through negligence than it is to revive those who do so through weakness. The former is represented by Eutychus, the latter by Tabitha, whom Peter restored to life. She fell ill and died in the daytime; he fell and died at midnight. After her death she was washed and placed in an upper room; he dropped from the third story and was mourned as dead below. In the latter case the teacher [Paul] was present and teaching; in the earlier case the teacher [Peter] was absent. Paul went down to him; Peter went up to restore life to her. She sat up as soon as she saw Peter; [Eutychus] died at midnight, and finally in the morning he rose again, and, revived by the inspiring son of righteousness, was led away.
