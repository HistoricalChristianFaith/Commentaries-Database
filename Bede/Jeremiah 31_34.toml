The teachers of the Word come and go, and others follow in the succession of those who pass away. But the sacred Scripture remains for all time without ever being abolished, until the time when the Lord shall appear at the end of the world. Then we shall have no further need for the Scriptures or for those who interpret them, since there will be a long-awaited fulfillment of that promise of the Lord that says, “And they shall not teach their neighbor and brother saying, ‘Know the Lord,’ for they shall all know me, from the least of them to the greatest.”
