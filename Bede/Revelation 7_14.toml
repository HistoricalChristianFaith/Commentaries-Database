Martyrs wash their robes in the blood of the Lamb, while as for their members, which “seem to the eyes of the ignorant” [to be] defiled by the squalor of their pains, they instead have made [these members] clean of all contagion by their blood which is poured forth for Christ. In addition, they have rendered [their members] worthy of the blessed light of immortality, which is [the meaning of] their having made their washed robes white in the blood of the Lamb.
