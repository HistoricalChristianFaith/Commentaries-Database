Because he had an only daughter, about twelve years old, and she was dying. The Synagogue itself, which alone was composed by legal institution, as if it were the only daughter of Moses, as if in the twelfth year of age, that is, when the time of puberty was approaching, was dying; because, having been nobly brought up by the prophets, after reaching the age of understanding, after it ought to generate spiritual fruits for God, suddenly distressed by the languor of errors, despairingly omitted to enter the ways of spiritual life. And if it were not helped by Christ, it would have fallen into horrendous death in every respect.
