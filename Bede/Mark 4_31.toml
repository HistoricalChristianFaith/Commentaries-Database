When it is sown in the ground, he says, it is smaller than all the seeds that are on the earth. But when it is sown, it grows up and becomes greater than all garden plants and puts forth large branches, so that the birds of the air can make nests under its shade. The preaching of the Gospel is the smallest among all disciplines. For the first teaching indeed does not hold the truth of faith, proclaiming a man, Lord God, dead and the scandal of the cross. Compare such teaching to the doctrines of philosophers, and their books and the splendor of eloquence and the composition of words, and you will see how much lesser the sown seeds of the Gospel are. But when those have grown, they show nothing biting, nothing vivid, nothing vital. Everything swells, flaccid and withered, into vegetables and herbs, which dry up and crumble. However, this preaching which seemed small in the beginning, whether sown in the soul of the believer or in the whole world, does not rise into vegetables, but grows into a tree, as is said very clearly by the other Evangelists. Therefore the mustard seed sown in the land or the field of the Lord arises and is transformed from a vegetable into a tree, whose nature is to surpass the nature of all herbs in height, breadth, and longevity. Great indeed is the height of this tree, because the preaching of the Gospel lifts up the minds of its hearers to desire heavenly things. It is spread out with branches, because it has occupied the ends of the whole world through preachers born from it. It surpasses in longevity, because the truth it proclaims will never be obliterated by any end. Under its shade, the birds of the heavens dwell, for the souls of the faithful that are accustomed to fly to heavenly things with desire, and to have their heart above, neglecting the desires of temporal things, according to the voice of the Psalmist: In the protection of the wings of the Lord they will hope (Psalm 90). Hence the bride in the Song of Songs, that is, the Church gathered from many souls of the saints, boasts and says: Under the shadow of him whom I desired, I sat, and his fruit was sweet to my throat (Song of Solomon 2). Which is to say openly: Under the protection of him whom I desired to see, I, deprived of the comfort of others, subjected myself, and the joy of his sight and presence was sweet to my heart, compelling me to despise, indeed to disdain, whatever is outside him.
