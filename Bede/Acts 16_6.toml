Truly “terrible” is the Lord “in his councils upon the sons of men.” The one who promised that he would follow the master through everything was not granted permission, and another man who had been ordered to follow did not receive the delay he asked for in order to bury his father. Paul, who was fighting against [Christ], was attracted in spite of himself. Cornelius, who devoted himself to prayers and almsgiving, was shown the way of salvation as his reward. And God, who knows hearts, on account of his kindness, withdrew [his] teacher from Asia lest, if what is holy were given to dogs, the error of their wicked hearts “might be judged more reprehensible on account of their disregard of his preaching.” On the other hand the Macedonian legate, whom we believe to have been the angel of that people, asked the apostles, who were concerned with other matters, that crumbs of the Lord’s bread might be offered to them.
