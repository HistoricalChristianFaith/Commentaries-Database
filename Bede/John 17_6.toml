And they have kept your word. He calls Himself the Word of the Father, because the Father by Him created all things, and because He contains in Himself all words: as if to say, they have committed Me to memory so well, that they never will forget Me. Or, they have kept your word, i.e. in that they have believed in Me: as it follows, now they have known that all things whatsoever You have given Me, are of You. Some read, now I have known but this cannot be correct. For how could the Son be ignorant of what was the Fatherâ€™s? It is the disciples He is speaking of; as if to say, they have learned that there is nothing in Me alien from You, and that whatever I teach comes from You.
