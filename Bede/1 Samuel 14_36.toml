And Saul said, "Let us go down after the Philistines by night," etc. Saul, planning to attack the Philistines by night and to destroy them completely, consults the oracle of the Lord but is not answered; and seeking the cause of the sin, he discovers it by lot and adjudicates Jonathan, who confesses, to death; however, since he had brought great salvation to Israel, the people rescue him from the judgement of death. Good leaders often desire to expel all the snares of demons and to eradicate the tares sown among the good seed from the field of this world if possible, yet they receive no answer from the Lord through the Scriptures that this can be done; upon seeking the cause, they hear nothing more than that human frailty and ignorance are to blame; for even the most eminent teachers and leaders of the faithful, in the good works they do, cannot stand immune to the suggestions of sin, but all offend in many ways; nevertheless, lest they suffer eternal death because of these, they are helped by the merits of the good deeds they have done and by the prayers of the Churches they fought to strengthen.
