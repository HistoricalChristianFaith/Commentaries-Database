And as he went, they spread their garments in the way. As the Lord is carried by the donkey, the disciples lay their garments in the path, because by stripping away their own bodily attire, they prepare the way for the simpler servants of God with their own blood, so that they may walk with an undisturbed step of the mind towards Jerusalem, where Jesus leads. For Jesus, sitting on the donkey, heads towards Jerusalem when, governing the soul of each faithful one, He leads His donkey to the vision of inner peace, or also when He presides universally over the holy Church and kindles in it the desire for the peace of heaven. But because according to other evangelists, not only disciples but also many from the crowd spread their garments on the road, those may be understood as well who, following the examples of the martyrs, discipline their bodies through abstinence, to prepare a path for the Lord towards the mind, or offer good examples for those who might follow.
