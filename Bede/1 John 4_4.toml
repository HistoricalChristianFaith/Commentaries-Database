By believing that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh you have already overcome the antichrist. “For greater love has no man than this, that a man should lay down his life for his friends.” But how could the Son of God have laid down his life for us if he had not taken on human flesh, which made it possible for him to die? Anyone who violates the law of love denies by the way he lives that Christ has come in the flesh, whatever his tongue might say, and this person is the antichrist.
