The Lord said: Who then is the faithful and wise steward, whom the Lord shall make ruler over his household? Answering the questions of the Savior, he first teaches that judgment is present for all, and that individuals will receive rewards or punishments according to the merit of their work and the capacity of their understanding. Then, in addressing what was especially asked, he shows that the grace of virtues which he brought to the world is to be pursued by each as much as they can. "I have come to cast fire upon the earth, and what will I if it be already kindled?" Certainly, in saying "who then is," he suggests the difficulty, not the impossibility, of achieving virtue, just as the Psalmist says: "Who is wise, and will observe these things?" (Psalm 106). He signifies not no one, but the rarity. For elsewhere the same term is used not for difficulty, but for impossibility. "Who is like unto thee, O God?" (Psalm 82), that is to say, none. "For thou alone art the most High over all the earth" (Psalm 82).

To give them their portion of wheat in due season. By the portion of wheat is expressed the measure of the word. For lofty matters ought to be covered before many listeners, and scarcely disclosed to a few, lest when something beyond the ability of a narrow heart is given, it be cast aside. Here, Moses, coming forth from the secret presence of God, veiled his shining face before the people, because surely, he did not reveal the secrets of innermost clarity to the crowds. Therefore, the speech of teachers ought to be formed according to the quality of the listeners, so that it suits each individually and yet never departs from the art of common edification.
