Solomon’s litter, therefore, is the glory of heavenly beatitude in which the King of peace himself rests with his saints, a rest toward which the King’s beloved, that is, the church, strains daily through the desert of this world and already partly enjoys, insofar as he gives his faithful a foretaste of their future reward. But they will receive it fully only when, at the end of the age, the founder and king of the heavenly city gathers the elect from the four winds and, as was said elsewhere, “girds himself and makes them recline at table and serves them.” - "Commentary on the Songs of Songs 2.3.7"
