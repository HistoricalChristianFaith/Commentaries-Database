The city had been built long before, but it was not proper that it be dedicated before the inhabitants had been gathered and ministers suitable for the temple and guardians for the gates and vestibules had been appointed. The holy city, after being built, is dedicated when, after the number of the elect is completed at the end of the world, the church in its entirety is introduced in heaven to the sight of its Creator, and whenever in this life we are uplifted with desire for that future life, it is as if we are rejoicing over the future dedication of our city. Thus this same dedication also can be interpreted in a twofold way, namely, at the present time the hope of those who desire and purify the eyes of their heart so that they can see God, but then in the reality of blessed persons in spiritual bodies who enjoy a vision of God amid hosts of angelic spirits.
