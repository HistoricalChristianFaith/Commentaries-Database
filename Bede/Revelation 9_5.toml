kill: Although heretics are supported by the secular power, and are permitted for a time to assail the good, yet, as the Lord saith, &quot;they are not able to kill the soul.&quot; For by the five months he signifies the time of the age, because of the division into five of the sense which we use in this life. But in that another translation has &quot;six months,&quot; it agrees with this interpretation, because of the six periods of the age.

scorpion: As the scorpion diffuses poison from its hinder parts, so the ungodliness of the wicked injures from their hinder parts, when by threats or blandishments it causes the temporal things which are behind to be preferred to the eternal good things which are before. In opposition to the parable of the Gospel, the generation of vipers gives this scorpion to its own offspring.           <a

Although supported by the secular power, the heretics are for a time allowed to attack those who are good, yet, as the Lord said, they are not able to kill the soul. By the five months he indicates the time of this age on account of the five senses that we use in this life. Another translation has “six months,” which agrees with this interpretation on account of the six periods of the age. … As a scorpion dispenses its poison from its tail, so the impiety of evil persons injures from their hind parts, when by threats and allurements it causes temporal things, which are behind, to be preferred to that which lies before, that is, to eternal blessings.
