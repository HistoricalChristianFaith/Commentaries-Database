Hearing these things, he added a parable, because he was near Jerusalem, and because they thought that the kingdom of God would appear immediately. It is the custom of the Lord to confirm the preceding discourse with subsequent parables. Therefore, having received and commended the penance of the publican more than the righteousness of the proud, he added a parable to teach that penance of sinners pleases him more than the justice of the proud, and that he would more widely reign among humble Gentiles who were ignorant of the law, than among Jews who are proud of the justice from the law. And because the disciples, hearing about the passion of the Lord above, or the resurrection to be fulfilled in Jerusalem, did not understand what was being said, thinking that the kingdom of God was coming immediately, he illuminated their ignorance, showing that he would first spread the faith of his kingdom over the whole world, and thus at the end of the world would come as judge and king of all ages.
