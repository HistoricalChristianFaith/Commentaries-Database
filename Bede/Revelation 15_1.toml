The “seven angels” are the church full of the sevenfold grace.… He calls [the seven plagues] the “last,” because the wrath of God always smites a rebellious people with seven plagues, that is, he smites them utterly and completely, as it is often stated in Leviticus, “I will smite you with seven plagues.” These will be the final [persecutions], since the church will come out from the midst of them.
