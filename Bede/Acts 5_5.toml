It was not on account of [this] accusation that Peter gave such a severe sentence to the transgressors, but in the Spirit he foresaw future weeds that would by their deformed character adulterate the simplicity of the church. For from these the worst type of Sarabaits reportedly arose. Although by no means did they give up their possessions, they pretended to preserve apostolic discipline. He did not allow the culprits to be healed by any repentance, but in order to strike fear into the generations to come, he took care to cut the noxious shoot out by its roots.
