“Do not contend with a person for no reason,” etc. He does not forbid contending with the one who does wrong in order to correct him, because that is not done without purpose, but out of certain necessity which compels it to be done. Indeed, he who said: “If your brother sins, rebuke him” (Luke 17), wants us to try to recall the erring one to the path of truth as much as we can.
