Just as above the blood of vengeance goes out as far as the bridles of the horses, that is, to the unclean spirits, so also here, when the final revenge was poured over the same powers of the air, it is said, “It is done.” That is, the end is come, when, as the apostle says, “the last enemy, death, will be destroyed.” … When at the end of time there will be such a tribulation as has never been from the beginning, the greatest signs will similarly be evident. However, whether they come from the side of the good or from the side of the evil or come from both sides, as was the case with Moses and the magicians, is in this passage not sufficiently made clear.
