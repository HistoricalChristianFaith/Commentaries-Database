And he said to them: Such is the kingdom of God, as if a man casts seed upon the earth and sleeps; and rises night and day, and the seed sprouts and grows while he does not know it. For the earth produces fruit by itself, first the blade, then the ear, then the full grain in the ear. And when the fruit has brought itself forth, he immediately wields the sickle, because the harvest is at hand. A man casts seed upon the earth, when he instills good intention into his heart. And after he has cast the seed, he sleeps, because he already rests in the hope of good work. But he rises at night and by day, because he progresses among adversities and prosperities. And the seed sprouts and grows while he does not know it; because even when he cannot yet measure his growth, the virtue once conceived leads to progress. And the earth produces fruit by itself, because with grace preceding itself, the human mind spontaneously rises to the fruit of good work. But this same earth first brings forth the blade, then the ear, then the full grain in the ear. To produce the blade, indeed, is to still have the tenderness of good initiation. But the blade reaches the ear when the virtue conceived in the mind draws itself to the progress of good work. And the full grain in the ear fructifies, when the virtue already progresses so as to be of robust and perfect work. And when the fruit has produced itself, he immediately wields the sickle, because the harvest time is at hand. For the Almighty God, with the fruit produced, wields the sickle and cuts off His harvest, because when He has led each one to perfect works, He cuts off their temporal life by His sent judgment, to bring His grain to the heavenly granaries. Therefore, when we conceive good desires, we cast seed into the earth. But when we begin to act rightly, we are the blade. However, when we grow to the perfect work of goodness, we reach the ear. When we are solidified in the perfection of the same operation, we already bring forth the full grain in the ear. Hence no one should be seen still in the tenderness of the mind for good purpose, because the grain of God begins from the blade to become grain.
