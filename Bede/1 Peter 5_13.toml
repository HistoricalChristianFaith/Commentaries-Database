Peter refers to Rome as Babylon, probably because of the enormous amount of idolatry which existed in both cities. In the midst of such confusion the church shone out in spite of its poor and primitive condition, following the example set by the people of Israel when they were in captivity in Babylon and found it so hard to sing the Lordâ€™s song in a strange land. Peter therefore encourages his hearers by telling them that the church is in Babylon, that is, in a sea of troubles. He also uses this image to remind them that the church cannot escape being mixed up with the evils of this world.
