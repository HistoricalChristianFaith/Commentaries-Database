I have likened you, my friend, to my horse-drawn chariots of Pharaoh. For indeed, He calls His cavalry the army of the children of Israel, whom He freed from Egyptian bondage, leading them across the Red Sea into the desert, and brought into the land of the inheritance promised long ago, while the chariots of Pharaoh, which pursued them and wanted to drag them back to servitude, were drowned in the same sea. He calls it a cavalry because just as a charioteer is accustomed to presiding over his cavalry, so the Lord Himself then presided over that people, governing and leading them through the path of salvation. And He compared His Church, which He made His friend through the water of regeneration, to that cavalry: for just as the people were indeed greatly terrified by the approaching chariots of Pharaoh, but were nevertheless saved by heavenly protection, so He has always taught the Church to trust in His protection amidst the threats of persecutors. For even the fact that a pillar of fire then illuminated the people of God, while thick darkness overshadowed the Egyptian troops, so that throughout the whole night they couldn't approach each other; this too never ceases to happen in the night of this age, when the divine dispensation, separating the just from the reprobate with precise judgment, illuminates the just with His grace, but leaves the others in the deserved blindness. And even this, when they came to the Red Sea, the children of Israel were freed with the waters divided, while the Egyptians, with the waters returning upon them, were drowned with their horses and chariots, is it not evident that the very wave of death, which will face all mortals, carries the wicked to destruction, but opens the path to salvation for the pious? The other events too, which we read happened to the cavalry of God, that is, the people of Israel, during the time of the Egyptian persecution, are found, the more diligently they are explained, the more clearly they reveal themselves as a foreshadowing in the holy universal Church, of which that was a part. And since it is taught in this verse how the Lord protects the Church amidst adversities, it remains to be shown how much the Church itself maintains the love of the same Lord and protector in the face of adversities.
