And when they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives. This is what we read in the psalm: "The poor shall eat and be satisfied; those who seek the Lord will praise Him" (Psalm 21). The hymn can also be understood as the one which the Lord, according to John, sang while giving thanks to the Father, in which, lifting His eyes up, He prayed for Himself, for the disciples, and for those who would believe through their word. And beautifully, He led the disciples, who had been imbued with the sacraments of His body and blood and commended to the Father with a hymn of holy intercession, to the Mount of Olives, to symbolically show that through the reception of His sacraments and by the aid of His intercession, we ought to ascend to the higher gifts of virtues and the charismata of the Holy Spirit, by which we might be anointed in heart.
