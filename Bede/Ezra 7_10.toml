And a proclamation was issued in Judah and Jerusalem to all the descendants of the exiles to assemble in Jerusalem, and so on until it says: Then all the men of Judah and Benjamin gathered in Jerusalem within the three days. Since it is the descendants of Judah and Benjamin who are said to have assembled, it is very clear that those who were defiled by marrying foreign wives were from the first group of returnees, who came from those tribes and were recalled home by Jeshua and Zerubbabel, as we have said above.
