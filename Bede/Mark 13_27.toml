And then he will send his angels, and they will gather his elect from the four winds, from the ends of the earth to the ends of the sky. By the four winds, he means the four quarters of the world: East, West, North, and South. And lest anyone think it was only from the four sides of the earth, and not rather from its entire bounds including the interior regions, he aptly added: From the ends of the earth to the ends of the sky, that is, from the extreme borders of the earth straight to its farthest limits, where, to those gazing afar, the circle of the sky seems to enclose the earth. Therefore, on that day, no elect will be left behind, who will not meet the Lord coming to judgment in the air, whether still living in the body or already resurrected to life from death. The reprobates also come to judgment, both those found living in the body and those resurrected to life from death. But with this distinction, that the just are gathered into the joy of their Lord; whereas his enemies, after the judgment is finished, are scattered and perish from the presence of God.
