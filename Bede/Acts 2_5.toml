Now there were Jews living in Jerusalem, devout men, from every nation under heaven. I think it fitting to inquire who these were, and from what captivity the Jews. Since indeed the one that was in Egypt or Babylon had already been completed. But the Jews had not yet come into captivity to the Romans, although even that itself was already impending as retribution for the sin committed against the Savior. Therefore, it remains to be understood as the captivity that took place under Antiochus, which certainly had happened not many times before.
