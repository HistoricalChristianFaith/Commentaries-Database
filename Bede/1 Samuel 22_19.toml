Now he struck the city of the priests with the edge of the sword, etc. With the doctors of Christ slaughtered by the Antichrist, he also seeks to utterly disgrace and eradicate their fame of doctrine, by which they used to courageously combat impious dogma as if barking against it, and fortifying their own life with deeds. But he does not omit attempting to compel by wicked torments all these strong in work, fruitful in generating and nurturing Christ's children, the little ones in Christ still suckling at the breasts of a pious chaste mother, as well as those carrying His sweet yoke and light burden, innocently hearing His voice, and following Him to the eternal pastures of highest blessedness, either to deny their faith in Him or to endure death for Him.
