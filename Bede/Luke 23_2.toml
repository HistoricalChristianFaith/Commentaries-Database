And they began to accuse him, saying: We found this man perverting our nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar, and saying that he himself is Christ a King. The Jews are convicted of impiety, because in accusing the Savior they do not even find anything plausible in the falsehood they can charge him with. And so, as Mark says: their witness did not agree (Mark XIV). However, he himself, to provide us an example of patience, just as he endured being scourged before, so now accused, he is silent and keeps quiet.
