But he, taking her hand, called out saying: "Girl, arise." In Mark, it is written: He said to her: "Tabitha cumi", which is interpreted, "Girl, I say to you, arise"; and immediately she arose (Acts IX). Where a diligent reader may inquire why the truthful Evangelist, explaining the saying of the Savior, added from his own, "I say to you", when in the Syrian language which he used, it was said no more than "Girl, arise." Therefore, holding the girl's hand, Jesus healed her, because unless the hands of the Jews, which are full of blood, are first cleansed, their dead synagogue will not rise.
