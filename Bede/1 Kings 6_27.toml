From what has been said already it is clear why the cherubim, whose abode is always in heaven, were placed in the middle of the interior of the temple. The cherubim, moreover, stretch out their wings as if to fly because angelic spirits always have their mind in readiness to comply with the divine will. But the fact that one cherub’s wing was touching one wall and the second cherub’s wing the other wall has to do with that ministry of love that the angels perform for us. The fact that the other wings in the middle of the temple touched each other expresses that grace of love with which they embrace each other.
