By the latter, quite appropriately, the divinity of our Savior is signified, just as his humanity is by Tobias. And the fact that we say that by two persons, that is, an angel and a man, the one person of the mediator between God and people is denoted in a figure, will be no surprise to the one who reads in the commentaries of the venerable Fathers that in Isaac who was offered up by his father on an altar, and in the ram that was immolated, was denoted in figure as the one person of him who suffered for the world’s salvation. He in his humanity was slaughtered like a sheep, but in his divinity he remains with God the Father incapable of suffering, just as Isaac came back home alive with his father. For if the ram aptly represents the humanity of Christ and the man his godhead, why should not a man much more aptly signify his humanity and an angel his divinity?
