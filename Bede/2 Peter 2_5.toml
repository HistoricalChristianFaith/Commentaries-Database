Here Peter means the world as it was before the flood, when people lived in it just as they do now. Basically it was the same planet that we live on, but there were some differences. For example, the earth changed its shape when the waters overflowed it during the flood, and there were fewer mountains and valleys than there are now. This would be easy to deny if it were not for the fact that every year we see how the shape of the land is altered by periodic flooding. It is bad enough now, so think how much worse it must have been after the great flood.
