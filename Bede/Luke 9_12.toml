The day began to decline, and the twelve, approaching, said to him, "Send the crowds away, so that they may go into the villages and countryside around and find food." As the day declined, the Savior feeds the crowds, because either with the end of the ages approaching, or when the Sun of righteousness has set for us, we are saved from the wasting away of long spiritual famine.
