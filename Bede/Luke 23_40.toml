But the other, answering, rebuked him, saying: Do you not fear God, seeing that you are under the same condemnation? And we indeed justly, for we are receiving due reward for our deeds; but this man has done nothing wrong. And he said to Jesus: Lord, remember me when you come into your kingdom. Who would not marvel at the spirit of this thief? Rather, who could marvel worthily at the aid given by the grace of the Lord? Let him be venerated with due thanks. On the cross, nails had bound his hands and feet, leaving nothing free from punishment except his heart and tongue. By Godâ€™s inspiration, he offered to God all that he found free in himself so that, as it is written: With the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation (Rom. X). Moreover, the Apostle testifies that three virtues remain greatly in the hearts of the faithful, saying: And now abides faith, hope, charity (I Cor. XIII). All of these the thief received by sudden grace and kept on the cross. For he had faith, who believed that the Lord would reign, although he saw Him dying together with him. He had hope, who asked for entrance into His kingdom. He also held onto charity vividly in his death, who rebuked his brother and fellow thief for dying for similar wickedness and preached to him the life he had come to know. He who came to the cross guilty, behold what kind of person leaves the cross by grace. He confessed the Lord whom he saw dying beside him in human weakness, even when the apostles, who had seen Him perform miracles through divine power, denied Him.
