A golden earring and a shining pearl, etc. Rightly, the humble listener is compared to a golden earring, because while he willingly lends his ear to the reproving and teaching, he already prepares himself to receive the clarity of heavenly wisdom, he already approaches the vision of the divine light. Rightly, the learned master is compared to a shining pearl, because while he shows the reform of morals, while he reveals the knowledge of the divine to the desiring and piously seeking souls, he adds a greater and more pleasing splendor of the burning gem to the golden ornament.
