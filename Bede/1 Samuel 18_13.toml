Saul therefore removed him from himself, etc. Just as those who are in charge of fifty soldiers are called centurions; so they are called chiliarchs in Greek, who are in charge of a thousand soldiers, whom the Latin custom delights in calling tribunes rather than millenaries from the fact that they are in charge of a tribe. Therefore, the Jews removed Christ from themselves, having despised His faith, and made Him provide the leadership of spiritual warfare more abundantly to the believers. For their fault is the salvation of the Gentiles. But most of all, the Lord reigns over those who are stable and immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that their labor is not in vain in the Lord. Their quadrated conversation, so to speak, and free from any fall, is shown by the millenary number, which is a solid squared ten. For with ten, the perfection of work or reward is usually indicated. But so that this same perfection increases the breadth of fraternal love, multiply ten by ten to reach a hundred. This sum, according to arithmetic, has equal square sides but is still flat, and thus suited by the figure to the love of neighbors whom we see on earth. But so that the squaring of fraternal love is also solidified by the height of divine love, accumulate each part of the centenary number by ten to ascend to a thousand; thus it is understood that the ten is not only equal in quadriform stability but also solid in perfect completeness; because such a number suits those over whom Christ presides, and fits both the most stable height and the highest stability. For wherever you turn a square, it stands solidly; whatever the just encounter, it proves them entirely stable and immovable.
