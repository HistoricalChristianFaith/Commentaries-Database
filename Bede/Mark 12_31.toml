Neither of these two kinds of love is expressed with full maturity without the other, because God cannot be loved apart from our neighbor, nor our neighbor apart from God. Hence as many times as Peter was asked by our Lord if he loved him, and attested his love, the Lord added at the end of each inquiry, “Feed my sheep,” or “feed my lambs,” as if he were clearly saying: “There is only one adequate confirmation of wholehearted love of God—laboring steadily for the needy in your midst, exercising continuing care of them.”
