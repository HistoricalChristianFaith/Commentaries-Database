At that time Christians were called Nazarenes as an insult. Afterwards, however, a heretical sect arose among the Jews, which was called the Nazarenes. “They believed in Christ as the son of God, born of the virgin Mary, and they said that it was he who suffered under Pontius Pilate and rose from the grave. In him we also believe. But while they wanted to be both Jews and Christians, they were neither Jews nor Christians.”
