“The wheel of our life”: The ceaseless advance of our earthly life by which we are continuously moved from the day of our birth right up to death as if by the always turning wheel of a carriage. [Thus] Solomon, when he said well, “Remember your Creator in the days of your youth before the time of affliction comes,” a little further on added, “And the wheel above the cistern is broken, and the dust returns to the earth it came from.”
