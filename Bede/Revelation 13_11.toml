And I saw another beast coming up out of the earth. He said another in office, yet it is one. What is the sea is also the earth, according to Daniel. To whom, seeing the four beasts rise from the sea, the angel says: These four great beasts are four kingdoms that will arise from the earth (Daniel VII).

And he had two horns like a lamb and spoke like a dragon. He presents the horns of a lamb to secretly insert the poison of the dragon. Because, through the hypocrisy of holiness, he falsely claims to have the unique wisdom and life that the Lord truly possessed. Concerning this beast, the Lord says: Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheepâ€™s clothing, but inwardly they are ravenous wolves (Matthew VII).
