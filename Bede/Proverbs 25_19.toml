A rotten tooth and a stumbling foot, etc. And Jeremiah says: Cursed is the man that trusts in man, and makes flesh his arm (Jeremiah XIII). He is rightly compared to a rotten tooth and a weary foot, because he who does not know that the unique good of man is to cling to God and put his hope in the Lord his God; this man can neither receive the food of life, nor reach the abode of desired salvation. And such a person loses his cloak in the day of cold, because even if he seems to be clothed with the habit of religion in the serenity of the present life, yet when the strictness of the just judge threatens, he will appear naked in every way from the ornament of justice, and unworthy of the company of those of whom it is written: Blessed is he who watches, and keeps his garments, lest he walk naked, and they see his shame.
