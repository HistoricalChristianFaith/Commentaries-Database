And he answering said to him: Lord, let it alone this year also, until I dig around it. It is the voice of the apostles, who after the passion of the Lord earnestly prayed for the Jews, that the vengeance of the Lord's crucifixion might not be sought upon the impenitent. Until I dig (he says) around it, that is, by the root of the unfruitful mind humble it with the sharp hoe of rebuke, and by inflicting, namely, the pressures of the present and the terror of perpetual damnation. Every trench indeed is at the bottom. And certainly rebuke, while it shows the mind to itself, humbles it.
