Let no one say that sin is one thing and wickedness another. Let no one claim to be a sinner but not wicked. Sin and wickedness are the same thing. Actually, the true meaning of this verse is clearer when we look at the Greek, because the word which in Latin is rendered “wickedness” (iniquitas) in Greek is “lawlessness” (anomia). So what John really means is that sin is lawlessness.
