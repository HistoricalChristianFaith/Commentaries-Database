For Moses said: Honor your father and your mother. And he who speaks evil of father or mother, let him surely die. In Scripture, honor is not felt so much in greetings and the rendering of services as in alms and the giving of gifts. Honor (says the Apostle) widows who are truly widows (1 Tim. 5). Here honor is understood as a gift. And in another place: Elders who rule well are to be considered worthy of double honor, especially those who labor in the word and teaching (Ibid.). And by this commandment, we are ordered not to muzzle the ox while it is treading out the grain, so that the worker is worthy of his wages (Ibid.).
