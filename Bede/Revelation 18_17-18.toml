quote='''
And every shipmaster, and all the sailors stood afar off, etc. Can all who sail the sea be present to see the burning of the city? But he means all the worshipers and workers of the world fear for themselves, seeing the ruin of their hope.

Saying: Who is like this great city? That is, the world cannot be restored to its entirety.
