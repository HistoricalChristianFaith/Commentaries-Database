He always mixes harsh sayings in with the easy and appealing words, so that watchfulness is encouraged. Psalm 144 does the same when it mentions the grace of God’s abundant mercies and suddenly mentions also his impending judgment: “The Lord watches over all who love him but will destroy all sinners.” He mentions the cowardly along with the unbelievers, since those who doubt the rewards for those who conquer will certainly be afraid to undergo trial.… He shows that there are many classes of liars. However, the greatest and most detestable liar is the one who sins in religion. The author spoke of such persons above: “They say that they are Jews but they are not, for they are lying; they are the synagogue of Satan.”
