While he was speaking, a cloud came and overshadowed them. He who sought a material tabernacle received the shadow of the cloud, so that he might learn that in the resurrection, the saints are to be protected not by the covering of houses, but by the glory of the Holy Spirit. About which the Psalmist says: But the sons of men shall hope in the covering of your wings (Psalm 56). And in his Apocalypse, John says: And I did not see a temple in it, for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are its temple (Revelation 21).
