But he was angry and refused to go in. His father came out and began to plead with him. He is still indignant and does not want to go in. Therefore, when the fullness of the Gentiles has come in, his father will go out at the appropriate time, so that all Israel may be saved, from whose part blindness has happened, like an absence in the field, until the fullness of the younger son, far off in the idolatry of the Gentiles, returns to enter and eat the calf. For there will indeed be an open calling of the Jews in the salvation of the Gospel. He calls this manifestation of the calling, as the father's going out to plead with the elder son.
