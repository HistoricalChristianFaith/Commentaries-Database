He led them out as far as Bethany, and lifting up his hands, he blessed them. And it happened that while he blessed them, he parted from them, and was carried up into heaven. Omitting all that could have been done by him with the disciples over forty days, he silently joins the first day of his resurrection to the last day on which he ascended into heaven. Beautifully, as he was about to ascend into heaven, he led the disciples whom he blessed out to Bethany. Firstly, because of the name of the city, which is called the house of obedience. Because he who descended due to the disobedience of the perverse, ascended surely due to the obedience of the converted: For he died, as the Apostle says, for our offenses, and rose again for our justification (Romans 4). Secondly, also because of the location of the same village, or little city, which is said to be situated on the side of the Mount of Olives. Because evidently the house of the obedient Church, worthy of apostolic hospitality, has established its foundations not elsewhere but on the very side of the high mountain, that is, the side of Christ, faith, hope, and love. From which indeed, through the lance-opened side, it delighted to see the sacraments of blood and water, by which it is both born and nourished, flow forth. From whose most abundant peak, that is, from the summit of divinity, it desires the gifts of spiritual anointing, and eagerly expects the promises of perpetual light and peace. Thirdly, because as John writes, Bethany was near Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs off (John 11). This number, indeed, due to the seven and eight which comprise it, fits the mysteries of the Scriptures, whether representing the life that is now or the life to come, or the Old and New Testament, or the rest of souls in the future and the resurrection of the flesh, or certainly something else entirely containing a heavenly and spiritual secret. And therefore rightly, to those to whom he opened the knowledge of both Testaments, whom he also taught every rule of living and hoping, he led out to the place where he would bless them and give them teaching commands, fifteen furlongs away. Rightly he separated the place of his glorious ascension from the place of his most victorious passion by fifteen furlongs, so that he might strengthen all who desire to live or die for him, with both the desire and love of first resting after death and finally being resurrected from the dead.
