The elect are doubtless imbued with one true faith, even if their merits differ in rank; for they will come to one light of eternal truth in heaven, even though the ones who endeavor to cleave to Christ higher up in this life will enjoy a closer vision of him in that life. Accordingly, it is said of certain ones on account of the merit of their great virtue, “These are those who follow the Lamb wherever he goes”; just before, it is said of others, as if of the nearby branches on the lampstand, “And they were singing a new song, as it were, before the throne and before the four living creatures and before the elders.” By this it is shown that all the saints throughout the streets of that heavenly city sing a new song of gladness to God, but those who in this life transcended the common life of the faithful by the special privilege of sacred virginity are there raised up into a special position above the others in the joy of song.

Virgins are not joined to the divine following because of chastity only, unless they also lead a life unblemished by any infection of sin. Tyconius does not interpret this vision to refer especially to virgins, but generally to the whole church, which the apostle betroths “to one husband, to present a pure virgin to Christ,” and he concludes in this way: “He did not say ‘no lie was in their mouth’ but ‘no lie was found.’ ” As the apostle says, “And such were you, but you have been washed,” and “the iniquity of the unjust will not harm him on the day he will have turned from his iniquity,” and he will be able to be a virgin, and deceit will not be found in his mouth. For those who are chaste and pure he calls “virgins.”
