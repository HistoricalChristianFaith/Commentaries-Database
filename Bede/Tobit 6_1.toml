When the Lord came to save the Gentiles, holy preachers followed in his footsteps because they carried out what he had commanded: “Go and teach all the nations.” Finally the Lord filled the home of Cornelius with the Holy Spirit, and so Peter baptized them with water. The teachers are called dogs because they defend their founder’s spiritual home, property and sheep from thieves and beasts, that is, from unclean spirits and heretical people.

Tobias stopped over by the waters of the Tigris because the Lord, when he appeared in the world, spent his life among sinners and mortals; but the water of sin did not touch him, nor did the prince of darkness, when he came, find in him anything of his own.
