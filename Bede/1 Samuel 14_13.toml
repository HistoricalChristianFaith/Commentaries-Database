Jonathan, however, climbed up, crawling on his hands and feet, etc. It is clear indeed that greater obstacles of temptations must be overcome with greater exertion of virtues; which is duly accomplished when, armed against the enemy, a humble spiritual listener follows all the examples of the teacher. But about the situation of this place, so it may become clearer to the reader, let us see the words of Josephus (Antiq. VI, 7). "The enemy's camps," he says, "were situated on a rock with a most subtle length, protruding in three very sharp peaks, with rocks going around, and as though ramparts preventing the assaults of the fighters. Hence it happened that the guards had less solitude of the camps; because by nature that place seemed fortified to all, and very difficult to capture, because not only did it seem difficult to ascend there, but even to approach. When therefore Jonathan had come to the camps, he encouraged his armor-bearer." And a little later: "Thus approaching the enemy's army, with day already appearing, the Philistines saw them." Again, after a few things, when he had narrated the words of the taunting Philistines, he added: "Saul's son, gladly receiving that voice as one designating victory for him, then indeed from that place, in which the enemies had been seen, withdrew; and changing place came to the rock, which, because of the fortifications of the places, was deserted by the guards, and from there, as though crawling and dragging themselves with much effort, they overcame the nature of the place, so that they descended to the enemies' camp; attacking them while sleeping, they indeed killed about twenty." However, having mentioned these places for the sake of clarity, let us return to investigating the mysteries of Sacred Scripture.

And the first blow was struck, with which Jonathan and his armor-bearer smote, etc. The number ten, as is certain, often signifies the perfection of good works or merit. But on the contrary, the number twenty, in which Jacob served Laban the Syrian, and sent gifts to his brother Esau, whom God hated, demonstrates the duplicity of depraved doctrines, which strive to take away the devotion or certainty of heavenly reward from the simple and members of the Church. The half acre of plowing is the Church, which, still conversing among the reprobate on earth, rejoices to be exercised by the correction of preachers in generating the fruits of life. A pair of oxen plowing in the day is the concord of teachers, of the discipline of law and Gospel under the same yoke of faith agreeing, chastising the hearts of subjects in the light of prescribed knowledge and cultivating them to bear fruit to God by the Spirit, of which Solomon says: “But where there are many crops, there the strength of the ox is manifest” (Prov. XIV). Therefore, the first strike, which Jonathan and his armor-bearer struck, was upon twenty men, in the middle of half an acre; and from there the Philistines, troubled and fleeing here and there, slaughtered each other with a very great massacre. First, the Church, which travels away from the Lord, shows the enemies of its faithful or actions to be sons of death, restraining them from besieging and disturbing its own through spiritual masters and obedient disciples; then they themselves of varying errors, as if with a contrary blade, pierce each other, so that, with the Church triumphing, it can openly be understood of them what is said: “For the sword of each one turned against his neighbor.”
