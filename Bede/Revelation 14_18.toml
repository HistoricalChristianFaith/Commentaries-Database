For, as the holy Gregory says, although the end of the world depends on its own course, yet by overtaking such as are more perverse, because they are deservedly overwhelmed in its ruin, it becomes known through them.            <a

As Jerome says, “The duty of the angels is twofold. Some assign rewards to the righteous; others preside over the various torments.” As it is said, “Who makes the winds to be his messengers and the flaming fire his ministers.” The two angels who announce that the harvest is dry and that the vineyard is ripe can be understood to represent the prayers of the church, which with a loud voice, that is, with a fervent desire, daily prays that the kingdom of the Lord come, saying: “Put in your sharp sickle, and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth.” As it was with the harvest, so also the vintage is partly of the earth and partly of heaven. But the maturation of both indicates the end of the age. “For its grapes were ripe.” This means that their sins are completed, although the perfection of that which is good can also be called “ripeness.”
