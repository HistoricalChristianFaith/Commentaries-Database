Truly when speaking to the populace the blessed Stephen followed the popular opinion in his discourse. In conflating the two accounts he concentrated less on the arrangement of the historical details than on the point with which he was concerned. For this man, who was accused of teaching against the holy place and the law, proceeded to show how it might be demonstrated from the law that Jesus Christ was the promised one and that they [the Jews] had been unwilling to be subject to Moses then, and they were unwilling to be subject to the Lord now. I have given the best explanation that I can, not [intending to] pass judgment in advance on a better opinion, if there should be one. Furthermore, the phrase “from the sons of Hamor, the son of Shechem” in the Greek exemplar is written “from the sons of Hamor, who was in Shechem.” This seems to be more in accord with the history in Genesis, although it could have been the case that the same Hamor had both a father and a son named Shechem.
