Or what king, going to engage in war against another king, will not first sit down and consider whether he is able with ten thousand to meet the one who comes against him with twenty thousand? Otherwise, while the other is still far away, he sends a delegation and asks for the terms of peace. A king comes against a king in equal battle, and yet, if he perceives that he cannot be sufficient, he sends a delegation and asks for terms of peace. With what tears, therefore, must we hope for pardon, who in that dreadful trial do not come to judgment equally with our king, whom undeniably our condition, weakness, and cause present as inferior? But perhaps we have already severed the faults of evil work, already we have outwardly declined all depravities; do we suffice to give an account of our thoughts? Therefore, when a double army comes against a single one, it examines us, scarcely prepared in our deeds alone, simultaneously concerning our deed and thought. And therefore, while it is still far away, let us send a delegation, let us ask for the things of peace. It is said to be far away, because it is not yet seen presently through judgment. Let us send our delegation, our tears, let us send works of mercy, let us sacrifice on His altar the offerings of placation. This is our delegation, which appeases the coming king.
