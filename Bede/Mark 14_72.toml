But what can be meant by his being first recognized by a woman, when men were more able to know him, if it be not that that sex might be seen to sin in the death of our Lord, and that sex be redeemed by His Passion? It goes on: “But he denied, saying, I know not, neither understand I what thou sayest.”.
The other Evangelists do not mention this crowing of the cock; they do not however deny the fact, as also some pass overmany other things in silence, which others relate. There follows: “And a maid saw him again, and began to say to them that stood by, This is one of them.”.
By this denial of Peter we learn, that not only he denied Christ, who says that He is not the Christ, but healso, who although he is a Christian, denies himself to be such. For the Lorddid not say to Peter, Thou shalt deny thyself to be my disciple, but, “Thoushalt deny me;” he therefore denied Christ, when he said that he was not Hisdisciple.There follows: “And a little after, they that stood by said again to Peter, Surely thou art one of them, for thou art aGalilaean, and thy speech agreeth thereto. "Not that the Galilaeans spoke a different tongue from the inhabitants of Jerusalem, for they were both Hebrews, but that each province and region has its own peculiarities, and cannot avoid avernacular pronunciation.
How hurtful it is to speak with the wicked. He denies before infidels that he knows the Man, whom amongst the disciples, he had confessed to be God. But the Scripture is wont to point out aSacrament of the causes of things, by the state of the time; thus Peter, who denied at midnight, repented at cock crew. Wherefore it is added: “And the second time the cock crew. And Peter called to mind the word which Jesus said unto him, Before the cock crew twice, thou shalt deny me thrice.”
