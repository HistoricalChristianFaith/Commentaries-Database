"A rich man rules over the poor," etc. It is clear according to the letter; but also the rich in virtues in the judgment of the secret inspector rule over those who lack the riches of virtues, indeed they are future judges of them. And whoever receives the word of salutary teaching from a teacher, is a servant of the same teacher, that is, a debtor to fulfill all that he [the teacher] rightfully commands by the authority of heavenly teachings.
