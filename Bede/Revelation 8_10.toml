The third trumpet shows the heretics apostatizing from the church and corrupting the rivers of the holy Scriptures.… The heretics, whom the apostle Jude calls “stars of seduction,” fall from the height of the church and by the flame of their own iniquity endeavor to pollute the fountains of the divine Scriptures, fearing neither to falsify their meaning and often even their words. And so they are worthy of the name Wormwood. For even a small admixture of this is able to make bitter a great sweetness.
