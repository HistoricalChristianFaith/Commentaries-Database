"And the sluggard desires and does not desire," etc. Rightly, the lazy person is marked by the term, who wants to reign with God but does not want to work for God. The rewards delight when they are promised; the struggles deter when they are commanded. Concerning this, James says, "A double-minded man is unstable in all his ways" (James 1). And the son of Sirach says, "Woe to the sinner who walks on two paths!" But those who carry out the Lord's commands do so because their soul is refreshed by the sweetness of heavenly things; according to him who beseeches the Lord, saying, "My soul will be satisfied as with fat and richness" (Psalm 62). Or certainly, the soul of the workers will be enriched, because those who toil with pious labor for the Lord will be rewarded with a heavenly and unfading recompense after their labors.
