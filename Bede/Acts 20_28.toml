He had said previously that the presbyters of Ephesus had been summoned to Miletus. Now he calls them bishops, that is, overseers. One city could not have several bishops, but under the name bishops [Paul] indicates these presbyters as being in fact priests, for the order was connected, and in many it was practically the same.

He did not hesitate to say “the blood of God,” because of the oneness of person in two natures of the same Jesus Christ. On account of this it has also been said, “the Son of man, who is in heaven.” Therefore let Nestorius stop separating the Son of man from the Son of God and making for himself two Christs.
