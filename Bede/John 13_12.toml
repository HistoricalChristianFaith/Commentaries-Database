Our Lord first did a thing, then taught it: as it is said, Jesus began both to do and to teach (Acts 1:1).
To know what is good, and not to do it, tends not to happiness, but to condemnation; as James said, To him that knows to do good, and does it not, to him it is sin (James 4:17). Wherefore He adds, If you know these things, happy are you if you do them.
