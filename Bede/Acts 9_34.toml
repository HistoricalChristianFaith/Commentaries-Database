When Peter had cured him of paralysis, he commanded him to rise at once and make his bed. Spiritually this informs us that whoever has received into his heart the firm foundation of faith will not only shake off the torpor in which he has been lying idle but will also produce the good works in which he will be able to rest after his toil.
