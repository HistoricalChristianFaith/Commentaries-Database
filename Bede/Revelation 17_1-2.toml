The multitude of the lost, who, abandoned by the Creator, gave themselves over to the corruption of demons are said to sit upon the waves, that is, upon the seditious discord of the nations. “The company of those who believed were of one heart and soul,” whom the apostle betrothed “to one husband, to present her as a pure bride to Christ.” “The kings of the earth have committed fornication [with the harlot], and with the wine of her fornication the dwellers on earth have become drunk.” The whole is greater than the parts. For the kings and the inhabitants of the earth each seek arrogantly after the things of the earth, and through the lust of vice they are corrupted by the allurements of the world and are made drunk by the madness of their minds.
