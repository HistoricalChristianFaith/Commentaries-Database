And crying out and greatly convulsing him, it came out of him. The unclean spirit, about to depart from the man, convulses him, and terrifies the onlookers with a frantic cry. For often the devil, while being expelled from the heart, generates sharper temptations in it than he had previously stirred up when he possessed it quietly.

And he became as dead; so that many said, he is dead. But Jesus, taking his hand, lifted him up, and he rose. Him whom the impious enemy had already been forced to flee and had struck down, rendering him like unto the dead, this pious Savior raised up with his gentle right hand touch. He showed by the power of saving that He was truly God, and also demonstrated by the manner of the human touch that He truly possessed the nature of flesh. For the insane Manichaeus denies that He was truly clothed in flesh: but He, by raising, cleansing, and enlightening so many with His touch, condemned that heresy even before it was born.
