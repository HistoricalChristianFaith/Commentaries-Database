They bemoan the loss of all the spectacles of the world and those things that are pleasant to the senses of the body and that are suitable for external use. For the various kinds of metals pertain to sight, the odors to smell, the unguents to the touch, the wine, wheat and oils to the taste. In the mention of the beasts of burden and of the slaves, they lament the loss of other aids to humanity, and this in a double sense. For either they fail when this world passes away, or the miserable survivors of those who have left the joys of the world through death lament their ruin as though [it were] the ruin of their own city.
