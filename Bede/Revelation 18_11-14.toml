And the merchants of the earth will weep and mourn over her, etc. They mourn the fall of all the world’s pomp, and those things which are either pleasant to the bodily senses or suitable for external uses. For precious metals pertain to sight, perfumes to smell, ointments to touch, wine, wheat, and oil to taste. Under the term of beasts and slaves, other human aids are also understood to perish. This is understood in two ways, as I said: either because these things fail with the dying world, or because the wretched survivors mourn the destruction of those who left the world’s joys through death as if they were mourning the ruins of their own city, and hence they are said to stand afar off, fearing similar punishment.
