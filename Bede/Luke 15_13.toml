And not many days after, the younger son gathered all together, took his journey into a far country, and there wasted his substance with riotous living. He went far away, not by changing his location, but by changing his mind. For the more someone sins in wicked deeds, the further he withdraws from the grace of God. The fact that it is said he departed not many days after, having gathered all together, to a far country, means because not long after the establishment of the human race, it pleased the soul to carry with it by free will a certain power of its nature, and to abandon Him by whom it was created, presiding over its own strengths. These strengths it consumes the quicker, the more it abandons Him by whom they were given. Therefore, he calls this life prodigal, loving to squander and to spend prodigally on outward shows, emptying itself within, when someone follows what proceeds from it, and leaves behind Him who is more interior to himself.
