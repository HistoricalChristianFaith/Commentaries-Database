First, we must note and diligently remember that the Lord condescended to stand in the middle of his disciples who were speaking around him and to reveal his presence in a vision of himself. This is what he promised elsewhere to all the faithful, saying, “Where there are two or three gathered together in my name, there am I in their midst.” In order to strengthen the steadfastness of our faith, which the presence of the divine benevolence always brings, he wished sometimes to show this by the presence of a physical vision of himself. Although we are lying far below the apostles’ feet, in our case we must trust that this same thing happens to us by his mercy. He is in our midst as often as we come together and gather in his name. His name is Jesus, that is, “Savior.” When we come together to speak about receiving our eternal salvation, it is undoubtedly true that we are gathered in the name of Jesus. It is not permissible to doubt that he is present among us as we are talking about the things that he himself loves. The more truly he is present, the better we retain in a more perfect heart what we profess with our mouth.

We must also see that when the Savior appeared to his disciples, he immediately imposed on them the joys of peace. He repeated that same thing that is a part of the celebrated glory of immortality that he gave as a special pledge of salvation and life when he was about to go to his passion and death. “Peace I leave to you. My peace I give you.” The angels seen soon after he was born also proclaimed the grace of this favor to the shepherds, praising God and saying, “Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace to men of good will.” Certainly the entire divinely arranged plan of our Redeemer’s coming in the flesh is the reconciliation of the world. For this purpose, he became incarnate, suffered and was raised from the dead. He did this to lead us, who had incurred God’s anger by sinning, back to God’s peace by his act of reconciliation. The prophet correctly gave him the names “Father of the world to come” and “Prince of Peace.” The apostle also wrote about him to those from among the nations who had believed. He said, “Coming, he brought the good news of peace to you who were from far off and peace to those who were near, since through him we both have access in one Spirit to the Father.”
