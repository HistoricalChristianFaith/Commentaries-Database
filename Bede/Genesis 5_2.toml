And he called their names Adam on the day when they were created. Adam, like Enos, is interpreted as Man, but Enos is said to sound like Man in a way that only suits males: whereas Adam is able to be applied to both sexes; hence it is rightly said that he called their names Adam, that is, Man. Just as man in Latin derives the etymology of the name from soil because he derives the origin of his flesh from soil, so among the Hebrews Adam is named from the earth because man was formed from the clay of the earth; hence also Adam can be interpreted as Earthly, or red earth. Furthermore, among the Greeks, man has a different etymology: for he is called antropos, from the fact that he ought to look above and lift the eyes of the mind to view the heavens. Moreover, in the name Adam, apart from the interpretation which designates man, there is another mystery which ought not to be passed over in silence. For it has four letters: A, and D, and A, and M, from which letters the four quarters of the globe, when named in Greek, take their beginning. For among them the east is called anatole, the west is called dysis, the north is called arctos, and the south is called mesembria; and it was very fitting that the name of the first man should mystically contain all the regions of the world, through whose progeny the whole world was to be filled. But when it says, And he called their names Adam, and added, On the day when they were created, it clearly insinuates that on one and the same day, that is, the sixth day of the nascent world, Adam and his wife were made, and not that the wife was separately created from his side after the sixth or seventh day.
