He clearly shows that all this will happen before the final persecution, for he says, “when they have finished their testimony.” At least that will happen which they show until the revelation of the beast who will emerge from the hearts of the wicked. They will strive at that time valiantly to resist the enemy with the same testimony; however, it is believed that at that time the church will be made destitute of the gift of miracles, while the adversary will be openly active with deceptive signs. As the Lord says, “Want will go before his face.” “And he will conquer and kill them.” He will conquer in those who will have succumbed, and he will kill those who by a praiseworthy suffering for the name of Christ will be slain. Or, should he conquer and kill in a spiritual manner, we understand this to refer to a portion of the witnesses, as it says in the Gospel, “They will deliver you up to tribulation and put you to death.” And the Evangelist Luke indicates that this was spoken of a part, saying, “Some of you they will put to death.” “And they will throw their bodies onto the streets of the great city.” “If they persecuted me, they will also persecute you,” it says. Therefore, it is not surprising if the city of the wicked, which did not fear to crucify the Lord, should also hold his servants in derision, even if they are dead. The history of the church relates that such things often occurred. “Which is spiritually called Sodom and Egypt.” “Sodom” and “Egypt” mean “silent” and “dark,” for this city possesses neither the light of faith nor the sound of confession. For “man believes with his heart and so is justified, and he confesses with his lips and so is saved.” As a sign of spiritual punishment, these regions were oppressed with these plagues, that is, [Sodom] by a ravaging fire and [Egypt] by water turned into blood.
