Lest you think that a friendâ€™s crime which you are unable to correct should be concealed, it rightly says that a people are corrupted without a governor but are saved where there is abundant counsel. [This is said] in order to show that the deed you are unable to amend alone should be revealed to many, so that it may be corrected by the unanimous diligence of all. .
