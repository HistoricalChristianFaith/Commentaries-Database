"Where there is no guidance, the nation falls," etc. Lest you should think that, if you cannot correct the faults of a friend, you should keep them hidden, he rightly says that a people without a governor will fall; but there will be safety where there are many counsels, to show that what you cannot amend alone must be revealed to many, so that the unified diligence of all may correct it.
