And the whole multitude of them arose and led him unto Pilate. That the word of Jesus might be fulfilled, which he had predicted concerning his death: For he shall be delivered unto the Gentiles, and shall be mocked, and spitefully entreated, and spitted on: And they shall scourge him, and put him to death (Luke XVIII). By Gentiles, he indeed means the Romans. For Pilate was Roman, and the Romans had sent him as governor to Judea, to whom the Jews deliver the Lord to be crucified, wishing in this manner to make themselves appear as if not involved in his death, so that their cruelty might be shown, not their innocence.
