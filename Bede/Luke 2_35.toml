And a sword shall pierce through your own soul also. No history teaches that blessed Mary departed from this life by the sword's killing, especially since it is not the soul, but the body that is usually killed by iron. Hence it must be understood that this sword, of which it is said: And a sword is in their lips (Psalm LVIII), passed through her soul, meaning the sorrow of the Lord's passion. Even though she knew Christ to be the Son of God and thus would not doubt he would overcome death, she, however, could not without sorrow witness her flesh and blood being crucified. For the iron that is said to have transpierced Joseph's soul is best understood as severe mental tribulation.

That the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed. It was uncertain once who among the Jews would accept the grace of Christ, which they surely knew was to come, and who would rather reject it. But upon hearing of His birth, with the thoughts of hearts soon revealed, King Herod was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him. The shepherds, with fear and joy, resounded praises to God, announced the message of peace to men. With His teaching and power being spread abroad, some flocked to Him as a teacher of truth, others fled from Him as a deceiver. With His sign of the cross raised, some mocked blasphemously as if justly condemned to death, others mourned bitterly as if the author of life were dying. And even to this day, and to the end of the present age, the sword of most severe tribulation does not cease to pierce through the soul of the Church, while it considers many hearing the Word of God and rising with Christ, but many more falling away from belief. With the thoughts of many hearts revealed, where the best seed of the Gospel is sown, there the weeds of vices either prevail more than they should or, gravely to say, alone germinate and reign.
