I will apprehend thee, etc. But thus the Synagogue speaks, as Paul says, We who live, who are left unto the coming of the Lord, shall not precede those who have fallen asleep (1 Thess. IV). He, though knowing certainly that he could not endure in the flesh until the day of judgment, yet on account of the fellowship of one and the same brotherhood, joins himself to the number of those who in the advent of the Judge will be found alive in the flesh. And here, therefore, the ancient people of God speaks from the perspective of that part of itself which would see Him appearing in the flesh: I will apprehend thee, and bring thee into my mother’s house: I will receive thee with ready and faithful devotion as thou comest, and with eager desires I will embrace thy words, I will await thy promises, and after the dispensation of the flesh is completed, I will lead thee back to the heavens with joyous eyes, I will proclaim thee with a joyful voice to all. For this is the house of His mother, namely the happiness of the heavenly homeland, for the inhabitation of which human nature was created, to which, if no one had sinned, the whole human race would have passed from the delights of paradise, in which the first man was placed, without the intermediary of death. Into this house, therefore, the Church promises to bring her Lord, not able to achieve this by her own power, but desiring it to be fulfilled through her prayers, proclaiming it to be fulfilled or predicting it to be fulfilled; just as the Psalmist could exalt Him to the heavens, who nevertheless said, I will extol thee, O Lord, for thou hast raised me up (Psalm XXIX). Which is to say openly, Because thou hast deigned to take upon thee my human frailty, rightly do I profess the praises of thy power, who hast glorified this with the unfailing delight of my mind.

There you will teach me, etc. There you will teach me, in the very substance of flesh, in which I will find you outwardly and kiss you; there you will give me the precepts of your Gospel, which the prophets, the law, and the psalms promised: there you will teach me to hope for more excellent gifts than I read in the law and the prophets; or certainly to be understood more deeply: there you will teach me in that house of my mother, into which I desire to lead you with a delightful company of eyes, and at the same time with praise of words. For there he taught and teaches the Church, from that part of it which he has received to himself there. There he will teach the whole Church, when, the universal judgment having been completed, his saints will be nowhere else, but all in heaven with him. What he will teach there, he himself designates in the Gospel, when in that most sweet and extensive discourse, which he held with it last before the passion, he says among other things: These things I have spoken to you in proverbs: the hour is coming, when I will no longer speak to you in proverbs, but I will tell you plainly about the Father, that is, I will plainly show you the Father.

And I will give you a cup of spiced wine, etc. The Church gives a cup of wine to the Lord when, having received His benefits, it returns great and fervent gratitude of love, and the wine itself is not pure, but seasoned as if with a mixture of noble spices when the same love is proven by the attestation of good works. Nor should we only engage in those works that show our love for the Creator, but also those that demonstrate our fraternal love, if we wish to offer a worthy and acceptable cup of our devotion to Him. This is clearly differentiated by Him when, admonishing His disciples not to show their righteousness before men to be seen by them, He immediately added three types of good action to conclude the same instruction: namely, almsgiving, prayer, and fasting; clearly indicating that our righteousness should consist in these three. For almsgiving pertains to all we mercifully do to relieve our neighbor's needs; prayer encompasses all that we perform with devoted piety to appease our Creator; fasting involves the full chastisement of the mind by which we strive to abstain from vices and worldly contagions. And because the holy Church offers not only the purity of life to her beloved but also the precious cup of death in many of her members for His love, it is fitting that after saying, "And I will give you a cup of spiced wine," it adds, "And the juice of my pomegranates." For the pomegranates are the same as the pomegranates; they are called pomegranates because of their abundance of seeds and are known as "pomegranates" because they are especially abundant in Africa and around Carthage. Since they hold the figure of the blessed martyrs, the reddish color itself is indicative. And well does he call it the juice of pomegranates, not a potion, wine, or strong drink, to signify the fervor of unquenchable love in the heart of the victorious army. For the juice, that is, wine taken directly from the press, is usually of greater fervor; therefore it aptly suits their most fervent virtue, who do not hesitate to pass through iron and flames for the vision of the Creator: for since this type of drink is said to not only heal the heat of the stomach and corrupted belly but also benefit the rest of the body, who does not see that the fervor of charity, the more it abounds, the more it covers, indeed even extinguishes the multitude of sins? Let then the ancient congregation of the righteous, desiring to see their creator’s advent in the flesh, say, "There you will teach me, and I will give you a cup of spiced wine, and the juice of my pomegranates." As if openly declaring: "There, that is, in the very time or place where I will have found and deserved to speak with You, and You will give me the commands and gifts appropriate for the Son of God appearing in human form to men, and I will render to You the service of an undivided heart, which is truly due to God; because surely His advent grants heavenly rest to the Church laboring in the adversities of the world, both now in hope and in the future in reality," rightly does it continue:
