And there were born to Heber two sons: the name of one was Peleg, because in his days the earth was divided, and the name of his brother was Joktan. He calls this the division of the earth, which occurred in the confusion of languages. He named his son Peleg, that is, Division, to leave a perpetual memory of his devotion to his descendants, because, indeed, when the languages of the faithless were divided due to their pride, he, by the merit of his faith, preserved the original language of the human race.
