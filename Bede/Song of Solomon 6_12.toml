I did not know, my soul was troubled within me, etc. I did not know the gifts of spiritual grace with which you were illuminated by the Lord to bring forth the fruits of faith among all nations. The internal anxiety of my mind troubled me because of the sudden introduction of the New Testament in place of the old, while the proclamation of the gospel suddenly filled the whole world instead of the books of the prophets and the law, which I knew to be divine and written by the Holy Spirit. Like swift chariots, it quickly traversed not only Judea and Samaria, but also the borders of all nations, to my amazement and astonishment. I rightly compare it not just to chariots, but to quadrigas; for indeed the authority of four writers commended it to memory, but the mind and hand to write were directed by one Spirit of God through Jesus Christ, like if you see one quadriga prepared for the course by the harmonious speed of four horses, but governed by the guidance of one charioteer, so that they run on the right path. Indeed, I had heard for a long time that four authors would write about Jesus with equal consent, but what spirit drove them, what utility and truth, how much glory and salvation their scripture contained, alas, I deserved to realize and know so late! Moreover, that the quadrigas are called the heralds of the New Testament in the name of Aminadab, signifies the Lord Savior, who, presiding over the chariot, filled the hearts of the preachers with the grace of His Spirit, through whom, by the preceding notion of the saving doctrine, He would reach the peoples about to believe in Him. For Aminadab, who was the great-grandson of the patriarch Judah, in both his person and name indicates the Lord Savior: namely, by his person, because the genealogy of the Lord's incarnation descends from Abraham to King David, from David to Joseph and Mary, in the same manner as the names of Judah and David, and Solomon, and other fathers, from whom Christ descended according to the flesh, are sometimes taken by the prophets to signify Him; as in the phrase, "Judah is a lionâ€™s cub. To the prey, my son, you have gone up. He stooped down, he crouched as a lion, and as a lioness; who shall rouse him up?" (Gen. XLIX). And again: "And I will cleanse them; and they shall be My people, and I will be their God, and David My servant shall be king over them" (Ezek. XXXVII). And in this very volume: "Go forth, daughters of Zion, and see King Solomon" (Cant. III). However, by his own name, Aminadab, which means "of my people, spontaneous," he fittingly designates the Mediator of God and men, who, although he was God before the ages, united with flesh, when he wanted and how he wanted, appeared as a pious Redeemer among the people of the Church. He became a part of his people through spontaneous kindness, of whom he was the Creator and ruler by natural power. When the Synagogue confesses the long delay of its mind, by which it was hindered from understanding the mysteries of the Lord's incarnation, the Church promptly responds by comforting and exhorting: Return, return, O Shulammite. Return to the knowledge of your Redeemer, from whom for so long you miserably wandered away, so that being imbued with his sacraments, you may become worthy of entering the heavenly life; return to the peace of our brotherhood, which you considered, for a long time, to be despised due to the cause of discordant religion. Return, return, so that we may look upon you: return in the purity of faith, return in the perfection of works, to the love of the Lord together, so that with joyful eyes and minds, we may contemplate the beauty of your chastity, which we have long desired, and with Christ's love uniting us together, we may be built into one house of faith, both in Him, as in the cornerstone. However, I do not remember ever reading the name Shulammite elsewhere; indeed, it seems to be the name of some noblewoman, either proper or derived from a place, who was distinguished at that time by much glory of wisdom, or beauty, or virtue. But if Shulammite, as some say, means despised or captive, this name is fitting for the Synagogue, which, because of the fault of treachery, departed from the grace of its creator, as much as it was captive under the yoke of sin, it remained unworthy in respect to divine kindness. But the Shulammite is asked to return, so that by the obedience of returning to the Lord, she may deserve to be freed from the binding of harmful captivity and be made worthy of the sight of her Redeemer and Savior. While the Church admonishes the Synagogue to return to the grace of its Redeemer, the Redeemer himself, agreeing to her devoted exhortations, suddenly interjects his speech and declares that the consolations of her exhortations are now about to come to effect. For he says:
