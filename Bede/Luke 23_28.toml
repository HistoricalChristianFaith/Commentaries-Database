"Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me, but weep for yourselves and for your children. Do not (he says) mourn for me about to die, for whose quick resurrection can dissolve death, whose death shall destroy all death, and deathâ€™s author itself. Rather, weep for yourselves and your progeny, so that you may not be damned along with the faithless to eternal death in retribution for my cross, and cleanse yourselves with worthy fountains of tears." And it should be noted when he calls them daughters of Jerusalem, that not only those who had come with him from Galilee, but also the women citizens of the same city adhered to him. And now also, as if Jesus is about to be sacrificed, a double crowd follows him, with some reading, listening to, and recollecting his passion's story as if worthy of laughter, and others with tearful eyes as is proper. Some regard the mysteries of his flesh and blood as cheap common foods, whereas others partake of it with a heart worthy of such a great matter. But where the Lord sees a contrite and humbled heart, he soon adds the grace of salvific compunction, from which the most pleasant, sweet, and gentle comforter brings solace.
