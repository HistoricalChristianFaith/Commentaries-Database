Nobody will take the disciples’ joy from them because, although they suffered persecution and torture on behalf of Christ’s name, yet they willingly bore all adversities because they were enkindled by hope in his resurrection and by their vision of him. Moreover, they thought it perfect joy when they encountered different kinds of temptations.
