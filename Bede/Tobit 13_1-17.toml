Then the elder Tobias, opening his mouth, blessed God. Confessing His severity and mercy, and at the same time admonishing His faithful to always proclaim His benefits, to fear His scourges; imbued with the spirit of prophecy, he chants many praises concerning our heavenly mother, Jerusalem. And the people of the Jews, converted at the end of the world to faith, will have many teachers and prophetic men who will inflame the minds of their neighbors with heavenly desires, while they frequently resound with the perpetual joys of the heavenly fatherland.
