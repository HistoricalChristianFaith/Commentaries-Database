And Jesus said to them, a prophet is not without honor, except in his own country, and among his own relatives, and in his own house. It is testified in the Scriptures that the Lord Jesus Christ is called a prophet, and Moses, predicting His future incarnation to the children of Israel, said: The Lord your God will raise up for you a prophet from among your brothers, like unto me, you shall listen to him. Not only He who is the head and Lord of the prophets, but also Elijah and Jeremiah, and the other prophets, were held in less honor in their own country than in foreign cities, because it is almost natural for citizens always to envy their fellow citizens. They do not consider the man's present works, but remember his frail infancy, as if they themselves had not also come to mature age through the same stages of life.
