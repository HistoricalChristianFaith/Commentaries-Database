But Samuel took one suckling lamb, etc. The Lord took the innocent one, whom He had clothed in human form for the salvation of the world, and offered Him as a whole burnt offering on the altar of the cross to the Father. And it is rightly said that He offered a whole burnt offering, that is, wholly consumed, as one conceived without iniquity, born, and living in the flesh without sin, making all that He did through humanity worthy of the fire of the Holy Spirit of God. And the Lord prayed to the Father for His faithful, that their faith might not fail (Luke XXII). He prayed also for those who persecuted Him, that they might be forgiven the great sin of perfidy which they committed unknowingly (Luke XXIII). And the Father heard Him, strengthening the faith of those who almost lost it, and calling those who completely lacked faith to belief.
