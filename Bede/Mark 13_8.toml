Because the Lord, when some were praising the buildings of the temple, had plainly answered that all these wereto be destroyed, the disciples privately enquired about the time and the signs of the destruction which was foretold. Wherefore it is said: “And as He sat upon the mount of Olives, over against the temple, Peter and James and John and Andrew asked Him privately, Tell us when shall these things be? and what shall be the sign when all these things shall be fulfilled? "The Lord sits upon the mount of Olives, over against the temple, when He discourses upon the ruin and destruction of the temple, so that even His bodily position may be in accordance with the words which He speaks, pointing out mystically that, abiding in peace with the saints, He hates the madness of the proud. For the mount of Olives marks the fruitful sublimity of the Holy Church.
For many came forward, when destruction was hanging over Jerusalem, saying that they were Christs, and that the time of freedom was now approaching. Many teachers of heresy also arose in the Church even in the time of the Apostles; and many Antichrists came in the name of Christ, the first of whom was Simon Magus, to whom the Samaritans, aswe read in the Acts of the Apostles, listened, saying, “This man is the great power of God.” Wherefore also it is added here, “And shall deceive many. "Wherefore it goes on: “And when ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars, be ye not troubled. "And when these come, the Apostles are warned not to be afraid, or to leave Jerusalem and Judaea, because the end wasnot to come at once, nay was to be put off for forty years. And this is what is added: “for such things must needs be; but the end shall not be yet,” that is, the desolation of the province, and the last destruction of the city and temple. It goes on: “For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.”.
Now it is on record that this literally took place at the time of the Jewish rebellion. But “kingdom against kingdom,” the pestilence of those whose word spreads as a canker, dearth of the word of God, the commotion of the whole earth, and the separation from the true faith, may all rather be understood of heretics who, by fighting one against the other, bring about the triumph of the Church.
