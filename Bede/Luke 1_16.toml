And he will turn many of the children of Israel to the Lord their God, and he will go before him in the spirit and power of Elijah. When John, who bore witness to Christ, was baptizing people in his faith, he is said to have turned the children of Israel to the Lord their God; it is indeed clear that Christ is the Lord God of Israel. If, however, Christ is, or rather, since Christ is the Lord God of Israel, let the Arians cease from denying that Christ is the Lord God. Let the Photinians blush for giving Christ a beginning from the virgin. Let the Manicheans stop believing that there is one God of the people of Israel and another of the Christians. And because John is said to go before him, let them see that the eternal God before the ages was born as a man in time, and therefore is named by his precursor now as a man coming after him, now as the Son of God. He is well said to go before in the spirit and power of Elijah, for just as that one was the herald of the coming judge, so this one became the herald of the Redeemer. Whence both, following a very similar way of life, pursued the desert, lived frugally, were dressed simply, and were regarded with contempt. Both tolerate the madness of king and queen. That one divided the Jordan when he was about to seek heaven, this one converted men to the saving bath by which heaven may be sought. This one is associated with the Lord on earth, that one is manifested with him in glory.
