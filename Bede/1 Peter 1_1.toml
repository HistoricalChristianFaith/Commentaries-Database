Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, etc. "Strangers in Latin, in Greek called proselytes." By this name, the Jews called those who, born from the nations, preferred to believe in God and, having received circumcision, to lead a life according to the Jewish custom, according to God's law. Among whose number were some of those who, on the holy day of Pentecost, when the apostles received the Holy Spirit in the vision of fire, believed in Christ at their preaching, as Scripture says that Jews and proselytes were present. Therefore, he calls them chosen strangers, who from gentility came to the knowledge and acceptance of the divine law, and having received the legal sacraments, deserved to reach the acceptance of the grace of faith. Hence, the holy presbyter Jerome, speaking of them, says: "Because Peter, after the episcopate of the Antiochian Church and the preaching of the dispersion of those who believed from circumcision in Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia, in the second year of Claudius, goes to Rome to oppose Simon Magus." But also if we can truly say with the prophet to God: "For we are aliens and pilgrims before You, as were all our fathers" (Psalm 38), we should also believe the letters written by the blessed Peter and read them as sent to us. Finally, in these same letters, as those having another homeland, he admonishes us, saying: "Beloved, I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims to abstain from fleshly lusts" (1 Peter II). As for what is added, concerning the dispersion, this indicates that they were dispersed from Jerusalem in the persecution that took place under Stephen, or surely afflicted by other various persecutions for the faith either by Jews or by the Gentiles, often driven from their own homes, as we read in the Acts of the Apostles. And even Paul to the Galatians: "Have you suffered so many things in vain, if it be yet in vain?"

The dispersion of Pontus, Galatia, etc. All these provinces are of the Greeks in Asia. But there is also another Bithynia in Europe, from which it is said those in Asia are descended. However, the Bithynia in Asia is also called the greater Phrygia, which is separated from Galatia by the river Hiera.
