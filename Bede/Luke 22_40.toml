And when he had come to the place, he said to them: Pray that you do not enter into temptation. It is impossible for the human soul not to be tempted. Hence also, in the Lord's Prayer we say; Lead us not into temptation (Matthew VI): not utterly rejecting temptation, but pleading for strength to endure in temptations. Therefore, even now, he does not say Pray, that you may not be tempted, but that you may not enter into temptation, that is, that the temptation may not ultimately overcome you, holding you within its snares; for example, a martyr who sheds his blood for the confession of the Lord is indeed tempted, but is not ensnared by the nets of temptation; whereas he who denies falls into the traps of temptation.
