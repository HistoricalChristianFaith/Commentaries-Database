And they were all scattered throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria. This is what the Lord Himself commanded: When they persecute you in one city, flee to another (Matt. X). For it was by His will that the occasion of tribulation became the seed-bed of the Gospel.

Now on that day, a great persecution arose in the Church that was in Jerusalem, and all were scattered throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria, except the apostles. If the Church was scattered, the apostles remained in Jerusalem, as Luke tells us, it is evident that he lied who, writing under the name of Melito, bishop of Asia, explains that in the second year after the Lord's ascension, all the apostles were divided to preach in their respective provinces: who all, as the death of the blessed Mother of God approached, were lifted in the clouds and snatched to Jerusalem from the places where they were preaching the word of God, and placed before the door of her house, among whom was also Paul, who, having recently converted from being a persecutor to the faith of Christ, was taken up with Barnabas into the ministry of the Gentiles. This scripture also specifically refers to the Apostle John, that at that time he preached in Ephesus: all of which openly contradicts the words of blessed Luke, who narrates that the apostles, with the other faithful driven out from Jerusalem, remained there and preached everywhere until the Church had peace through all Judea, Samaria, and Galilee. That this could not be accomplished in one year is evident to all. He also clearly indicates that Paul was not ordained with Barnabas into the ministry of the Gentiles in the second year after the Lordâ€™s ascension, but a long time later. Moreover, let us not believe that the blessed Apostle John, to whom the Lord on the cross committed his virgin mother to a virgin, departed after one year and left her alone, and that so much time passed that she feared her body would be burned by enemies after death; and that he, after being taken up in clouds, returned to himself as if negligent or forgetful, and that she anxiously asked him, saying: "I ask you, son John, to remember the word of your master, my Lord Jesus Christ, who commended me to you. Behold, I am called to the way of all the earth. But I have heard the counsel of the Jews saying: Let us wait for the day when she who bore Jesus of Nazareth dies, and let us burn her body; therefore, my son, take care of my funeral." I have taken care to recall these things because I know some who rashly give assent to the aforesaid book against the authority of blessed Luke.
