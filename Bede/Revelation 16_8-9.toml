The persecutors of the church, who like a burning sun attempt to dry up the seed of the word of God, will be burned in the future fire by the flames of Gehenna. Or, if one interprets the sun to be the splendor of the wise, it is not given to the angel to pour out upon the sun, but it is given to the sun itself to punish people with heat and fire. For while wise people, conquered by torments, are affected by the error of having done evil, the weak, persuaded by their example, are inflamed by temporal desires. However, the heat may also be understood to be that by which the person of the devil is incurably tormented by the steadfastness of the saints and is incited to blasphemy. The prophet has spoken concerning this [fire], “Zeal overcomes a people without understanding, and now fire consumes the adversaries.” It says “and now” because the fire of the last judgment is reserved. “And people were scorched by the fierce heat.” In the present time, so far as it is permitted, the devil glorifies his own followers, although the Holy Spirit has defined such glorification and joy to be nothing but plagues and sorrows. For we also read above that the army of the devil has killed people with fire, smoke and sulphur. Not that he killed them openly, but rather that with these plagues he binds to himself those who were in agreement with him.
