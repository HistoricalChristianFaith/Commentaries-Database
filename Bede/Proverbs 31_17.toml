"She girded her loins with strength," etc. Therefore the Church girded her loins with strength when, intent on the desires of the heavenly, she scorned to succumb to carnal allurements; she strengthened her arm when she prepared herself to perform works of virtue. And it is well said first to gird the loins with strength and then to strengthen the arm, because the action of a good work can in no way be acceptable to the Lord if one does not first restrain oneself from the indulgence of lust, in both body and mind. Hence the prophet says, "Cease to do evil, learn to do good" (Isaiah I). And the Lord Himself says, "Let your loins be girded and your lamps burning" (Luke XII). By this, having girded loins signifies to not succumb to lust; by burning lamps signifies to shine with good works.
