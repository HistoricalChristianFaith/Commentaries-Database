It was fitting that the herald of his resurrection is reported to have been sitting, so that by sitting he might prefigure him who, having triumphed over the author of death, would ascend to his seat in the everlasting kingdom. Concerning this he said a little later, as he appeared to his disciples, “All power in heaven and on earth has been given to me”; and the evangelist Mark says, “The Lord, after he had spoken to them, was taken up into heaven and sat down at God’s right hand.” [The angel] was sitting upon the stone with which the tomb was closed, but which had been rolled away, to teach that [Christ] had cast down and triumphed over the closed places of the lower world by his power, so that he might lift up to the light and the rest of paradise all of his own whom he found there, according to the prophet’s [statement], “You also because of the blood of your covenant, have led your prisoners back from the pit, in which there is no water.”
