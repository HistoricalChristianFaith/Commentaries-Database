And being asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God would come, he answered them and said: "The kingdom of God does not come with observation." They ask about the time of the kingdom of God, because as below Luke revealed, they thought that the kingdom of God would immediately be manifested when the Lord came to Jerusalem. Thus even the apostles, led by this opinion, asking him after his resurrection said: "Lord, will you at this time restore the kingdom to Israel?" (Acts I); and elsewhere Cleophas said: "But we had hoped that he was the one to redeem Israel" (Luke XXIV). However, the kingdom of God does not come with observation.
