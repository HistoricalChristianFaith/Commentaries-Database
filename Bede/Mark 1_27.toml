And they were all amazed, such that they questioned among themselves, etc. Seeing the virtue of the miracle, they marvel at the newness of the Lord's teaching, and are stirred to inquire about the things they had heard through the things they had seen. For certainly the signs that either the Lord himself did in the assumed man, or that he gave to the disciples to do, were done so that through these, faith in the Gospel of the kingdom of God, which was being preached, might be more certain, while those who promised future heavenly joys to the earthborn demonstrated heavenly and divine works on earth. Truly, the disciples conducted everything as pure men with the Lord granting. But the Lord himself singularly operated in the virtue of power and worked healings and miracles, and spoke in the world what He heard from the Father. For even before (as the Gospel testifies) he was teaching them as one having authority, and not as the scribes (Matt. VII). And now, with the crowd attesting, he commands the unclean spirits with authority, and they obey him (Mark I).
