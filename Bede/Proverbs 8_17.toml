I love those who love me, etc. Such is it also in the Gospel: "But he who loves me will be loved by my Father, and I will love him, and manifest myself to him" (John 14). Surely, they who always in the renewed pursuit of the mind strive to reach the vision of Christ are watchful in the morning for wisdom. "Riches and glory are with me," etc. He speaks of wealthy riches, high riches, so as to signify heavenly gifts. For in Greek, "proud" is called "hyperiphanos," that is, "super-appearing." And therefore wisdom rightly says that riches hyperiphanous are with her, because whatever gifts are given from heaven to the faithful are proven to be more excellent than all the riches of the world. This is also more clearly emphasized by adding "justice:" for unjust men often have earthly riches and glory; but we in the resurrection, as Peter says, expect new heavens and a new earth, and his promises, in which justice dwells (2 Peter 3).
