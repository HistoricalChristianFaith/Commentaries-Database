And it will be life to your soul. Your soul has life with God if you keep His decrees, however much the flesh may be pressed by the discipline of correction or even death.

And grace to your throat. How sweet are your words to my throat, says the psalm (Psalm 118)! The senses of the soul, therefore, have their throat, by which they judge the words they hear, by which they scrutinize the deeds of each person they see, and by which they receive these by embracing them, and reject those by despising them. When we keep the law and counsel of the Lord with these throats, grace is multiplied, because the more diligently one obeys the divine commands, the more sweetly he conceives His love. The Psalmist desired that this grace be in our throats when he said: Taste and see that the Lord is sweet (Psalm 34).
