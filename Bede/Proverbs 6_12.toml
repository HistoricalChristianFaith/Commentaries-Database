An apostate man, a useless man walks with a perverse mouth, etc. He spoke of heresies and other kinds of vices; he had instructed a teacher, aroused the sluggard, but now he reproves the schismatic. Where it should be noted that he who wished to call the sower of quarrels, first named him an apostate, because unless he first fell inwardly in the manner of the proud angel by turning his mind from the sight of the Creator, he would not come outwardly to sow quarrels. He is rightly said to nod with his eyes, scrape with his foot, speak with his finger. For there is an inward custody that orderly preserves the outer members. Therefore, he who has lost the state of his mind flows out into the inconsistency of movement and indicates by external mobility that nothing roots within.
