Enoch, in that he was engendered seventh in the line of descent from Adam, prefigured that the Lord would be conceived and born not in the usual way of mortal nature but by the power of the Holy Spirit. He prefigured that the full grace of the Holy Spirit, which is described by the prophet as sevenfold, would come to rest upon Christ in a special way when he was about to be born. And he would baptize in the Holy Spirit and give the gifts of the Spirit to those who believe in him.
