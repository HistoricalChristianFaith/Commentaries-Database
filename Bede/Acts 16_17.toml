These men are servants of the Most High God. This is not a confession from the will, followed by a reward for confessing, but compelled by the fear of the Holy Spirit, the lying spirit speaks truth, not daring to hide its darkness any longer in the present light. But God says to the sinner: Why do you recount my statutes? Let us not be corrupted by the bitter honey of deceit, if he who serves falsehood sings truth, as Arator says.
