That confession is not voluntary that is followed by a reward for confessing, but under the compulsion of fear of the Holy Spirit, the deceitful spirit spoke the truth, not daring any longer to hide its darkness in the presence of the light. “But to the sinner God says, ‘Why do you recite my judgments?’ ” As Arator says, “If she who was a servant of falsehood prophesies what is true, let us not be corrupted by the bitter honey of deceit.”
