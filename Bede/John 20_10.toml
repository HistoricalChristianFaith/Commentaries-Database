Mystically, Mary, which name signifies, mistress, enlightened, enlightener, star of the sea, stands for the Church, which is also Magdalene, i.e. Towered, (Magdalene being Greek for tower) as we read in the Psalms, you have been a strong tower for me. In that she announced Christâ€™s resurrection to the disciples, all, especially those to whom the office of preaching is committed are admonished to be zealous in setting forth toothers whatever is revealed from above.
