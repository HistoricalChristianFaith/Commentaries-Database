It should be noted with respect to the historical sense that among the ancients the day of Pentecost (that is the fiftieth day, on which the law was given) was computed from [the time of] the killing of the [paschal] lamb. In our case, however, it is not from the Lord’s passion but from his resurrection, as the blessed Augustine explains it, that we are to calculate the fiftieth day, on which was sent the Holy Spirit, who, recalling the example of the old sign, most clearly consecrated the Lord’s day to himself by his coming. Indeed, by this specific time [of his coming] he also showed that the Passover was to be celebrated on the Lord’s day. For here too God appeared in a vision of fire, as he had also in the earlier case, as Exodus says, “For the whole of Mount Sinai was smoking because the Lord had descended upon it in fire.”
