If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, etc. John speaks thus about schismatics or heretics to be detested, what he taught in words, he also practiced in deeds. For his most holy listener and strongest martyr Polycarp, the bishop of the Smyrnaeans, recounts that at a certain time, while he had entered the baths at Ephesus for the sake of washing, and had seen Cerinthus there, he immediately jumped out and left without washing, saying: “Let us flee from here, lest even the baths collapse in which Cerinthus, the enemy of truth, is bathing.” The same Polycarp also, when he once met Marcion, who said to him: “Recognize us,” he replied: “I recognize, I recognize the firstborn of Satan.” Such caution did the apostles and their disciples use in religion at that time, that they would not permit even a word’s communion with any of those who had deviated from the truth; as Paul also says: A man that is heretical, after a first and second admonition, avoid, knowing that such a one is perverted and sins, being self-condemned (Tit. III).
