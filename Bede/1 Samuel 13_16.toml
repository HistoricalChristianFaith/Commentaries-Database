Both Saul and Jonathan his son, and the people, etc. Machmas is humility, as often said, Gabaa of Benjamin sounds like the hill of the son of the right hand. It must be questioned how, with the gates of humility besieged by unclean spirits, on the perfect hill of virtues either masters or listeners can pitch their spiritual camps; and it must be seen what is written below, because Saul with his six hundred was dwelling at the far end under a pomegranate tree. Indeed, under the pomegranate tree, the people who can say: But far be it from me to boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ (Gal. VI). For the fruit of the cross reddened with the Lord's blood, like a pomegranate, encompasses many grains of believers as if with one rind of charity and hope. But at the far end of Gabaa, it has the same tree of life under which he rests; he who is not yet perfectly consummated laments with the Apostle, saying: I delight in the law of God according to the inner man; but I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members, and so forth (Rom. VII).
