Thus therefore, any one of you who does not renounce all that he possesses cannot be my disciple. The Lord very clearly teaches with this conclusion what it means to build a tower or to make peace with a stronger king: namely, to be his disciple; and to prepare the costs to complete the tower, and to send a delegation to obtain peace, is nothing else but to renounce all that we possess. Among such possessions, even the love of our neighbors, as mentioned earlier, and our own soul, which some think is referred to for this temporal life, must be understood in such a way that we possess it temporarily so that it does not hinder us from the eternal, if anyone should threaten to take it away. There is certainly a difference between renouncing all things and leaving all things; it is for the few and the perfect to leave all things, to set aside the cares of the world, and to aspire solely to eternal desires. But it is for all the faithful to renounce all that they possess, that is, to hold onto worldly things in such a way that they are not held by them in the world; to have temporal things in use, eternal things in desire; to manage earthly things in such a way that yet with the whole mind they strive for heavenly things.
