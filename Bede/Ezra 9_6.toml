” And if anything else is needed, whether calves and Iambs and young goats as a burnt offering to the God of heaven, or wheat, salt, wine and oil according to the custom of the priests who are in Jerusalem, let it be given to them daily, so that there be no complaint in anything. And let them make offerings to the God of heaven and pray for the life of the king and his children. For who could not know that calves, lambs and young goats, which are clean animals, and wheat, salt, wine and oil and the things which were offered to God by the Law, are often customarily understood in the Holy Scriptures to indicate good people, perfect works, or spiritual gifts? All these things are nowadays by the king's command offered as a burnt offering to the God of heaven when, supported by the powers of this world, the riches of the Holy Church increase and the subject people of these rulers are gathered from everywhere into one and the same faith of truth to be consecrated to Christ; and whatever naturally good thing anyone has heard through divine inspiration, whatever healthful thing he has learned from men of the churches, all this he devotes to the service of divine worship. Concerning these offerings it is fittingly said that they should be given according to the custom of the priests who are in Jerusalem, doubtless because the vows of those who offer them become acceptable to the Lord only if they are offered according to the custom of catholic peace. For whatever good things are thoroughly mingled with either pagan belief or heretical speech should in no way be deemed good. The priests make offerings on behalf of the life of the king and his children, according to that saying of the Apostle:  urge, then, first of all, that requests, prayers, intercessions and thanksgivings be made for everyone -for kings and all those who are in high station, that we may live a peaceful and quiet life?
