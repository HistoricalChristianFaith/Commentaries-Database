And Saul feared David, etc. The people of the Jews feared the Church of Christ, because they saw the grace of divine power in it while they themselves were forsaken. For it is written: Many signs and wonders were done among the people by the apostles in Jerusalem, and great fear was upon all. For all who believed were together and had all things in common (Acts 2); which also, this society of mutual love, is proof of the present heavenly grace. And elsewhere: And by the hands of the apostles many signs and wonders were done among the people, and they were all with one accord in Solomon's porch; but of the rest no one dared join them, but the people magnified them (Acts 5).
