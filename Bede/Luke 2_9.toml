And they feared with a great fear. And the angel said to them: Do not be afraid. Behold, I bring you good news of great joy that will be for all the people. Not for all the people of the Jews, of whom many were rebellious, but for all the faithful people gathered into one Church of Christ from all tribes, nations, and tongues, eternal and great joy is proclaimed.
