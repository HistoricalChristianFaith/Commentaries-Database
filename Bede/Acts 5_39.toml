But if it is from God, you will not be able to destroy them. And in the Greek, more is added here: Neither you, nor your rulers.

Lest you be found to be fighting against God. For what we have as fighting against God, or, as some have interpreted, opposing God, in Greek one word is used, θεομάχοι. I thought this worth mentioning, so that when we find θεομάχος or θεομαχίαν in histories, we can more surely know the meaning of the term.
