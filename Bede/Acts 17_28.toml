Since this verse is difficult to understand, it should be explained in the words of the blessed Augustine, who says, “The apostle shows that God is ceaselessly at work in the things which he has created. It is not with respect to his substance that we are in him. For instance, it has been said that he has life in himself, but since we are certainly different from him, we are not ‘in him’ in any other way except that he brings it [our existence] about; and this is his work, whereby he contains all things. And it has been said that his wisdom reaches ‘mightily from one end of the earth to the other and orders all things well.’ It is through this ‘ordering’ that ‘in him we live and move and are.’ Hence we infer that if he withdrew this work of his from things, we would neither live nor move nor be.”

“We are” very rightly “called the offspring of God, not in the sense that we were brought forth out of his nature but in the sense that through his Spirit we are both created by his will and re-created by his adoption.”
