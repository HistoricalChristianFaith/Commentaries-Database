They were troubled and terrified, thinking they were seeing a spirit. This is what the Manichean heretics suspect and believe about Christ, that He was not true flesh, but a spirit. This first thought arose in the hearts of the apostles. And indeed those Manicheans never believed that Jesus was a man. However, the disciples knew the man with whom they had conversed for such a long time. But after He died, could they believe that what they knew could be raised again if it could die? Therefore, He appeared to their eyes as the one they knew. And not believing that true flesh could rise from the grave on the third day, they thought they were seeing a spirit. This error of the apostles is the sect of the Manicheans. However, when these things are objected to them, they usually respond in this way: What harm do we believe? We believe Christ as God, we believe He was a spirit, we do not believe He was flesh. Spirit is better than flesh. We believe what is better; we do not wish to believe what is worse. If there is nothing wrong with this statement, let Jesus leave His disciples in this error. What harm did the disciples believe too? They believed Christ to be a spirit. For they did not think He was nothing, but a spirit. If you think you are at risk from a small sickness, listen to the doctor's sentence.
