He who lay at his gate full of sores, desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man's table; moreover even the dogs came and licked his sores. The beggar Lazarus, full of sores, lies at the gate of the rich man. Concerning this matter the Lord accomplished two judgments at once. For the rich man might perhaps have had some excuse if the poor and sore-covered Lazarus had not lain at his gate, if he had been removed, if his poverty had not been obtrusive to his eyes. Again, if the rich man had been far away from the eyes of the sore-covered poor man, the temptation would have been less for the poor man in spirit. But while he placed the needy and sore-covered man at the gate of the rich man who abounded in delights, in the same situation he brought about the punishment of the indifferent rich man from the sight of the poor man, and again proved the poor man tested daily from the sight of the rich man. For certainly, poverty alone might have sufficed for his punishment, even if he had been healthy. Again, sickness might have sufficed, even if succor had been present. But to test the poor man further, both poverty and sickness crippled him, and moreover, he saw the rich man proceeding, supported by a train of attendants, while he was visited by no one in his infirmity and need. For that no one was there to visit him, the dogs testify, who freely licked his wounds. Therefore from one situation, Almighty God exhibited two judgments, while He allowed Lazarus, the poor man, to lie at the gate of the rich man, so that the impious rich man might increase his punishment and the tested poor man might grow toward his reward.
