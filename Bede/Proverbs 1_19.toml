If the paths of the greedy seize the souls of those who possess them. He calls the paths of the greedy his subtle thoughts, whereby he diligently inquires how to increase his wealth. Such paths seize the souls of those who possess them, that is, of those who excessively cling to the possessions of wealth. Therefore, he says, not only do those who, for the love of money, watch for the robberies and murders of the innocent, destroy themselves by acting thus, but also, in the same order, even though lesser in guilt, all greedy thoughts that prefer gold to God, lead to destruction. Alternatively: Thus, the paths of every greedy person seize the souls of possessors. With such an end, as mentioned earlier, every greedy person destroys or strips those who abound in possessions, so that by doing this, he rather perishes himself. For why should he kill the poor, whom he sees possessing nothing? He does not find anyone to rob. Hitherto, the persecutions which the Jews brought upon Christ are described. From here, they recount what He Himself speaks to His own persecutors through the apostles after His passion.
