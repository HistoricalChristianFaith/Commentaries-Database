Because I will give you the holy and faithful promises of David, that is, whatever I promised David, I will surely and faithfully fulfill to you, namely, that Christ would be born from his lineage. For Isaiah, tasting the mysteries of the New Testament in this way, says: “And I will make with you an everlasting covenant, the holy and sure blessings of David” (Isaiah 55:3). This is read in the Hebrew truth: “And I will make with you an eternal covenant, the faithful mercies of David.”
