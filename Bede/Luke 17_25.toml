But first, it is necessary for him to suffer many things and be rejected by this generation. The Lord, speaking much about the glory of His advent, also took care to insert a few words about the terror of His passion so that when they would see Him dying, whom they had heard would be glorified, the pain of the passion would be mitigated by the hope of the promised glory, and at the same time, they themselves might prepare, if they love the glory of the kingdom, not to dread the danger of death. However, the generation He refers to is not only the Jews but all the reprobate, by whom even now the Son of Man in His body, that is, in the Church, suffers many things and is rejected. For although the head of this body, which indeed is ourselves, already rises freely above all, nevertheless He still feels the wounds of the reprobate through His body, which He holds downward.
