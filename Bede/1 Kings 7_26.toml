For by the brim of a cup is expressed the taste of the Lord’s passion, and by the leaf of a crisped lily the glory of his resurrection is openly revealed. For that the chalice of his passion is indicated in the cup is attested by the Lord, who on approaching his passion prayed to his Father, saying, “Father, if you are willing, remove this chalice from me”; but the lily, which, in addition to the grace of a most pleasant fragrance, displayed a white color on the outside and a golden color on the inside, appositely suggests the glory of the resurrection of him who showed the disciples the immortality of his body externally and at the same time taught that there was within him a soul shining with divine light. One can also fittingly take the crisped lily as the “mediator of God and humankind” himself crowned with glory and honor on account of the suffering of his death, who prior to his passion was still, as it were, a closed lily and shone forth as an illustrious human being by reason of his signs and wonders, but after his resurrection and ascension showed himself to the citizens of the heavenly homeland a crisped lily because he showed forth in his assumed humanity the power of the divine glory that he had with the Father before the world was.
