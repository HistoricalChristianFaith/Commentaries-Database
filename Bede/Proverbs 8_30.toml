"And I delighted every day," etc. Saying "playing," he means rejoicing. Therefore, he was playing before the Father every day, because, as the prophet says, "From the beginning, from the days of eternity" (Mic. 5), he was rejoicing to be one with the Father. He was at all times playing in the world, for even when the times of the world and creation began to exist, he remained the Son, which he was in the Father. This is said so that no one would claim that he began with creatures and times. And his delights are to be with the sons of men, because he desires to rest in our soul, and to lead us by the grace of good merits to the vision of himself.
