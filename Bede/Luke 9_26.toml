For whoever is ashamed of me and my words, of him the Son of Man will be ashamed when he comes in his glory and the glory of the Father and of the holy angels. But behold, now men say among themselves: We are now not ashamed of the Lord and his words, because we openly confess him with our voice. To whom I respond that in this Christian assembly there are some who confess Christ because they see that all are Christians. Therefore, the voice of profession is not sufficient for the testing of faith, as the profession of generality defends it from shame. Yet there is a place where each one may question himself, so that he may truly test himself in the confession of Christ. Certainly, in the time of persecution, the faithful could be ashamed of being stripped of their possessions, cast down from dignities, afflicted with scourges: but in the time of peace, since our persecutions are absent, there is another where we may be shown to ourselves. We often fear being despised by our neighbors, we disdain to tolerate verbal injuries: if perhaps a quarrel occurs with a neighbor, we are ashamed to make amends first. For the carnal heart, while seeking the glory of this life, rejects humility.
