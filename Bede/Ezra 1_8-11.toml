Therefore the basins, which are large vessels, signify the clear hearts of the simple, who do not know how to hide in themselves any covert thought but always declare with a pure tongue the things they have in their mind … The knives, which they used to cut and divide in a right measure the members of the victims, so that, after everything had been prepared according to the ritual, a part might be consumed on the altar by the holy fire and a part might be given to the use of those who had made the offering, indicate those in the church, who are renowned for the grace of discretion, who know perfectly how to distinguish the sacrifice of salvation, which is Christ.… The bowls, which are vessels for drinking, figuratively express those who are usually inebriated by a greater ardor of interior charity.
