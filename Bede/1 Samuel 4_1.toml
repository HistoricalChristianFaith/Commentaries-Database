For Israel went out to meet the Philistines, etc. The people went out, meaning, after gaining knowledge of the law, to openly perform good works which it had learned; and to the extent it could, to root out the error of Gentile customs, by which the hearts of the wicked, intoxicated, were heading toward eternal death. Whence rightly the Philistines are said to fall by drinking. In this struggle, however, Israel cared not so much to call back foreign nations from the pollution of sins as to guard itself, lest it perish by their example.

And they encamped beside the stone of Help. And placed all its confidence for spiritual warfare in His aid; of whom it was said: When my heart was troubled, You lifted me up on a rock (Psalm. LX). And elsewhere: The Lord is my rock and my strength (II Kings XXI).

Moreover, the Philistines came to Aphek, etc. As Israel was progressing in the true God, a new fury of envying and corrupting immediately seized the worshipers of many false gods; and this is what it means for the Philistines to draw up their battle lines in Aphek, that is, in new fury against Israel, teaching all the neighboring nations instructed by unclean spirits to present examples of perverse religion or action to scandalize the people of God, which they never ceased to do from the time the law was received until the grace of Christ made both one.
