For the mystery of the holy Trinity was to be preached throughout the four regions of the world by the twelve apostles. It is for this reason that four linen cords were let down from heaven three times. Or, as it is interpreted by the blessed Ambrose, “The third repetition of the figure expressed the operation of the Trinity. And so in the mysteries a threefold question is put and a threefold confirmation is proclaimed. Nor can anyone be purified except by a threefold confession. Hence in the gospel Peter himself was asked three times whether he loved the Lord, so that his threefold response might loose the bonds with which he had bound himself by denying the Lord.” These things shown to Peter were very appropriate to the situation, since the Gentile Cornelius appealed to him to show him that he should not hesitate to entrust the Christian faith to the uncircumcised. For he was from among those living things that were manifested in the evangelical vessel. Hence it was confirmed by the Holy Spirit that he should act in the same way.

After the threefold lowering the vessel was taken up to heaven, since after the affairs of this world, through which the church travels as a pilgrim who has been cleansed by faith and baptism, there then follows a happy and everlasting heavenly dwelling.
