And the prophets Haggai and Zechariah prophesied, etc. These things are more fully written in the books of these prophets; with words by which they either reproved the laziness of those who had been more negligent towards the work of the temple, or stirred them to work with the promise of God's aid; by which devotion at their exhortation, Zerubbabel, Joshua, and all the people set themselves to the work of building the house of the Lord. And indeed the prophet Haggai begins thus: In the second year of King Darius, on the first day of the sixth month, the word of the Lord came by the hand of Haggai the prophet saying: Speak to Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, and to Joshua, the son of Jozadak, the high priest, saying: Thus says the Lord of hosts: This people says, The time has not yet come to build the house of the Lord. And the word of the Lord came by the hand of Haggai the prophet saying: Is it a time for you yourselves to dwell in paneled houses, while this house lies in ruins? (Haggai I). And shortly after: And the Lord stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and the spirit of Joshua, the son of Jozadak, the high priest, and the spirit of all the remnant of the people; and they came and worked on the house of the Lord of hosts, their God, on the twenty-fourth day of the month, in the sixth month, in the second year of King Darius (Ibid.). And in the following, which we placed above: The glory of this latter house will be greater than that of the former, says the Lord of hosts (Haggai II). Likewise, Zechariah begins thus: In the eighth month, in the second year of Darius, the word of the Lord came to Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo, the prophet (Zech. I). From which title it is clearer how Ezra names him the son of Iddo, evidently because he was the grandson of him. But Iddo himself is to be understood as a noble prophet, of whom Zechariah, as a distinguished prophet, is rightly called his son. Among these, it must be noted the great spirit of these prophets, who ordered the temple to be built against the decree of such a great king and the Samaritans, and all the surrounding peoples hindering the construction of the temple. Zerubbabel and Joshua, and the people who were with them, are likewise proven to have been of no less faith, as they listened to the prophets commanding rather than the king forbidding. But since we have often spoken in this volume about Zerubbabel and Joshua, or Jesus (for it is the same name), how they designated the Lord Savior, the king and high priest both by lineage and act, it seems appropriate to explain their names as they signify Him. Zerubbabel is therefore called a garden in Babylon, or master of Babylon; Shealtiel, my request is God; Jesus or Joshua, savior; Jozadak, the Lord is just. And indeed openly, as the son of Nun clearly signifies the Lord Christ Jesus. Hence each led the people into the promised land, that one from a long stay in the wilderness, this one from the longer captivity, in a figure of the true Jesus, who, delivering His chosen from all evils, leads them to the joys of the promised heavenly kingdom; who is the son of Jozadak, that is, of the Lord's just one, about whom it is sung in the psalm: The Lord just shall crush the necks of sinners, be ashamed and be turned back, all who hate Zion (Psalm 128). Zerubbabel, called a garden in Babylon, refers historically to him because he was born there, being of the lineage of David, who was born in Bethlehem. According to allegory, it pertains to the Lord; who, that He might lead from the confusion of errors, deigned to arise and dwell for a time in Babylon, that is, in the confusion of this world. He is also called the master of Babylon, not that he teaches the things of Babylon, that is, of this world; but because he instructs those whom he found oppressed by the yoke of Babylon to the grace of freedom, and leads the instructed to the walls of the heavenly homeland. His father is Shealtiel, that is, my request is God, who himself says in the psalm: Request of me, and I will give you the nations as your inheritance (Psalm 2). But also, each faithful one invoking the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, when seeking none other than God himself from Him, can rightly be named Shealtiel, that is, my request is God, according to the dictum of the Psalmist: For what is there for me in heaven, and what have I desired on earth besides you (Psalm 73)? and the rest, until he says: But for me it is good to be near to God. Our petition is therefore God, when we seek only Him from Him, so that we may be deemed worthy to enjoy the eternal vision of Him.
