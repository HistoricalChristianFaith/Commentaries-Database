But he began to curse and to swear: "I do not know this man you are talking about." And immediately the rooster crowed again. Scripture is wont to designate the mystery of events by the state of times. Hence Peter, who denied in the middle of the night, repented at the crowing of the rooster. He who even after the resurrection of the Lord professed by daylight equally thrice to love Him whom he had thrice denied. For surely, what he erred in the darkness of oblivion, he corrected by the remembrance of the hoped-for light, and by the acquisition of the presence of the true light, fully raised all that had faltered. I think this rooster is to be understood as some teacher, who, awakening us supine and rebuking the sleepy, says: "Awake to righteousness, and do not sin."
