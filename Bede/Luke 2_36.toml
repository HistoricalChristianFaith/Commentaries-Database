And there was Anna, a prophetess, daughter of Phanuel, from the tribe of Asher; she had advanced in many days, etc. According to the history of her devout conversation and equally venerable age, and worthy in all aspects to bear witness to the incarnate Lord, Anna is taught to have been. According to the mystical understanding, because she signifies the Church, which in the present is as if widowed by the death of her spouse and Lord, the number of her years of widowhood also designates the time of the Church, when established in the body, she journeys as a pilgrim away from the Lord, and with the affection of great devotion, keeping the thresholds of the heavenly temple, awaits that daily coming of the Lord. Concerning this He says: We shall come and make our abode with him (John 14). For seven times twelve make eighty-four. And indeed seven refers to the course of this world, which revolves in seven days. Twelve, on the other hand, pertains to the perfection of apostolic doctrine. Therefore, whether it is the universal Church, or any faithful soul who cares to dedicate the entire span of their life to apostolic institutions, it is praised as if multiplying seven by twelve, and serving the Lord in the figurative eighty-four years. Also as the time of seven years, during which she stayed with her husband, most fittingly corresponds to the time of the Lord’s incarnation. For by the number seven (as I said), the perfection of time is usually indicated. But there, due to the privilege of the Lord’s majesty by which He taught in the flesh, the simple number of seven years is expressed. Here, on account of the apostolic summit of dignity, seven years are multiplied by twelve. However, it pleases the mysteries of the Church that Anna is interpreted as grace and that she is the daughter of Phanuel, which means face of God, singing with the Psalmist: The light of your face, O Lord, is signed upon us (Psalm 4). And she descends from the tribe of Asher, which means blessed, which among the twelve patriarchs is the eighth in the order of birth. About which number, because it is sacred to the New Testament, it has been repeatedly emphasized.
