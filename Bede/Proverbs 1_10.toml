"My son, if sinners entice you," etc. Sinners entice in two ways those whom they deceive, because they either allure them to commit crimes with blandishments, or they uplift deeds already done with favors, as if laudably performed. In both cases, wisdom exhorts its listeners not to acquiesce to such things.
