I am the most foolish of men, etc. For the sons of this world are wiser in their generation than the sons of light (Luke XVI). And the Apostle says, If anyone seems to be wise in this world, let him become foolish, that he may be wise (1 Cor. III). And he himself about himself and his fellows, in whom is God, We preach Christ crucified; to the Jews a stumbling block, and to the Gentiles foolishness (1 Cor. I).
