Then you will understand the fear of the Lord, etc. If you seek with a careful heart, you will come to the experience of the loving fear of the Lord, which is not only the beginning but the perfection of heavenly wisdom in this life alone. And thus perfect love does not cast it out (I John IV), but makes it endure forever. And you will find the knowledge of his divinity, which makes perpetually blessed.
