“And a carved work under its brim surrounded it, encircling the sea for ten cubits. There were two rows cast of chamfered sculptures.” Since it has been said above that a line of thirty cubits encircled the sea and it is now added that this carved work under the brim went around it for ten cubits, it is obvious from both accounts that the vessel was bent backwards and spread out like a bowl, because from a circumference of thirty cubits, which it measured at the brim, it narrowed to ten cubits. The chamfered sculpture is one that represents some historical events. Hence also the chamfered sculptures surrounding the sea rightly denote examples of former times that we must judiciously ponder to see by what works the saints have pleased God from the beginning and with what obstinacy the reprobate persisted in crimes and with what wickedness they perished because of their crimes; how in the beginning of the nascent world Cain was condemned for the malice of envy and Abel crowned for the merit of his uprightness; how Lamech was cursed for his adultery and murder38 and Enoch brought back to paradise for the grace of his piety; how after the flood Ham was detested by his father for his lack of filial piety and the peoples of Shem and Japheth were granted a perpetual blessing for their reverential obedience;40 how Abraham was made the heir of the divine promise in recognition of his faith while the numerous other nations were left in their ancestral unbelief; how when the Lord came in the flesh, Judea was rejected for the offense of unbelief and the Gentiles brought back to salvation by the grace of faith, and other things of the kind in both Testaments, which, when judiciously and devoutly contemplated, are of great profit to all earnest-minded people. And that perhaps is the reason why two orders of chamfered sculptures were made in the bronze sea, namely, that those who were immersed in the font of baptism may listen carefully to the stories of both Testaments; and the reason why they were ten cubits in circumference was that they might strive to imitate whomsoever they perceived in these stories to have been committed to carrying out the heavenly commands and totally rapt in the pursuit of heavenly rewards.
