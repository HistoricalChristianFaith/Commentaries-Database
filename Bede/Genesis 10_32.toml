These are the families of Noah according to their peoples and nations. From these were the nations divided on the earth after the flood. Let the diligent reader review in order the names of the men or peoples who are said to have been born from the three sons, and they will be found to number seventy-one: namely, thirteen from Japheth, thirty-one from Ham, twenty-six from Shem, from whom they are believed to have filled the world with as many languages and nations, or rather seventy-two, as clearer tradition holds, since there was one among them from whom afterward two nations and peoples were born; unless perhaps it is to be understood that there are two Asshurs, who created two peoples: one who, having gone out from the land of Shinar, built Nineveh, and the other a son of Shem; and thus the number of seventy-two nations is completed. Neither does it seem irrelevant that the Lord therefore sent seventy-two disciples to preach, because there were as many nations and languages to whom the word of preaching was to be committed, just as he first chose twelve apostles for the same number of tribes of Israel to be called to faith; so afterward he designated seventy-two teachers to indicate the salvation of all nations, which were encompassed by the same number.
