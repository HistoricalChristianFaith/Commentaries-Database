Having first briefly said, He hath raised up a horn of salvation to us, he goes on to explain his words, adding, of salvation from our enemies. As if he said, He hath raised up to us a horn, i. e. He hath raised up to us salvation from our enemies, and from the hand of all who hate us.

Salvation from our enemies, and from the hand of all who hate us. It must be joined from the previous verse, "he raised up for us," that is, he raised up for us salvation from our enemies. For when he had briefly stated earlier: "And he raised up a horn of salvation for us," continuing as if explaining more openly what he had said: "Salvation," he says, "from our enemies, and from the hand of all who hate us." But all who hate us signify either perverse men or unclean spirits. From whose hand, both in the present with hope we have been saved, and in the future, in reality, we will be saved.
