The trap will ensnare the sinful and unjust man, etc. Therefore, the trap of sinners does not harm the just man, even if it destroys him bodily. But the snares they prepare for their neighbors damn the reprobates themselves forever; while the just rejoice, praising the right judgment of the Creator either for their own deliverance or for the ruin of the wicked. Finally, the ancient edition clearly stated the conclusion of the previous verse as, The nets encircle his own feet. For from the ambiguous Greek, which is αὐτοῦ, it can be interpreted either way: for he who digs a pit for his neighbor will fall into it himself, as said elsewhere.
