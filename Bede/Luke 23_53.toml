And he wrapped it up in a shroud and placed him in a hewn tomb, in which no one had yet been laid. And from the simple burial of the Lord, the ambition of the rich is condemned, who cannot be without wealth even in their tombs. But we can also, according to spiritual understanding, sense this: that he wraps Jesus in a clean shroud who receives Him with a pure mind. Moreover, He is placed in a new tomb, so that after the resurrection, with other bodies remaining, another would not be pretended to have risen. It is well remembered that the tomb was hewn from rock, so that if it had been built from many stones, it might be said to have been stolen with its foundations dug up. Otherwise: The Lord is enclosed alone in the tomb, so that His unique burial, unlike ours, as well as the other mysteries of His dispensation, differing from the frailty of our nature, signifies His unique resurrection. For the old man appeared, but conceived and born from a virgin mother. And He was tempted in all things, but without sin for likeness. And He died, but in the manner that He wished. And He was buried, but as long as He wished. And He was raised, but when He wished. Therefore, this is what He said: I am singular until I pass (Psalm 140). And elsewhere about the unique burial: In peace I will lie down and sleep, for you alone, O Lord, have set me in hope (Psalm 4), meaning, with the resurrection of other mortals reserved for the end, you promised me by a unique gift to rise from the dead on the third day.
