“And some fell on rocky ground, and when it came up, it withered because it had no moisture.” Here he correctly identifies the rocky ground as a hard and unyielding heart, unpenetrated by the plow of true faith. Moisture at the root of the seed is akin to the oil for the lamps of the virgins in another parable, meaning love and the perseverance of virtue.
