And they returned and prepared spices and ointments. And indeed they rested on the Sabbath according to the commandment. The commandment was that the Sabbath silence be observed from evening to evening, and therefore the devout women, after the Lord was buried, were occupied in preparing ointments as long as it was permitted to work, that is, until sunset. Which they had done not only on the day of Preparation but also, after the Sabbath, that is, at sunset, as soon as the permission to work returned, they bought spices so that coming early in the morning they might anoint his body, as the Evangelist Mark testifies. For they did not wish to visit the tomb on the evening of the Sabbath, when night was already approaching. But after seeing the burial of the Lord and returning, they prepare spices and ointments, those who, having read, heard, recalled the passion of the Lord, immediately turn to perform works of virtue by which Christ is pleased, and indeed on the Sabbath, with the spices prepared, they rest, waiting to come to the Lord after the Sabbath with their offerings, when, with the preparation time of this present life completed, they joyfully expect in blessed rest, when appearing at the time of resurrection, fragrant with the spiritual actions of Christ as if with spices, they will meet him.
