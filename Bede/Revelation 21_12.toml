[The wall represents] the unconquerable strength of [the church’s] faith, hope and love. The Lord himself can be understood to be this great wall that protects the church on every side. Isaiah spoke of this: “A wall and a bulwark is set up in it.” [Isaiah is speaking] of the protection of the Lord and of the intercession of the saints who make a path to the city by addressing their teaching to the hearts of the faithful. The twelve gates are the apostles who by their writing and their work first made known to all the Gentiles the entrance into the church. [The twelve angels] are the teachers who in the mystery of faith and word follow in the footsteps of the apostles.… [The names of the twelve sons of Israel] signify the remembrance of the ancient fathers that is implanted in the hearts of preachers. For this reason when the high priest entered the tabernacle, he was commanded to carry the remembrance of the fathers in his mind and understanding.
