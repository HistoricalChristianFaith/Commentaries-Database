But he said to them, "You give them something to eat." He challenges the apostles to the breaking of bread, so that, as they declare themselves not to have anything, the greatness of the miracle might become more known, at the same time suggesting that through them our hungry hearts are to be fed daily. For what does Peter do when he speaks through the Epistles, if not to fill our poorly hungry hearts with the nourishment of the word? What do Paul and John achieve by speaking through the Epistles, if not that our minds may perceive heavenly nourishment and overcome the revulsion of famine by which they were dying?

But they said: We have no more than five loaves and two fish. The apostles did not yet have more than five loaves of the Mosaic law and two fish of both Testaments, which, for a longer time, were hidden in the mystery of things latent, as if covered and nourished by the waves of the abyss. However, it is well said in the Gospel of John that the loaves, which designate the law, were barley loaves, which is the food of draught animals and most rustic slaves: because to beginners and those not yet perfected, harsher and coarser precepts are to be entrusted. For the animal man does not receive the things of the spirit of God (1 Cor. II). And so the Lord, giving gifts to each according to their strength, and always provoking to greater perfection, first feeds five thousand with five loaves, then four thousand with seven loaves. Thirdly, he entrusts the mystery of his flesh and blood to his disciples. Finally, he grants the great gift to the elect, that they may eat and drink at his table in the kingdom.
