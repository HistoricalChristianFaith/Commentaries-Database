I sleep, and my heart watches. As if to say, With the cessation of persecutions for a time, I have begun to have some rest in the Lord even in this life, enjoying His leisure gladly, and now with all the desire of my heart, I keep watch for that rest which knows no end. I sleep, because, by His grace, I enjoy a little tranquility in this life in worshipping Him. Nor am I bound by so much labor of preaching as the early Church endured, nor struck by so many conflicts of the faithless as the numerous congregations of the nascent Church endured at first. And my heart watches, because the more freely I am free from external attacks, the deeper within me I see that He is the Lord. This indeed the holy Church says concerning those who, in the calm of temporal life, desire to serve the Lord with psalms, fasts, and other prayers and alms of temporal life, by quieter actions. But because this life is one of labor, not rest, soon she feels the voice of the Lord awakening her, and urging her to the toil of preaching, so that she may remember that in the time of this exile, the desired rest is neither wholly denied its taste nor eternally granted its full enjoyment. For it follows:

The voice of my beloved knocking: Open to me, my sister, etc. For the beloved knocks at our door when the Lord stirs us to the progress of virtues, when He admonishes us of the joys of the promised kingdom to be obtained, just as we also knock at His door when we seek from Him the progress of virtues and the entrance to the kingdom, mindful indeed of His promise, who said: Knock, and it shall be opened to you (Luke 11). And He also declares that He knocks at our door, when He says: Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in to him and dine with him, and he with me (Rev. 3). We open to the Lord knocking in two ways: when we open the sanctuary of our hearts to receive His fervent love, which we already have to some extent; or certainly when we open the hearts of our neighbors to receive His fear or love, which they have not yet had, by preaching. There is also a third knocking of the Lord at our door, when He admonishes us through prior infirmities that we are to be taken from this life. Concerning this, He Himself says in the Gospel, And you, he says, be like men waiting for their master when he will return from the marriage feast, so that when he comes and knocks, they may open to him immediately (Luke 12). We open immediately to the Lord knocking thus if we gladly receive death, and do not fear to be led to His judgment, remembering that we have pleased Him with good works and always honored Him; according to the Psalmist, And the honor of the king loves judgment (Psalm 96). But in this place, if carefully considered, the Lord seems rather to seek that opening of a faithful soul which happens in the instruction of neighbors. For it is certain that she had opened her own heart to Him because desiring to depart to Him, freed from the bonds of the flesh, she could say: I sleep, and my heart watches. It is certain that the beloved had already entered her because she had honored Him with the marks of so many and such great names, that she could say: My sister, my friend, my dove, my undefiled: my sister, because made co-heir of my kingdom; my friend, because having left the yoke of servitude, you have become conscious of my secrets; my dove, because enlightened by the gift of my spirit; my undefiled, because set apart from busy actions, you are exalted to divine visions. But when He says, Open to me, He undoubtedly requires the minds of those who were not yet worthy of all these to be opened to Him by preaching, as the following words declare, which say:

Because my head is filled with dew, etc. The head of Christ is God, as the Apostle says (I Cor. 11); but His curls are the collected thoughts in the minds of His faithful, which do not flow dispersed, but remain held together by discipline. The dew and drops of the night, which fall from above amid the darkness and cold, are the minds of the wicked, surely obscure and blind, and always desiring earthly things. Of such it is said: Because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall grow cold (Matt. 24). The Lord has commanded that we love Him, and also love our neighbor. But when we venerate Him with lesser love than we should, and when many, which is worse, hold no affection of charity toward Him at all, what else but the head of Christ is filled with dew? And when the wicked spend their hatred instead of love towards the servants of Christ, who gather into the guardianship of their minds and adhere more closely to the love of their Creator, do not His curls become wet with the drops of the night, and do they not gravely endure the oppressive chills of blind persecution? Therefore, when such a time arises, the Lord justly stirs the Church from the slumber of sweet studies in which it delights, and commands it to insist upon the word of preaching, and by frequent exhortation to warm, enlighten, and open up to Him the hearts of the wicked, which were closed against Him, so that entering in, He may dwell there by faith, preferring that the Church reach salvation for many through labor, rather than having rest in the few who were saved, although praiseworthy by frequent meditation on heavenly goods. Provoked to the labor of preaching, the Church responds to the Lord:

I arose to open to my beloved. To open to the Lord in this place signifies to preach the word of the Lord. For we open to the Lord, not only when we receive His coming into our heart through love, but also when we convert those who used to close their hearts against the truth by teaching them to accept it. And it is well that the bride recalls that she arose to open to her beloved, because it is absolutely necessary that everyone who intends to preach the truth first rises to carry out what he teaches, lest by preaching to others he himself be found unworthy. The following words are suitable, when it is said:
