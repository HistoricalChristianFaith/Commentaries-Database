loosed: In the same manner as prophecy, which points out to us things to come, he himself in spirit sees them come to pass. And he has said four angels, because the persecution will rage in the four parts of the world. For these are they whom he saw above, standing at the four corners of the earth, and restrained from injuring the earth and the sea for the sealing of the servants of God.

He spoke of four angels, since the persecution will rage in the four parts of the world. These are the same angels whom the seer previously saw standing at the four corners of the earth and restrained from harming the earth and the sea so that the servants of God might be sealed.â€¦ [They were ready for the hour, the day, the month, and the year] for the wicked spirits desire the death of humankind at every hour and moment of time. These will be permitted to rage more freely so that the church might be made stronger, but at the proper time, they themselves will be destroyed. And what do you think [such spirits] will do when they are released, when they work such devastation even now when they are bound?
