John tells us how we can know where we stand in Godâ€™s eyes. Everyone who has assurance on the day of judgment has perfect love in him. What does it mean to have assurance? It means that we are not afraid of the coming of judgment. When someone is newly converted, he starts by being afraid of the day of judgment, because he thinks that when the righteous Judge appears, he will be condemned as unrighteous. But as he grows in the faith and his life starts to change, he learns not to be afraid anymore but to look forward eagerly for the coming of the One who is the desire of the nations, hoping that on the strength of his good life he will be crowned among the saints.
