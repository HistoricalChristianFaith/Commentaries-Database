The Pelagians do not want to believe that the entire human race has been corrupted by the sin of one person and condemned as a result. From that sin and damnation only the grace of Christ can cleanse and deliver us. Why is it therefore that a righteous man is scarcely saved? Is it difficult for God to deliver the righteous? Of course not! But in order to show that our nature has been justly condemned, even the Almighty does not want it to appear as if being delivered from it is something easy.
