Matthias was chosen by lot so that the choice of the apostle would not appear to be out of harmony with the command of the old law, where it was ordered that the high priest be sought, as was said of Zechariah, “according to the custom of the priest’s office, it came about by lot that he offered incense.” He [Zechariah] was, as I suppose, selected by lot at that time so that it might be typologically prefigured that they were to continue to seek out a priest until the one came who had replaced him, the one who, not by bloody sacrifices “but by virtue of his own blood, entered once for all into the holy places, having obtained eternal redemption”24—his sacrifice was immolated at the time of the Passover but truly brought to perfection by the Holy Spirit in the appearance of fire on the day of Pentecost. For according to old customs, victims acceptable to God were brought to perfection by celestial fire. Therefore until the truth was fulfilled, the practice of the figure was permissible. So it was that Matthias, who was appointed before Pentecost, was chosen by lot, while in the case of the seven deacons, who came later, there was no shaking of lots but only the disciples’ choice; and indeed they were appointed by the prayer of the apostles and the imposition of hands. Therefore if there are any who, under the compulsion of some difficult situation think that because of the example of the apostles they should consult God with lots, they should see that these same apostles needed only the assembly of the brothers gathered together and prayers poured forth to God.
