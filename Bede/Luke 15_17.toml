He said: How many hired servants of my father have bread enough and to spare, and I perish here with hunger. How could he know this, being in such great oblivion of God, as all idolaters were, unless because this recollection was already of one repenting, when the Gospel was preached? Therefore, the workers of the Father have bread aboundingly, because those who strive to perform deeds worthy with a view to future recompense are daily refreshed with the nourishment of divine grace. But truly, they perish with hunger who, placed outside the house of the Father, desire to fill their bellies with husks. That is, those who, living without end, seek a blessed life in the pursuits of vain philosophy. For just as bread, which strengthens manâ€™s heart, is likened to the word of God which refreshes the mind, so too the husk, which is internally empty and externally soft, and does not refresh the body but fills it, so that it is more a burden than a benefit, is not unreasonably compared to secular wisdom, whose language is sonorous with eloquence but empty of the power of usefulness.
