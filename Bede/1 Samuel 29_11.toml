The Philistines had gone up to Jezreel. When David departed with his men, the Philistines went up to Jezreel, that is, to combat in the seed of God, where they had previously assembled in Aphek, that is, in the new wrath. And the reprobates often, having driven away the stronger doctors of the Church from their proximity, exert all their strength to corrupt the weaker ones, whom, out of respect or fear of the former, although raging in spirit, they had previously not presumed to touch and disturb. Not only those who carry arms or argue against the good, but also those who, presenting examples of depravity under the name of brothers, display them to the sight of the pious, ascending into Jezreel, that is, the seed of God, try to infect it with the tares of diabolic seed. We see and hear that the mysteries of this reading are being fulfilled even today in many places, driving the Lord from the hearts of many, and oppressing His chosen ones; but with the approach of the world's end, with the heaps of evils growing, we do not doubt in trembling fear that they must be fulfilled more and more.
