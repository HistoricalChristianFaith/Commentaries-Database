Since all the weak at that time will seek to be strengthened by the examples of the highest in the church, and to be fortified by their counsel, and to be protected by their exhortations and to be sheltered by their prayers, it is as though they entreated the mountains themselves to fall upon them out of compassionate affection. For “the high mountains are a refuge for the deer, and the rocks for the badger.” “And hide us from the face of him who is seated on the throne and from the wrath of the Lamb.” That is, when he comes, that he should not find us worthy of condemnation but steadfast in faith, our sins being covered by the intercession of the saints and the mercy of God. “And who will be able to stand.” Certainly that one will be able to stand who has now taken care to be vigilant, to be steadfast in faith and to live courageously. Because, if one refers this earthquake literally to the day of judgment itself, it is not surprising if at that time the kings and princes of the earth out of fear seek the refuge of the holy mountains, just as we read has already occurred in the story of the rich man clothed in purple and the poor Lazarus.
