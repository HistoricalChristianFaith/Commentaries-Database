And Saul said to David: You are not able to resist this Philistine, etc. This is the trembling of the weak, or even the resistance of the proud. Can this one engage in battle against the strength of the devil, which belongs solely to the Divinity; since he is clothed in human, indeed humble flesh; and yet his adversary, powerful by his spiritual nature, has learned to wield arms against the Creator and also against our kind, ever since he was created in rebellion? For he was a murderer from the beginning, and did not stand in the truth (John VIII). A murderer, of course, first of himself by his pride, and then of man by his seduction; in which double murder he long fell away from the truth he had once deserted, indeed, and he does not cease sinning until the end of the world, continually falling by accumulating sins.
