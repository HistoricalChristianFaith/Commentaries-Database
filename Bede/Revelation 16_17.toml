And the seventh poured out his vial into the air, etc. Just as above the blood of vengeance up to the horse bridles, namely the unclean spirits went out, so also here when the same aerial powers are drenched with the final vengeance, it is said to have happened, that is, the end is at hand, when (as the Apostle says) the last enemy, death, will be destroyed (1 Cor. 15). Thus far under the name of plagues is described the final persecution, which Tyconius wants to be understood all oppositely. A plague, he says, is incurable, and a great wrath to receive the power of sinning especially against the saints, and not yet to be chastised by a greater wrath of God. For the outcome of the blessedness of the wicked is death, just as conversely the torments and humiliation of the Church is its glory. For at that time all the impious people will be unharmed by any bodily plague, as if they had received the full power of raging. Nor will there be a need then for the fulfillment of sins and the completion of wrath for any of the wicked to be scourged, and to be restrained from fury. He summarizes from the same persecution, describing the ruin of the impious city.
