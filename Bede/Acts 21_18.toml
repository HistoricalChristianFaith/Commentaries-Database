This James was “the brother of the Lord,” that is, “the son of Mary, the sister of the Lord’s mother, whom John” the Evangelist “mentions.” It was he who “was appointed bishop by the apostles immediately after the Lord’s passion and ruled the church at Jerusalem for thirty years, that is, until Nero’s seventh year.” Since the Jews were not able to kill Paul, though they very much sought to, soon afterwards, as Festus had died and Albinus had not yet come to the province, they turned their hand against James, who “was buried next to the temple, where he had also been thrown down.”
