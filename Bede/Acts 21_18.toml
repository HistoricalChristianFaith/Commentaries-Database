The following day Paul went in with us to James. This James was the brother of the Lord, that is, of Mary, the sister of the Lord's mother, whom John the Evangelist mentions, and he was her son. Immediately after the passion of the Lord, he was appointed bishop by the apostles and ruled the Church in Jerusalem for thirty years, that is, until the seventh year of Nero. When the Jews, who were keen to kill Paul, could not do so, as soon as Festus died and Albinus had not yet arrived in the province, they turned their hands against James, who was buried next to the temple where he had been cast down.
