Then he opened their minds to understand the Scriptures, and he said to them: Because it is written thus, and thus it was necessary for Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead on the third day. He offers himself to be seen with the eyes, he offers himself to be handled by the hands. It is not enough to read, he recalls the Scriptures. And this is not enough, he opens the mind, so that what you read you understand. Then after commending the truth of his body, he commends the unity of the Church.
