But they said: Where do you wish us to prepare? We do not have a dwelling, we do not have a tent. Let those who are concerned with building houses and who think about the construction of grand porticoes hear this, those who are delighted by the display of precious marbles and ceilings adorned with gold, let them recognize Christ, the Lord of all, who had no place to lay his head. And for this reason, his disciples asked him: Where do you wish for us to prepare the Passover for you to eat?
