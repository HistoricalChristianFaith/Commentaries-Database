But as the crowds were gathering, he began to say: This generation is an evil generation: it seeks a sign, and no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah. He had been attacked with a double question. Some indeed were slandering him for casting out demons by Beelzebul, to whom this has been answered. And others, testing him, were seeking a sign from heaven from him, to whom he begins to respond, not giving them a sign from heaven which they were unworthy to see, but instead granting a sign from the depths of hell, like the prophet Jonah who, shipwrecked, swallowed by a whale yet freed from the abyss and the jaws of death, both received and gave, namely the sign of the incarnation, not divinity, of the passion, not glorification. But to his disciples, he gave a sign from heaven, revealing to them the glory of eternal blessedness, first figuratively transformed on the mount, and then truly lifted to heaven.
