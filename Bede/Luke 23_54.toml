And it was the day of Preparation, and the Sabbath was drawing near. Preparation is interpreted as preparing, by which name the Jews who lived among the Greeks called the sixth day of the week, which is now called Friday by us, because on that day they prepared what was necessary for the Sabbath. According to what was once commanded concerning manna: "On the sixth day you shall gather double," etc. (Exodus 16). But the Jews who lived among the Romans more commonly called it in Latin, "the pure supper." Because man was made on the sixth day, and the whole creation of the world was perfected, and on the seventh the Creator rested from his work, hence he commanded it to be called the Sabbath, that is, rest, rightly the Lord was crucified on the same sixth day, fulfilling the mystery of human restoration. Therefore, when he had received the vinegar, he said: "It is finished" (John 19), that is, the work of the sixth day, which I undertook for the resurrection of the world, is entirely completed. On the Sabbath, resting in the tomb, he awaited the event of the resurrection which was to come on the eighth day. Here shines the example of our devotion, for whom it is necessary to suffer for the Lord in this sixth age of the world, and to be crucified as it were to the world; but in the seventh age, that is, when one joyfully pays the debt, the bodies indeed remain in the tombs, but the souls remain in secret peace with the Lord, and it is fitting to rest after good works, until finally in the coming eighth age even the bodies themselves, purified by the resurrection, receive incorruptibility of eternal inheritance together with the souls. Hence it is aptly read that the seventh day in Genesis did not have an evening, because the rest of souls which now exists in that age shall not be consumed by any sorrow, but shall be increased by the fuller joy of the future resurrection.
