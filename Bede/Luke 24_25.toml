And He said to them: "Oh foolish ones, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken! Was it not necessary that the Christ should suffer these things and enter into His glory?" And starting with Moses and all the prophets, He interpreted to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning Himself. In this place, we are not obliged to interpret any Scripture, but we are doubly humbled, who are neither sufficiently taught in the Scriptures nor as intent on fulfilling what we might have learned as we ought to be. For if Moses and all the prophets spoke concerning Christ, and that He would enter into His glory through the suffering of His passion, by what reason do those who, according to the measure of their abilities, neither investigate the Scriptures as to how they pertain to Christ nor desire to attain the glory they wish to have with Christ through the sufferings of tribulations, boast themselves to be Christians?
