The glory of that city will be so great and so exalted from the goodness of God that no remnant of its [former] agedness will remain, namely, when the celestial incorruption will raise up all the bodies [of the saints] and the contemplation of the eternal King will feed their minds.â€¦ It was earlier said that death had been sent into the lake of fire. We can also now understand these statements in the same way, namely, that when the holy city has been glorified at the last judgment, mourning and crying and mortality will remain in Gehenna alone.
