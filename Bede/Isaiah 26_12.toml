“A man’s steps are directed by the Lord.” Whoever walks a straight path composed of human steps does so not by the freedom of human judgment but by the governance of him to whom Isaiah said, “All of our works were accomplished by you.” “What man can understand his way?” In this it becomes clear that whatever goodness anyone possesses from himself he does not have except through the grace of God, because no one is able to understand through the freedom of his own judgment either what kind of future he will have or the quality and duration of conquests to come. - "Three Books on the Proverbs of Solomon 2.20"
