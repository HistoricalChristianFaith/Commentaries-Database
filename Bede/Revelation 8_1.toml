It is believed that after the destruction of the antichrist, there will be a short rest in the church. Daniel prophesied of this, “Blessed is he who waits and comes to the thousand three hundred and thirty-five days.” The blessed Jerome commented upon this passage [of Daniel]. “Blessed, he says, is he who when the antichrist is killed waits for the forty-five days beyond the thousand two hundred and ninety days, that is, three and a half years. For during them our Lord and Savior will come in his majesty. It is a matter of divine knowledge why there is silence for forty-five days after the death of the antichrist, unless we make the conjecture that the delay of the kingdom of the saints is a test of patience.” We should note that the greatest afflictions of the church are envisaged in the sixth period, while a rest is seen in the seventh. For the Lord was crucified on the sixth day, and he rested on the seventh, awaiting the time of the resurrection.
