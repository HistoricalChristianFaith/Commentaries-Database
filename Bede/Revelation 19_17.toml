[The angel standing in the sun] represents preaching in the church, which shines the more brightly and thunders the more freely the more it is oppressed.… The birds refer to the saints who live a heavenly life, “for wherever the body is, there the eagles will be gathered together.” Considered as one body, he had referred to the saints as an eagle flying in mid-heaven.
