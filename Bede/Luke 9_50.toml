And Jesus said to him: Do not forbid him. For whoever is not against you is for you. Taught by this saying, the Apostle says: But whether in pretense or in truth Christ is proclaimed, and in this I rejoice, yes, and will rejoice (Philippians 1). But although he rejoices even in those who proclaim Christ insincerely, such people sometimes doing signs in the name of Christ are considered not to be prohibited for the sake of othersâ€™ salvation, however, their own conscience is not made secure through such signs. Rather, on that day when they say: Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many mighty works in your name? they will receive a reply: I never knew you, depart from me, you workers of lawlessness (Matthew 7). Therefore, in heretics and evil Catholics, it is not the common sacraments, which are with us and not against us, but the division contrary to peace and truth, which is not with us and they do not follow the Lord with us, that we ought to detest and prohibit.
