Four thousand men of the Sicarii. There is no controversy to be held between the tribune who spoke these things and Josephus who wrote about the Egyptian. For it could happen that he first came with a few, the same secretly leading a tyranny, but later joined many to himself by public deceit. It is read, however, that in the time of Felix, this kind of robber arose, who, not seeking hidden places or times, but carrying daggers, that is, short swords in hand, mixed among the people in the very light of day, attached themselves by blind wounds, to the point that death prevented a complaint, and the striker lay hidden. And if anyone were moved by the fact that such things were done in the middle of the city, he too perished. Thus, by fear of danger or dissimulation of the crime, the assassin was not apprehended.
