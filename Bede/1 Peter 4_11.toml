It seems that Peter was afraid that he might say or teach something which goes against the will of God, or against what is written in Scripture, and be found to be a false witness to God or a blasphemer or a heretic who was introducing something which goes against the Lordâ€™s teaching. And what he practiced himself in this respect he enjoins on us all.
