At the Lord’s passion only the priest leaped from his throne and tore his garments, because on that occasion the old priesthood was being changed to a new one. Now, however, since after the killing of the apostles the whole people together would be robbed of the glory of the kingdom, all of them flung off their apparel and raised up to the heavens an outcry mixed with dust, in accord with what the psalm says, “The pride of those who hate you ever rises.”
