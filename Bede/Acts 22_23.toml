As they were shouting, throwing off their cloaks, and throwing dust into the air. In the Lord’s passion, the priest alone leaping from the throne tears his garments, because then the old priesthood was to be changed to the new. But now, because after the death of the apostles, the whole nation was to be stripped of the glory of the kingdom, all throw off their garments, and lift their clamor mixed with dust to heaven. According to what the Psalmist says: “The pride of those who hate you rises always” (Psalm 73).
