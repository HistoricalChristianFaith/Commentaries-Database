Because the people of Israel were found rebellious not only after the Lord’s incarnation but even from the earliest times when the law was given, they were as if lame from the mother’s womb. This was well prefigured by Jacob’s being blessed, indeed, but lame when he wrestled with the angel, for this same people, when they prevailed over the Lord in his passion, was in some of [its members] blessed through the faith but in others lame through infidelity.

The beautiful gate of the temple is the Lord. Whoever enters through him will be saved. Enfeebled Israel, being unable to walk to this gate, was brought there by the words of the law and the prophets, so that they might request help from those who were entering into the interior places of the wisdom of the faith which they were to hear. Those who place the prophecies of things to come are, as it were, hearers at the gate. But Peter is the guide into the temple. To him, in virtue of his strong profession of faith, the epithet of “rock” and the keys of heaven were given.
