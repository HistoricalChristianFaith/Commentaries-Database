And running, you will not have a stumbling block. The more eagerly you run to fulfill God’s commandments, the less you will fear adversities that impede you: for whoever sweats in evil deeds finds a stumbling block in the midst of the course, because immediately, when they do not foresee, they are snatched to punishment.
