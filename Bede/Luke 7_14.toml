And he approached and touched the bier. But they who carried it stood still. The bier, on which the dead person is carried out, is the badly secure conscience of a desperate sinner. And those who carry it out for burial are either the unclean desires which drag a person to perdition or the poisonous flatteries of deceitful companions, which indeed augment sins while they elevate them with favors, and bury the sinners under contempt, like a heap of earth. Of these it is said elsewhere: "Let the dead bury their own dead" (Matthew 8). Indeed, the dead bury the dead, when sinners seduce others like themselves with harmful favor, and with a heap of worst flattery, oppress them so that they may never have the hope of rising again.

And he said, "Young man, I say to you, arise." And he who was dead sat up and began to speak, and he gave him back to his mother. Indeed, he who was dead sat up when a sinner revives with internal compunction. He begins to speak, showing to all who had lamented the sin the signs of returning life. He is given back to his mother when, by the decree of priestly judgment, he is restored to the communion of the Church.
