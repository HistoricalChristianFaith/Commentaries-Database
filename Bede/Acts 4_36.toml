Wherever the sacred Scriptures give the names of things or persons with an interpretation, it certainly indicates that a more sacred sense is contained in them. Rightly, therefore, is a person called a son of consolation [encouragement], who, despising present things, is consoled by the hope of things to come. And to be sure, the Holy Spirit is given the name Paraclete because through the inner pouring out of his favor he grants the paraclÄ“sis, that is, the consolation, of heavenly joys to those who have distress in the world.
