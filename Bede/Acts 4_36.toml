Joseph, who was also called Barnabas by the apostles. I think this Barnabas is the same who later is read to be ordained as an apostle to the Gentiles with Paul. Hence, because he was a Cypriot by birth, after separating from Paul, he returned to his native island. Although some think he was a companion of Paul rather than the one who was established by lot with Matthias in the apostleship, they overlook the fact that, according to the more correct manuscripts, this Barnabas should be called Barsabas with a changed letter, and in the Book of Hebrew Names, this Barnabas is interpreted as the son of consolation, but the other as the son of quiet.

Which means the Son of Consolation. Wherever the sacred Scriptures place the names of things or persons together with an interpretation, it undoubtedly signifies a more sacred meaning in those. He is rightly called the son of consolation, who, despising present things, is consoled by the hope of future things. For the Holy Spirit is therefore also called Paraclete because He grants consolation, that is, the joy of heavenly things, through the inner infusion of His gift to those who have pressure in the world. Similarly, blessed Peter is called Bar Jona, that is, the son of the dove, because of the same grace of the Spirit.

Joseph, who was surnamed Barnabas by the apostles, which is interpreted as the son of consolation, a Levite of Cyprian origin, having land, sold it, etc. It is remarkable how this Barnabas, who was later ordained an apostle of the Gentiles with Paul, and after a long companionship with him, returned to Cyprus, where he was born, to preach again, Eusebius, in the Ecclesiastical History, considers him to be among the seventy disciples of the Lord Savior, while it is clearly written by blessed Luke that he came to the discipleship of the apostles after the Lord's ascension; unless perhaps it is to be thought that he first followed the discipleship of Christ in such a way that he had not yet renounced all that he possessed. Whether this was in keeping with evangelical doctrine, anyone can easily see.
