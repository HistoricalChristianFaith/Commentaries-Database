But Saul gave Michal his daughter as a wife to David, etc. Phalti means my savior, Lais means lion, or fears for himself, Gallim means those who are transmigrated. The leaders and teachers of the Jews, after they saw that the Gentiles believed in Christ, withdrew the common people subject to the Synagogue from him and taught them to believe rather in the Antichrist, whom they await as their savior at the end, indeed the son of the devil, who was made so that he would fear no one, and roamed around like a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour (I Pet. V); and he is numbered among the unclean spirits, who also formerly transmigrated from the heavens to Tartarus, and daily do not cease to lead their followers from virtues to vices, from bad to worse.
