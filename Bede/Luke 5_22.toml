For He said, answering them, "Why do you think in your hearts?" For to the same God who says, "I am, I am He who blots out your iniquities" (Isaiah 43), the wisest speaker says, "For You alone know the hearts of all the sons of men" (1 Kings 8). Therefore, He said, by the same majesty and power with which I observe your thoughts, I can also forgive men's sins. Understand from yourselves what the paralytic receives.
