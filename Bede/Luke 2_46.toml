And it happened after three days, they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the doctors, listening to them and asking questions. As a fountain of wisdom sits in the midst of the doctors, but as an example of humility, he first seeks to listen and ask questions of the doctors rather than to teach the unlearned. So that the little ones may not be ashamed to learn from their elders, and he himself, for the sake of human age appropriateness, is not ashamed to listen to men, though he is God. So that the weak may not dare to teach, he, as a boy, wished to be taught by asking questions, who by the power of divinity provided the word of knowledge to his very doctors.
