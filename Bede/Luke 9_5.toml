And whoever will not receive you, as you go out from that city, even shake off the dust of your feet as a testimony against them. The dust is shaken off their feet in testimony of their labor, in that they have entered the city, and the apostolic preaching has reached them. Or the dust is shaken off so that they may accept nothing from them, not even what is necessary for sustenance, who have spurned the Gospel. Allegorically, those who humbly attend to the word, if they are obscured by the spots of earthly levity as men, are soon purified by those marks of the evangelical preaching which they receive. But those who scorn through unbelief, negligence, or even deliberate effort, are judged to have their communion to be avoided, their synagogue to be shunned, and the dust of their feet shaken off, lest the mind's chaste mark be stained by what is handled and compared to dust.
