Beloved, do not believe every spirit, etc. And who is it that tests the spirits or how they can be tested, the Lord teaches in the Gospel where he foretold such things as John already proves came in his time. Beware, he said, of false prophets who come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly are ravenous wolves. You will know them by their fruits. Do they gather grapes from thorns, or figs from thistles (Matt. VII)? These are therefore the fruits by which evil spirits, who speak in false prophets, can be knownâ€”the thorns of schisms, and the rough thistles of heresies, by which they contaminate those who approach them incautiously, tearing their faith. Conversely, the fruits of the good, that is, love, joy, peace in the Holy Spirit, are aptly figured by the fragrance of the grapes and the sweetness of the figs.
