Peter records that Paul wrote to them, because even if Paul addressed his letters to specific churches, he nevertheless intended them to circulate among them all, because there is only one universal church. Note too that although Peter here praises Paul’s wisdom, Paul said of himself: “I am the least of the apostles, who am not worthy to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.” Paul humbled himself because he remembered his early unbelief, and he put the other apostles ahead of himself. Peter, on the other hand, the first of the apostles, almost forgets his primacy and the fact that the keys of the kingdom were given to him and instead marvels at the wisdom which was given to Paul. The reason for this is that it is a characteristic of the elect that they admire the virtues of others more than their own and that those virtues encourage them to grow more deeply in their faith.
