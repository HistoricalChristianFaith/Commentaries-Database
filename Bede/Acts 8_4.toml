Therefore, those who were scattered went about evangelizing the word of God. For scattered, in Greek it is written as disseminated, that is, dispersed. For they were those of whom Isaiah spoke: All who see them will recognize them because they are the seed which the Lord has blessed, and about whom the Lord said in the parable of the Gospel: The good seed, these are the sons of the kingdom (Matthew XIII). This seed was disseminated through regions so that the harvest of faith, which began in Jerusalem, first filled Judea and Samaria, then the whole world. Finally, we read about these same scattered ones, or rather disseminated ones, in the following: that they spoke the word not only to Jews but also to Greeks, and the foundations of the nascent church in Antioch were laid nobly through them.
