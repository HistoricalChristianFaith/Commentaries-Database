And they themselves began to inquire among themselves who it might be from them who was going to do this. And certainly, the eleven apostles knew that they had not conceived such a thing against the Lord, but they believed the teacher more than themselves, and fearing their own weakness, they sorrowfully inquired about the sin, of which they had no consciousness. Judas also shamelessly inquires, as Matthew and Mark mention, in order to falsely feign a good conscience with boldness.
