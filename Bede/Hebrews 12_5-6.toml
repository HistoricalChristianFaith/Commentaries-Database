At this point we might consider and commit more actively to memory how almighty God allows God’s chosen ones and beloved servants—those God has predestined to life and the eternal kingdom—to be so stricken in this life by the persecution of the wicked and to be wasted by so many kinds and such fierce punishments and deaths. This is so that when we have viewed the sufferings of the maturely faithful, we may grieve less over the adversities that perhaps have happened to us and learn instead to esteem it complete joy when we fall into various kinds of struggles, keeping in mind that “the Lord disciplines him whom he loves and chastises every son whom he receives.”
