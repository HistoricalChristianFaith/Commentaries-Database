She considers the ways of her household, etc. She considers the ways of her household, because she carefully investigates all the thoughts of her conscience. She does not eat the bread of idleness, because what she has perceived from understanding the sacred word, she shows by her works before the eyes of the eternal Judge. Again, the house of the strong woman is the dwelling of the heavenly country; the ways of that house are the commands of justice, by which one arrives at the mansion of eternal life. Indeed, the soul well considers these ways, when both it diligently examines by what acts it should arrive at the higher, and does not cease to zealously practice what it has learned must be done. She does not eat the bread of idleness, when receiving the sacrifice of the Lord’s body, she strives to imitate in action what she celebrates in ministry, being very concerned not to eat and drink the Lord’s bread and cup unworthily, lest she eat and drink judgment upon herself; but that by suffering for Christ, and shedding tears, persisting also in good deeds, she may follow the examples of His passion as much as she can. It can also be simply understood that the strong woman does not eat the bread of idleness; according to that saying of the Apostle: If anyone is not willing to work, let him not eat (II Thessalonians III). And he himself said of himself, "Because for what I needed, and for those who are with me, these hands have ministered" (Acts 20). Hence, rightfully reproving luxurious widows, he adds: "Besides, they learn to be idle, wandering about from house to house; and not only idle, but also gossips and busybodies" (1 Tim. 5).
