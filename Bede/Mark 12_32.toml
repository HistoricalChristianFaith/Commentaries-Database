And the scribe said to him: Well said, teacher, you have truly said that there is one God, and there is none other besides him. And to love him with all your heart, and with all your understanding, and with all your soul, and with all your strength, and to love your neighbor as yourself, is greater than all burnt offerings and sacrifices. It is shown by this response of the scribe that there was often a serious question debated among the scribes and Pharisees about what was the first or greatest commandment of divine law, some indeed praising offerings and sacrifices, others preferring with greater authority the works of faith and love, because many of the fathers before the law, without any custom of victims and sacrifices, pleased God through faith alone, which works through love, and were held in the highest regard by him; but none was ever found to have pleased God through holocausts and sacrifices alone without faith and love. In which opinion this scribe also declared himself to be.
