If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear. If anyone has the understanding to perceive the word of God, let him not withdraw, let him not turn his hearing to fables, but diligently lend his ear to examining those things which the truth has spoken, diligently employ his hands in fulfilling those things which he has already understood, diligently subject his tongue to preaching those things opportunely and inopportunely.
