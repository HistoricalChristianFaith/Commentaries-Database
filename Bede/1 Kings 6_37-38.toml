The allegorical meaning of the fact that the house of the Lord was built in seven years is plain, because, of course, the holy church is being built of the souls of the elect for the entire duration of this world, which is also completed in a period of six days, and it too brings its growth to an end with the end of the world. Or, at all events, it is built in seven years on account of the import of the grace of the Spirit through which the church alone gets the authority to be the church. For Isaiah enumerates the seven gifts of the Holy Spirit without which no one can either become a believer or keep the faith or by the merit of faith attain the crown. On the other hand, the fact that it was in the eighth year and in the eighth month of that year that the house was completed in all its parts and all its specifications has to do with the world to come and the day of judgment when the holy church will already have reached such a degree of perfection that it will not be possible to find anything to add to it. For it will then have what that dutiful devotee suppliantly asked of the Lord, saying, “Lord, show us the Father, and it is enough for us.” For it is well known that the day of judgment is often represented typologically in the Scriptures by the number eight from the fact that it follows this world, which lasts for seven days. This is also why the prophet gave the title “For the eighth” to the psalm he used to sing through fear of this severe judge, beginning with the words “Lord, rebuke me not in your indignation, nor chastise me in your wrath,” and so forth.But there arises the rather important question as to how the house of the Lord is said to have been completed in all its parts in the eighth month and in all its specifications, whereas in what follows one reads that its dedication was completed in the seventh month. On the other hand, it is not credible that Solomon, though he built the temple in seven years and completed it in the eighth month of the eighth year, nevertheless deferred the dedication of the completed building until the seventh month of the ninth year. Hence it seems more likely that the house was built in seven years and seven months so that the solemn ceremony of dedication might be celebrated in the same seventh month, and, as the Chronicles relate, on the twenty-third day of that month Solomon sent the people away to their tents, and thus after one week when the eighth month had come around, the house of the Lord was found to be complete and already finished, that is to say, both in all its parts and in its actual dedication. Unless perhaps one should think that after the dedication of the temple some extra features were added for its services up to the beginning of the eighth month, the king speeding up the work so that the temple would be dedicated in the seventh month, … and that in this way the two things might turn out to be true, namely, both that the temple had been completed in the eighth month in all its parts and specifications and that it had been dedicated in the seventh month.
