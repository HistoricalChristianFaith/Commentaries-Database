John answered him, saying: Master, we saw someone casting out demons in your name, who does not follow us, and we forbade him. John, loving the Lord with supreme devotion and therefore worthy of being loved in return, thought that he who does not use the office should be excluded from the benefit, but it is taught that no one should be barred from the good which he partially possesses, but rather should be encouraged towards that which he does not yet have. For it follows: But Jesus said: Do not forbid him; for there is no one who does a mighty work in my name who will be able soon after to speak evil of me. For whoever is not against you is for you. Taught by this sentence, the Apostle says: But whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is proclaimed, and in this I rejoice, yes, and will rejoice (Philippians I). But although he rejoices, even in those who proclaim Christ insincerely, and such persons doing signs in the name of Christ for the salvation of others are considered not to be forbidden, yet to such persons by these signs, their conscience is not rendered secure. Rather, on that day when they will say: Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and in your name cast out demons, and in your name perform many mighty works (Matthew VII)? They will receive the answer: I never knew you; depart from me, all you workers of iniquity (Ibid.). Therefore, in heretics and evil Catholics, it is not the common sacraments, in which they are with us and are not against us, but the divisions contrary to the peace of truth by which they are against us and do not follow the Lord with us, that we must detest and forbid.
