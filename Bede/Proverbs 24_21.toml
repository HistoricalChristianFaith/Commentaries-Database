Fear the Lord, my son, and the king. Rightly as he himself said, "Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's, and unto God the things that are God's" (Matt. 22). Neither is there any obstacle in the Lord and king to understand the Father and the Son being designated, who are to be worshipped with one and the same honor of divinity. For he who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent him (John 5). And do not join with the detractors. Meaning those who, claiming to know God the Father, refused to receive the Son of God appearing in the flesh.
