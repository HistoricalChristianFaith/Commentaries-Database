He also gave them this parable: Can a blind man lead a blind man? Will they not both fall into a pit? The sense of this saying depends on the preceding, where he instructs about giving alms and forgiving injury. If (he says) anger against the violent and greed against the petitioner has blinded you, can you cure his fault with your corrupted mind? Or will not only he who committed the injury but also you, who could not endure it, be considered guilty? But if his wickedness finds you gentle and with a tranquil heart, both he will be moved to repentance, and you will be given the reward of patience, because you are endeavoring to lead the blind with a seeing eye—that is, a serene heart—towards the light.
