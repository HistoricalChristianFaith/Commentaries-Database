And he placed them and took his staff, etc. The Lord arranged the sacraments of the law, which He deemed good to adopt for a short time to prove their goodness in its time, and He exercised His power of judgment, which He always used to rule everything, even freely concerning the arrangement of the law. He set aside Saul's armor when He said: For the Son of Man is the Lord even of the Sabbath (Matt. XII). He took his staff, always held in his hands when he was teaching them as one having authority, and not as their scribes and Pharisees. He put on Saul's armor, coming to the singular battle, when, as His passion's struggle approached, He said to His disciples: With desire I have desired, etc. (Luke XXII). He set them aside when he added: For I say unto you, I will not eat thereof, until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God, etc. (Ibid.). In the same manner, He foretold that the Paschal cup, legally observed, should no longer be observed carnally. He took his staff, which he always had in his hands, when, with the mystery of His cross beneficial for the salvation of the world (for the figure of the staff can not improperly be applied to Him, who always had time and manner in His power), He taught His disciples: Taking bread, He gave thanks, and broke it, and gave it to them, saying: This is my body, etc.

And he chose for himself five smooth stones from the brook, etc. Having shown the rejection of the preceding commandment, because of its weakness and unprofitableness, the Lord rather taught Himself to choose the very law, which is written in five books, to be observed spiritually, extracting it from the turbid minds of those who, having a veil over their hearts, could not look attentively at the face of Moses, and lifting it into the free air of evangelical light. Therefore, He also was careful to commit the spiritual law's sublime intellect to the hearts of the spiritual pastors, whom He had with Him as companions. To this, He added the aid of the allegorical, moral, and anagogical senses, as if woven into a threefold cord. Thus armed with such fitting weapons, He set forth to conquer the prince of this world as a victor.
