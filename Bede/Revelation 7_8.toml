However, God works and perfects these things in the “habitation of strength,” which is the meaning of Zebulun, since “strength is made perfect in weakness.” And this God does so that the body, which is regarded as weak by its enemies and through which they strive to wreak destruction upon the soul, might be found, with God’s assistance and by the happy addition which will come to it, to be invincible. And this is indicated by the name Joseph, which means the “gifts of grace to be added.” By this we must understand either the increase of the spiritual gift from the double return of the talents, or you should think of those offerings which are rendered to God the Redeemer by the devotion of the faithful. And that you might understand that all these, who by sequence and the interpretation of names are placed here in a meaningful way, are those who will in the future judgment be at the right hand of Christ, the eternal king. Benjamin, as we said before, is mentioned in last place. For Benjamin means “son of the right hand,” because he is at the end of the series. For, when the last enemy, namely, death, is destroyed, the felicity of the eternal inheritance will be given to the elect, either each one of the faithful rightfully being named “son of the right hand,” or the whole congregation of the church, concerning which we sing, “A queen stood at your right hand dressed in various golden robes.”
