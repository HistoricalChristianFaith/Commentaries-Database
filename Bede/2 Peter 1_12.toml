Why did Peter want to go on reminding people of these things, when he says that they know them and are already established in the presence of the truth? Perhaps the reason was that he wanted them to turn their head knowledge into practical action and maintain the truth which they knew they had, in order to escape being led away from the purity and simplicity of their faith by teachers of heresy, of whom he has a good deal to say in the course of his letter. Compare what Peter says to John’s statement in his first epistle: “I write to you, not because you do not know the truth, but because you know it.” The apostles wrote to people who knew the truth already and exhorted them to live up to what they knew. As John added a little further on: “Let what you heard from the beginning abide in you.”
