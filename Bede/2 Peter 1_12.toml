Wherefore I will always begin to admonish you about these things, etc. Why does he want to always admonish them about good works, those whom he says have knowledge and are confirmed in the present truth? Unless perhaps it is so that the knowledge they have learned they may exercise in good works, and the truth of which they are confirmed in presence they may guard with a fixed mind, lest ever through teachers of error they fall from the simplicity and purity of faith, concerning which teachers he speaks more in the course of the Epistle. And this sentiment agrees with that of blessed John, who says: “I have not written to you because you do not know the truth, but because you do know it” (1 John 2). Therefore, the apostles write to those who know the truth, and admonish them so that they might observe what they know. Whence also John, speaking, adds shortly after: “Let that which you have heard from the beginning remain in you” (Ibid.).
