The one who has the bride is the bridegroom. By the bride he means the church gathered from among all nations.… It is a virgin pure of heart, perfect in love, bound to him in the bond of peace, in chastity of body and soul and in the unity of the Catholic faith. For it is useless for her to be a virgin in body without retaining the purity of the Catholic faith. Our Lord therefore committed his bride to his friends who are the preachers of the true gospel. Therefore, John says, “The friend of the bridegroom who stands and hears him rejoices greatly because of the bridegroom’s voice.” The friend is able to stand and hear him because he remains in the true faith and preaches what he believes.
