Jesus has passed from this world to his Father and remains upon the heights of his Father’s kingdom, clearly out of human sight, where a great distance exists between him who sat at the right hand of God now that he in the flesh had become victorious over everlasting death, and those wretched mortals and godless ones of this world who labored to fight against him. Nonetheless, as he preached through his apostles, he called out to the people of Israel and to the experts in the law and forced them to rouse themselves from the slumber of their guilty indolence and to answer him by believing in him. Abner, whose name means “lamp of the father,” points to those who ought to have imparted the light of the truth of that time to the people. His father, Ner, which means “lamp,” alludes to their teachers who excelled in kindling the light of knowledge of the law in a spiritual fashion and in revealing to the ordinary teachers and to the people at large.
