They were forbidden by the Holy Spirit to speak the word in Asia, etc., up to Passing into Macedonia, help us. Truly the Lord is terrible in counsel above the sons of men. One promises to follow the Master in everything and is not allowed; another, commanded to follow, does not get the requested leave for burial of his father. Saul is drawn in, invincible and resisting. To Cornelius, persistent in prayers and alms, the way of salvation is shown as a reward, and God, who knows the hearts, removes the Teacher from Asia through the grace of a benefit, lest the error of a wicked heart be judged more severely for despised preaching if what is holy is given to dogs. Again, while another apostle cares elsewhere, a legate from Macedonia, whom we believe to be an angel of that nation, asks to be offered crumbs of the Lord's bread.
