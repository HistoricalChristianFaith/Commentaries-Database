“This vessel signifies the church,” endowed with an incorruptible faith, “for a moth, which corrupts other cloth, does not consume linen.” Therefore, whoever wishes to be part of the mystery of the Catholic church “should root out from his heart the corruption of evil” thoughts, “and in this way he may be incorruptibly strengthened in faith, so that he will not be consumed by perverse thoughts, like moths, in his mind.” Alternatively, the moth is a heretic, wishing to corrupt the Lord’s robe but unable to do so because the Lord does not permit it. This is also prefigured by the Lord’s tunic, which the soldiers did not presume to tear.

The four corners by which the linen sheet hangs down designate the four regions of the world to which the church extends, for it is “the city of our God on his holy mountain,” spreading sounds of joy to every land. [That the sheet] is lowered from heaven indicates that [the church] will be preserved as well as increased only by the grace of the Holy Spirit coming upon it. Hence John says in the Apocalypse, “I saw the holy city, the new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God.” Also, the four corners may be figures of the Evangelists, through whom the church is nourished and exalted with heavenly gifts.
