And there were with him about four hundred men. Those who remain firm in faith, acting manfully and strengthened in heart by the doctrine of the Gospel, which is marked by the most beautiful unity of the four books, are called to hope for, seek, and obtain the heavenly kingdoms. For the number one hundred, which, after so many numbers running on the left, first seeks the right hand, as has been often said, reveals the entrance of the higher kingdom once the lower labors are completed. It should be noted that the events that took place in the cave of Adullam, which we have explained to our ability, can be referred to the primitive church and also appropriately applied to the state of the whole Church. For what follows specifically pertains to our Church, that is, the Church of the Gentiles.
