And her spirit returned, and she immediately got up. Mark says it this way: And immediately the girl got up and walked. And spiritually it teaches that whoever recovers from the death of the soul with Christ strengthening him by the hand, ought not only to rise from the filth of vices, but also immediately progress in good deeds.

And He commanded that she be given something to eat. He ordered her to eat, given as a testimony of life resurrected, so that it would be believed as truth and not a phantom. But if someone has risen from spiritual death, it is necessary that they soon be satiated with heavenly bread, and of course become a partaker of the divine word and the sacred altar. For according to moral understanding, those three dead ones whom the Savior raised in the bodies signify three kinds of the resurrection of souls. Indeed, some by giving in to the consent of evil delight, with the sin's thought hidden, bring death upon themselves. But indicating that he brings such to life, the Savior raised the daughter of the synagogue leader, who was not yet carried outside but was dead inside the house, as if concealing vice secretly in the heart. Others, not only by consenting to noxious delight but also by performing the very evil they delight in, bring their dead almost outside the gates. And demonstrating that He brings these to repentance, He raised the young son of a widow carried out outside the gates and restored him to his mother. For He restored the soul repenting from the darkness of sin to the unity of the Church, as we have also taught before. However, some, not only by thinking or acting illicitly, but by the habit of sinning itself, almost corrupt themselves by burying. Yet, neither is the power and grace of the Savior less in raising them if there are solicitous thoughts watching over their health, as devoted sisters to Christ. For indicating this, He raised Lazarus, already four days in the tomb, and attested by his sister as already stinking. For the worst deeds often accompany a harmful reputation. It should be noted, however, that the more severe the death of the soul that comes upon it, the more persistent the fervor of repentance must be that it deserves to rise. Secretly wishing to show this, the Lord resurrects the dead girl lying in the room with a modest and gentle voice, saying: “Child, arise.” And because of the ease of resurrection, He denied that she had already died. The young man carried outside, He strengthens with more words so that he must revive, saying: “Young man, I say to you, arise.” But the one dead for four days, to be able to release the long-sealing tomb, Jesus groaned in spirit, troubled Himself, shed tears, groaned again, and cried with a loud voice: “Lazarus, come forth” (John 11). And thus at last, he who was in despair, with the weight of darkness dispelled, is returned to life and light. But it should also be noted that since public guilt requires a public remedy, but minor sins can be erased by lighter and private repentance, the girl lying in the house rises with few witnesses, who are also instructed not to divulge the miracle.
