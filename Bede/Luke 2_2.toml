This first census was made when Cyrenius was governor of Syria. And all went to be registered, each to his own city. This census taken during the time of Cyrenius is also mentioned by the illustrious Hebrew historian Josephus, in the eighteenth book of Antiquities, as follows: "Cyrenius, a man who through the consent of the Roman Senate ascended through various magistracies to the rank of consul, distinguished in other respects, came to Syria with a few companions, sent by Caesar to give law to the nations and also to be the censor of patrimonies." Therefore, the phrase: "This first census was made when Cyrenius was governor of Syria," indicates that this census was either the first of those which encompassed the entire world, because many parts of the lands are often recorded to have been described, or certainly the first it began then, when Cyrenius was sent to Syria. And as then, under the reign of Augustus and governance of Cyrenius, everyone went to be enrolled, each to his own city, so now under the rule of the Church presiders, that is, the teachers, indeed persuaded and promised rewards by Christ, let us all go, no one being excluded from the census of justice. Let us come to Him, who toil and burdened, and He will give us rest. Let us take His yoke upon us, and learn from Him for He is gentle and humble in heart, and we will find rest for our souls (Matt. XI). For this is our city and fatherland, namely the blessed and heavenly rest of souls, to which we were created by God Christ at the beginning of this nascent age, and to which we have been re-created by the man Christ at the end of the ages. To which, indeed, the city of peace and quietness we strive to go and offer treasures to our King, growing daily in the progress of virtue and faith, to behold the eternal joys of the heavenly light, and to despise both the prosperous and adverse things of the world for acquiring these, and having acquired them, to offer to God as a precious gift, cleansed from all defilement of flesh and Spirit (II Cor. VII). But if we more diligently inspect the type of coin that was paid to Caesar, we will also prove ourselves not lacking in devotion to purify it, which we can better search for and find from the Gospel itself, where, being tested about rendering tribute to Caesar, the Lord said: Show me the coin for the tribute. And they brought him a denarius. And Jesus said to them: Whose is this image and inscription? They said to him, Caesar's. Then he said to them: Render therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's (Luke XX). First, it must be noted that the denarius, which had ten coins, was paid to Caesar, titled with his image and inscription, which is even evident from the name. Next, it must be inferred that, by the Lord's command, things that are Caesar's should be rendered to Caesar, and things that are God's to God, diligently showing us also that we must offer to God our King the decalogue of the law in the likeness of the royal denarius, that is, with an entire heart to keep the love of God and neighbor, of which one, perceived by three, encompasses the other seven. In this sacred denarius of Scripture, marked with the ten heavenly commandments like gold coins, whoever knows to gaze upon the face and name of the eternal King, that is, the recognition of the divine will, will find it. Whatever one perfectly believes, hopes for, loves in the tablets of one's heart, is inscribed by the pen of diligent correction. And we carry this denarius with us, as if closed in a purse on the way, knowing how to say with the Psalmist: The light of your face is signed upon us, O Lord, you have given gladness in my heart (Psalm IV), yet we preserve that seal of faith and joy of hope and charity in our hidden meditation of conscience stored with God as witness. But arriving in the homeland to our King whose vision we thirst for, to behold him in his beauty with all the effort of virtue and the entire intention of the mind, we hasten to bring forth the good gifts of our good conversation, which were hidden on earth and shall be crowned in heaven, when what we said in the dark shall be spoken in the light, and what we spoke in the ear in closets shall be proclaimed on the housetops (Matt. X).
