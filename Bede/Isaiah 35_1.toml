After John was killed, the Lord saw the time drawing near and withdrew to a deserted place called Bethsaida. This teaches mystically that a deserted Judah, which had beheaded its prophets by not believing them, would later become fruitful in the desert of a church that possessed no man of the Word. Hence, the beautiful Bethsaida means “house of fruitfulness.” For it was about it that Isaiah said, “The desert and the dry land will rejoice, and the wilderness will exult and bloom like the lily,” and again, “they will see the glory of the Lord and the beauty of our God.”
