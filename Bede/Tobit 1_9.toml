He learned that Christ was to be born of his own kin, as Moses had said, “Your God will raise up for you a prophet like me from among your brethren; to him you shall listen”; and the Lord said to David, “One of the fruit of your womb I will set upon my throne.” He gave him his own name believing and confessing what the Father says of him, “And I will make him the firstborn,” as he says of the people themselves, “Israel is my firstborn son.”8“He taught him from his infancy to fear God and refrain from all sin,” believing and confessing that he would commit no sin and that no deceit would be found on his lips10 but that the spirit of the fear of the Lord would fill him.
