And he had a son named Saul, etc. For he who is of the earth is from the earth, and speaks of the earth: he who comes from heaven is above all; who did not commit sin, nor was deceit found in his mouth (John III; 1 Peter II). But also the name Saul, which means "desired" or "petition," most fittingly applies to Christ, who is always implored with great desire by the saints and is asked to be present. Likewise, the name of his father Cis, that is, "stern," also alludes to mysteries; whether it signifies God the Father, or David, or Abraham, or any other of the fathers, from whom Christ is according to the flesh. For that nature is stern, which not only cannot be conquered or changed, but also cannot be comprehended by any created nature. It is stern in the strictness of judgment to the reprobate, but through the grace of mercy is kind to the good. For it is said of these: “How good is God to Israel, to those who are pure in heart” (Psalm XXII)! But of those, it is said: “Your almighty word leapt down from heaven, from the royal throne, as a stern warrior into the midst of the land of destruction” (Wisdom XVIII); and in temptations, the faithful hearts of the good are stern, to whom under the guise of Ezekiel it is said: “Behold, I have made your face stronger than their faces, and your forehead stronger than their foreheads; like adamant, harder than flint have I made it” (Ezekiel III).
