But Peter followed from a distance, etc. Deservedly he followed from a distance, who was soon to deny him. For he could not have denied if he had clung closely to Christ. Yet in this, he is most greatly venerable to us with admiration because he did not leave the Lord even when he was afraid. For what he fears is due to nature; what he follows is due to devotion; what he denies is due to deception; what he repents of is due to faith. Another interpretation: Peter following the same Lord from a distance to the passion signified that the Church would indeed follow, that is, imitate the passion of the Lord, but from a far distance. For the Church suffers for itself, but He for the Church.

And he was sitting with the attendants and warming himself at the fire. There is the fire of love, and there is also the fire of desire. Of this it is said: I came to cast fire upon the earth, and what will I if it be already kindled (Luke 12)? But of that: They are all adulterers, like an oven heated by the baker (Hosea 7). This fire, descending upon the believers in the upper room of Zion, taught them to praise God in various languages. That fire kindled by the evil spirit in the courtyard of Caiaphas armed the harmful tongues of the faithless to deny and blaspheme the Lord. For what the malignant council was plotting inside the house of the high priest, this fire materially lit outside in the courtyard amidst the cold of the night, symbolically prefigured. Therefore, whoever extinguishes the evil and harmful fire in themselves can say with the prophet to the Lord: For I am become like a bottle in the frost; yet do I not forget thy statutes (Psalm 119). But those in whom the flame of love has been overwhelmed by the turbulent waters of vices hear from the Lord: Because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold (Matthew 24). At that cold moment, the Apostle Peter, numb from the cold, wished to warm himself by the coals of Caiaphas' attendants, because he sought the comfort of temporal ease by the company of the faithless. But soon, remembered by the Lord, he left behind both the physical fire of the wicked and the infidelity within his heart. And after the resurrection of the Lord, revived by the holy fire, he completely purged the sin of his threefold denial by the threefold confession of love. Then, upon that memorable catch of fish, when he came to the Lord with his fellow disciples, soon seeing the coals laid, and the fish laid on it and the bread, he was inflamed with the fire of love in the hidden chambers of his heart.
