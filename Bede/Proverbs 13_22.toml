A good man leaves an inheritance to his children, etc. We often see good men die without children, indeed promising greater rewards from the Lord to those who have preferred the chastity of virginity to the procreation of children, yet also the substance of the just being taken by sinners. For the Apostle glories in those who received the seizure of their goods with joy. Hence, it must be understood spiritually that the good and just Lord, who, after his passion ascending into heaven, left the apostles and their successors as heirs of his doctrine, to whose faith a multitude of peoples were converted, who were the substance of the devil. For he entered the house of the same wicked adversary and, breaking him with greater strength, plundered his arms in which he trusted and distributed his spoils, as he testifies in the Gospel. Or certainly, the substance of the sinner was kept for the just when the kingdom of God was taken from the Jews and given to a nation producing its fruits.
