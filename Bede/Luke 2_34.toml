And he said to Mary his mother: Behold, this child is set for the fall and rising of many in Israel, and for a sign that will be spoken against. Blessed indeed in the rising for he is the light, the glory of the people of Israel, as he said: I am the resurrection and the life: he who believes in me, though he were dead, shall live, and whoever lives and believes in me shall never die (John XI). But how is he set for the fall, except that he is also a stone of stumbling and a rock of offense? That is to say, a downfall to those who stumble upon the word and do not believe. Of whom he himself says: If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not be guilty of sin; but now they have no excuse for their sin (John XXII). He is set not only in himself, but also in his preachers for the fall and rising of many, as the Apostle testifies who says: For we are to God the aroma of Christ among those who are being saved and those who are perishing. To the one, we are an aroma that brings death; to the other, an aroma that brings life (II Cor. II). For whoever hears the word preached by the Apostle and follows it in love rises with a good aroma and is saved. Whoever follows it in hatred falls and perishes by the same aroma. But the sign that will be spoken against, understand as the faith in the Lord's cross. Of which the Apostle Paul says Jews: For as concerning this sect, it is known to us that it is spoken against everywhere (Acts XXVIII). And the Apostle himself: For we preach Christ crucified, to the Jews a stumbling block, and to the Greeks foolishness (I Cor. I).
