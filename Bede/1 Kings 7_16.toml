The tops of the pillars, that is, their highest part, are the hearts of faithful teachers whose God-centered thoughts guide all their actions and words as the head guides the members of the body. On the other hand, the two capitals that were placed on these pillar tops are the two Testaments, which holy teachers are totally bound both in mind and body to meditate and observe. It is appropriate, then, that both capitals were five cubits high because the Scripture of the Mosaic law comprises five books, and furthermore the entire collection of Old Testament writings embraces the five ages of the world. But the New Testament does not proclaim to us something different from what Moses and the prophets had said should be proclaimed: “If you believed Moses you would believe me, for he wrote of me.” For Moses wrote much about the Lord not only in figure but also quite plainly as when he relates what had been promised to Abraham in the Lord’s words: “In your seed shall the families of the earth bless themselves,” and when in his own words he says to the Israelites, “The Lord will raise up for you among your brothers a prophet like me; him you shall hear according to all things whatsoever he shall speak to you.” Of this prophecy the voice of the Father from heaven reminded the disciples when, as the Lord appeared to them in glory between Moses himself and Elijah on the holy mountain, it rang out, saying, “This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased; listen to him.” Therefore, with the admirable harmony of divine activity, the grace of the New Testament was hidden under the veil of the Old at first, but now the mysteries of the Old Testament are revealed by the light of the New, as if the reason why the capital of each of the two pillars was five cubits high was that it is manifest that the grace of the perfection of the gospel too is innate in the Old Testament whose mysteries are noted beforehand in the five books of the Law or are all comprised more fully in the five ages of the world; and so it happens that each eminent preacher, whether destined to be sent to the Jews or to the Gentiles, fortified with the harmonious testimony of the word of God, keeps the sure and correct rule of faith and conduct free from error, and in the course of his teaching he knows how to draw forth “out of his treasure house new things and old.” Not only do the Testaments harmonize with each other in their account of the divine mysteries, but also all the elect who are written about in the books of these Testaments are endowed with the one faith and are bound to each other by the same charity.
