And he said to them: "Is a lamp brought in to be put under a basket, or under a bed, and not to be set on a stand? For there is nothing hidden except to be made manifest; nor is anything secret except to come to light. If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear." Because he had previously said to the apostles and those who were with them: "To you has been given the mystery of the kingdom of God; but to those outside, everything is in parables," now he shows through them that the same mystery is to be revealed to others at some point as well, and that the hearts of all who are going to enter the house of God are to be illuminated by the flames of faith. With these words, he symbolically teaches the confidence of preaching, lest anyone hide the light of knowledge they know out of fear of physical discomforts. For with the terms ‘basket’ and ‘bed,’ he designates this present life and the flesh in which we live; but with the term ‘lamp,’ he designates the word by which we are enlightened. For since the time of our life is contained within a certain measure of divine provision, it is rightly compared to a basket. And who does not see that the body, in which the soul temporarily dwells and rests, can rightly be called a bed? Hence it is said to a certain healed person: "Rise, take up your bed, and go to your house" (Matthew 9). Which is clearly to say: Rise from the body of negligence; and raise up the body, in whose desires you lay for a long time, towards the practice of good works diligently: and thus enter the house of eternal habitation, where you will receive the rewards of good works. Therefore, whoever, out of love for this temporal life and carnal allurements, hides the word of God, covers the lamp with a basket or a bed, because they place the desires of the flesh above the revelation of truth, which they fear to proclaim. But he places the lamp on a stand, who subjugates his body to the service of God, so that the preaching of truth is superior, and the service of the body is inferior: yet through that very service of the body, the superior doctrine shines forth, which through bodily actions, that is, through voice and tongue and other movements of the body, is imparted to those learning through good works. Therefore, he places the lamp on a stand when the Apostle says: "I do not box as one beating the air, but I discipline my body and keep it under control, lest after preaching to others I myself should be disqualified" (1 Corinthians 9).
