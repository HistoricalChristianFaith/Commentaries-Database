When you go with your adversary to the ruler, on the way, make an effort to be delivered from him, lest perhaps he deliver you to the judge, and the judge deliver you to the officer, and the officer throw you into prison. These things, like the previous admonitions, teach us to trample the allurements of the world underfoot, and to await the coming of the fearful judge with constant expectation. Indeed, our adversary on the way is the word of God opposed to our carnal desires in this present life. One who submits himself humbly to its precepts is thereby delivered from it. Otherwise, he is given over to the judge, and the judge delivers him to the officer, because from the despised word of the Lord, the sinner shall be held guilty in the judgment. The judge delivers him to the officer because he permits him to be dragged by the evil spirit to punishment, so that the spirit may exact the compelled soul to punishment from the body, which voluntarily consented to guilt. The officer throws him into prison because he is thrust back into hell by the evil spirit until the day of judgment comes, from which point onwards he will be tortured along with it in the fires of hell.
