I tell you, you will not get out of there until you have paid the very last penny. That is, until you have paid for even the smallest sins. Because you will always be able to pay the penalties by suffering, but never able to obtain forgiveness in return (for there will be no place for forgiveness there), you will never come out from where you will bear the eternal penalties for your deeds.
