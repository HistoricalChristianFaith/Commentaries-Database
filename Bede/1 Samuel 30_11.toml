And they found an Egyptian man in the field, etc. The Catholic teachers hastening to engage in the battle with the heretics often find men abandoned by them, notable for the dark stain of their sins, unable to follow the teachers of error to devastate the Church due to the tenderness of their intellect; and they bring them to hear the Catholic faith, giving them the bread and water of the word; but they also add the sayings of preceding teachers, who, from the most beautiful tree of the present Church, as it were, from the fig tree, or severed at the brink of life and death, throughout the entire year of this current age which is now being lived, do not cease to preserve the mature memory of their teaching to refresh the souls of the faithful. And they well give a fragment of the dough, because they suggest not complete works to such people, but the sayings of the fathers deemed sufficient. They well give two clusters of grapes; because they show that they are to be united to Christ and the Church by the bonds of dual love.
