John shows quite clearly that those who want to have fellowship with God must first of all be joined to the church and there learn that faith and be blessed with its sacraments, which the disciples truly received during the time of Christ’s incarnation. Nor do those who believe the apostles’ testimony belong any less to the Lord than those who believed him when they heard him preaching in the flesh do, although there might be some distinction in the quality of the works of faith which they perform.
