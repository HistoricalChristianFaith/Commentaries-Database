But he, answering, said to his father: Behold, all these years I have served you, and I never disobeyed your command. The question arises how that people could be said to have never disobeyed God's command. But it is easily resolved that this was not said about every command, but about the one most necessary, by which they were commanded to worship no other God. Neither should this son be understood as representing all Israelites, but those who have never turned from the one God to idols. For although this son, placed as if in a field, desired earthly things, he desired these goods from the one God. This is also confirmed by the testimony of his father when he says: You are always with me. For he does not refute him as if he were lying, but approving his perseverance with him, invites him to the enjoyment of a greater and more delightful celebration.

And you never gave me a young goat so that I might celebrate with my friends. Certainly, a sinner is usually signified by the name of the young goat, but far be it from me to understand the Antichrist. For it is quite absurd that it is said to him. You are always with me, having wished this from the father, that he would believe in the Antichrist. Nor is it at all proper to understand this son in the people of the Jews, who are going to believe in the Antichrist. But how would he feast from that goat if he himself is the Antichrist, who would not believe in him? Or if this is to feast from the slaughter of the goat, which is to rejoice at the destruction of the Antichrist, how does the son, whom the father receives, say that this was not granted to him, when all the sons of God are going to rejoice at the damnation of that adversary? Surely, therefore, he complains that the Lord Himself is denied to him for joining, while he considers Him a sinner. For when the goat is of that nation, that is, when he considers Him a violator of the Sabbath and a transgressor of the law, he did not deserve to rejoice in His feasts. So that what he says: You never gave me a young goat so that I might celebrate with my friends, is as if he were saying, him who seemed a goat to me, you never gave me to feast upon, thus denying me him himself by that very thing by which he seemed a goat to me. But what he says, With my friends, either it is understood from the perspective of the leaders, with the people, or from the perspective of the people of Jerusalem, with the other peoples of Judea.
