Luke writes more clearly of how they appeared and what they spoke about with him. Luke says that Moses and Elijah were seen in majesty, and they spoke of his passing away which he was about to fulfill in Jerusalem. Moses and Elijah, who talked with the Lord on the mountain and spoke about his passion and resurrection, represent the revelations of the law and prophets that were fulfilled in the Lord.…It is appropriate that the Evangelist reported Moses and Elijah were “seen in majesty.” The mark of the favor with which they are to be crowned is shown by the preeminence of their majesty. It is also appropriately recorded that they spoke about his passing away, which was to be fulfilled in Jerusalem. To his faithful, the Redeemer’s passion has become a unique subject for praise. The more they remember that they could not have been saved apart from his grace, the more they should always ponder the greater memory of this grace in a faithful heart, and bear faithful witness to it.
