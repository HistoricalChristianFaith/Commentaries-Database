And it happened on one of the days, and he was sitting teaching, and there were Pharisees sitting, etc. Where the Lord, sitting and teaching, cured the paralytic when the scribes and Pharisees were sitting, Luke omits for brevity's sake, but Matthew and Mark, who narrate it, seem to question it. Since indeed Matthew testifies that he did this in his own city, and Mark in Capernaum. Which would be more difficult to resolve if Matthew also named Nazareth. Now, however, either Galilee itself, where Nazareth was, should be understood as the city of Christ, in distinction from the region beyond the sea of the Gerasenes, from which, crossing over, as Matthew writes, he came to Galilee. Or certainly Capernaum itself is called the city of Christ, which he made his own not by being born there, but by illuminating it with his miracles.
