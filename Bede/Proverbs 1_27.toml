When sudden calamity comes upon you, etc. He speaks of the sudden siege of Jerusalem, and the destruction of the whole province that was made by the Romans, which the Lord himself predicted in the Gospel, seeing the city and weeping over it (Luke XIX).

When distress comes upon you, etc. The Jews are not read to have called upon the Lord in that siege, but only to have relied on arms, although they witnessed the desolation of their homeland and the ruin of the temple with bitter minds. However, if some did call upon him then, because they refused to understand the guilt for which they were punished, to truly repent, they cried to him in vain whom they had despised. Therefore, they are rightly said to have endured tribulation with distress. For tribulation was in them, by which they were afflicted outwardly; distress, in that they found no consolation from God inwardly. On the contrary, the saints, when oppressed outwardly by adversity, expand in heart with certain hope of salvation, knowing that they are heard when they cry to him whose words they remember to have obeyed. Hence the prophet says: When I called, you answered me, O God of my righteousness, you enlarged me when I was in distress. This whole correction of wisdom can generally apply to all the reprobates, because in the day of judgment they will cry to the stern judge, asking for the gate of the kingdom to be opened to them, and they will not deserve to be heard. For what follows, In the morning they will rise, and will not find me; that very time of the final judgment openly designates when some will rise to eternal life, and others to eternal shame and contempt.
