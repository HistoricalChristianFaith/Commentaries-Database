While the Lord taught through his apostles, the people of the Jews—or those in their midst who were predestined to eternal life—lifted up their voice to confess the truth which they had up until recently denied and sought to bury. They wore away the contaminations of original sin as they cleansed themselves with their tears befitting repentance. They confessed both the justice and the kindness of the Lord and recalled the faults caused by their own malice, for they themselves had ferociously handed over to death the author of every kindness, but he had been given over to death unjustly, although he was omnipotent and wished to save his killers and give them life rather than to destroy them.
