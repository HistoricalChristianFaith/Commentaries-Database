Blessed is that servant whom, when the Lord comes, He finds so doing. Truly I say to you that He will set him over all His possessions. Just as there is a great difference in merits between good listeners and good teachers, so too is there in rewards. For when He comes and finds these watching, He will make them sit down to eat, and passing by, He will serve them. But those whom He finds faithfully and wisely dispensing the word of food to the family entrusted to them, He will set over all that He possesses, that is, over all the heavenly joys of the kingdom, not that they alone may hold the Lord, but that they may more abundantly enjoy eternal possession with the other saints. For those who are learned shall shine as the brightness of the firmament, and those who instruct many to righteousness as the stars for endless eternities (Dan. XII). And the Apostle says: The elders who rule well are worthy of double honor, especially those who labor in the word and doctrine (I Tim. V).
