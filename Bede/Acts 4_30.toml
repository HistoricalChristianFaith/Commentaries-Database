In that you stretch out your hand, healings and signs and wonders are done through the name of your holy Child Jesus. In Greek, it is rendered as “through the name of your holy Boy Jesus,” which seems to align more with the apostles’ wishes, who strove in every way to make it known that the man whom the Jews crucified, through the signs of miracles becoming evident by his name, having been taken up into heaven, should be recognized as the Son of God.
