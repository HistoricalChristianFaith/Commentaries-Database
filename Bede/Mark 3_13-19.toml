(in Marc. i. 16) After having forbidden the evil spirits to preach Him, He chose holy men, to cast out the unclean spirits, and to preach the Gospel; wherefore it is said, And he went up into a mountain, &c. (Luke 6)

(ubi sup.) For it was not a matter of their choice and zeal, but of Divine condescension and grace, that they should be called to the Apostleship. The mount also in which the Lord chose His Apostles, shows the lofty righteousness in which they were to be instructed, and which they were about to preach to men.

(ubi sup.) For as a sacrament of this the children of Israel once used to encamp about the Tabernacle, so that on each of the four sides of the square three tribes were stationed. Now three times four are twelve, and in three bands of four the Apostles were sent to preach, that through the four quarters of the whole world they might baptize the nations in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost. It goes on: And he gave them power, &c. That is, in order that the greatness of their deeds might bear witness to the greatness of their heavenly promises, and that they, who preached unheard-of things, might do unheard-of actions.

(ubi sup.) And the reason that the Lord willed that he should at first be called otherwise, was that from the change itself of the name, a mystery might be conveyed to us. Peter then in Latin or in Greek means the same thing as Cephas in Hebrew, and in each language the name is drawn from a stone. Nor can it be doubted that is the rock of which Paul spoke, And this rock was Christ. (1 Cor. 10:4) For as Christ was the true light, and allowed also that the Apostles should be called the light of the world, (Matt. 5:14.) so also to Simon, who believed on the rock Christ, He gave the name of Rock.

(ubi sup.) We must connect this with what went before, He goeth up into a mountain, and calleth.

For Andrew is a Greek name, which means 'manly,' from ἀνὴδ, that is, man, for he manfully adhered to the Lord. There follows, And Philip.

(ubi sup.) But Thaddæus is the same person, as Luke calls in the Gospel and in the Acts, Jude of James, for he was the brother of James, the brother of the Lord, as he himself has written in his Epistle. There follows, And Simon the Canaanite, and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him. He has added this by way of distinction from Simon Peter, and Jude the brother of James. Simon is called the Canaanite from Cana, a village in Galilee, and Judas, Scariotes, from the village from which he had his origin, or he is so called from the tribe of Issachar.
