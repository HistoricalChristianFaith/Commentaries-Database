When the Lord saw her, he was moved with compassion for her and said to her, "Do not weep." He said, "Cease to weep, as if for the dead whom you will soon see rising alive." Here, mystically, the doctrine of Novatian is confounded, who proudly boasted about his own purity, tries to nullify the humble purification of penitents, and denies that Mother Church should be consoled by the hope of life to be restored, weeping over the spiritual extinction of her reborn ones. And beautifully, the evangelist testifies that the Lord was first moved with compassion for the mother, and so revived the son, so that in one instance he showed us an example of imitable piety and in the other, confirmed faith in his wondrous power.
