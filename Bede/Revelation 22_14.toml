In the image of the white robes he is promising a worthy and suitable reward, namely, that of a pure and stainless life. Clearly [he promises this] in order that one might receive the vision of the Lord, who is eternal life. “Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.” “That they might enter the city by the gates.” Those who keep the commandments of the Lord, who said, “I am the door; if any one enters by me, he will be saved, and will go in and out and find pasture”46—these are the pastures that are also here promised, that is, the tree of life—these without doubt enter through the gates into the church, to be sure, through the gates of righteousness which the psalmist says are opened to him.“However, he who climbs in by another way, that man is a thief and a robber.”
