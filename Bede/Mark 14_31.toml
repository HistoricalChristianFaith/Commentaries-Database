Beautifully also does the Lord leadout His disciples, when they had tasted His Sacraments, into the mount of Olives, to show typically that we ought through the reception of the Sacraments to rise up to higher gifts of virtue, and graces of the Holy Spirit, that we maybe anointed in heart.
But the Lord foretells to His disciples what is about to happen to them, that when they have gone through it, they may not despair of salvation, but work out their repentance, and be freed. Wherefore there follows: “And Jesus saithunto them, All ye shall be offended because of Me this night.”.
This is written in different words in Zecharias, and in the person of the Prophet it is said to the Lord, “Smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered.”.
Peter then promised in the ardour of his faith, and the Saviour as God knew what was to happen. Wherefore it goes on: “And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, that this day, even in this night, before the cockcrow twice, thou shalt deny me thrice.”
