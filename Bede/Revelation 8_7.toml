The first trumpet of [the church’s] preaching reveals the universal destruction of the impious by fire and hail.… The foretelling of these plagues is rightly compared with a trumpet, which is the signal for battle. For, the Scripture says, “Lift up your voice as a trumpet; declare to my people their transgressions,” and elsewhere, “Set the trumpet to your lips, as an eagle over the house of the Lord.” That the punishment of Gehenna is the reward for works that spill blood is indicated by the voice of the preachers who say, “He will pass from the waters of the snow to very great heat.” It is possible that by the word blood the spiritual death of the soul is intended.
