Your brother has come, and your father has killed the fattened calf, because he received him safe and sound. Your brother was in the ends of the earth, but from there greater joy comes from those singing a new song to the Lord, for his praise from the ends of the earth (Ps. 47). And for him who was absent, that one was sacrificed to whom it was said: "And may your burnt offering be fat" (Ps. 19).
