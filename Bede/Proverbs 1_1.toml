The Parables of Solomon, etc. The Greek word Parables is translated as Similitudes in Latin; Solomon named this book so that we might understand its contents more deeply and not just according to the letter, in which he signifies that the Lord would sometimes speak to the crowds in parables. He also announces the everlasting kingdom of Christ and the Church, symbolized by his own name and the peaceful state of his reign; as it is written: His empire shall be multiplied, and peace shall have no end; upon the throne of David and over his kingdom (Isa. IX). Likewise, through the construction and dedication of the temple, he implies the edification of the holy Church, which will be dedicated forever at the time of the resurrection. For he himself is also said to be the son of David and the spiritual king of Israel, as testified by the crowds who came to meet him at Jerusalem with palm branches and praises (Matt. XXI).

For those things rightly called parables, because they are hidden, can also incongruously be called proverbs, because they are the kind of things that justly deserve to be frequently spoken of and retained in memory. And proverbs are often spoken so obscurely that they might not undeservedly be noted by the name of parables, the Lord himself attesting, who said: These things I have spoken to you in proverbs. The hour is coming when I will no longer speak to you in proverbs, but will tell you plainly of the Father (John XVI). The usefulness of Solomon's Parables is shown in the added title, when it says:
