My beloved put his hand through the opening. My beloved puts his hand through the opening when the Lord secretly and invisibly kindles us with the hidden spur of divine love toward virtuous acts. He puts his hand to us when, seeing us longing to rest, he recalls to our memory his work in us—not only that we are men but also that we belong to him. He extends his hand to remind us of his work on our behalf: He left the bosom of the Father to become human like us, not only to be incarnate and dwell on earth, making us spiritual and heavenly, but also to die so that we might live forever. Therefore, rightly, our heart trembles at his touch, for when our conscience recalls his merciful deeds, it is filled with awe, inspired by prophetic insight: "I have considered your works and was afraid" and hurries to aid in the salvation of others for whom God was incarnate and died. For by the name "womb" is often meant the heart because just as food is digested in the womb, so thoughts mature in the heart through diligent reflection. Thus, Jeremiah says, "My womb, my womb, I am in pain" (Jer. IV). What would it profit listeners if a teacher complained of pain in his stomach? But his intention was to greatly benefit them by testifying that his own conscience was troubled and filled with deep pain due to their rebellious acts. The term "womb" can also denote the softness and fragility of those who, either because they consider themselves less capable, tremble to undertake the duty of teaching, or because they delight in the ease of their rest, shy away. And the bride's womb trembled at the beloved’s touch when, moved by divine compunction, the weak in the Church shook off their sluggishness and aroused themselves to practice good works, rising up to advise others through preaching. This is precisely shown in the following phrase:
