On the first day of unleavened bread, when they sacrificed the Passover, the disciples said to Him: Where do You want us to go and prepare for You to eat the Passover? He calls the first day of unleavened bread the fourteenth day of the first month when, having cast away the leaven, they used to sacrifice the Passover, that is, kill the lamb in the evening. Explaining this, the Apostle says: For even Christ our Passover has been sacrificed (I Cor. V). Although He was crucified on the following day, that is on the fifteenth moon, yet on this night when the lamb was sacrificed, He handed over to His disciples the mysteries of His body and blood to be celebrated, and being captured and bound by the Jews, He hallowed the beginning of His own sacrificing, that is, of His passion.
