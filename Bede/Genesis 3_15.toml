I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your seed and her seed. The seed of the woman is the entire human race, the seed of the devil are the betrayers, who are depraved with his example of pride and rebellion. His seed is a perverse suggestion; the seed of the woman is the fruit of good work, by which the perverse suggestion is resisted. The enmity mentioned between this serpent and his seed, and how much the human race endures this enmity, and how much enmity all the elect exercise against him by living rightly, is clearer than the sun to all the faithful. A sign of this enmity appears even in the nature of the irrational serpent, which, because of the innate pestilence of its venom, exists always as an enemy to all living creatures and beasts of the earth: it is to be believed that from the time of this curse, and not before, this was implanted in it.

She will crush your head, and you will lie in wait for her heel. The woman crushes the head of the serpent, when the holy Church detects and scatters the devil’s wiles and toxic suggestions from the very start, and as if trampling on him, reduces him to nothing. She crushes the serpent's head when she resists the pride through which Eve was deceived, often humbling under God’s mighty hand: for the beginning of all sin is pride. The serpent lies in wait for her heel, because the devil, circling around the Church like a roaring lion, seeks whom he may devour, how he may overthrow the steps of our good actions. He lies in wait for the heel, when he tries to snatch us at the end of this present life. For the heel, which is the end of the body, not unjustly designates the end of our life, which both are also figuratively announced by the condition of the serpent, who is accustomed to be crushed by all who have the power, and he himself does not cease lying in wait to strike the heels of men.
