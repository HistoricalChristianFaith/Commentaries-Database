The sons of Cush: Seba, and Havilah, and Sabta, and Raamah and Sabteca. Seba from whom came the Sabeans. As Virgil says: "The incense-bearing branch belongs to the Sabeans. The air is scented with Sabean frankincense." Havilah from whom came the Getuli, living in the remote part of Africa adjacent to the desert. Sabta from whom came the Sabtaeni, now called the Astabori. Raamah and Sabteca gradually lost their ancient names; and what they are now called is unknown. However, from the vision of Tyre mentioned by Ezekiel, where he says the merchants of Sheba and Raamah, or as the LXX interpreters said, Regma, were your traders, it seems that these people also made their nation, and since Sheba is mentioned, it indicates that its region is neighboring to this province.

The sons of Seba: Raamah and Dedan. This Seba is written with the letter Sin, but above it was written with Samech, from which we said the Sabeans were named. Therefore, Seba is now interpreted as Arabia. In the seventieth psalm, where we have "The kings of Arabia and Sheba will offer gifts" (Psalm 71:10), in Hebrew it is written "The kings of Seba and Sheba," the first name with Sin and the second with Samech (which is similar to our letter S). Dedan is a nation of Ethiopia in the western region.
