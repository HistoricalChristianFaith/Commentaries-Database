And he said to them: When you pray, say: Father, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Give us this day our daily bread; and forgive us our sins, as we ourselves forgive everyone who is indebted to us. And lead us not into temptation. According to the evangelist Matthew, the Lord's Prayer seems to contain seven petitions. Of which in three eternal things are requested, in the remaining four, temporal things, which nevertheless are necessary for the sake of attaining the eternal. For what we say: Hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come; thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven; which some have not absurdly understood as in spirit and body, must be retained entirely without end, and begin here, and the more we progress, are increased in us: and perfectly (which is to be hoped for in the other life) they will always be possessed. But what we say: Give us this day our daily bread; and forgive us our debts, as we also forgive our debtors; and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil; who does not see that it pertains to the need of the present life? Thus, in that eternal life, where we always hope to be, both in the sanctification of the name of God, and his kingdom, will remain perfectly and immortally in our spirit and body. But daily bread is called so, because it is necessary here as much as should be given to soul and flesh, whether understood spiritually or corporeally, or both ways. Here too is the forgiveness we seek, where there is the commission of all sins. Here are the temptations, which allure or drive us to sin. Finally, here is the evil, from which we desire to be delivered. But in that life, there is none of these. The evangelist Luke, in the Lord's Prayer, not seven, but five petitions are comprised. Nor did he differ from the other, undoubtedly, but by how these seven are understood, he recommended by their brevity. For the name of God is hallowed in the spirit, but the kingdom of God is to come in the resurrection of the flesh. Therefore, showing that Luke considered the third petition to be a kind of repetition of the two preceding ones, he made it more understood by omitting it. Then he adds those three, concerning the daily bread, the forgiveness of sins, and the avoidance of temptation. And what the former put at the end: But deliver us from evil, the latter did not include for us to understand that it pertains to what was said above about temptation. Therefore, he indeed said: but deliver; he did not say: and deliver, as if demonstrating it to be one petition, saying not this, but that, so that everyone may know that he is delivered from evil, by not being led into temptation.
