When evening came, he arrived with the twelve. And as they reclined and ate, Jesus said, "Truly I tell you, one of you will betray me, the one who is eating with me." He who had foretold of the passion, also foretells of the betrayer, giving a place for repentance, so that when he understood that his thoughts and the secrets of his conscience were known, he might repent of his deed. And yet he does not designate him specifically, so that, being openly accused, he would not become more impudent. He places the crime within the number, so that the guilty one might act with repentance.
