And when he was twelve years old, as they went up to Jerusalem according to the custom of the feast day, and having completed the days as they returned, the boy Jesus remained in Jerusalem. The one who, from birth, indeed from human conception, was approved by clear signs of miracles showing that he is God, even then, as soon as the time of age was appropriate, began reverently to reveal and open both his natures, namely, what in truth of divine majesty belonged to the Father, and what, according to the frailty of human assumption, belonged to the mother. Nor without foresight did he reveal the first rudiments of his faith at twelve years old, which by the ministry of the twelve apostles was to be revealed and elucidated throughout the world. We can also say this, that as with the number seven, similarly the number twelve, which consists of the multiplied parts of seven, may designate the totality and perfection of things or times. And for this reason, that it is fitting for all places or times to be occupied, the light rightly takes its beginning from the number twelve. Therefore, it is not idly said that he appeared to have been unmindful of his parents, but that he instructs us, because not only before his own parents, but even before Abraham was made, he is, he delights rather to reside in the city and temple of God, as if by paternal right.
