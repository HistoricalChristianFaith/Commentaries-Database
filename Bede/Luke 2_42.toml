Now that the Lord came up every year to Jerusalem at the Passover, betokens His humility as a man, forit is, man's duty to meet together to offer sacrifices to God, and conciliate Him with prayers. Accordingly the Lord as man, did among men what God by angels commended c men to do. Hence it is said, According to the custom of the feast day.
