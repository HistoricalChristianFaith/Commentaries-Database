When therefore David heard in the desert that Nabal was shearing his sheep, etc. When the Lord, conversing in the world in man, heard that the learned in the law were preparing their hearers either to cleanse themselves from sins or to offer their own for the Lord, as if with the fitting scissors of practice, He sent His most valiant disciples, namely the heralds of the heavenly denarius to be attained, whose youth had been renewed like the eagle in baptism, and said to them: Ascend into the recognition of circumcision, open in the progresses of virtues and doctrine, show that you truly know and have ascended the height of spiritual chastity: and by doing this you will come to the very teachers of the law, and also evangelists announcing salvation from my name, which I am called and am the Savior, to those future heavenly in peace, saying: Let there be peace to all who by believing in the name of God the Father wish to be brothers of Christ, let there also be peace to you converted in pious society to the same faith; nay, and to all whom you have taught, and to all that you do, peace. That is, the peace which made both one and broke down the middle wall of partition, the enmities in His flesh (Ephesians II).
