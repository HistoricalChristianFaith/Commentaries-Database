According to the historical sense, this shows that the manâ€™s mature age [made him] invincible to detractors. Allegorically, however, [the passage signifies that] that people of Israel not only despised the manna and sought the base things of Egypt for the forty years in the desert, but even in the land of promise they continued always to limp along with the rites of idols together with those of the Lord. Or, if the number forty signifies the fullness of the twofold law (for four times ten makes forty), a transgressor of both, as it were by lying enfeebled, transcends a fortyfold perfection.
