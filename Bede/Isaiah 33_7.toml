But if you want to see that the ancient prophets were terribly sad and aggrieved about the future blinding of their nation, which was the cause of our illumination, listen to Isaiah, for when he was sent to announce beforehand the grace of the Lord’s coming, saying that “a light has arisen upon those who dwell in the region of the shadow of death,” he responded immediately to the advent of the same light, saying “you have enlarged the nation; you have not increased its joy.” And elsewhere, while commemorating the despondency of this people, Isaiah said, among other things, “the messengers of peace will weep bitterly, referring to the prophetic heralds of the divine word.”
