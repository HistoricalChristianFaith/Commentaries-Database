And the scribes and Pharisees began to consider, saying, "Who is this who speaks blasphemies? Who can forgive sins but God alone?" The scribes speak the truth, because no one can forgive sins except God, who also forgives through those to whom He has granted the power to forgive. And therefore Christ is proved to truly be God, because He can forgive sins as God. They truly bear witness to God, but by denying the person of Christ, they are deceived. Thus, the Jews err, who believe that Christ is both God and capable of forgiving sins, but do not believe that Jesus is the Christ. But the Arians err much more foolishly, who, though conquered by the words of the Gospel that Jesus is the Christ and is able to forgive sins, do not dare to deny it, yet nevertheless do not fear to deny that He is God. But He, desiring to save the unfaithful, and by the knowledge of hidden things and the power of His works, manifests that He is God.
