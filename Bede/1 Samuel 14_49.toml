Now, the sons of Saul were, etc. The three sons of Saul represent great leaders of the Catholic faith, which proclaims one God in three persons. Since they are what they are not by their own virtue but by the grace of God, and because they desire to enjoy the eternal vision of their Creator (to whom it is said, "But you are the same" [Psalm CVIII]), and because they trust that through Christ Jesus, the true King and Savior, they will be saved and reign forever; rightly the first son is interpreted as the gift of the dove, the second as I have desired, and the third as my King, my salvation. His two daughters indicate weaker members of the faithful devoted to God in body and mind; or certainly, the firstborn daughter holds the image of the synagogue, while the younger holds the image of the Church. The etymology of the names of the daughters is also fitting; for the Synagogue of the elect is not gathered from all nations broadly, but from the multitude of the Israelite lineage alone: the Church, however, is called to faith from all nations. Rightly, the firstborn daughter is said to be interpreted as from the multitude, and the second as from all. Saul's wife Achinoam, which is interpreted as the beauty of the brother, figuratively signifies the perfection of the Catholic Church, which is often called in the Song of Love, the sister and the beauty of its Creator, who deigned to become her brother through the mystery of incarnation. Abner, the chief of his army, who is called the lamp of the father, indicates either John the Baptist, who was a burning and shining lamp (John V), or all men of virtue who shine with singular height among the defenders of the Church. We should certainly remind the reader that not always do the same persons hold the same manner of typological figures, but as the circumstances of the surrounding matters change, the types and orders of figures change according to time and place.
