From this, the Son of Man will be sitting at the right hand of the power of God. Therefore, if in Christ, O Jew, pagan, and heretic, contempt, weakness, and the cross are an insult, see that through these the Son of Man will sit at the right hand of God the Father, and being born as a human from the virgin's birth, he will come in his majesty with the clouds of heaven. Hence the Apostle, when he described the abasement of the cross, added, saying: For which reason also God exalted him, and gave him a name above every name, that in the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of those in heaven, on earth, and under the earth, and every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is in the glory of God (Philipp. II).
