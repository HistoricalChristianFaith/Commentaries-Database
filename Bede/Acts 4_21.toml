Because all were praising for what had been done. It is better in Greek: "For all were glorifying God for what had been done." And what in our Codices is added, "for what had happened," is not in the Greek. Indeed, "glorifying" and "praising" are often interchangeably translated from the same Greek, which is "ἐδόξαζον," but there is a difference between a deed being praised and God being praised or glorified in the deed. For a deed or word to be praised is to be spread to the knowledge of many by fame, which can also happen with human deeds remarkably done; but for God to be praised or glorified in the deeds of men is specific to Christian piety and humility, with Him commanding and saying: "Let your good deeds shine before others, that they may see your good works and glorify your Father who is in heaven" (Matt. V).
