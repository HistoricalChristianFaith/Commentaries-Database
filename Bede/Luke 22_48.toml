But Jesus said to him: Judas, do you betray the Son of Man with a kiss? He says, do you betray the Son of Man because it is the flesh, not the divinity, that is seized. However, it rebukes the ungrateful all the more because he betrayed him who, though he was the Son of God, nevertheless wanted to be the Son of Man because of us. And it is as if he is saying: Ungrateful one, do you betray what I took on because of you? Certainly, it should be pronounced interrogatively, as if with the affection of someone who loves, he rebukes the betrayer. Judas, do you betray the Son of Man with a kiss? That is, with the symbol of love you inflict a wound, with the duty of charity you shed blood, with the instrument of peace you impose death; the servant betrays the Lord, the disciple the master, the chosen one the author?
