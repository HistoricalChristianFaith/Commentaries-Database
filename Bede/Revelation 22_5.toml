[In the city above] the weakness of our bodies will require neither the quiet of night nor the light of a fire. For then God will be all in all, namely, he who is the true light and the eternal rest of the saints. One might also interpret these words figuratively. The exhortation of the prophets and the preaching of the divine Law will not be necessary there, for these are now said to be lights in a dark place. But then, when all things have been fulfilled, the promise will be perfected in the vision and contemplation of God.
