Indeed, the Son of Man came to seek and to save what was lost. This is what he says elsewhere: "I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners" (Matt. IX). The merciful Teacher certainly does not disdain to explain his mysteries to the murmuring crowds, showing clearly that the repentance of sinners is not to be despised, as the Son of God himself was sent to earth especially for this reason. To remind us of his compassionate governance, he frequently calls himself the Son of Man, diligently reinforcing to us that he became benignly for us.
