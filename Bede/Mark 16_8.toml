In Marc., 4, 40: As then the women hew the great fervency of their love, by coming very early in the morning to the  sepulchre, as the history relates, according to the mystical sense an exampleis given to us, that with a shining face, and shaking off the darkness of wickedness, we may be careful to offer the fragrance of good works and the sweetness of prayer to the Lord.
Or else, by this phrase is meant the first day from the day of sabbaths, or rests, which were kept on the Sabbath. There follows: “And they said among themselves, Who shall roll us away the stone from the door of the sepulchre?”Severianus, Chrysologus: Your breast was darkened, your eyes shut, and therefore ye did not before see the glory of the opened sepulchre. It goes on: “And they looked, and saw that the stone was rolled away. "I goes on: “For it was very great.”Severianus, Chrysologus: Great indeed by its office rather than its size, for it can shut in and throw open the body of the Lord.
Now they saw a young man sitting on the right side, that is, on the south part of the place where the body waslaid. For the body, which was lying on its back, and had its head to the west, must have had its right to the south.Severianus, Chrysologus: Again, they saw a young man sitting on the right, because the Resurrection has nothing sinister in it. They also see him dressed in a long white robe; that robe isnot from mortal fleece, but of living virtue, blazing with heavenly light, not of an earthly dye, as saith the Prophet, “Thou deckest thyself with light as with a garment;”
