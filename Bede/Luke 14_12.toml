And he said also to the one who had invited him: When you give a luncheon or a dinner, do not call your friends, nor your brothers, nor your relatives, nor your rich neighbors. He does not forbid celebrating feasts with brothers, friends, and the rich, as if it were a crime, but shows that, like other necessary human commerce, where even sinners lend to sinners to receive equal returns, such actions are of no value in acquiring the rewards of heavenly life. Finally, he adds:

Lest perhaps they also invite you in return, and it may become for you a recompense. He does not say, "And it may become a sin for you," but he says, "And it may become for you a recompense." Like what he says elsewhere: "If you do good to those who do good to you, what grace is there to you?" (Luke 6). He does not say here, "It is a sin for you," but, "What grace is there to you?" Since even sinners do this.

Finally, they are counted among the works of darkness by the Apostle. As he says, "Let us walk properly as in the day, not in revelries and drunkenness" (Rom. 13). Indeed, revelries are luxurious banquets which are celebrated either by everyone's contribution or are usually hosted in turns by companions, such that no one is ashamed to say or do anything dishonorable, because it is convened for disgraceful things to be done there, stimulated by an abundance of wine and various pleasure of lust.
