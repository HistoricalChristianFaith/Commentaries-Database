And he ran to Eli, etc. Christ, called by the Father, who was always in him, to contemplate the miracles of his eternal majesty, responds that he will remain eternally with the Father by divine presence; and among these, suddenly appearing in human flesh, he speaks to the teachers of the Jews: And he himself, whom you sought for so long, and desired to come in the flesh, who was often called by the prayers and vows of the faithful for the salvation of the world, I myself have come, I who spoke, behold, here I am.

He said, "I did not call," etc. The Scribes and Pharisees deny that they sought the coming of Christ; at whose birth, upon hearing, not only King Herod was troubled, but also all Jerusalem with him. And they instructed to sleep again in the temple the one whom, having repulsed from their disbelief, they sent back to reveal the secrets of the father's child. However, when he was a young man, that is, after the thirtieth year of his age, some from their number believed him to be the Son of God. And this is similar to how Eli, after the third coming of Samuel to him, understood that the Lord was calling him; after the third decade of his years, the Jews knew and believed that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God.
