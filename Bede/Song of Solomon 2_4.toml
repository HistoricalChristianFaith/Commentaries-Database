We ought to love God in the first place, enemies in the last; and the measure of love that ought to be weighed out to our neighbors will vary according to the diversity of their merits. We know that the patriarch Jacob, although he loved all his sons, nevertheless loved Joseph more than the rest because of his singular innocence, as Scripture bears witness. Hence the church says pleasingly of Christ in the Song of Songs: “He brought me into the wine chamber, he set charity in order in me.”
