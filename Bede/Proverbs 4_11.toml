I will lead you in the paths of equity, etc. Paths, that is, actions of equity, while they begin, seem narrow and strait; but when they take progress, already by habit they seem spacious and broad, as the Psalmist testifies, who when he began told the Lord, Because of the words of your lips I stayed strong in the hard paths (Psalm XVI), but afterward, already making progress, he sang, I have run the way of your commandments, when you enlarged my heart (Psalm CXVIII). And therefore, even if the paths of equity seem narrow when you begin to enter them, once entered, the steps of your mind will not be constrained; but you will find that which the Lord says: His yoke is easy, and His burden is light (Matthew XI). For indeed, the reprobate in this life enter a broad way, but on the last day, with feet and hands bound, they will be cast into darkness (Matthew XXII); while the feet of the elect will be directed into the way of peace.
