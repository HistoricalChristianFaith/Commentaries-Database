Take away the iniquity of your servant, etc. Wash me more, he says, from my injustice, and cleanse me from my sin (Psalm 51). For I believe and confess without any doubt, that when the plans of the persecutors are suppressed and defeated, God the Father, who alone is sufficient to save and protect the world from the evil one, will multiply far and wide the people consecrated by your faith.
