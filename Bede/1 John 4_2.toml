It is to be understood that the word confesses here includes not merely the profession of an orthodox faith but also the practice of the good works which ought to accompany faith. If it were not so, then there would be some heretics, many schismatics and many pseudo-orthodox who would confess that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh but who would deny that confession by their behavior, for they have no love. For it was the love of God toward us which induced his Son to come in the flesh. God showed his love to us not in words but in deeds, not by talking but by loving.
