“A savior who is Christ the Lord has been born to you today in the city of David.” It is good that [the angel] said “has been born today” and did not say “this night,” for with heavenly light he appeared to those who were conducting the watch by night and brought the good news that day was born, namely, the one concerning whom the psalmist foretold, saying, “Announce well his salvation day from day.” Indeed the salvation of God, that is, the Lord Jesus, is “day from day” because he who appeared temporally in the city of David as a human being from a virgin mother was, in truth, himself born before all time and without spatial limitation, light from light, true God from true God. Because, therefore, the light of life rose for those of us dwelling in the region of the shadow of death, the herald of this rising suitably says, “A savior has been born to you today,” so that being always advised by this word we may recollect that the night of ancient blindness is gone past and the day of eternal salvation has drawn near, and “let us cast off the works of darkness.” And let us walk as children of light, “for the fruit of the light, as the same apostle [Paul] says, is in all justice and holiness.”
