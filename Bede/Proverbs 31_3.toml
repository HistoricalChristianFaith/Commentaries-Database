Do not give your substance to women. The sense of the letter is clear, but we are also forbidden to contaminate the substance of our virtues with the corruptions of vices.

And your riches to destroy kings. He gives his riches to destroy kings, who corrupts the hearts of men with earthly delights, so that they do not seek the heavenly goods, in which they can reign perpetually with Christ. For kings are destroyed by riches, when anyone joined to the body of the highest King through faith, nonetheless deserves to be eradicated from the land of the living by the allurements of the world. Do not give wine to kings, O Lemuel, do not give wine to kings. And the following things are clear according to the letter. But allegorically it commands not to intoxicate the minds of the faithful, who are members of the eternal King, with wine in which there is luxury; because there is no secret where drunkenness reigns; nothing about secrets is considered where carnal pleasure reigns; but only carnal things, which are visible, are scrutinized.
