Answering they say to him: Where, Lord? He said to them: Where the body is, there the eagles will be gathered. Two Saviors were asked, where the good will be taken, and where the evil will be left, he said one thing, but left another to be understood. For by asserting that the saints will be with him, obviously the reprobates will be separated from his vision, and therefore they will be condemned nowhere else than with the devil, he implies. Therefore, wherever the Lord will be in body, the elect will be gathered there, who by imitating his passion and humility, are as if filled with his flesh, whose youth, like eagles, will be renewed in the resurrection (Psalm 103). It also harmonizes with the efforts of those who thirst to contemplate the glory of the supreme majesty with their whole mind, as the eagle surpasses other birds in flight and joyfully fixes its eyes on the sun's rays. It also fits that, for the protection of its nests, the eagle is accustomed to bring a resisting stone so that perhaps a serpent may not approach, or dare to touch its chicks or eggs. Because evidently every wise person, to defend his actions and thoughts from the incursion of the ancient serpent, needs to always keep in his heart that stone, cut from the mountain without hands, which laid waste to the devil's kingdom (Daniel 2), that is, the faith and love of Christ.
