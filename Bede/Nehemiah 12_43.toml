For on that day of perpetual light about which Zechariah said, “And there shall be one day that is known to the Lord, not day or night” (that is, a day that is remote from the usual experience of passing time), the elect sacrifice great victims to the Lord, namely, those about which the psalmist, tasting them in the hope of things to come, said, “You have broken my bonds; I will offer to you the sacrifice of praise.” He properly also reveals where he was hoping that he would offer this sacrifice when he immediately adds, “I will pay my vows to the Lord in the courtyards of the Lord’s house, in the sight of all his people, in the midst of you, O Jerusalem.” For we pay our vows to the Lord in the midst of Jerusalem in the sight of all his people when, in the heavenly homeland, after the whole multitude of the saints has congregated, we offer those praises of thanksgiving to him whom in this present life we sigh for and thirst for with daily desire.
