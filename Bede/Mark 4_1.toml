And again he began to teach by the sea. If we look at the Gospel of Matthew, it is clear that this teaching of the Lord by the sea took place on the same day as the previous sermon celebrated in the house. For when that sermon was finished, Matthew immediately added, saying: On that day Jesus went out of the house and sat by the sea, and large crowds gathered around him, etc. (Matthew XIII). Not only the deeds and words of the Lord, but also the journeys and places where he performs miracles and preaches, are full of heavenly mysteries. After giving a sermon in a house, where he was said to have a demon, he began to teach by the sea, to show that, having abandoned Judea because of the fault of unbelief, he would go to save the Gentiles. Indeed, the proud and unbelieving hearts of the Gentiles are rightly likened to the swollen and bitter waves of the sea. Who does not know that the house of the Lord was an unbelieving Judea? But, having left the house in which he suffered the blasphemies of the wicked, he began to teach by the sea, because, having abandoned the Synagogue due to its unbelief, he came to gather the multitude of the Gentile people through the apostles. Hence it is aptly first put forward that while he was preaching in the house, his mother and brothers stood outside and were not recognized by him, and thus, leaving the house, he went to teach by the sea, because after the Synagogue fixed itself firmly outside on the preservation of the letter and preferred to put the figures of the law before the inner secrets of the faith of the Lord, the Lord conferred the sacraments of salvation, which it had rejected, to the foreign nations throughout the world.
