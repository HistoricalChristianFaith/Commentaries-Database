And there is no salvation in any other. If salvation is in no other, but only in Christ, then the fathers of the Old Testament were saved by the same Redeemerâ€™s incarnation and passion, in which we believe and hope to be saved. And though the sacraments may differ according to the times, yet the same faith agrees. For the dispensation of Christ, which we know to have been accomplished through the apostles, they learned through the prophets would come. For there is no redemption of human captivity except in the blood of Him who gave Himself as a ransom for all.
