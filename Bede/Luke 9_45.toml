But they did not understand this saying. This ignorance of the disciples arises not so much from slowness as from love, because they, still being carnal and ignorant of the mystery of the cross, could not believe that he, whom they knew as the true God, could die. And because they were accustomed to hear him frequently speaking in figures, they thought even those things which he spoke concerning his being delivered up referred figuratively to something else.
