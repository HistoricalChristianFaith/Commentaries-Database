However, a certain Samaritan, as he was traveling, came near him, and seeing him, was moved with compassion. The Samaritan, which means "guardian," signifies the Lord, about whom the prophet most rightly prays, so that he may not fall upon these robbers. He says, "Guard me from the snare they have set for me, and from the traps of those who work iniquity" (Psalm 140). Who, for us men and for our salvation, descending from heaven, undertook the journey of this present life, and came near to him who was languishing with inflicted wounds, that is, being made in the likeness of men and found in human form (Philippians 2), became close to us by taking on our compassion and was made a neighbor through the consolation of mercy.
