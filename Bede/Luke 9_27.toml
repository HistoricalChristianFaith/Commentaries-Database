But I tell you truly, there are some standing here who will not taste death before they see the kingdom of God. The kingdom of God in this place is called the present Church; and because some of the disciples were to live in the body to such an extent that they would see the Church of God constructed and raised against the glory of this world, it is now said with a comforting promise: There are some standing here who will not taste death before they see the kingdom of God. But since the Lord was giving so many precepts of undergoing death, what was necessary that He suddenly came to this promise? Except that something also had to be promised to the unlearned disciples concerning the present life, so that they could be more firmly established in the future, for which He promised them to see the kingdom of God on earth, so that this might be more faithfully presumed by them in heaven. But if we wish to accept the kingdom of God in this sentence as the future blessedness in heaven, even this some of those standing there saw not many days later on the mountain, namely so that by the contemplation of enduring joy, even if briefly experienced, they might more modestly endure the adversities of the passing present age. With a most fitting word, indeed, He testifies that the saints taste death, by whom the death of the body is, of course, tasted by sipping, and the life of the soul is held by possessing.
