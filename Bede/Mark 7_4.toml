It is a superstitious tradition of men to wash frequently before eating bread, once washed, and not to eat unless they baptize themselves from the market. But the doctrine of truth is necessary, which orders those who wish to participate with the bread of life descending from heaven to often cleanse their works with the washing of alms, tears, and other fruits of righteousness, so that they may be able to communicate with heavenly mysteries with a pure heart and body. It is necessary to purge the defilements that anyone has contracted from the cares of temporal business with the following diligence of good thoughts and acts, if he desires to enjoy the feasts of internal refreshment. But the Pharisees, taking the spiritual words of the prophets carnally, which commanded them concerning the chastisement of heart and works, saying: Wash yourselves, be clean, and be purified, you who bear the vessels of the Lord (Isa. I), these only observed the washing of the body. But Pharisees in vain, all Jews in vain, wash their hands, and are baptized from the market, as long as they despise being washed by the fountain of the Savior. In vain do they keep the baptisms of vessels, who neglect to cleanse the filth of their hearts and bodies: since it is certain that Moses and the prophets who ordered the vessels of the people of God to be either washed with water, or purged by fire, or sanctified with oil for whatever reason, did not command in this the cleansing of material things, but rather the chastisement and holiness of minds and works, and the salvation of souls.
