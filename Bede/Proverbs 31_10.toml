Thus far the words of Lemuel. Hence the wisest of kings, Solomon, celebrates the praises of the holy Church in a few verses, but with the fullest truth. For it is established that the same poem consists of 22 verses, according to the order and number of the Hebrew letters, so that each verse begins with distinct letters. By the most perfect order of this alphabet it is typically indicated how extensively the virtues and rewards of either each faithful soul or the whole holy Church, which is completed from all chosen souls as one catholic, are here described.

Who can find a strong woman? etc. The strong woman is called the Catholic Church: a woman, namely, because she customarily gives birth to spiritual children to God through water and the Holy Spirit; strong, because she despises all adversities and prosperities of the world for the faith of her Creator, whom, when He appeared in the flesh, He found weak, but by His finding, that is by His pious visitation, made her strong. Hence, after His redemption returning to the heavens, rejoicing with the heavenly citizens, He said: "Rejoice with me, because I have found my sheep which was lost" (Luke 15). Therefore, seeing the human race entangled in innumerable errors, and that for its salvation, no patriarch, no prophet, no elect at all was sufficient, except the only Mediator of God and men, Solomon said: "Who can find a strong woman? Her price is far above rubies." As if he openly, admiringly, confessed the future grace of the Lord, saying, "Who is of such virtue, who of such merit, who from so many unbelieving and wicked nations of the world would gather one Church of the elect for himself, which by His grace He makes strong and invincible against all adversaries? Surely, no one similar to us, nor is anyone in our time coming, but at the end of the ages, God is descending from heaven as man, who redeems us by His passion. This is what he says, "Her price is far above rubies." Far, indeed, in the state of time, which intervened from the days of Solomon up to the birth of the Virgin. However, from the utmost ends, because "His going forth is from the end of heaven" (Psalm 19), He who offered nothing else for our redemption but himself. Whence the Apostle says, "Who loved us, and gave himself for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling aroma" (Ephesians 5). And although it can rightly be understood this way, that the price of the holy Church was placed far off, because the incarnation, the conversation of the Word of God among men, passion and resurrection were far removed from the condition of our nature; for He, when He willed, was born from whichever mother He willed, and lived sinlessly in the world; and when He willed, and by whichever death He willed, He departed from the world. He also had in His power the time of His resurrection and ascension, and things of this sort; in which as far from us as heaven is from earth. But because the Lord redeemed the Church, He not only gave her the word of salvation to receive but also the enduring certitude to contend for it, and this to preach throughout the world. Rightly, therefore, it is added:
