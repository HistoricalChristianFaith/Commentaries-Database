By divine eloquence, the nature of his divinity and humanity conjoined in Christâ€™s one person is expressed through this bread and mixed wine, as was said above. Or at least the sacrament through which we are satiated at the table of his altar is clearly shown in the bread of his body and in the mixed wine of his most holy blood. .
