And the ark rested in the seventh month, on the twenty-seventh day of the month, upon the mountains of Armenia. That the ark rested in the seventh month refers symbolically to that seventh rest about which it has often been spoken, as those who are perfect and who have the stability of a mind fixed upon God, as if squared, tend toward rest. Well did the ark come to rest on the twenty-seventh day of the same month, which number according to arithmetic reasoning is a solid squared trinity. For the number three accords with our devotion of mind due to the memory by which we recall God, the understanding by which we know Him, and the will by which we love Him. But for this very trinity to reach a squaring from a simple and straight line, multiply three by three, and make nine; and for that squaring to also take height and become solid, again multiply nine by three, and there will be twenty-seven, that is, you will complete the solid squared trinity number, in which the ark rested, because the Church in the stability of its mind and action, as if squared, both expects rest in this life and receives eternal rest in the future. Now it rested upon the mountains of Armenia, because, renouncing the summit of the world's pomp, even in this pilgrimage, leading a life, it approaches heavenly joys with the mind.
