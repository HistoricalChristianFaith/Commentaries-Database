"And poverty will come upon you like a traveler," etc. For poverty and misery are the ultimate punishment, in which the damned deserve nothing of wealth: they will come like a traveler, because unforeseen and sudden; like an armed man, because they cannot be conquered perpetually. It is clear according to the letter, that sloth is the nurse of poverty and indigence. But if you are diligent, etc. The earthly fruits we reap are not comparable to a spring, but to a cistern, because they feed the gatherer for a time and eventually run out; but he who is diligent in laboring for heavenly riches, the harvest of this, like a spring, will come, because it will perfect the enduring reward of labors. And poverty will flee far from you. Because I will be satisfied, he says, when your glory is made manifest.
