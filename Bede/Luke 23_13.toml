Perish then those writings, which composed solong a time after Christ, convict not the accused of magical arts against Pilate, but the writers themselves of treachery and lying against Christ.
As if he said, I will subject Him to all the scourgings and mockings you desire, but do not thirst after the innocent blood. It follows, For of necessity he must release one to them an obligation not imposed by a decree of the imperial law, but binding by the annual custom of the nation whom in such things he was glad to please.
Even to this day their request still clings to the Jews. For since when they had the choice given to them, they chosea robber for Jesus, a murderer for a Savior; rightly lost they both life and salvation, and became subject to such robberies and seditions among themselves as to forfeit both their country and kingdom.
With the worst kind of death, that is, crucifixion, they long to murder the innocent. For they who hung on the cross, with their hands and feet fixedby nails to the wood, suffered a prolonged death, that their agony might not quickly cease; butthe death of the cross was chosen by our Lord, as that which having overcome the Devil, Hewas about to place as a trophy on the brows of the faithful.
This chastisement wherewith Pilate sought to satisfy the people, lest their rage should go even so far as to crucify Jesus, John's words bear testimony that he not only threatened but performed together with mockings andscourgings. But when they saw all their charges which they brought against the Lord baffled by Pilate's diligent questioning, they resort at last to prayers only; entreating that He might be crucified.
