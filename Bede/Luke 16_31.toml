If they do not listen to Moses and the prophets, they will not be convinced even if someone rises from the dead. For indeed, those who despise the words of the law will, by far, more hardly accomplish the commands of the Redeemer who has risen from the dead, as much as they are more subtle. And indeed it is apparent that those who refuse to fulfill His words, undoubtedly refuse to believe in Him. Who, according to the allegory, does this rich man signify, who was clothed in purple and fine linen, and feasted sumptuously every day, if not the Jewish people, who outwardly had the worship of life, who used the delights of the law received to shine, not to be useful? And who does Lazarus, full of sores, signify if not the Gentile people figuratively expressed? Who, when converted to God, was not ashamed to confess his sins, this one had wounds on his skin. Indeed, in a wound of the skin, the poison is drawn from the inner parts and erupts outwardly. What, then, is the confession of sins, but a certain breaking of wounds? Because the poison of sin is healthily revealed in confession, which was pestilently hidden in the mind. But Lazarus, wounded, desired to be filled with the crumbs that fell from the rich man's table, and no one gave him any, for that proud people despised admitting any Gentile to the knowledge of the law, who, inasmuch as they did not have the teaching of the law for charity but for pride, feared, as it were, losing their accepted wealth, and because words flowed down from their knowledge, as it were, crumbs fell from their table. On the other hand, the dogs licked the wounds of the lying poor man. Sometimes in the sacred word, preachers are understood by the dogs. For indeed the tongue of the dogs, while it licks the wound, heals it because the holy teachers, while they instruct us in the confession of our sins, they, as it were, touch the wound of the mind with their tongue. And because they deliver us from sins by speaking, they, as it were, bring back the wounds to health by touching them. Hence it is well that Lazarus means 'assisted' because they help him to be delivered, who heal his wounds by the correction of the tongue. It happened that both of them died: the rich man, who was clothed in purple and fine linen, was buried in hell, but Lazarus was carried by angels into Abraham's bosom. What does Abraham's bosom signify, if not the secret rest of the Father? about which the Truth says: Many will come from the east and west and recline with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven. But the sons of this kingdom will be cast out into the outer darkness (Matt. 8). For he who is said to be clad in purple is rightly called the son of the kingdom. He lifts up his eyes from afar to see Lazarus because, while they are in the depths of their punishment for their damnation, the unbelievers, they look up at the faithful in rest before the day of final judgment, whom they can never behold after their joy. What they see is far off because they do not reach it through any merit. He is shown to burn more intensely in his tongue when he says: Send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue, for I am in agony in this flame. The unbelieving people held the words of the law in their mouth, which they contemned to keep by action. Therefore, he will burn more where he showed he knew what he refused to do. He desires to be touched by the tip of the finger because he wishes, while given to eternal punishment, to partake even a little in the action of the just. To whom it is answered that he received good things in his life because he thought all his joy was in transitory happiness. Indeed, the just may have good things here, but they do not receive these in recompense, because while they seek better, that is, eternal things, however many good things may present themselves, with holy desires they yearn for, the good things are scarcely seen. Among these, it is noteworthy that it is said to him: Remember, son. Behold, Abraham calls him son whom he does not free from torment, because the preceding faithful fathers of these unbelieving people, as they observe many swayed from their faith, do not deliver them from torments by any compassion, whom they nevertheless recognize as sons through the flesh. In torment, the rich man is said to have five brothers, for the same proud Jewish people who are already in great part condemned know those whom they left on earth, addicted to the five bodily senses. Therefore, he expresses the brothers he left by the number five because, while in hell, he laments that they do not rise to spiritual understanding. He asks for Lazarus to be sent to them, to whom it is said that they have Moses and the prophets. But he says that they do not believe unless someone rises from the dead. To this, it is immediately responded: If they do not listen to Moses and the prophets, neither will they be convinced if someone rises from the dead. Certainly, the truth says about Moses: If you believed Moses, you would believe me also. For he wrote of me (John 5). It is thus fulfilled what is said through the response of Abraham. For the Lord rose from the dead, but the Jewish people, because they did not want to believe Moses, even disdained to believe Him who rose from the dead; and as they declined to understand the words of Moses spiritually, they did not come to Him about whom Moses spoke.
