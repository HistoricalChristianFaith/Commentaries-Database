But to the rest (He spoke) in parables, so that seeing they might not see, and hearing they might not understand. Mark says it thus: But to those who are outside, everything is done in parables (Mark 4). Therefore, let us also enter into the sanctuary of God with the disciples of Christ, so that we may understand the final mysteries of the kingdom of God. For those who approach His feet will receive from His teaching, saying with the Psalmist, "Reveal our eyes, and we will consider the wonders of Your law" (Psalm 119). Rightly therefore do they hear in parables and in a riddle, who with closed senses of heart neither care to enter nor to know the truth, having forgotten the Lord's command: "He who has ears to hear, let him hear" (Matthew 11).
