"Hope deferred makes the heart sick," etc. For certainly, as long as the hope of eternal things is deferred, the soul of the faithful is afflicted, either because of the delay of the good things they love or because of the imposition of the evils they endure. But when what they desire comes, they easily forget what they have endured, because they begin to live forever with their Redeemer, whom they sought with their whole intention. He himself is the tree of life to those who embrace him.
