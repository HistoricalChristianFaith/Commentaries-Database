And Abimelech answering the king, said: And who, etc.? The sacred order of commandments, fighting for the kingdom of Christ, will respond to the Jewish people, who consider the faith and love of Christ a crime: And who among all the prophets and saints, whom it is known from their words, prayers, and examples, served your interests greatly, could equate to the apostle and high priest of our confession, Jesus, who is faithful to Him who made Him (Hebrews III), just as Moses was in all His house? For he has been deemed worthy of greater glory than Moses, by how much greater honor the one who built it has than the house; he who joined to himself in the covenant of a bride the church of the Gentiles, begotten from the ancient faith of your fathers. Nor is he proven to have done or taught anything else in the flesh than what you yourselves learned according to the words of the prophets, indeed you have always desired that Christ, when He came, would do. Do we begin today to have this faith in Him and to seek the divine oracles of the word for the state of His Church, and did we not rather receive, venerate, and worship it as passed down and commended to us by the ancient tradition of the patriarchs and prophets?
