And when the days of her purification according to the law of Moses were fulfilled, they brought him to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord. It was indeed a decree of the law that a little one, on the thirty-third day after his circumcision, be brought to the temple of the Lord and an offering be given for him; and that the firstborn male be made holy to the Lord. Mystically, as we have said, implying that no one except one circumcised from vices is worthy of the Lord's view, and no one except one released from the bonds of mortality can perfectly enter the joys of the heavenly city. For it is said: "The wicked will not dwell near you; the unjust shall not remain before your eyes" (Psalm V). And the Apostle: "Flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God, nor will the perishable inherit the imperishable" (1 Cor. XV). Truly, if you inspect the words of the law more diligently, you will surely find that not only the incarnate Lord was free from the contamination of sin and the condition of the law, which he condescended to take upon himself more precisely to prove that it was holy, righteous, and good, and to free us from its servitude and fear by the grace of faith, but also that the Mother of God herself, being free from male involvement, was also immune from the legal requirement. For Moses says: "If a woman has conceived seed and borne a male child, she shall be unclean seven days, according to the days of her menstruation separation, and on the eighth day the infant shall be circumcised. She shall then remain thirty-three days in the blood of her purification. She shall touch no holy thing, nor come into the sanctuary, until the days of her purification are completed, etc." (Leviticus XII), which concerns the rite of the childbirth woman. Note therefore that not every woman who gives birth, but she who has conceived seed and borne, is designated unclean, and is taught by the law to be cleansed, to distinguish thus the one who conceived as a virgin and bore a son, and called his name Emmanuel, which is interpreted "God with us" (Isa. VII). Therefore, the Son who is God with man, and the Mother who bore by the working of the Holy Spirit, did not need the offerings of sacrifices for purification, but that we might be freed from the bond of the law, as the Lord Christ, so also the blessed ever-virgin Mary was willingly subject to the law.
