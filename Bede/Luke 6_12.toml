But it happened in those days that He went out to the mountain to pray. Not everyone who prays ascends to the mountain. For there is a prayer that brings about sin. But he who prays well, who seeks God in prayer, ascends from earthly things to higher things, reaching the peak of higher concern. But he who earnestly prays about riches, or worldly honor, or even about the death of an enemy, he, lying in the depths, sends vile prayers to God. The Lord, however, prays not for Himself, but to intercede for me. For even if the Father has put all things in the Sonâ€™s power, the Son still deems it necessary to beseech the Father on our behalf because He is our advocate. For He says, "We have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ" (1 John 2). If He is an advocate, He must intervene for my sins. Therefore, He pleads not as a weak person, but as a pious one. Do you want to know how capable He is of accomplishing everything He wishes? He is both advocate and judge. In one, the function of piety; in the other, the symbol of power.

And He was spending the night in prayer to God. A model is prescribed for you to emulate. What should you do for your own salvation when Christ spends the night in prayer for you? What should you do when you wish to undertake an office of piety, when Christ ensured to pray first before sending the apostles? Do you want to know how, He prayed for me, not for Himself?
