He not only surnamed Peter first, but long before this, when he was brought by Andrew, it is said, You shall becalled Cephas, which is by interpretation, a stone. But Luke, wishing to mention the names of the disciples, since it was necessary to call him Peter, wished shortly to imply that this wasnot his name before, but the Lord had given it to him.
Matthew places himself after his fellow-disciple Thomas, from humility, whereas by the other Evangelists he is put before him. It follows, James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon who is called Zelotes.
But in a mystical sense the mountain on which our Lord chose His disciples represents the loftiness of justice in which they were to be instructed, and which they were top reach to others; so also the law was given on a mountain.
