For he was hastening if it were possible to be present at the day of Pentecost in Jerusalem. Indeed, it was commanded by the law that all Jews should gather in Jerusalem three times a year, that is, at the time of Passover, Pentecost, and the Feast of Tabernacles, but the Apostle, breaking the ties of the world, hastens to observe the fiftieth day, that is, the day of remission and the Holy Spirit.

For he was hastening, if it were possible for him, to observe the day of Pentecost in Jerusalem. In Greek, it is written as the Day of Pentecost, that is, the fiftieth day. Therefore note that the time of Passover and Pentecost were also celebrated at the time of the apostles. But whether they were celebrated among the Jews who adhered to the law on the day the lamb was sacrificed in Egypt and the day the law was given on Mount Sinai, or on the day of the Lord's resurrection and the coming of the Holy Spirit, let those who know say. Nonetheless, it is known that the apostle Peter celebrated Passover in Rome on the Lord's Day of the resurrection of Christ; it is known that the evangelist Mark, sent by him, taught this in Egypt.
