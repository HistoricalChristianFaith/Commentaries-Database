And these are the ones sown on good ground: they hear the word and accept it and bear fruit, one thirty, and one sixty, and one hundred. Good ground, that is, the faithful conscience of the elect, opposes all the evil yields of the earth, for it both willingly receives the seed of the word entrusted to it and, preserving it consistently among adversities and prosperities, maintains it until the time of fruition. And it bears fruit, producing one thirty, one sixty, and one hundred. Thirty, specifically, when it instills the faith of the Holy Trinity in the hearts of the elect. Sixty, when it teaches the perfection of good work. For, since the adornment of the world was completed in the number six, good work is rightly designated by this number. One hundred, when in all our actions it shows us the rewards to be sought in the heavenly kingdom. For one hundred, which are transferred to the right hand by counting, are rightly set in the significance of eternal happiness. For although thirty and sixty are still contained in the left hand, one hundred pass to the right. Although the great faith which reveals to us the knowledge of our Creator is significant, and the great works by which faith is fulfilled, lest it be idle, are significant, both are necessary in this life; the reward of faith and works exercised through love is to be hoped for in the life to come.
