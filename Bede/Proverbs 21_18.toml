The impious is given in place of the just, etc. The just and the upright seem to be the same; but there is a difference between the impious and the iniquitous, for all the iniquitous are reprobates; the impious, however, are those who, entangled in greater crimes, either never received the holy mysteries of the faith, or, after receiving them, returned to apostasy. Hence, in this place, the impious can be understood to mean all the persecutors of the faithful; furthermore, under the term iniquitous, all the wicked are generally designated. And the impious is given in place of the just, when the persecutor who gave him to death is punished for the martyr. The iniquitous in place of the upright, who, seeing their just life, did not wish to imitate them. Herod is condemned not only for the innocent whom he wickedly delivered to death; but also received the sentence of condemnation because he did not want to follow the faith of the Magi to seek the Lord, although he was among the Jews and knew the words of the prophets. Hence indeed the Lord says: "The queen of the south will rise in judgment with this generation and condemn it, etc." (Matthew 12:42). Not that she herself by her virtue and power will condemn, but because, by comparison with her, they will be condemned, who, knowing her devotion, when they could much more easily, neglected to have concern for wisdom.
