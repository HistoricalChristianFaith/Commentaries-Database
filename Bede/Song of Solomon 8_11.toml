Solomon had a vineyard in Baal-Hamon; he leased the vineyard to keepers; everyone was to bring a thousand pieces of silver for its fruit. My own vineyard is before me. You, O Solomon, must have a thousand, and those who keep its fruit two hundred. Speaking of this, the Church, or the Synagogue, which he saw to be emulated by her or, to say more gently, marveling at her conversion to the Lord, or indeed to her maidens, whom she was accustomed to call daughters of Jerusalem by this song. The Peaceful one, however, whom she names, is her spouse and beloved, the Father of the future age, the Prince of peace (Isaiah 9), whose figure Solomon presented both in the peaceful state of his kingdom and in his name itself. In whose peace the vineyard existed, because by His grace the Catholic Church was established throughout the world. It is mentioned in many passages of Scripture, but most clearly in the Gospel parable where it is written: "The kingdom of heaven is like a man who was a householder who went out early in the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard," etc. (Matthew 20); where by the laborers of the first, third, sixth, ninth, and eleventh hour it is clearly expressed that the one and the same Church of Christ, throughout the entirety of this age, which is signified by one day's duration, is tirelessly cultivated by the labor of spiritual teachers. Likewise, there was a vineyard for the peaceful one in it, that is, in that peace about which He had foretold that it would be made in His presence, as if finding peace; because whoever neglects to have peace does not belong to the Church of Christ, even if he seems to confess Christ and obey His commands. For in peace is His place established. And the Apostle says, "Follow peace with all men, and holiness, without which no one will see God" (Hebrews XII); The society of this peace is set before us by the very sight and form of a most beautiful vineyard, which, to use the words of blessed Ambrose, "first plants a living root for the imitation of our life; then, because it is of a flexible and fragile nature, it clings with tendrils, like certain arms, to whatever it grasps, and with these raises and lifts itself." The people of the Church are like this, who are planted with a root of faith and restrained by the shoot of humility, and lest they be turned away by the storms of the world and driven by tempest, they embrace those around them with tendrils and circles, as if with the arms of charity, and rest in their union. This vineyard is cultivated when we are relieved from the burden of worldly concerns. For nothing burdens the mind more than such anxiety and desire, whether for money or power. A cultivated vineyard is supported so that it may be elevated when our affection is raised by the example of the saints, and does not lie low and despised, but each mind lifts itself to higher things, daring to say: "Our conversation is in heaven" (Philippians III). This vineyard has peoples, because the holy Church is gathered not from one Jewish nation, but from the peoples of all nations. The Church of the Gentiles was especially added for this reason, to teach that it could belong to this vineyard, and that Judea should not glory in the exclusivity of the divine knowledge given to it; for the Psalmist says, "Praise the Lord, all you nations" (Psalm CXVI). And Moses himself foretold, "Rejoice, O nations, with His people" (Romans XV). Since the Lord greatly cares for this vineyard so that it may be kept undefiled, and there is great necessity for men to participate in it, it is rightly added:

He entrusted it to the keepers, etc. For the keepers of the Church are the prophets, the keepers are the apostles, the keepers are the successors of the prophets and apostles, who in different ages of the world were given to its governance by divine command; the keepers are the heavenly host of the military, who at all times during the passing of the age take care for the state of the Church, lest it be disturbed by the inbreaking of the wicked, whether men or spirits. But the man brings a thousand silver coins for the fruit of this vineyard, because whoever makes progress in acquiring the heavenly kingdom forsakes all that is of the world: for the fruit of labors done temporarily for the Lord is the reception of the eternal rest and kingdom with the Lord. Concerning which He Himself said, "I have appointed you that you should go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain" (John XV); that is, that you should work and receive wages, and that wage itself should never be ended. Scripture is accustomed to call a man of perfect virtue vir (man): for indeed vir takes its name from virtue, since undoubtedly a vir, that is, a soul elevated by the grace of virtue, brings a thousand silver coins for the fruit of this vineyard when he forsakes all his temporal possessions so as to be worthy to receive eternal goods. By the term silver coins, it designates any kind of money that should be forsaken. By the number a thousand, which is perfect and complete, the entirety is usually designated, and therefore by the thousand silver coins which a man is said to bring for the fruit of this vineyard, the entirety of what the perfect forsake for the Lord is indicated; which, even if sometimes small in valuation, is certainly judged to be great and abundant in the estimation of Him who considers not the sum of the given money, but the conscience of the giving man. This is the same sentiment which above is set forth in other words, "If a man would give all the substance of his house for love, he will utterly be contemned": indeed, here the thousand silver coins are set for all the substance of the house which is to be forsaken; but love, which, the other charismata ceasing, embraces us perpetually in the heavenly fatherland, is itself the fruit of the vineyard by which the blessed will then be satiated, who now in the same vineyard are laboring and are hungry and thirsty for righteousness. Then follows the voice of the One at peace, as it teaches how much care He has for His vineyard, namely the Church, what He conserves eternally for those who forsake their own for Him, what special reward He intends to give to the keepers of the same vineyard, that is, the teachers.
