While the Lord said, “Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for justice,” these people on the contrary hungered for iniquity and thirsted as much for blood, so that they even gave up food for the body until they might be satiated by the death of a just man. But “there is no wisdom, there is no prudence, there is no counsel in opposition to the Lord.” For [as we have read] also above, although Paul offered sacrifices, shaved his head, “went barefoot and to the Jews became a Jew,” nevertheless he could not escape the chains that had been foretold. In this case too, although these men took counsel together, bound themselves under a vow and laid snares [for Paul], nevertheless the apostle was kept unharmed so that he could also give testimony to Christ in Rome, just as had also been said.
