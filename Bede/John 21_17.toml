What [Christ] said to [Peter] at this point, “Feed my sheep,” was surely the same thing that he had said to him more clearly before his passion, “But I have asked on your behalf that your faith may not fail you, and once you have recovered, strengthen your brothers.” To feed Christ’s sheep is to strengthen those who believe in Christ, lest their faith fail them, and to devote oneself ceaselessly [to seeing to it] that they may make greater and greater progress in their faith. However, we must look carefully at the fact that his feeding of the Lord’s flock is not to be carried out with one single approach but should rather be multifaceted. A director must diligently see to it that earthly necessities are not lacking to his subjects and also be careful in providing them with examples of virtues along with words of preaching.… When those who are under his care may perhaps themselves have fallen into error, he as a righteous person should, according to the word of the psalmist, “accuse them mercifully and rebuke them,” but he should not soothe their hearts with the oil of harmful approval. This too is one of the obligations of a pious shepherd.
