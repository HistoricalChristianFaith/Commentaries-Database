"He who loves purity of heart," etc. He who rightly preaches with a pure heart will be numbered among those, about whom the prophet says to the same King and Creator of the ages: "But to me, your friends, O God, are greatly honored" (Ps. CXXXVIII). For if anyone shows the grace of lips by preaching rightly, but neglects to keep the purity of heart, such a one is by no means to be considered able to enjoy the friendship of the eternal king.
