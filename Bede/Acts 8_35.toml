Philip means “the mouth of a lamp,” and there is a beautiful meaning in “the mouth of a lamp” opening his mouth as he brought the obscurities of prophecy into the light of knowledge. However, according to the historical sense this circumlocution can also designate the considerably longer discourse that he was then about to deliver.
