But to those who are outside, everything is done in parables, so that seeing they may see and not perceive, and hearing they may hear and not understand, lest they turn and be forgiven their sins. It should be noted in these words of the Lord that not only what he said but also what he did were parables, that is, signs of mystical things, since it is said that those to whom everything was done in parables neither could lead what they saw and heard to understanding. For what would hinder those looking at his deeds or journeys from understanding, if something more than what is apparent to the eyes of the flesh was not intended to be spiritually understood? Therefore, to those who are outside and do not approach the feet of the Lord to receive from his teaching, everything is done in parables, both the deeds and words of the Savior, because they are neither able to recognize him as God in the things he worked with power, nor in the mysteries he preached. Therefore, they do not deserve to attain the remission of sins which is to be obtained through the grace of his faith.
