And when day came, he says, he called his disciples, and chose twelve of them. It should be noted here that the Gospel and Apostolic Scripture not only calls those twelve the disciples of Christ, but also all who, believing in him, were instructed by his teaching toward the kingdom of heaven. For disciples are called so from learning, from whose multitude he chose those whom he himself wanted.

Whom he also named apostles. Apostles in Greek, in Latin means sent. Whose sacrament the evangelist Mark explains by name, saying: "And he made twelve to be with him, and to send them out to preach the Gospel." And the Lord himself says: "As the Father has sent me, so I send you." The twelve are well chosen, in order to mystically commend also by their number the salvation of the world which they would preach by word. For three times four is twelve, a noble computation. Hence it is that, as I also said above, when Solomon built a temple to the Lord in the typology of the Church, he made a bronze sea in which the priests would wash, and placed it on the backs of twelve oxen, three of which faced north, three west, three south, and three east, figuratively indicating that the apostles and their successors would cleanse all the regions of the world with the faith and confession of the Holy Trinity from the stain of sins.
