That is, Christ’s disciples, for in the Greek the “his” is not stated, but only “disciples,” so that we may understand it in general, as the disciples of Christ or of the church. For we do not read of Paul as having yet made disciples but only of having confounded the Jews who were living in Damascus.

Even today this sort of escape is preserved in the church whenever someone who has been enveloped in the snares of the ancient enemy or in the traps of this world is saved through the defenses of his hope and faith. For the wall of Damascus (which means drinking blood) is the adversity of the world. King Aretas (which means a descent15) is understood to be the devil. The basket, which is usually constructed of rushes and palm leaves, designates the conjunction of faith and hope, for the rush signifies the freshness of faith, and the palm signifies the hope of eternal life. Therefore, anyone who sees himself encircled by a wall of adversity should be quick to climb into the basket of the virtues, in which he may make his escape.
