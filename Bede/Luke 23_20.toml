But Pilate again spoke to them, wanting to release Jesus. But they shouted back, saying: Crucify, Crucify him. How great the cruelty of the unfaithful, who not only desire to kill the innocent, but to kill with the worst kind of death, that is, by crucifixion! For those hanging on the wood of the cross, fastened to the wood by nails in their feet and hands, were killed by a prolonged death, and they were long-lived on the cross, not because a longer life was chosen, but because death itself was extended, lest the pain end quickly. But He, by dying the worst kind of death, killed all death. It was terrible to the unknowing Jews. For it was chosen by the Lord. For He was to have that very cross as His sign, He was to place that very cross as a trophy over the conquered devil on the foreheads of the faithful, so that the Apostle might say: But far be it from me to boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world (Galatians 6:14).
