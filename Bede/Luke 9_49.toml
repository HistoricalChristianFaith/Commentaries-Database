But answering, John said: Master, we saw someone casting out demons in your name, and we forbade him, because he does not follow with us. John, loving the Lord with special devotion and thus worthy to be loved back, thought he should be excluded from the benefit who did not use his service. But he is taught that no one should be excluded from the good he has in part, but rather to be encouraged towards what he does not yet have.
