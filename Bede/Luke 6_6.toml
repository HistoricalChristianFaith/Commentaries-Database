And it came to pass on another Sabbath, as he entered the synagogue and taught, and there was a man whose right hand was withered. The Lord taught particularly on the Sabbaths in the synagogue, and performed miracles, not only to insinuate the spiritual Sabbath, but also because of the more celebrated gathering of the people on that day. Then it was the custom from the ancient institution of the Fathers, which was commanded by the law to rest from labor, to give time to reading and listening to the Scriptures. According to what James speaks in the Acts of the Apostles. For Moses from ancient times has those who preach him in the synagogues, where he is read every Sabbath. For just as those whose art is hunting, where they have learned that wild animals, fish, and birds abound, they set their nets there the most: so also the Lord always taught in the synagogue and in the temple, where all the Jews gathered, wishing all to be saved, and to come to the knowledge of the truth. Surely the man who had the withered hand signifies the human race shriveled by the barrenness of good work, but cured by the Lordâ€™s mercy. Whose right hand, which in the first parent withered while plucking the fruit of the forbidden tree, is restored to the health of good works by the grace of the Redeemer, while he stretched his innocent hands on the tree of the cross. And it is well that the hand was withered in the synagogue, because where the gift of knowledge is greater, there the danger of the inexcusable sin is more serious.
