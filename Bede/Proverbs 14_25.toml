A faithful witness delivers souls, etc. Christ, who is the faithful witness, liberates souls, as we read in the Apocalypse; and, as the Apostle says, he testified the good confession before Pontius Pilate (I Tim. VI). The devil, who rightly is called the deceitful, proclaims lies, because he pronounces the evils which he suggests to be done as good, and promises eternal joys to those whom he prepares for the torments of hell. Likewise, the catholic teacher liberates souls, who faithfully proclaims, that is, correctly preaches, the testimonies of the Scriptures, and the heretic proclaims lies, or, as in another version it is clearly translated: He stirs up deceit with lies; it is implied he deceives the souls of those whom he has led astray by his error.
