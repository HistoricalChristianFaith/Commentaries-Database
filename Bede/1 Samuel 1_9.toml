And Anna rose, etc. The Church rose from the prolonged grief of its desolation, having now received confidence in supplicating the Lord. After being refreshed by his sacred body and inebriated by the precious chalice of his blood, while the Jewish teachers still remained on the same soil, ministering on the chair of Moses, keeping watch over the entrance to the heavenly kingdom so that they themselves might enter and teach those who wished to enter, she began to seek from the Lord with tears and prayers the gifts, which, before the mysteries of his incarnation were known or perceived, she could not yet presume.
