He who is good will draw grace from the Lord, etc. The connection of these verses is as follows: He who is good does not trust in his own thoughts, but seeks the grace of the Lord, and through it receives the ability to live piously. However, he who trusts in his own thoughts cannot be good. For he who does not care to seek the grace of the heavenly Helper, rightly endures in an impious action.
