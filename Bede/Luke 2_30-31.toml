For my eyes have seen your salvation, which you have prepared before the face of all peoples. Blessed are the eyes that see what Simeon saw: blessed are they who have not seen, and have believed (John 20). That very thing, he says, which you have prepared to be beheld with mind and faith by all nations, peoples, and tongues afterward, and which you foresaw was to be sought with hope and love, I now contemplate your salvation, long desired, with the eyes of both flesh and heart.
