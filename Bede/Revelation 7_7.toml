Simeon is placed next and means “he has heard sorrow” or “the name of dwelling,” so that by the character of this name he might more clearly teach what is here to be acquired and what is more advantageously to be awaited. For the joy of the celestial habitation is given to those whose mind is here made sorrowful by a fruitful repentance, of whom indeed it was said, “Your sorrow will be turned into joy.” Next listed is Levi, which interpreted means “addition,” by which we understand either those who with temporal things purchase eternal things, as Solomon says, “The ransom of a man’s life is his own wealth,” or those who by following the counsel of God receive in this world a hundredfold with tribulations, but in the future age [they receive] eternal life. Concerning these it has been written: “He who adds knowledge adds woe.” For this reason was the bitterness of tribulations added even to holy Job that, having been found worthy, he might receive a greater reward. And so not without reason does Issachar follow him in a proper order. Issachar is interpreted to mean “there is a reward,” for, as the apostle says, “the sufferings of the present age are not worthy to be compared to the future glory which will be revealed in us.” For, indeed, we fight with greater effect when a sure reward is awaited.
