Peter says that we must still suffer for a little while, because it is only through the sadness of the present age and its afflictions that it is possible to reach the joys of eternity. He stresses the fact that this is only “for a little while,” because once we have entered our eternal reward, the years we spent suffering here below will seem like no time at all.
