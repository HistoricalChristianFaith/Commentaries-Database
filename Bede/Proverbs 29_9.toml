A wise man contending with a fool, etc. A wise teacher, if he contends with an unbelieving and obstinate man, whether he speaks of the torments of the reprobates or the joys of the good, labors in vain against the senseless; whether he advises the coverings of repentance, or speaks of the rewards of good work, he is not heard by the fool. Hence the apostles also said to the Jews, We lamented to you, and you did not mourn; we sang to you, and you did not dance (Matt. XII).
