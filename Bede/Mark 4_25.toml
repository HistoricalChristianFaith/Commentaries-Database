For whoever has, to him more will be given. And whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken away from him. He said, with full intention, give effort to the word that you hear, by remembering and examining: because whoever has love for the word, even the sense of understanding what he loves will be given to him. But whoever does not have love for hearing the word, even if he seems to excel either by natural talent or by exercise in letters, will enjoy none of the sweetness of true wisdom. And although it seems to have been especially said about the apostles, to whom it was given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God more by charity and faith, and about the perfidious Jews, who, seeing in parables, did not see; and hearing, did not understand; namely, that they would lose the letter of the law in which they boasted: it can however also be generally understood that sometimes an ingenious reader by neglecting deprives himself of wisdom, which one slow in talent but studious, by laboring, tastes.
