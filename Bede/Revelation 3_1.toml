He says that the angel, that is, the bishop, exercises insufficient diligence in the correction of evil people. Nonetheless, he commends him for having some who walk in white garments, and to these the name of “Sardis” corresponds, namely, “precious stone.” … Indeed, you seem to yourself to be alive, but unless you are vigilant in the correction of the wicked, you will be regarded as already among the dead.… Even though he might seem to people to be guiltless, the works of a ruler are not perfect before God if he does not strive to enliven also others.
