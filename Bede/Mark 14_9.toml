Amen, I say to you, wherever this Gospel is proclaimed in the whole world, what she has done will also be told in memory of her. Pay attention to this knowledge of future events, that He knew He would suffer after a few days, and that His Gospel would be celebrated in the whole world. It should be noted that just as Mary has achieved glory throughout the world, wherever the holy Church has spread, because of the homage of devoted piety she showed to the Lord, so, conversely, the one who did not fear to detract from her homage with a reckless tongue, has been infamously known for his treachery far and wide, and deservedly made hateful to God and men alike. But the Lord, rewarding good with worthy praise, silently overlooked the future insults of the wicked.
