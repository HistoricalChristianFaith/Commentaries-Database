And Jesus said: "Someone touched me. For I know that power has gone out from me," etc. Let Pelagius say, if he pleases, that he is saved by his own effort. But let us say that the salvation of man is vain, in God we shall do virtue. For He also knows that the power, which is propitious to all our iniquities and heals all our infirmities, goes out not from ourselves but from Him. Therefore, He does not ignore the one who has touched the hem of His garment, that is, the mysteries of the incarnation, until he reaches the greater truths, having believed perfectly by fully loving.
