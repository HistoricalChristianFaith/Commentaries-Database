God is not like an earthly father, who is more inclined to pardon his erring sons than he is to spare other members of his household. God the Father is so holy and just that he adopts as his sons not only humble and obedient servants but also enemies who have lifted up their hands against him. On the other hand, he has also disinherited those who appeared to enjoy the benefits of sonship because of their disobedience.
