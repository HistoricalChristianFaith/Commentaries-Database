And if you call on the Father. Saying in prayer: Our Father, who art in heaven (Matt. 6).

Who without respect of persons judges, etc. Not like an earthly father who is accustomed to pardon his erring children more indulgently than his servants. But the Father God is of such justice and piety, that He transforms even humble and obedient servants, indeed even enemies who give themselves to Him, into the adoption of children, and again, those who seem more honorable under the name of children, for the fault of disobedience, utterly excludes from perpetual inheritance.

Conduct yourselves in fear during the time of your sojourning. Lest through idleness and negligence you become unworthy of such a Father, and while you are secure in the present sojourn, you may not attain the promised happiness of the homeland.
