The fruit of the just is a tree of life. The reward of the just is the vision of Christ. For He is the wisdom of which it is said, "She is a tree of life to those who lay hold of her" (Proverbs 3). And in the Apocalypse, it is said, "To him who overcomes, I will give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the paradise of my God" (Revelation 2). And now the just await this fruit, because long, as it is predicted, they flourish like a green leaf.

And he that wins souls is wise. He who undertakes the care of souls for the Lord, such as to teach the erring, to comfort the mournful, to sustain the needy with temporal goods, to lead the resistant to the remedies of salvation, or to govern those destitute of a shepherd, so that he may bring many to the Lord with himself; he, I say, who undertakes souls in this way, is wise, because he greatly procures for his own soul by these means, whereby he may reign more gloriously with the Lord.
