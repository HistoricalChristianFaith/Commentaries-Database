And they said to each other, "Who will roll away the stone for us from the door of the tomb?" And looking up, they saw that the stone had been rolled away. For it was very large. How the stone was rolled away by the angel, Matthew explains sufficiently. But the rolling away of the stone mystically suggests the uncovering of the mysteries of Christ, which were covered by the veil of the legal letter. For the law is written on stone, whose covering having been removed, the glory of the resurrection is shown, and the abolition of the ancient death and the eternal life to be hoped for by us began to be proclaimed throughout the whole world.
