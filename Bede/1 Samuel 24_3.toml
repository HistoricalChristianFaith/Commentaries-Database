And he also came to the sheepfolds, etc. In persecuting the great shepherd of the sheep, our Lord Jesus Christ, he also dragged the wicked investigation to the gatherings of his faithful disciples, who offered themselves as sheep to the raging wolves, to see if they could find any reason within them to criticize their master. Hence the saying: "Behold, your disciples do what is not lawful on the Sabbaths," and others (Mark II).

And there was a cave, etc. This cave is a symbol of the Lord's tomb, whose entrance Saul entered to relieve himself, while the rulers of the kingdom of the Jews, having departed from Pilate, secured the tomb, sealing the stone with guards, in an attempt to block the path of resurrection to the Author of Life. By doing this, they revealed to all the long-conceived and steeped filth of their unfaithful minds. Moreover, the Lord lay hidden in the inner part of the tomb, and his men also hid there—that is, the strong who at that time were to become stronger as his disciples. It is certain that wherever they were in the city of Jerusalem at that time in body, they held with their entire focus and desire the place of the tomb, where they mourned the burial of the only one they loved. Indeed, they hid in the cave because they did not at all want those who had unjustly killed him to know the devotion and love they had for him. Or certainly it is to be understood that David’s men hid with him in the cave, and even rose and came out from the cave with him, according to the Apostle’s statement: "Our old self was crucified with him so that the body of sin might be destroyed, and we might no longer be slaves to sin" (Rom. VI). And as he had previously said: "For as many of us as were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death. We were therefore buried with him through baptism into death, in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, we too may walk in newness of life" (Rom. VI).
