And they were afraid as they entered into the cloud, and a voice came from the cloud, saying: This is my beloved Son, hear him. Human fragility cannot bear the sight of greater glory, and trembling with the whole mind and body, it falls to the ground. The more one seeks greater things, the more he collapses to lower things, if he does not know his own measure. Indeed, the voice of the Father speaking from heaven is heard, which bears witness to the Son, and teaches Peter the truth, removing his error, and indeed teaches the other apostles through Peter. This is (he says) my beloved Son, it is he who should have a tabernacle built, it is him who should be obeyed. This is the Son; Moses and Elijah are servants to him, they too should prepare a tabernacle for the Lord in the inner rooms of their hearts along with you. And note, just as when the Lord was baptized in the Jordan, so also on the glorified mountain, the mystery of the whole Trinity is declared, whose glory we confess in baptism, and which we will see in the resurrection. Nor is it in vain that the Holy Spirit appears here in a bright cloud, there in a dove, because he who now keeps the faith which he perceives with a simple heart, will then behold what he had believed with the clear light of vision, and by the same grace will be protected forever.
