Understand, you simple ones, craftiness, etc. It is evident concerning the Lord, that when he was in the world, he spoke the word to every age, sex, and condition; indeed, even cried out standing in the temple, If anyone thirsts, let him come to me and drink (John VII). And now through the teachers of the Church (for they are the gates of his city) he preaches to men and women alike, to the wise and the foolish, to the elderly and the young; but on the contrary, deceptive teaching seeks those whom it might seduce secretly and privately.
