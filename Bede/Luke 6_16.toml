Judas of James, and Judas Iscariot, who was the traitor. And for the sake of distinction, he doubled the names. One of whom, as he himself writes in the catholic Epistle, is the brother of James, who was also called Thaddaeus. The other took his name either from the village in which he was born, or from the tribe of Issachar as a premonition of his condemnation. For Issachar, which means "reward," hints at the price of betrayal. But Iscariot, which is interpreted as "memory of death," shows that he did not suddenly decide, but meditated longer on committing the sin of betraying the Lord. He was chosen among the apostles not by imprudence but providence. How great is the truth, which even an adversarial minister cannot weaken? How great is the morality of the Lord, who preferred to risk His judgment among us rather than His affection? For He had taken on human frailty, and therefore did not refuse even these parts of human weakness. He wanted to be deserted, wanted to be betrayed, wanted to be handed over by His own apostle, so that you, deserted by a companion, betrayed by a companion, might bear your misjudgment and lost benefit with moderation.
