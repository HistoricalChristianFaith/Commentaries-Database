Now according to the law of Moses, those who vowed themselves to God were ordered to let their hair grow for as long as they wished to be Nazarites and afterwards to have it cut and to consign it to the fire. Paul did these things, not indeed because he had forgotten what he, along with the other apostles, had settled at Jerusalem concerning the abolition of the law, but so that those among the Jews who had come to believe might not be scandalized, he played the part of a Jew himself in order to win over the Jews.
