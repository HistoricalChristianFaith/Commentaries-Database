But Jesus answered and said: "Permit it thus far." It should not be thought that He was pleased with what had happened up to this point, but rather He did not want it to proceed any further. In the words which Matthew records the Lord is said to have spoken: "Put your sword back in its place; for all who take the sword will perish by the sword" (Matthew 26). It was understood rather that the entire action, wherein Peter used the sword, was displeasing to the Lord. For it is more accurate that when they asked Him, saying: "Lord, should we strike with the sword?" then He responded: "Permit it thus far," meaning: do not be concerned with what is about to happen, they must be allowed to proceed up to this point, that is, to apprehend Me, and that what is written about Me may be fulfilled. But in the intervening time between the words of those questioning the Lord and His responding, Peter, in his eagerness to defend and with greater commotion for the Lord, struck. But it could not also be spoken at the same time that which could be done at the same time. For He would not have said: "But Jesus answered," unless He was responding to their questioning. For concerning Peter's action, Matthew alone states what He judged. Where Matthew also did not say: "Jesus answered Peter: 'Put your sword back,'" but said: "Then Jesus said to him: 'Put your sword back,'" which appears the Lord said after the fact.

And when he touched his ear, he healed him. The Lord never forgets his compassion, even preventing his enemies from being harmed. They inflict death on the just one, while he heals the wounds of the persecutors: mystically teaching that even they can be healed, if they are converted, who are wounded in agreement with his death. According to the allegory, this servant is the people of the Jews, subjected to the obedience of the chief priests, so much so that by their influence they asked for Barabbas to be released, and Jesus, whom they had just been singing Hosanna to as the son of David and king, to be crucified. In the Lord's Passion, they lost the right ear, that is, the spiritual understanding of the law, being content only with the left, that is, the benefit of the letter. This ear is cut off by Peter's sword, not because he takes away the understanding from those listening, but reveals the neglect removed by divine judgment. But the same right ear was, by divine dignity, restored to its original function in those who chose to believe from the same people. Alternatively: the ear cut off for the Lord, and healed by the Lord, signifies hearing renewed after the old state is removed, so that it is in the newness of the spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter. Whoever is granted this by Christ will also be granted to reign with Christ. Hence, it is fitting that Malchus, the name of that servant, is interpreted as king or one destined to reign. But that he was found a servant also pertains to that old condition which generates servitude, which is Hagar. But when health approached, freedom was also symbolized.
