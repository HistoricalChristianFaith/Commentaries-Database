"She seeks wool and flax," etc. The beginning of this verse, the strong woman, that is the holy Church, customarily takes and observes even according to the letter; according to the prophetic saying, "When you see the naked, cover him, and do not hide yourself from your own flesh" (Isaiah 58). However, she works not with superfluous and blind labor, but certainly with that counsel, that she may deserve to hear from her own husband, namely the Lord Christ, in judgment, "I was naked, and you clothed me" (Matthew 25); and "As you did it to one of the least of these my brethren, you did it to me" (Ibid.). But she works with the counsel of her own hands, that is, those persons, through whom she distributes alms to the poor. In this devoted work, he very profitably uses this advice, that when dispersing he gives to the poor, he is not praised by men at that time, but his righteousness endures from generation to generation, his horn is exalted in glory (Psalm III). Mystically, however, everything of simplicity and piety which we bestow on our neighbors can be received in the wool, which is the clothing of sheep. As punishment of our flesh can be indicated in the linen, which greenily springs from the earth but loses its native moisture through long and numerous exercises and reaches the grace of new whiteness. While we boil out the ingrained filth of vices through continence, we indeed make it worthy to be donned by Christ, according to that of the Apostle, "For as many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ" (Galatians III). Therefore, the strong woman seeks wool and linen and works with the counsel of her hands, when the holy Church diligently seeks what fruits of piety she may exercise, how to cleanse herself from carnal allurements. And she does both of these with the most prudent counsel, that is, only in view of the reward of modernity. This reward is also more openly remembered in the following verse, when it is added, "She is like the merchant ship, etc." He calls the merchant a trader, who is so called by the ancients because he diligently attends to acquiring and multiplying goods. Therefore, the strong woman becomes like the merchant ship, for just as the merchant ship, laden with merchandise that is more abundant in its homeland, seeks other lands by sea so that, selling what it had brought, it may bring back more expensive goods home, so indeed the holy Church, thus every perfect soul rejoices to be laden with the riches of virtues, by which it may purchase greater gifts of divine grace. For it is an excellent commerce when the good deeds we are able to perform first receive this reward from the Lord, that we always progress to greater deeds, then also receive eternal life. Therefore, the holy soul becomes like the merchant ship, which crosses the waves of the present world by desire, and solely hopes to receive eternal joys in heaven, meditates on these, and strives to perform whatever it is capable of to acquire these more abundantly, to boldly overcome whatever adverse circumstances it encounters. Rightly it is said that she brings her food from afar, because in everything she does temporally good, she expects only the eternal reward, desires only the satisfaction of the living bread, indeed of Him who mercifully and powerfully promises his hearers, "Come to me, all you who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest" (Matthew XI). But on the contrary, he receives his bread nearby and does not bring it across seas from afar, who appears to live justly purely for human approval. By no intuition of enduring life does he strive to surpass and trample upon those things that are slipping away excessively. Of such people, He himself terrifyingly thunders, "Verily I say to you, they have received their reward." And she rises while it is still night and gives prey to her household, etc. Just as the whole course of the fading world is varied by the alternating presence of day and night, and indeed, the day is naturally made for working, not resting, so the whole time of the present Church is distinguished by a certain dual state of rest and work. It is as if she rests at night when some of her faithful, having momentarily dropped external concerns, begin to care for themselves spiritually or secretly exercise themselves in studies such as sacred readings, orations, and tears. But she rises while it is still night, when she earnestly girds herself in the same faithful to also care for others, which work of brotherly administration she customarily exercises in two ways, both by calling those who wandered outside to the grace of faith, and by continually stirring those who are already imbued with the sacraments of faith to more diligently insist on good works. Hence it is well said, "She gave prey to her household, and food to her maidservants." She gives prey to her household when she is able to teach to snatch them from the old enemy, reconciling them to the society of those who preceded them in faith. She also gives food to her maidservants, when she refreshes the humble and those maintaining a due fear, with the reminder of the heavenly reward, lest they grow weary under pious labor.
