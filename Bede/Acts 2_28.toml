For You have made known to me the paths of life, by which we proceed to eternity. In these, after the sorrow of passion, You will fill me with joy with Your face (Psalm XV). And ascending to heaven, You will give the delights of Your right hand continually. Because He was neither left in Hell. Thus Christ indeed descended according to the soul to Hell, to aid those who needed it, but He was not left in Hell, for He quickly returned to claim His resurrected body.
