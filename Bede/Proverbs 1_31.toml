Therefore they will eat the fruit of their way. Their way, he says, of which he had spoken above: For their feet run to evil. Because, he says, they did not want to enter my ways that they might live, they will receive the reward of their ways, to perish eternally. But on the other hand, of those who fear the Lord, who walk in His ways, it is said: You will eat the labors of your fruits; blessed are you, and it will be well with you. And they will be satisfied with their own counsels. Because they refused to acquiesce to my counsel, by which I had decreed to save them, they will be satisfied with their own; with which they said, Let us hide snares against the innocent in vain; with which they chose a robber for themselves over the Savior, so that they might be destroyed by robbers, and condemned among robbers. This can also be understood of all despilers of the word of God, as in other things. The turning away of little ones will kill them. He calls little ones not by age, but by sense, to whom it was said above: How long, little ones, will you love childishness? who could have been not little ones, but perfect in senses if they had not turned away from the counsel of wisdom. But as they had turned away, they destined themselves to eternal death. And the prosperity of fools will destroy them. When they accomplish their acts, hindered by no adversities, which meditating they say: We will find all precious substance. Likewise: The turning away of little ones will kill them, and the prosperity of fools will destroy them, because often a spirit turned away from the fear of the Creator, already suffers from the wrath of the same just Creator, so that in what they sin, they seem to endure nothing adverse. But as blessed Job says, Let him lead his days in goods, and in a moment descend to hell (Job. XXI).
