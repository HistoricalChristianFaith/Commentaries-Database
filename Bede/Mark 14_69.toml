Again, when the maid saw him, she began to say to those standing around: This man is one of them. But he denied it again. The one accusing him now should not be believed to be the same as before. For Matthew says very clearly: When he went out to the gate, another saw him and said to those who were there (Matthew 26), etc. From this denial of Peter, we learn not only that Christ is denied by someone who says He is not Christ, but also by someone who, when He is, denies that he himself is a Christian. However, the Lord did not say to Peter: You will deny my disciple, but: You will deny me. So he denied Him when he denied being His disciple.
