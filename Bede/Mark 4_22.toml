For nothing is hidden, except to be made manifest; nor is anything secret, except to come to light. He says, do not be ashamed of the Gospel of God, but among the darkness of persecutors, raise the light of the word upon the candlestick of your body, retaining with a steadfast mind that day of ultimate recompense, where the Lord will illuminate the hidden things of darkness, and will reveal the thoughts of hearts. For then both praise from God awaits you, and eternal punishment for the adversaries of the truth.
