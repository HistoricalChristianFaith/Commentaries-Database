This verse causes a problem when we remember that the Lord promises that those who are pure in heart will see God and tells the saints that their angels are constantly gazing at the face of God in heaven. John repeats this phrase in his Gospel, where he adds that the only-begotten Son has seen the Father and has made him known to us. Our blessed father Ambrose expounded this as follows: “No one has ever seen God because no one has ever comprehended the fullness of the divinity which dwells in him, either with his mind or with his eye. For the verb see implies both physical and mental perception.” It is therefore clear that here we are not talking about physical sight so much as about mental perception, and our minds are incapable of ever grasping the fullness of God’s being.
