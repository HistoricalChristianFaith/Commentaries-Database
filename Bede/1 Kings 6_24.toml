Wings when used as a figure of holy people signify their virtues whereby they delight in always flying to heavenly things and passing their lives in preoccupation with these things. But when wings are used to signify angels, what do they more aptly demonstrate than the grace of perpetual and unfailing happiness of those who persevere continually in heavenly things in the service of their Creator? Or at all events because they are endowed with the lightness of spiritual nature so that they can get to wherever they want, as it were, by flying, they are here both figuratively represented with wings and actually shown with wings. Now it has been well said: “One wing of the cherub was five cubits, and the other wing of the cherub five cubits,” since the angelic powers keep with untiring devotion the law of God which is written in five books, that is, by loving the Lord their God with all their strength and by loving their neighbors as themselves. “For love is the fulfilling of the law. Now “their neighbors” includes both the angelic spirits themselves reciprocally and elect human beings who are equally their fellow citizens. So the reason each wing is said to be of the same dimensions is that with the same devotion as they love each other in God they also long for our company as we ascend to them, and so two wings together take up ten cubits when, in a twofold demonstration of love, the angels rejoice in the presence of their Maker.
