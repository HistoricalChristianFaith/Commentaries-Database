But the waters went back and decreased until the tenth month. The time of the tenth month can signify that period during which the saints enter the joys of eternal light with the Lord. For He also in the Gospel by the name of the denarius, which was to be given to the laborers of the vineyard, intimates the perception of the same heavenly kingdom. For a denarius contains ten obols. So the waters go back, which had flooded the ark, and decrease until the tenth month, because the washing of baptism, where it has fulfilled its office in each of the faithful, ceases. For no one, if he has sinned, can be cleansed anew by the same font of sacred baptism; but it sends those already once washed and sanctified to the hope of heavenly life, when they come and appear before the face of God.

For on the first day of the tenth month, the mountain peaks appeared. The first day of the tenth month can be understood as the beginning of that eternal life, in which the saints, even while placed in this life, taste and see that the Lord is good. On this day, the mountain peaks appear because the more perfectly this is held in their pure hearts, the more clearly the empty heights of the world, which are inflated in vain, become apparent.
