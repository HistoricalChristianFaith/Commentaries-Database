It is an abomination to the Lord to have diverse weights, etc. For having diverse weights and a deceitful scale in one's heart means that while seeking pardon from the Lord for one's own sins, one is unwilling to forgive a man who has sinned against and repented toward oneself. He who is God strives to be moved to compassion by prayers; although he, being human, cannot be moved to mercy by any human prayers, that he may rightfully be abhorred by the Lord as an unjust weigher, since his injuries are measured as graver than those of the Lord: for example, he who does not wish to forgive one who has defiled his wife and asks to be forgiven himself, although he may have defiled a virgin espoused to Christ; or certainly, may have defiled his soul consecrated to God in baptism with some filth of vice.
