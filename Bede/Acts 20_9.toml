A certain young man named Eutychus was sitting at the window, etc. Eutychus in Hebrew means insane, in Greek lucky. One of these fits him who has fallen from the height of virtues due to youthful pleasure, the other to him who, by the preacher's condescension, will return to the height of virtues.

Awakened from sleep, he fell down from the third loft, etc. During the words of preaching, an opportunity for healing arose, so that the word might be strengthened by the sweetness of the miracle and the doctrine, and the labor of vigils might be warded off, and the memory of the teacher soon to depart might be more deeply impressed upon minds. Indeed, the three lofts in which Paul was disputing represent faith, hope, and charity. But the greatest of these is charity (1 Cor. 13). If anyone out of laziness deserts it, and does not fear to slumber among the voice of the Apostle, he will already be counted among the dead. For whoever offends in one point becomes guilty of all (James 2).

Awoken from sleep, he fell from the third loft. For the third loft, in Greek it is written "τριστέγου," which I wanted to mention so that the reader may know what is in Genesis, where Noah is ordered to build the ark: "Make in it lower, second, and third decks" (Gen. VI); for in Greek, "στέγη" means roof, and "τρίστεγα" means threefold roofs.
