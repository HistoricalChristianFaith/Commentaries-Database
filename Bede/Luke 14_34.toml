Salt is good: But if the salt has also lost its flavor, how shall it be seasoned? He refers to the preceding, where he commanded not only the beginning but also the completion of the tower of virtues. Indeed, it is good to hear the word of God, to more frequently season the hidden things of the heart with the salt of spiritual wisdom, even to become salt of the earth with the apostles, that is, to suffice for saturating the minds of those who still think of earthly things. But if anyone once enlightened by the seasoning of truth returns to apostasy, by what other teacher will he be corrected, who has rejected the sweetness of wisdom which he himself has tasted, whether terrified by worldly adversities or enticed by allurements? According to what some wise man said: Who will heal the enchanter bitten by the serpent? (Eccl. XII) By which sentence it is not undeservedly believed that Judas Iscariot and his companions themselves are designated, who, overcome by avarice, did not hesitate to betray his rank of apostleship and to hand over the Lord.
