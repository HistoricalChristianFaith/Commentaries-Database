For everyone (he says) who asks receives, and he who seeks finds, and to him who knocks it will be opened. Therefore, according to the previous parable of the requesting friend, perseverance is required so that we may receive what we ask, find what we seek, and have opened what we knock on. For if it is given to the one who asks, and the seeker finds, and it is opened to the one who knocks, therefore, to whom it is not given, who does not find, and to whom it is not opened, it is clear that he did not ask, seek, or knock properly.
