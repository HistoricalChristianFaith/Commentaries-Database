“And when they had descended to the edge of the city, Samuel said to Saul, ‘Tell the lad to go on ahead of us and pass over, but you stay here a little bit so that I may tell you the word of the Lord.’ ” Although the Lord took on humility and poverty for us and showed himself as a despised man and the least among the citizens of the world and taught that his followers ought also to be poor in spirit, nonetheless he did not at once undergo death, although often godless men were plotting it, but according to the oracles of the prophets. It was the prophets’ duty (and John too is to be counted a prophet) to precede him and be his obedient servants and to call their hearers to pass over from vices to virtues, from death to life. However, Christ himself stood still in the world for a little while as those prophets were departing until he could fulfill the word of the father concerning himself declared to his faithful through the prophets. - "Four Books on 1 Samuel 2.9"
