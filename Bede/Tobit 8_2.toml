And the Lord, as he is about to receive the church from the Gentiles as his bride, bids it at first betrothal (in the person of each individual believer) to renounce Satan and all his works and all his pomps, and then to confess its faith in the holy Trinity for the remission of sins, which is the significance of burning up with live coals the innermost entrails of the fish. - "On Tobit 8.2"
