Therefore, I have sworn to the house of Eli, etc. The house of Eli according to the letter could not be cleansed by the blood of victims, which the iniquity of his sons polluted, but nevertheless, it was cleansed by the blood of martyrdom when so many priests of his lineage were innocently destroyed in the city of Nob for the sake of the grace of paternal hospitality (1 Kings 22). According to the consequence of allegory, the iniquity of the house of Eli, indeed of the whole house of Israel, could not be entirely cleansed by any kind of sacrifices or gifts of good action, until the Lamb of God came, who takes away the sins of the world. For only the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanses us from all iniquity (John 1).
