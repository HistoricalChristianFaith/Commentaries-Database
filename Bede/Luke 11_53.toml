When He said these things to them, the Pharisees and the experts in the law began to fiercely oppose Him and to press upon His mouth, laying traps for Him about many things, and seeking to catch something out of His mouth, so that they might accuse Him. The crimes of their perfidy, simulation, and impiety they themselves attest to have truly heard, who, at such a thundering storm, do not repent themselves, but plan to attack the teacher of truth with treachery.
