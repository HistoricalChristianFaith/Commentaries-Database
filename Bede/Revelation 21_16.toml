[The twelve thousand stadia] means that he looked upon the church in her faith and works and made her to be perfect. For the perfection of the four cardinal virtues is lifted up by the faith in the holy Trinity, and so by the number twelve the dignity of the church is indicated.… “Its length and breadth and height are equal.” This signifies the stability of unconquered truth by which the church, supported by the length of faith, the breadth of love and the height of hope, is not allowed to be blown about by every wind of doctrine. Were she to lack any one of these, the perfect stability of the church would not exist.
