This vision corresponds to the hymn. For in order that the Lord might be adored by all nations, the temple of the mysteries of God, once enclosed in the walls of one city, now begins to be opened spiritually to the whole world. “Out of the temple came the seven angels with the seven plagues.” This is what Mark spoke about, “And they went forth and preached everywhere.” They are “robed in a pure white stone,” for as the apostle says, “For as many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ.” Christ himself is the elect chief Cornerstone. Or, if one should understand the singular [stone] to represent a plural, the stone signifies the various beauties of the virtues. Another rendering has “white linen.” This would indicate the mortification of the flesh that our teachers endure. It says, “I pommel my body and subdue it to servitude, lest after preaching to others, I myself should be disqualified.” “Their breasts were girded with golden girdles.” Whoever desires to preach mighty things, let him not only mortify the body but also bind his breast with the gold of wisdom. Or, to bind the breast with golden girdles is to bind every movement of our changeable thoughts by the chain of love alone.
