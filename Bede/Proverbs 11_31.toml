“If the righteous receives [retribution] on earth, how much more the wicked and sinner?” This is to say clearly, “If the frailty of mortal life is so great that not even the righteous who are to be crowned in heaven pass through this life without tribulations on account of the countless slips of [our] flawed nature, how much more do those who are cut off from heavenly grace await the certain outcome of their everlasting damnation?

If the just on earth receive, etc. If the holy martyrs endured so much as the just, how much torment do you think awaits those who unjustly afflicted them? If Job and Tobit, and others chosen by God, received so many adversities in this life, why are you troubled if a slight affliction reaches you, who lie so far beneath their traces? And indeed you, even if you should not say and believe that you are impious, you should not deny that you are a sinner, that is, to have some sins, small or great, open or hidden. Rather, you must confess so as not to deceive yourself, and the truth may not be in you (1 John 1). If, therefore, the just received on earth, Abel the martyr and Job the example of patience, how much more the impious, Antiochus and Herod! And sinners in the Gospel, the paralytics, could be healed by the Lord only after their sins were first forgiven. Note that Peter, in his Epistle according to the old translation, placed this sentence, saying: And if the righteous scarcely be saved, where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear (1 Peter 4)?
