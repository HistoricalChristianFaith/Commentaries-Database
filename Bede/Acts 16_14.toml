And a certain woman named Lydia, a dealer in purple, of the city of Thyatira, a worshipper of God, heard, etc. He says “a dealer in purple” meaning a seller of purple, as we also find in another translation, which in Greek is called πορφυρόπωλις. Properly, however, the woman who first believed with the Apostle preaching in Illyricum is said to be a dealer in purple. It signifies the Church, which is accustomed to sell, as it were, purple, because it does not hesitate to shed its blood for Christ, so that through this it can obtain eternal life. Indeed, purple rightly designates the shedding and color of blood, and by the property of its nature, which is made from the blood of shellfish. Lydia, however, forced the Apostle and his companions to enter her house and to stay there, because the Church received the preaching of the gospel with internal devotion of the heart, despite being rejected by the Jews.
