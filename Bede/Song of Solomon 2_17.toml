“Until the day breathes and the shadows lengthen,” that is, until the eternal light of the coming age appears and the shadows of the present life, that is, the ignorance or error whereby even many of us faithful who have the use of the lamp of God’s word are temporarily darkened, lengthen and disappear. - "Commentary on the Songs of Songs 2.2.17"
