Anxiety in a man's heart weighs him down, etc. Because it is necessary that first the sinner be healthily humbled by the anxiety of repentance, and then afterward by the judgment of the priest, the word of given reconciliation may bring joy. He who neglects loss for the sake of a friend, is just. If this is rightly said about the general giving of money and a pure man friend, how much more is he worthy of the crown of justice who, for the sake of Him who said, I tell you, my friends, do not be terrified by those who kill the body, either selling what he possesses, gives to the poor, or receives the plundering of his goods with joy, or certainly, in passion, hands over his flesh to be mortified or killed!
