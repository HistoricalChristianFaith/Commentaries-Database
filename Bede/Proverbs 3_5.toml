Trust in the Lord with all your heart, etc. Do not be afraid that you cannot observe the divine commands due to your own weakness, nor again suppose that you can fulfill them by your own strength, or know them by your natural knowledge if you are not instructed by his law; but rather seek his frequent help both in learning and in doing, and he, being gracious, will grant that you can fulfill what he commands.
