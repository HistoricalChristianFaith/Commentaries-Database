In the performance of this miracle Jesus requested silence. Yet it did not remain concealed in silence for long. So it is with the called people of Godâ€”while following his precepts and example, they may prefer their responsible actions to remain unspoken, yet for the benefit of others providence may allow them to become known contrary to their own wishes.
