Josephus also writes about this Gaulanite of the city Gamala who, when he was drawn into the undertaking by a certain Pharisee called Sadducus, urged the people not to lose their freedom by paying tribute to the Romans, “showing from the law” that the Lord alone was to be served and that they who were bringing tithes to the temple should not pay tribute to Caesar. “This heretical sect grew so large that it even stirred up a large part of the Pharisees and the people, so that” they believed that “the Lord Christ should be asked, ‘Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar or not?’ ”
