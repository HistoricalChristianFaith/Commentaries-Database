He said to all: If anyone wishes to come after me, let him deny himself. He aptly added, to all, because the previous matters about the faith of the Lord's birth or passion, he dealt with only with his separate disciples. But then we deny ourselves when we avoid what we have been through oldness, and strive for what we are called through newness. Therefore, let Truth say, let it say: If anyone wishes to come after me, let him deny himself.

And let him take up his cross daily, and follow me. For the cross is borne in two ways, when either the body is affected through abstinence, or the soul is afflicted through compassion for a neighbor. Let us consider how Paul bore his cross in both ways, who said: I buffet my body, and bring it into servitude, lest after preaching to others, I myself might be rejected (I Cor. IX). Behold, in the affliction of the body, we heard the cross of the flesh; now in the compassion for the neighbor, let us hear the cross of the mind. He says: Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who is scandalized, and I do not burn (II Cor. XI)? But in both cases of bearing the cross, it is to be noted that we are commanded to bear it daily, and having taken it up, to follow the Lord.
