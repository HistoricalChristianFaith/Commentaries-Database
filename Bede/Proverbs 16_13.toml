The will of kings is just lips. He speaks of holy kings who primarily command over vices and are accustomed to be surrounded by the ranks of virtues of the soul as of obedient companions. Of whom the Lord says, Many prophets and kings have desired to see what you see and have not seen it (Matthew XIII). Otherwise, earthly kings often detest just lips, as Herod of John, for which he punished him with death.

Whoever speaks rightly will be guided. So that, namely, with the right steps of deeds he may reach eternal life. But on the contrary, the talkative man will not be guided on the earth. Nor does this statement contradict what is said of Antiochus, And deceit in his hand will be directed. For Scripture did not say that that man, whom it foresaw to be perverse and wicked, would be directed; but it says, deceit in his hand will be directed, because indeed the frauds and crimes which he planned, without anyone hindering, he brought to the effect he intended; yet having accomplished them, he himself perished forever as he deserved.
