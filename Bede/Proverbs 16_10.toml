Divination is on the lips of the king, etc. He signifies that king, of whom it was said, God, give your judgment to the king (Psalm XVII). For who among temporal kings never errs in judgment? In whose lips is divination, because He not only directs His own words and deeds, but also controls what the soothsayers of the Gentiles, commonly called diviners, may answer to those who inquire; as evidenced by the prophet Micaiah, who testifies that a spirit was sent from the throne of the supreme judge to fill the mouths of his prophets and to arm them with the persuasion of things by which the wicked king would perish. For indeed the mouth of the Eternal King did not err in this judgment but permitted the erring prophets to speak to the impious king what he deserved to hear due to his previous sins. But also, Ezekiel says to the sinning and perishing people of the Ammonites, When you were seeing falsehood, and divining lies (Ezekiel XXI, 29). There is not the divination of demons, but the judgment of God; who put an end to perfect malice. Another translation of this verse has it more clearly of the Lord: Nothing false will come from His mouth; for He neither can be deceived by any lying, nor can He ever lie.
