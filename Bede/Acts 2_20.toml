The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood. This is believed to have been partly fulfilled during the Lord's Passion, and partly to occur before the great day, that is, the Day of Judgment. For at that time the sun was darkened, but the moon, turned into blood, could not plainly appear to men, since it was (as it happens during Passover) the fifteenth day, and during the day it was hidden from mortal sight by the obstruction of the earth.

The sun will be turned into darkness. The name of darkness in Greek is read in the singular number, that is, σκότος, which the Latin translator necessarily rendered in the plural as tenebras because he could not express it in the singular. I thought it necessary to mention this so that anyone who reads this among the people of the Angles might know that it is not necessary, because of the authority of the Latin language, to render "darkness" in their own speech in the plural; rather, it should be in the singular, as this can just as easily be done owing to the authority of the Greek, from which it was translated into Latin scripture.
