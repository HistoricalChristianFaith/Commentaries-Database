The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood. This is believed to have been partly fulfilled during the Lord's Passion, and partly to occur before the great day, that is, the Day of Judgment. For at that time the sun was darkened, but the moon, turned into blood, could not plainly appear to men, since it was (as it happens during Passover) the fifteenth day, and during the day it was hidden from mortal sight by the obstruction of the earth.
