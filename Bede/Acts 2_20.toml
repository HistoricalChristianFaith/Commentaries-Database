This is believed partly as something that had been done at the Lordâ€™s passion and partly as something to be done in the future, before the great day of the Lord, that is, the day of judgment. For at that earlier time [of the passion], the sun was darkened, but the turning of the moon into blood could not have appeared openly to humankind, for inasmuch as it was then, at Passover, in the fifteenth [day of the lunar month], the moon was hidden by day from the sight of mortals by the interposition of the earth.
