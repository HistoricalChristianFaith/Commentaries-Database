And behold, men brought on a bed a man who was paralyzed, and they sought to bring him in and lay him before Him. The healing of this paralytic indicates the salvation of a soul sighing for Christ after a long period of carnal indolence. First of all, it needs ministers to lift it and bring it to Christ, that is, good teachers who offer the hope of healing and the help of intercession. These, according to Mark, are found to be four, either because the strength of all preachers and every word is confirmed by the four books of the Gospel, or because there are four virtues by which the confidence of the mind is uplifted to obtain healing. About which it is said in praise of eternal wisdom: “For she teaches temperance and prudence, justice and courage, which are more profitable than anything in life for men” (Wis. 8). Some refer to them with other names: prudence, fortitude, temperance, and justice.
