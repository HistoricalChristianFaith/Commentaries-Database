To walk in long clothing is to go forth into public clad in garments too much ornamented, in which amongst other things, that rich man, who fared sumptuously every day, is said to have sinned.
But they do not only seek for praise from men, but also for gain. Where there follows, “Which devour widows’ houses, under the pretence of long prayers.” For there are men who pretending to be just hesitate not to receive money from persons who are troubled in conscience, as though they would be their advocates in the judgment. A hand stretched outto the poor is always an accompaniment to prayer, but these men pass the night in prayer, that they may take away money from the poor.
