For the fact that each of the four rows worn on the chest contains three stones corresponds to the sequence of the yearly cycle, which is divided into four seasons of three months each. Now in the Scriptures the entire year is designated as the time of our salvation, in which we strive for an eternal reward. As the Savior bears witness, he was sent in accordance with the saying of Isaiah to preach the acceptable year of the Lord and the day of recompense. The psalmist also sings to him concerning the same year, saying, “You bless the crown of the year with your goodness.” For in the present time he gives them the goodness of right faith and works, and on the day of recompense he will give the crown of everlasting blessing.
