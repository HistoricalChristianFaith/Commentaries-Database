A diligent woman is a crown to her husband, etc. The meaning of the letter is evident because a good and chaste woman gives honor to her husband in all things, and by well managing the household with his virtues, she, as it were, adds grace to the crown; but indeed an adulteress, although she may appear beautiful outwardly, internally defiles her limbs with the stench of luxury. Indeed, spiritually, the Church offers Christ a crown, none other than herself.

For all who are around him, etc. And the son of Sirach concerning the high priest: He himself standing next to the altar, and around him a crown of brothers. But the bones, that is, the virtues, which can be seen in the faction of heretics, the rot of evil doctrine corrupts.
