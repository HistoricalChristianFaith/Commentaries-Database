[[commentary]]
quote='''
To him who overcomes I will give hidden manna. He who despises the enticement of the flesh, although hypocrites may urge it, will justly be filled with the sweetness of the invisible bread that came down from heaven.

And I will give him a white stone. That is, a body now made white by baptism, then shining with the glory of incorruption.

And on the stone a new name written. That we may be called and may be the sons of God.

What no one knows except the one who receives it. Because he who says he knows God and does not keep His commandments is a liar. The hypocrite does not taste how sweet the Lord is.
