Stay with me, do not be afraid, etc. Remain, he said, in my love; do not be afraid of those who kill the body: if they persecuted me, they will also persecute you; but where I am, there will my servant also be; if anyone serves me, my Father will honor him (John XV; Matthew X; John XII). This betrayal and the attack by Doeg the Edomite, and during the times of the Lord and the Apostles in Judas Iscariot and other false brothers, and at the end of the world in the very Antichrist greater than the others, can be understood, in the manner of the fifty-first psalm, which is sung in reference to him, is not inappropriately applied to that enemy, as the title says: To the end, for understanding by David himself, when Doeg the Edomite came and reported to Saul, and said: Behold, David is in the house of Ahimelech; where “for understanding by David himself” is placed at the beginning not for any other reason than to signify that David understood among the hardships he suffered innocently, what wickedness would be plotted against the true David to be born from his seed by the scheming of the wicked. For he did come, boasting in malice, powerful in iniquity, thinking of injustice all day long, and the rest, which he added in the psalm. He who understood these things through the Spirit, burdened by sins and to be burdened by punishments, Judas announced to the Jews, and said: Behold, Jesus is accustomed to frequenting the garden of the Mount of Olives with his disciples. For from the ultimate tribulation how this title should be understood, clearly shows from what has been discussed above. But since we have extended our discourse and dictated a longer third book in the exposition of blessed Samuel, both second and first, we think it fitting to put an end to this labor with the triumph of the martyrs among the priests, and judging it proper to cease from the work for a time to recover strength in silence.
