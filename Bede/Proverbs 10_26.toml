Just as vinegar to the teeth, etc. Just as the treachery of heretics generates trouble and tears for good teachers, so a Catholic living badly is a burden through laziness to those who have been commanded to show their faith through works. For the eyes and teeth are the preachers of the holy Church, who are accustomed to foresee right ways for her and to supply spiritual nourishment. But vinegar, which degenerates from wine, and smoke, which rises from fire and vanishes, figuratively denote those who, withdrawing from ecclesiastical sweetness and charity through pride or sloth, also attack it with words. Of such, John says, "They went out from us, but they were not of us," and so on (1 John II).
