“And when Moses had gone up, a cloud covered the mountain.” Just as the mountain on which Moses received the law designates the height of the perfection that was written down in that law, so does the cloud that covered the mountain suggest the grace of divine protection, which is enjoyed more and more the higher one ascends in order to search out the wonders of God’s law, as the eyes of one’s heart are opened. For surely the cloud covered not only the mountain on which Moses went up, but also the people who were traveling through the wilderness. They were by no means able to ascend to the higher regions, but the cloud sent from heaven overshadowed them nevertheless. Hence it is written that “he spread out a cloud for their protection,” since the Lord surely protects with heavenly benediction “all those who fear him, both small and great.”
