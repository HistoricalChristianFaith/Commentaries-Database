Samuel grew, etc. The preaching of the Gospel grew, and God was in Christ, reconciling the world to himself. The reputation of Jesus grew, and it spread throughout all Syria. Hence John said: He must increase (John 3); and concerning the passing away of the old law like Eli, he immediately added: But I must decrease.

And not a word from Him fell to the ground. You will find nothing earthly in the words of the Lord, nor will any of those who think earthly things understand His spiritual sayings. Or certainly it should be said that the Lord, while dwelling in the flesh, deferred the delivery of His word to the Gentiles, who, in comparison to the Jews, were like earth to heaven, yet later He deemed it worthy to call them to faith through the apostles.
