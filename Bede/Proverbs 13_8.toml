As Solomon says, “A man’s own wealth is the redemption of his soul.” This might be temporal wealth which one distributes and gives to the poor so that one’s righteousness may endure forever, or it might be spiritual wealth in the form of the righteousness that one has attained by taking pity on the poor or by doing other good things.

"The ransom of a man's life is his wealth," etc. Therefore, whoever wants his soul to be redeemed from future wrath should gather the riches of good works. For he who lacks these kinds of wealth cannot endure the rebuke of the strict judge. The Psalmist prays about this, saying: "Lord, do not rebuke me in your anger, nor chasten me in your wrath" (Psalm 38). Otherwise, the poor in spirit are not rebuked by the Lord there but receive the blessing of an eternal inheritance.
