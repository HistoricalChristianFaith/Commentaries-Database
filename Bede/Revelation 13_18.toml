number: This number among the Greeks, is said to be found in the name of Titan, that is, &quot;a giant,&quot; in this manner, - T three hundred, E five, I ten, T three hundred, A one, N fifty. And it is thought that Antichrist will usurp this name, as if he excelled al in power, boasting also that he is the one of whom it was written, &quot;He rejoiced as a giant to run his course. His going forth is from the highest heaven.&quot; And Primasius also mentions another name, which contains the same number, - A one, N fifty, T three hundred, E five, M forty, O seventy,  two hundred, which signifies, &quot;contrary to honour.&quot; Besides there is the word, - A one, P one hundred, N fifty, O seventy, Y four hundred, M forty, E five, that is, &quot;I deny.&quot; By these, both the character of the person and the asperity of the work of Antichrist are indicated. But how so great a coveter of praise should be willing to be denoted by such a mark, requires a lengthened exposition. Otherwise: who is ignorant, that the number six, in accordance with which the world was created, signifies the perfection of work? And this, whether simple, or multiplied by ten, or a hundred, demonstrates the fruit of the same perfection to be sixty-fold, or a hundred-fold. The weight of gold also which was brought to Solomon every year was six hundred and sixty-six thousand talents. The seducer, therefore, will presume to exact for himself the offering which is rightfully due and paid to the true king.                 <a
