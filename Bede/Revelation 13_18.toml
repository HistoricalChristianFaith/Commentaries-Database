Here is wisdom. Let him who has understanding, etc. This number is said to be found among the Greeks in the name Titan, that is, giant, as follows: Τ equals 300, Ε equals 5, Ι equals 10, Τ equals 300, Α equals 1, Ν equals 50. It is thought that the Antichrist will assume this name as if he surpasses all in power, boasting that he is the one of whom it is written: He rejoiced as a giant to run his course, from one end of the heaven is his going forth, etc. (Psalm XVIII). Primasius also mentions another name that completes the same number: Α equals 1, Ν equals 50, Τ equals 300, Ε equals 5, Μ equals 40, Ο equals 70, Σ equals 200, which signifies "contrary to honor." Also, the word Α equals 1, Ρ equals 100, Ν equals 50, Ο equals 70, Υ equals 400, Μ equals 40, Ε equals 5, meaning "I deny." Through these, the quality of the person and the harshness of the Antichrist's work are indicated. However, a complex exposition is needed to explain how such an aspirant to praise would want to be marked with such a character. Otherwise, who does not know that the number six, by which the world was made, signifies the perfection of the work? Whether simple, or multiplied by ten or a hundred, it demonstrates the perfection of the sixtieth and the hundredfold fruit. Moreover, the weight of gold that came to Solomon each year was six hundred sixty-six talents. Therefore, what is rightly owed and paid as tribute to the true king, that same tribute the deceiving tyrant will presume to demand.
