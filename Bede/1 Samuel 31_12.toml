And they walked all night, etc. When the inhabitants of the city of Christ situated on the mountain, Judea, from which they recollected heralds and ministers of salvation had come to them in patriarchs, prophets, and apostles, were treated with contempt and ridicule by the gentiles, they rose to the work of the word, all zealously rejoicing to act; and amidst the darkness of erring ones themselves walking the path of virtues, they forbade rejoicing in the public insultation of those whose fault brought salvation to the gentiles as if pertaining to the house of the devil. They say, if the first fruit be holy, so also is the lump; and if the root be holy, so also are the branches. But if some of the branches have been broken off, and you, being a wild olive tree, were grafted in among them, and made a partaker of the root and fatness of the olive tree, do not boast against the branches (Rom. XI), and the other things which the Apostle miraculously and elaborately addressed to the Romans.

They came to Jabesh and burned them there, etc. The corpses, carnal or fleshly bones, signify the strongest and the works of virtues. Therefore, they burned the corpses of Saul and his sons, who left the weaknesses of the downfall of the Jews to divine judgment, so that they might understand that these things were done or permitted according to the depths of the riches of the wisdom and knowledge of God (Rom. XII), according to the inscrutable counsel of His will. Indeed, we must understand the burning in this place according to that which is commanded regarding the receiving and searching of the sacraments of the Lord's passion under the type of eating the lamb: If anything remains, you shall burn it with fire (Exod. XII). They buried the bones in the forest of Jabesh, as when they found any strength and firmness in the weak, they did not despise them as worthless, but preferred to add them to the fruitful works of the saints; if they knew any among the carnal and frail to strive for the virtues of the soul, they took care to number them with the fellowship of the saints. For indeed, the fruit of good works is known to be expressed through the forest, which in reading Genesis, understands what or what kind of forest Abraham planted in Beersheba. Otherwise, Saul, dead and ridiculed for his sins, is rescued from public disgrace by the men of Jabesh, whom he saved. The corpse is burned, and the bones are placed in the forest; for it is indeed fitting, that if any of the faithful and great men, overcome by sin, incur spiritual death, they may be helped especially by those whom he benefited in goodness, so that he may be able to revive, and that his carnal [deeds] may be revealed by their most fervent prayers in compunction, and his spiritual deeds may be commended to their Creator, worthy of His kindness.
