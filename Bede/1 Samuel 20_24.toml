David therefore hid in the field, etc. Christ is hidden in Christians by faith so that He might not be seen by those who have learned only to know, believe, and love earthly and temporal things; and times have come in which the splendor of the Church would more and more increase through the touch of the new Sun of righteousness: and the people of the Jews sat among those who rejoiced more in the pride of an earthly kingdom than in being humbled for a heavenly one, to enjoy the feasts of sacred readings.
