And the borders of Canaan extended from Sidon as one enters Gerar, reaching to Gaza, until one enters Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboiim, as far as Lasha. The ancient translation has Lyce for Lasha. It is now called Callirhoe, where hot springs flow into the Dead Sea. Therefore, Sidon was the boundary of the Canaanites to the north, Gerar to the south, Gaza near Egypt."
