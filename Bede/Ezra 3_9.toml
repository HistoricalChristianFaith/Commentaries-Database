When I heard this speech, I tore my cloak and tunic, and pulled hair from my head and beard, and sat down in sorrow. Through the sombre garb of a mourner Ezra reveals the inmost anguish of his heart. He tears his clothing, pulls out hair from his head and beard, and sits down in sorrow in order that by such defilement of his body and clothing along with the sadness of his face, he may more swiftly rouse the minds of all to repentance of their own or their brethren's sin.
