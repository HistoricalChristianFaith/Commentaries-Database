And he set out to go to Macedonia. After he had toured those parts and had exhorted them with many words, he came to Greece. Greece is a province of Achaia, which the Greeks call ἑλλάδα. Hence, where Latin Codices have Greeks or, to distinguish them from Jews, Gentiles, the Greek text writes ἕλληνας and ἑλληνιστὰς. So after Macedonia, Paul came to this place, because he intended, as said above, to pass from Macedonia and Achaia and to go to Jerusalem.
