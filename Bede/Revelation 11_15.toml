The seventh trumpet reveals the day of judgment in which the Lord will reward his own followers and banish those who have corrupted the earth.â€¦ The six previous trumpets, corresponding to the periods of the present age, proclaimed the course of the various struggles of the church. This seventh trumpet is the messenger of the eternal sabbath and of the victory and dominion of the true King.
