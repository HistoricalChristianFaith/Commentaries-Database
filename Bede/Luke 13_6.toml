He also spoke this parable. A certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard. This fig tree could indeed represent human nature. Well planted, that is, created in the likeness of its author. But when God sought fruit from it for three years, it refused to give because it disdained to obey before the law, under the law, and under grace. But if you look higher, you will notice it, and if generally for all, especially it bears the type of the synagogue. For when that terrible and fearful sentence precedes: "If you do not repent, you will all likewise perish," immediately he adds the parable of the unfruitful and to be uprooted tree, very clearly teaching those to whom he spoke, like the unfruitful fig tree, that if they did not repent, they would be cut down. Therefore, the vineyard of the Lord of Hosts is the house of Israel, as we are taught by the song of Isaiah. But the synagogue established in the same house is the fig tree in the vineyard. But he who allowed his vineyard to be plundered by travelers also commanded the fig tree to be cut down.

And he came seeking fruit on it, and found none. He who instituted the synagogue through Moses, the Lord born in the flesh appeared, and frequently teaching in the synagogue, sought the fruit of faith, but found it not in the minds of the Pharisees.
