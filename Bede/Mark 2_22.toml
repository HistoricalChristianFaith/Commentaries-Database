But in a mystical sense, it may thus be expressed; that the disciples of John and the Pharisees fast, because everyman who boasts of the works of the law without faith, who follows the traditions of men, and receives the preaching of Christ with his bodily ear, and not by the faith of the heart, keeps aloof from spiritual goods, and wastes away with a fasting soul. But he who is incorporated into the members of Christby a faithful love cannot fast, because he feasts upon His Body and Blood. It goes on, “No one seweth a piece of "rough, that is, “new, cloth on an old garment: else the new piece that fillet hit up taketh away from the old, and the rent is made worse.”.
Neither was it fitting to sew on anew piece; that is, a portion of doctrine which teaches a general fast from allthe joy of temporal delights; for if this be done, the teaching is rent, and agrees not with the old part. But by a new garment is intended good works, which are done externally, and by the new wine, is expressed the fervour of faith, hope, and charity, by which we are reformed in our minds.
