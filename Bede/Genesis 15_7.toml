And he said to him: I am the Lord, who brought you out of Ur of the Chaldeans, to give you this land to possess it. Some think Ur is the name of a place, but because Ur is interpreted as Fire, it is better understood according to the tradition of the Hebrews, as we said above, that he was rescued from the fire of the Chaldeans, who wanted to consume him with flames because he refused to worship and adore the fire which they worshipped as God. But, with God protecting him, they could not accomplish this.
