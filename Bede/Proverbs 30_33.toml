But he who presses the breasts strongly to extract milk, etc. We press the breasts strongly when we ponder the words of sacred speech with subtle understanding, by which pressure while we seek milk, we find butter, because while we seek to be nourished even with slight understanding, we are anointed with the richness of internal abundance: which is not to be done excessively nor always, lest while we seek milk, blood follows from the breasts, because while the words of the sacred text are dissected more than they should be, they fall into carnal understanding. For he who milks vehemently draws blood, because what is perceived from excessive examination of spirit becomes carnal.

And he who provokes anger, etc. What the preceding parable signified literally, it reveals, because he who speaks to his neighbor with modest words receives a pleasant response, as if he extracts butter from the breasts in which he was seeking milk. But with an inept word, he provokes anger and discord from a brother's heart, as if extracting words excessively results in finding blood instead of milk.
