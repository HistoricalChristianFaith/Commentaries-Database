And they went to the city where the man of God was. And the Lord came through the incarnation into the world, where at that time the greatest of the prophets, John the Baptist, was; with him also came those saints, not indeed being born again in the world they had already lived in and desired him to come; but by turning their mind to love him even in the flesh, whom they always spiritually loved in divine secrecy.
