[Paul] did not say this because he was stirred by passion in his mind. Rather, he surely spoke by way of prophesying, for, as a figure, that high priesthood that had been compared to the likeness of a whitewashed wall was to be struck and destroyed, since the true priesthood of Christ had now come with the apostles’ preaching of the gospel. And that is why he said, “God will strike you.” He did not say, “May God strike you.” In fact, he signified by the indicative mood that this thing was going to happen; he did not utter a curse by using the optative mood.
