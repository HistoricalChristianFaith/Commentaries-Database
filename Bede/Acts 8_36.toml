Here another translation, which follows the Greek model, has a few more verses in which it is written, “Behold, here is water. What is there to prevent my being baptized?” And Philip said to him, “If you believe with all your heart you will be saved.” And he answered and said, “I believe in Christ, the Son of God.” And he ordered the carriage to stop, and so forth. I believe that these verses were originally inserted in our version too, but through scribal error they were later removed.
