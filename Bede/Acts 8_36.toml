They came to a certain water. Even today there is a village called Bethsoro in the tribe of Judah, on the twentieth milestone of those going from Chebron of Elias. Near it, a fountain bubbling up at the roots of a mountain is absorbed by the soil from which it springs. In this place, the eunuch was baptized by Philip.

Who prohibits me from being baptized? And he commanded the chariot to stop, and the rest. Here another translation according to the Greek exemplar has a few more verses where it is written: Behold water, who prohibits me from being baptized? But Philip said to him: If you believe with all your heart, you will be saved. And responding, he said: I believe in Christ, the Son of God. And he commanded the chariot to stop, and the rest. I believe, therefore, that our own interpreter initially translated these verses as well, but they were later omitted due to the fault of the scribes.
