This means that whoever believes in the Son in such a way as to do what the Son commands has the witness of God in him and may be counted among the children of God. Jews and heretics are wasting their time when they claim to believe in God, because they reject Christ and refuse to believe in him. For whoever refuses to honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent him.
