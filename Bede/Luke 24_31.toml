And he vanished from their sight. And they said to one another, "Were not our hearts burning within us while he spoke to us on the way and opened the Scriptures to us?" "I have come to cast fire upon the earth, and how I wish it were already kindled (Luke 12:49)." The Lord indeed sent fire upon the earth when he kindled the hearts of the carnal with the breath of the Holy Spirit. And the earth burns when the hearts of the carnal, previously cold in their own pleasures, abandon the desires of the present age and are set aflame with the love of God. "Were not our hearts burning within us while he spoke to us on the way and opened the Scriptures to us?" they ask. For indeed, upon hearing the word, the mind ignites, the coldness of the body recedes, the mind becomes anxious with a desire for the heavenly, alien to earthly desires. True love which has filled this mind torments in tears. But while it is tormented with such ardor, it is fed by its very torments, it delights in hearing heavenly precepts, and as it is instructed by each commandment, it is as if it is set on fire by so many torches.
