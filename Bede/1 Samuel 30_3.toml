When David and his men came to the city, etc. The Lord, arriving in His elect and Catholic teachers, and seeing the towers and roofs of the Church once shining, leveled to the ground by heretical discourse, first, as is proper, beseeches the Father with tears and prayers for its restoration, and then promptly begins the task of restoration as well. The doctors lament for the churches and souls entrusted to them, which they had brought forth and nurtured for God, corrupted from the simplicity of faith for a time, due to the delayed help of Christ; this is to say, with the advent of David delayed for a time, their wives and children were taken captive. For if His assisting grace were present, they certainly could not have been corrupted.
