And those who dwelt in Mesopotamia, and in Judea, and Cappadocia. In this place, Judea does not signify the entire nation but a part of it, that is, the tribe of Judah and Benjamin, to distinguish, namely, from Samaria, Galilee, Decapolis, and other regions in the same province. Although they all spoke one Hebrew language, each had its own distinctive way of speaking. Hence also Peter, during the Lord's Passion, was identified as a Galilean by his speech.

And those who inhabit Mesopotamia, and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia, Phrygia and Pamphylia. These provinces which are named after Judea, indeed all speak Greek, but if they sounded nothing different from the custom of their homeland, they would not by any means be mentioned with such a subtle distinction of languages. Hence, the wondrous grace of the Spirit is to be seen in the apostles, which not only taught them the diversity of all languages, but also made the distinctiveness of properties in each language recognizable in their speech, according to the number of provinces that used it.
