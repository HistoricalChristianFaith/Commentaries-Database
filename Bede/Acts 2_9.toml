Judea does not signify the entire nation, but part of it, that is, the tribe of Judah and Benjamin, especially in distinction from Samaria, Galilee, Decapolis, and other regions in the same province. There, although all spoke one language, Hebrew, nevertheless each region had a distinct local way of talking. Proselytes, that is, foreigners, was the term applied to those who, although their origin was from the pagan nations, preferred to choose circumcison and Judaism.
