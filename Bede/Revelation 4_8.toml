eyes: The holy Church observes itself with vigilance, both before God and before men. The Psalmist had beheld its eyes within, when he says,&quot;All the glory of that daughter of kings is within;&quot; and its eyes without, when he adds immediately, &quot;clothed around with golden fringes in variety.&quot; Otherwise: whether thou shalt attend to the letter, or seek for an allegory, in the Gospel thou wilt always find light. Another translation has: &quot;Full of eyes before and behind;&quot; because the light of the Gospel both illumines the dark sayings of the Law, and pours upon it the brightness of a new grace.

wings: They raise the Church on high by the perfection of their doctrine. For the number six is called perfect, because it is the first which is made complete by its several parts, in that one which is the sixth part of six, and two which are the third, and three which are the half, make up the number six. Otherwise: the six wings of the four living creatures, which are twenty-four in number, intimate as many books of the Old Testament, by which the authority of the Evangelists is supported, and their truth proved.
