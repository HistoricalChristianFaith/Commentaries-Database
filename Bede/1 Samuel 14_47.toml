Against Moab and the sons of Ammon, and Edom, etc. Moab and Ammon, who were conceived by incest at night through the help of drunkenness, in which there is lust (Eph. V), signify heretics, degenerate by the disorderly reception of the seed of paternal faith. Edom, who, though the elder, was condemned to serve his younger brother, represents the Jewish people; who are subjected to the nations of the Gentiles throughout the world, both by the blindness of the perfidy of their minds and by the condition of earthly servitude. The kings of Zobah, the Philistines, and Amalek, about whom it is subsequently said.
