Cornelius sent three people to Peter because the Gentile world, which was to come to believe in the faith of the apostles, had subjugated Europe, Asia and Africa, which were to be taken over partly by militant zeal (that is, by urgent preaching) and partly by domestic business dealings. Note also that one soldier and two domestic servants were sent, for among the members of the church, the greater their strength, the fewer you will find. There are more who know how to hear the word than those who know how to speak it.
