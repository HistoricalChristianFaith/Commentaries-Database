But I will laugh at your calamity, etc. It is said likewise in the psalm about the same: He who dwells in the heavens laughs at them, and the Lord scoffs at them. Not because the Lord laughs with his mouth, or scoffs with his nose, but the power implied by such a word is that he granted to the apostles to foresee that the wicked would not succeed against him at all, beyond what he permitted, rather that all their endeavors would be in vain, while his glory would be spread over the world after his passion. Therefore, they would utterly disdain their pride, even when they saw it prevailing greatly.

When your fear comes as calamity. Saying to one another, If we let him go on like this, everyone will believe in him, and the Romans will come and take away both our place and our nation (John XI).
