And rising up, he came to his father. To come to the father is to be established in the Church through faith, where legitimate and fruitful confession of sins already may exist.

Yet while he was still far off. And before he could understand God, but nevertheless while he already piously sought Him.

His father saw him. For the impious and proud are fittingly said to not be seen, as if not held before the eyes. For someone held before the eyes is usually said to be one who is loved.

And he was moved with mercy, and running, fell on his neck. For the father did not desert the only-begotten Son, in whom he ran and descended even to our distant wandering. Because God was in Christ, reconciling the world to Himself (II Cor. V). And the Lord Himself said: The Father dwelling in me, He does the works (John XIV). What is it, then, to fall on his neck, but to incline and humble his arm in an embrace? And to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed? (John XII), which is indeed our Lord Jesus Christ.

And he kissed him. To be consoled by the word of God's grace unto the hope of the forgiveness of sins, that is, after long journeys remaining, to merit the kiss of charity from the father.
