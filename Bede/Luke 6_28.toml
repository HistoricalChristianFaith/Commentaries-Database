Bless those who curse you, pray for those who slander you. And the Apostle testifies that he and his like have done this, saying: We are reviled, and we bless. We are persecuted, and we endure it (I Cor. IV). But here the question arises, how this command of the Lord is not opposed to the fact that many imprecations against enemies, which are considered curses, are found in the prophets, such as: Let their table become a snare before them, and other things said there. The apostle John says: If anyone sees his brother sinning a sin not leading to death, he will ask, and He will give him life for those who commit sin not leading to death. There is a sin leading to death, I do not say that he should pray about that. First, it must be seen that the prophets, by way of imprecation, sang what was to come, not by the will of the one wishing, but by the spirit of foreseeing, who are accustomed to predict future things in the figure of one who is imprecating, just as often they sang of things to come in the figure of past time. Second, it must be understood from the words of the Apostle that there are certain brothers for whom we are not commanded to pray, since the Lord also commands us to pray even for our persecutors. This question cannot be resolved unless we admit that there are some sins among the brothers graver than the persecution by enemies. That brothers, however, signifies Christians can be proven by many teachings of the divine Scriptures. Therefore, I believe the sin of a brother leading to death is when, after the knowledge of God by the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, someone opposes the brotherhood, and against the very grace by which he was reconciled to God, he is agitated with the flames of envy. However, the sin not leading to death is if someone has not alienated love from a brother but has not exhibited the duties of brotherhood due to some weakness of mind. Wherefore the Lord also said on the cross: Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do (Luke XXIII). For they had not yet become partakers of the grace of the Holy Spirit, nor had they entered the fellowship of holy brotherhood. And blessed Stephen prays for those who were stoning him, because they had not yet believed in Christ, nor were they fighting against that common grace. And for this reason, I believe, the apostle Paul does not pray for Alexander because he was already a brother, and had sinned to death, i.e., oppressing the brotherhood with envy. But for those who had not broken off love but had succumbed out of fear, he prays that they be forgiven. So he says: Alexander the coppersmith did me much harm. May the Lord repay him according to his works; you too must beware of him, for he has greatly withstood our words (II Tim. IV). Then he adds, for whom he prays, saying: At my first defense no one stood with me, but all forsook me. May it not be charged against them (Ibid.). This is the distinction of sins, separating Judas who betrayed from Peter who denied.
