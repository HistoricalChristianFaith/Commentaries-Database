And Jesus said to him: No man, having put his hand to the plow, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God. To put one’s hand to the plow, is as if with a kind of instrument of compunction, with wood and iron to grind down the hardness of one's heart in the passion of the Lord, and open it to bring forth the fruits of good works. If anyone, having begun to cultivate this, in delight looks back at the vices he left behind with Lot’s wife, he is deprived of the gift of the future kingdom.
