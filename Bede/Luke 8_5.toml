“And as he sowed, some fell along the path and was trampled underfoot, and the birds of the air devoured it.” What the Lord explained must be received with pious faith. But those things that he left silent for our understanding must be briefly mentioned. The seed that fell along the path perished due to a double injury: it was trampled underfoot by passersby and snatched away by birds. Thus, the path is a heart worn and hardened by the frequent passage of evil thoughts, so it cannot accept and germinate the word's seed. Therefore, whatever good seed reaches the vicinity of such a path is trampled upon by wicked thoughts and taken away by demons. These are called the birds of the air, whether because they have a celestial and spiritual nature, or because they fly through the air.
