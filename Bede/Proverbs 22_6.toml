It is a proverb, Train up a child in the way he should go, etc. It is evident that many change from the vices they had as youths in old age, by the gift of the Lord, and conversely, some, by the Lord deserting them, abandon the virtues they seemed to have displayed in their youth. But because much more often each one is accustomed to follow the habits with which he was imbued from youth into the remaining time of his life, he says there is a proverb, because what anyone takes up in youth, he will not change in old age. However, he does not always confirm that it happens this way. Therefore, he posits this kind of proverb to persuade his listeners to pursue virtues from early age, lest perhaps in old age they are unable to learn pursuits which they despised to embrace in tender age. For 'What is once imbued in fresh clay will long preserve its scent,' and Greek history tells that Alexander, the most powerful king, ruler of the world, could not refrain in his manners and conduct from the vices with which he had been infected when he was still a boy by his tutor Leonidas.
