Peter began to say to Him, "Behold, we have left everything and have followed You." Great confidenceâ€”Peter was a fisherman, he was not rich, he sought food by hand and skill, and yet he speaks confidently, "We have left everything." And because it is not enough only to leave, he adds what is perfect: "And have followed You." We have done what You commanded, what then will You give us as a reward?
