Pressured by the attacks of his enemies, Nehemiah enters the house of Shemaiah as though Shemaiah were his friend and brother but discovers that Shemaiah himself is a traitor and enemy, inasmuch as he had been corrupted by the gifts of friendship with foreigners. For the elect always have “conflicts without and fears within,” and not just the apostles but the prophets too lived a life fraught “with dangers from the nation, with dangers from Gentiles, with dangers from false brothers.”
