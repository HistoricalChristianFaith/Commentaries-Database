And some of those standing by, hearing this, said: "Behold, he calls Elijah." Not all, but some. I think these were Roman soldiers, not understanding the Hebrew language, but from what he said "Heloi, Heloi," thinking Elijah was being invoked by him. But if you prefer to understand Jews saying this, they also do it as is their custom, to dishonor the Lord with weakness, who is seen as seeking Elijah's help.
