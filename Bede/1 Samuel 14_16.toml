And the watchmen of Saul look forth, etc. Those who have ascended the watchtower of holy Scripture look forth beyond others, and they are on the hill of the sons of the right hand, that is, established in the lofty citadel of heavenly deeds, and distinguished by evident pure knowledge and simple action, and they are the first to see the impending ruin and the flight of the wicked. For it is not for all Catholics, upon reading the books of heretics or pagans, to immediately recognize what error is contained in them; upon hearing the wiles of dialecticians, to immediately discern with the keenness of a sharp mind the ruinous snares of deceptions; but for those who, by long meditation on the Scriptures or by the merit of virtues, have exercised their senses for the discernment of good and evil; the feet of many almost slipped, and their steps were nearly poured out, because they were jealous of the sinners, seeing the peace of sinners. But that most noble watchman marvelously ascending to the hill of the son of the right hand, saw the ungodly exalted and lifted high above the cedars of Lebanon (Psalm 72). And I passed by, he said, and behold, he was not; and I sought him, and his place was not found (Psalm 36). And this is for the watchmen placed in Gibeah to see the multitude laid low, which those situated below and not yet ascending the peak of perfect knowledge, thought to stand in prosperity and to live in safety; the wise foresee the certain punishment of those living in wickedness.
