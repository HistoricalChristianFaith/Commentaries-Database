But why do you not judge for yourselves what is right? Showing them, as rational creatures, and even if they are illiterate, they can by natural instinct discern, either that one who has done works among them which no one else could have done should be understood as beyond human and therefore believed to be God, or that after so many injustices in this age, the just judgment of the Creator is going to come. No one, therefore, from what has been said above, should presume that a servant ignorant of the master's will shall receive few stripes, while in sinning, he avails himself of the excuse of ignorance. For, if I keep silent about other things, from the very fact that he is human, he can neither be ignorant of the evils which he must avoid, nor of the goods which he must seek.
