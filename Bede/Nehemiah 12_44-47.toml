The reason that the people liked the priests, Levites and other ministers of holy things to dwell in Jerusalem is that they rejoiced in the good works of those by whose God-devoted perseverance not only had the people been corrected from their sins but also the city rebuilt and dedicated with great praise and joy. The allegorical exposition of this chapter is clear to us because the Lord stated that those “who preach the gospel should live by the gospel.” But woe to those priests and ministers of holy things who are happy to take from the people the payments due to their rank but are not at all eager to labor for the salvation of this same people, not to offer them any holy guidance by living uprightly or to sing of the pleasantness of the heavenly kingdom by preaching something delightful to them; instead, so far from opening the doors of the heavenly city for them by having citizenship in heaven, they are proven rather to shut these doors by acting perversely, and so far from rejoicing in the works of these ministers when confessing or praising the Lord, the people are compelled to be all the more afflicted.
