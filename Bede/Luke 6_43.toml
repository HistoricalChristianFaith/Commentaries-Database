For a good tree does not produce bad fruit; nor does a bad tree produce good fruit. He continues against the hypocrite he began with. If you want, he says, to have true and not feigned righteousness, what you show in words also care to compensate with deeds, that being a good tree, you may be adorned with good fruits. For even if the hypocrite pretends, he is not good who does bad deeds. And if he reprehends the innocent, he is not therefore evil who does good deeds.
