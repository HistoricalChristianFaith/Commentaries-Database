And they worshiped and returned to Jerusalem with great joy, and they were continually in the temple praising and blessing God. As the Lord ascended into heaven, the disciples worshiping in the place where His feet had last stood, immediately returned to Jerusalem, because there they were commanded to wait for the promise of the Father, which they had heard through the mouth of the Lord. They bring great joys, because they rejoice that their God and Lord, after the triumph of the resurrection, has also penetrated the heavens. They remain continually in the temple praising and blessing God, so that, in the place of prayer and among the devotions of praises, they might wait with ready and prepared hearts for the promised coming of the Holy Spirit. And we, following the example of the disciples, after celebrating in Jerusalem, and this in the vision of peace, the solemnities of the Lord's passion and resurrection, let us soon seek the fields of Bethany with Christ as our guide, so that with a peaceful mind, and already calmed from every whirlwind of discord, we might be imbued with the sacraments of His body and blood: let us ensure that we exist in the house of obedience, truly following His footsteps, who, to give us a form of living, was made obedient unto death (Philippians II). Thus indeed we also daily deserve to be exalted by His blessing, if, daily mindful of His triumphant ascension into heaven, praising and blessing God, in Jerusalem, that is, in the already and greatly desired vision of the heavenly peace, we rest, like men awaiting their lord when he returns from the wedding feast (Luke XII). Since the blessed evangelist Luke, among the four animals of heaven, is received as signified by the calf, by whose sacrifice those chosen for the priesthood were commanded to be initiated, because he undertook to set forth the priesthood of Christ more fully than the others, beautifully beginning his gospel from the ministry of the temple through the priesthood of Zechariah, he completed it in the devotion of the temple, when he concluded with the apostles there, namely, future ministers of the new priesthood, not in the blood of victims, but in the praise and blessing of God. Amen.
