And the Pharisees and some of the scribes from Jerusalem gathered around him. And when they saw some of his disciples eating bread with unclean hands (that is, unwashed), they found fault. Oh how true is that confession of the Lord to the Father, because you have hidden these things from the wise and prudent, and revealed them to the little ones. The men of the region of Gennesaret, who seemed less learned, not only come themselves but also bring their sick; indeed, they carry them to the Lord so that they might deserve to touch even the fringe of his garment to be healed. Hence, they immediately obtain the reward of the desired healing. But indeed the Pharisees and scribes, who ought to have been the teachers of the people, come to the Lord not to hear the word, nor to seek a cure, but only to stir up debates, and they blame them for not washing their hands, in whose works, whatever is done by hands or other members of the body, nothing defiling of impurity could be found; whereas they ought to blame themselves more, who, having hands washed with water, bore a conscience defiled with malice. For the Pharisees and all the Jews do not eat unless they wash their hands often, holding to the tradition of the elders, and when they come from the marketplace, they do not eat unless they purify themselves.
