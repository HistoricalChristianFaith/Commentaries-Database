But they said: Lord, behold, here are two swords. And he said to them: It is enough. Two swords are enough to bear witness to the voluntary suffering of the Savior. One which would show the apostles' courage in striving for the Lord, and, when struck, the ear cut off would demonstrate the Lord's mercy and healing power even unto death. Otherwise, the other sword, not being drawn from its sheath, would show that they were not allowed to do all they could for his defense.
