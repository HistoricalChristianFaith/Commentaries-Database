The Apostles are also exhorted not to be alarmed by these forerunners, nor to desert Jerusalem and Jud√¶a. But the kingdom against kingdom, and the pestilence of those whose word creepeth as a cancer, and the famine of hearing the word of God, and the shaking of the whole earth, and the separation from the true faith, may be explained also in the heretics, who contending one with another bring victory to the Church.
