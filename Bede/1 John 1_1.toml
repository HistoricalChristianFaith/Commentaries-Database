The disciples were with Jesus from the beginning, and so they could preach what they had seen and heard in his presence without any ambiguity.

It was against heretics like Cerinthus and Marcion that John wrote his Gospel, stating both in his own words and in those of the Lord that the Son is consubstantial with the Father. Here in his letter he does the same thing again by conveying the Lordâ€™s teaching in his own words and confounding the foolishness of the heretics with his apostolic authority.
