All these matters that are contained in this chapter are relevant to the care of the Lordâ€™s house and his ministers and services. This excellent order of religious life ought to be imitated by us, too, in a spiritual manner today, namely, that first the descendants of the exiles purified themselves from the pollution caused by the Gentiles, then they were sanctified by keeping the sabbath (which stood prominently among the first commandments of the Law) and only then did they turn all their attention to carrying out the observance of divine worship in other respects, for we must first be cleansed from evils and only then equip ourselves for good works. However, it would take quite a long time to discuss allegorically in what order we must carry out each of these in a spiritual manner with respect to the worship of the Lord, and this should be done rather in the Book of the Law itself.
