Give strong drink to those who are sorrowful, etc. Let them drink and forget their poverty, and remember their sorrow no more. Strong drink and wine in this place signify the supernal consolation of divine wisdom, which is to be exhibited to those hearts that refuse to be consoled in low things, and receive whatever occurs in the present with a bitter soul, clinging wholly with their minds to the joys of heaven which they do not yet see; according to the one who said, "My soul refused to be comforted; I remembered God and was delighted" (Psalm 76). Likewise, "Give strong drink to those who are sorrowful, and wine to drink to those who are bitter of soul," and so forth (Proverbs 31). To those who are oppressed with mourning and sadness for the fullness of their past deeds, abundantly pour the joy of spiritual knowledge, like wine that gladdens the heart of man, and refresh them with the intoxication of the saving word, lest perhaps overwhelmed by the continuity of mourning and deadly despair, they are swallowed up by more abundant sadness, who are such.
