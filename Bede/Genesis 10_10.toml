Now the beginning of his kingdom was Babylon and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar. In the following passages, it is more fully explained how Babylon was made; but here it is first stated that it is left unmentioned that Nimrod was the builder of that city and its most proud tower. The beginning of his kingdom was Babylon, either because it was the first of his cities, founded, or because it was considered the metropolis of his kingdom due to its size and splendor. "Erech is what is now Edessa, Accad is what is now Nisibis, a city of Mesopotamia. Calneh is what is now Seleucia, named after King Seleucus, or certainly what is now also called Ctesiphon." But what is added in the land of Shinar seems to pertain to all the same four cities. Shinar, indeed, is said to be a plain of such width that it could easily contain Babylon itself and many other cities. Because Babylon, with the cities of which it is the capital, designates the proud glory of this world, which is subject to confusion; for Babel means confusion, aptly the builder of it figuratively indicates the devil, who is the head of all evils; to whom also the name Nimrod, which sounds like tyrant, or fugitive, or transgressor, suits well. For he is a tyrant because, rebelling against the Creator, he strives to obtain the height of divinity and the kingdom of the world. He is a fugitive, because, having fallen from heaven and cast out from the society of the angels who remained in their state, he wretchedly exults too much. He is a transgressor, because he disdained to obey the will of the Creator, to whom the role of a hunter is not undeservedly attributed; for he sets traps of his ambushes in the forest of this world, and hunts men who are clean in nature and wit, like deer and goats, deceiving them for death: surely opposed to those hunters who seek to catch the souls of men by their teaching so that they may lead them to eternal life; to whom the Lord speaks, saying, "Come after me, and I will make you become fishers of men" (Matthew 4:19); whose homeland for that reason was called Bethsaida, that is, the House of Hunters, because they were to hunt men for life. Now Nimrod is the son of Cush, which is interpreted as Ethiopian, because indeed the ancient enemy always arises anew from the dark people of the unfaithful through the execution of nefarious teaching or operation.
