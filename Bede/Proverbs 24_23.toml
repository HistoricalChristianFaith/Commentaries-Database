These things also to the wise. It is understood, are unknown, when each of the reprobates is suddenly snatched from the world by destruction. Or these things also are to be observed by the wise, which I have taught, not to be mingled with the detractors; because by this particular vice almost the whole human race is endangered. Hence, wishing to remedy this same vice, blessed Father Augustine had these verses inscribed on his table: Whoever loves to slander the life of an absent person with words, let him know that he is unworthy of this table. This verse is more clearly stated in the ancient edition: I say this to you who understand wisdom, for it can not incongruously be the principle of the following sentences.

To recognize a person in judgment is not good. He taught above to fear the king, and now forbids recognizing a person in judgment. Whence it is understood that subjects ought to render the debt of temporal obedience to princes, so that never out of respect for their reverence or fear they deviate from the path of truth.
