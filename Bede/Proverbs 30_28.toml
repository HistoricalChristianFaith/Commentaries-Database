The lizard advances with its hands, etc. The lizard advances with its hands because it does not have wings to carry it. And it dwells in the kingâ€™s palaces, signifying the humility of those who, though naturally slow in intellect, by the diligence of their effort, either to the knowledge of divine Scriptures or to the grace of virtues, attain the entrance to the kingdom of heaven. Many times indeed birds, elevated by their wings for flight, dwell below. And the gecko, which does not have wings to fly, clings to the building of a king with its hands: because indeed often some clever people, while they become sluggish through negligence, remain in depraved acts, and the simple ones, who are not aided by the wings of intellect, are lifted to the walls of the eternal kingdom by the virtue of their actions.
