As the church among the Gentiles praises the faithfulness of Christ through which it is awarded eternal life, the philosophers and high priests of idols are angered and fear to entrust themselves to him. They grieve that their own civilization and wisdom was destroyed by his word. They see clearly that the choir of the holy church celebrates his great triumph over the ancient enemyâ€”a triumph such as no one else has ever been able to accomplish. As they come to understand the faith, they refuse to unite themselves to the members of Christ and refuse to submit themselves to his authority. - "Four Books on 1 Samuel 4.29"
