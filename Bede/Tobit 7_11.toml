The Gentile people, on hearing the message of the faith and being admonished by the apostles to form the church of Christ from their progeny throughout the world, were able (but only after reliable investigation) to undertake the obligations and rules of the new religion. For they knew that in former times they had had many teachers who all (comprised, as it were, in the number seven) knew about the joys of this life alone but had nothing reliable to say about eternal joys; and consequently the destruction of eternal death would have snatched them away without hope of immortal life.
