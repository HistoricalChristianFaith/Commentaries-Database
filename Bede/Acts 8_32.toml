Just as a sheep “does not resist when it is led away to be a sacrificial offering, so too he suffered by his own will.” Or, according to a more profound understanding, just as a lamb was customarily immolated at the Passover, so too “Christ our Passover lamb has been immolated.”

He has not only redeemed us with his blood, but he has also clothed us with his wool. This is so that with his clothing he may warm those who are cold with infidelity, and so that we may hear the apostle telling us, “All of you who have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ.” He did not open his mouth during his passion when he chose to answer very little to Pilate and the chief priests and nothing at all to Herod.
