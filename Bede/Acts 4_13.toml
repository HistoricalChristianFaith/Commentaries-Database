Finding out that these men were unlettered and ignorant, they marveled. Illiterate men are sent to preach, so that the faith of believers might not be thought to have been brought about by human eloquence and learning, but by the power of God, as the Apostle says: "Not in the wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made of no effect" (I Cor. I). For those were called idiotae who, content with their own language and natural knowledge, were unacquainted with the study of letters. Indeed, the Greeks call their own, ἴδιον.

But seeing the boldness of Peter and John, and realizing that they were unlettered and ordinary men, they marveled. "Unlettered" is said, not because they were ignorant of letters, but because they were not skilled in the art of grammar. For in Greek, it is more clearly, for this word, "ἀγράμματοι," that is, unlettered, and "idiotae" are called unskilled. Finally, in the Epistle to the Corinthians, where it is written: "And if unskilled in speech, yet not in knowledge" (2 Cor. XI), for "unskilled" in Greek it is "ἰδιώτης."
