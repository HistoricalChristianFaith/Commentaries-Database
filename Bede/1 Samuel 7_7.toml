And the Philistines heard that the children of Israel had gathered in Mizpah, etc. The enemies of the truth heard that, with the Lord preaching the Gospel of the Kingdom, all the people gladly listened to Him; and unclean spirits, specifically the princes of the impious (wherefore they are also called the rulers of darkness by the Apostle [Ephesians VI]), rose up against the state of the Church, or rather, against each of the faithful, to be attacked with wicked snares. Concerning their wicked uprising, we have previously discussed while expounding the name Baalim.

When the children of Israel heard this, they were afraid, etc. The disciples of Christ, fearing the face of the persecuting Jews, watched and prayed, as He commanded, that they would not enter into temptation; and, suddenly struck by the storm of temptations, they said: Lord, save us, we are perishing. They are also remembered to have prayed frequently in afflictions after His ascension (Matt. VIII). This same practice offers us also, who are tempted, a very beneficial safeguard, that our soul may be delivered from the fear of the enemy.
