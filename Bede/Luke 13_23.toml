But someone said to him, "Lord, are only a few saved?" And he said to them, "Strive to enter through the narrow door." The hall of salvation is entered through the narrow door because it is necessary to overcome the enticements of this deceitful world through labors and fasts. And he well said, "Strive to enter," because unless the struggle of the mind is fervent, the wave of the world is not overcome, by which the soul is always drawn back to the depths.
