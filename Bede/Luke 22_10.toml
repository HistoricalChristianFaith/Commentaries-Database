And he said to them: Behold, when you enter the city, a man carrying a water jar will meet you. Follow him into the house he enters. It is indeed a sign of foreknowledge from divinity that, while speaking with his disciples, he knows what will happen elsewhere. Beautifully, as the disciples are preparing the Passover, a man carrying a water jar meets them, to show that this mystery of the Passover is to be celebrated for the complete purification of the whole world. For water signifies the washing of grace, the jar signifies the perfect measure. Therefore they prepare the Passover, where a jar of water is brought, because the time is at hand when the symbolic blood on the threshold is removed for the true worshippers of the Passover, and the baptism of the life-giving font is consecrated to remove sins.
