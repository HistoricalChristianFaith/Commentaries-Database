But that you may know that the Son of Man has power on earth to forgive sins. If He is also God, according to the well-known testimony of Isaiah, who blots out our iniquities (Psalm 50), and the Son of Man has the power on earth to forgive sins (Matthew 9), therefore He Himself is both God and the Son of Man, so that Christ as man by the power of His divinity can forgive sins, and the same Christ as God can die for sinners through the frailty of His humanity.

He says to the paralytic: I say to you, rise; take up your bed, and go into your house. Spiritually to rise from the bed is to draw the soul away from carnal desires, where it lay sick. To take up the bed is to deprive the flesh itself, thus corrected by the reins of continence, of earthly delights by the hope of heavenly rewards. For the same bed that is washed every night by David, that is, chastised with a worthy flood of penitence for the stains of each sin. But taking up the bed and going to the house is to return to paradise. For that is the true home, which first received man, not lost by right but by fraud, and finally restored by Him who owed nothing to the fraudulent enemy. Alternatively, the one who was sick returns home with the bed when the soul, having received the remission of sins, returns with the body itself for the inward custody, lest after forgiveness it commits something for which it might justly be struck again.
