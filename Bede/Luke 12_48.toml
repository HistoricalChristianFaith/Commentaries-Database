For there are evidently five senses, with which, while using them in this life, we must cultivate the image of our Creator that we have received: but the people to whom the Decalogue of the law was given through a servant ought to cultivate less. Much more, however, those to whom the grace of eternal life has been entrusted through the Son. And therefore, the gain of this accumulates through the number ten, the gain of that through the number hundred, which no one doubts pertains to the signification of the kingdom of heaven, about to be given to the right. For it is not in vain that, with the same flexure of the fingers, the ten is figured on the left and the hundred on the right. Unless it is because both now the works of the Decalogue, which the letter could not complete, faith perfects, and in the future, it will render to each one according to his works, to those indeed who, according to the patience of good works, seek for glory, honor, and incorruption, eternal life. But, because neither by our own strengths, but by His grace we have been saved through faith, it is rightly said: He forgave both, not having anything whose due they could repay. And indeed, he loves more, to whom more is forgiven. But to whom less is forgiven, he loves less. Because whether you wish to understand the good of the knowledge we received to be perfected, or the foolishness to be avoided that we incurred, much more indeed is granted to the Church than to the Synagogue, which was once defiled by baser, as none of its teachers prohibited it, the filth of idolatry was corrupted, but where sin abounded, grace superabounded (Roman V), and it is now exalted with the higher proclamation of evangelical perfection. To which it is said: Because many prophets and just men desired to see what you see, and did not see; and to hear what you hear, and did not hear (Matthew XIII). Certainly, in this place, it fits what the history of Numbers recounts, that with the spoils of the Medianites divided equally, those who came from the battle gave the five-hundredth head of their portion to the Lord, while the rest gave the fiftieth to the Lord. Because both he who keeps himself safe from hostile incursion by exercising virtue in the camps offers much, but he who, wielding the sword of the word, strikes down countless hosts of the adversary offers much more.

But the one who did not know and did things deserving of punishment will be beaten with few blows. From everyone who has been given much, much will be demanded; and from the one who has been entrusted with much, even more will be asked. Therefore, after saying, "To whom much is given," he added, "And from whom much is demanded," understanding, divine judgments. Unless perhaps through this he wanted to indicate both the order of the faithful, namely of the rulers and subordinates, because much is often given even to certain individuals to whom both the knowledge of the Lord's will and the ability to execute what they know is imparted. Much is also entrusted to him to whom, along with his own salvation, the care of pastoring the Lord's flock is entrusted. Therefore, the powerful will suffer powerful torments, and stronger torture awaits the stronger, that is, those endowed with greater grace, if they sin, greater vengeance will follow. However, the mildest of all penalties will be for those who, apart from the original sin they inherited, have not added any additional sin; and among the other sins they have added, each will have a more tolerable condemnation to the extent that he had less iniquity here.
