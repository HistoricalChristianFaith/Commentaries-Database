And there will be joy to you and exultation, and many will rejoice at his birth. The father rightfully rejoices because either born in old age or has received a son of such grace. Others also rejoice, to whom he will preach the hitherto unheard entrance of the kingdom of heaven. And it should be noted that many rejoice at the birth of the forerunner, but at the birth of the Lord, the angel announces great joy which will be for all the people. For evidently, this one comes to preach salvation to many, that one to grant it to all who wish.
