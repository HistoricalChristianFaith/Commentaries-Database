If the doors of the inner house of the Holy of Holies are the ministries of angels that unlock the entrance to celestial life for us when we have left the body, and [if] the doors of the house of the temple are the holy teachers and priests who throw open to us the first thresholds of the present church by teaching, baptizing and communicating to us the mysteries of the Lordâ€™s body and blood, what are the hinges of both doors? They are the minds and hearts of these angels or saints by which they cleave fixedly to the contemplation and love of their Creator so that those who never turn their gaze from the will of him whom they serve may thereby properly fulfill the ministry entrusted to them. For the gates are opened and closed at the appropriate time, but at no time do they leave their hinges, because both angels and holy people, whether they receive the faithful and the elect in this life of faith or in the other life of vision, keep their minds ever firmly rooted in love. These hinges are well said to have been made of gold for this reason, namely, either because of the merit of their own glory or because of the love they have for God. - "On the Temple 2.25.1"
