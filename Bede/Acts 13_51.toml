According to the commandment in the Gospel, dust was shaken off from their feet in testimony of their labor, because they entered into their city, and the apostolic preaching reached all the way to them [the Antiochenes]. Alternatively, the dust was shaken off so that they would take nothing, not even a thing so basic to life, from those who had rejected the gospel.
