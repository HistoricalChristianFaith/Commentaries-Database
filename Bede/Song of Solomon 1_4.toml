The chambers of the eternal King are the interior joys of the heavenly homeland to which the holy church is now introduced by faith, as it awaits a fuller, future introduction to the reality itself. The young maidens of which it speaks are the faithful souls of the church of Christ who were only recently reborn as members of Christ. - "Commentary on the Songs of Songs 1.1.3"
