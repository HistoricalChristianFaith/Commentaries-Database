Because of the cold, the sluggard would not plough, etc. He who now neglects to labor in the service of God due to sloth will beg in the coming day of the kingdom, and it will not be given to him, because whatever a man sows, that also shall he reap. Therefore, it is rightly compared to the kingdom of God, because then the clouds of our sorrow pass away, and the days of life shine with the brightness of the eternal sun, and the fruit of labor is received in joy.
