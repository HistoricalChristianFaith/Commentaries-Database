Therefore, laying aside all malice and all deceit, etc. Because you have been recently reborn, he says, and made children of God through baptism, now be such by striving for a good way of life, just as newborn infants of an innocent age by nature, ignorant, namely, of malice and deceit, not knowing to pretend, envy, slander, or be committed to other such vices in any way. Just as they naturally desire their mother's milk, that they may grow to salvation and be able to come to eat bread, so also you should seek the simple rudiments of faith first from the breasts of the mother Church, that is, from the teachers of both Testaments, who either wrote divine words or even preach them to you in a living voice, so that by learning well you may come to the nourishment of the living Bread that came down from heaven, that is, through the sacraments of the Lord's incarnation, by which you have been reborn and by which you are nourished, you may come to the contemplation of the divine majesty.
