When Jesus saw them, He was indignant and said to them, "Let the little children come to Me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these." He said significantly, "to such as these," not "to these," to show that it is not age that reigns, but character; and that the reward is promised to those who have similar innocence and simplicity. The Apostle also agrees with this sentiment: "Brothers, do not be children in understanding, but in malice be children, and in understanding be perfect."
