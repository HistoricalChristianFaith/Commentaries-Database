When Simon Peter saw this, he fell at Jesus' knees, saying: Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, O Lord. For the carnal ones in the Church somehow repel the governance of the spiritual ones in whom the persona of Christ clearly shines. They do not say this with the voice of the tongue to the good ministers of God, to repel them, but they advise with the voice of their morals and deeds to withdraw, lest they be governed by the good ones, and the more vehemently as they show them honor. Yet, they admonish with their deeds to withdraw, just as Peter signified this honor falling at the feet of the Lord; but showed the morals in what he said: Depart from me, Lord, for I am a sinful man. However, since the Lord did not do this – He did not depart from them but led them to the shore with the drawn-up boats – it signifies that in good and spiritual men there should not be this will, to be so disturbed by the sins of the crowds that, to live as if more securely and peacefully, they abandon the ecclesiastical duty.
