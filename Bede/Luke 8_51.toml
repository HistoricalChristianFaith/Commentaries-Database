And when he came to the house, he did not allow anyone to enter with him except Peter, James, and John, and the father and mother of the girl. Previously, the son of the widow was publicly raised, here several witnesses are removed. Therefore, I think that the kindness of the Lord is again shown in this, because the widow, being the mother of an only child, did not suffer delays, and therefore, to avoid further affliction, maturity is added. It is also a form of wisdom, in that the son of the widow quickly believed in the Church, in the daughter of the ruler of the synagogue, indeed, the Jews will believe, but fewer of the many.
