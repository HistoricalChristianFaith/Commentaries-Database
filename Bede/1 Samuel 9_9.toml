Once in Israel, everyone used to speak thus: "Come, let us go to the seer," etc. The same man is rightly called an investigator and narrator of secrets, and a prophet, because he speaks of the future, that is, he foretells. And he is not unreasonably called a Seer, because with the cleansed eyes of the heart he searches the mysteries that less perfect ones cannot. Hence, their writings are called visions as well as prophecies. "The vision," he says, "of Isaiah, son of Amoz." "The book of the vision of Nahum the Elkoshite." "The word that Isaiah, son of Amoz, saw" (Isa. 1; Nahum 1; Isa. 2). Therefore, those who claim that the prophets of God spoke in a trance like the Cataphrygians and were unaware of the wise words they uttered should indeed be refuted. In line with the truth of the apostolic sentence, it should be understood catholically that the spirits of the prophets were subject to the prophets, so they knew by reason when to speak and when to be silent. Finally, the Psalmist. He who diligently seeks the commandments of God boasts that he understands more than the elders (Psalm 119). And in another place: "I will sing psalms and understand in the blameless way, when you come to me" (Psalm 101). Therefore, he does not sing psalms ignorantly as if possessed, who understands what he sings, with the spirit of wisdom coming upon him; but often the prophets, regarding certain things divinely shown to them which, due to their greatness, men could scarcely grasp, would inquire from the angels standing by as if using reason, and thirsting for wisdom. But it is questioned how Samuel, who does not speak of distant past but of present times, that is, the times of his age, can say: "For he who is called a prophet today was formerly called a seer." And they wish these and such verses to have been inserted by Ezra the priest and scribe, when he restored the holy Scripture, as if recounting times long past. For even long after Samuel's death up to the times of Ezra, the name of seers is equally ascribed to the prophets in the Scriptures.
