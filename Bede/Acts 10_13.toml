It [the voice that Peter heard] told him: Arise to make ready to preach the gospel. Kill in the Gentiles what they had been, and make [them] what you are; for whoever eats food lying outside of himself turns it into his own body. Therefore it [the voice] taught that the nations, which had formerly lain outside through their lack of belief, would, once their former life had been put to death, be incorporated within the society of the church. This Peter indicates, just as the apostle Paul had said of himself, “Through the law I have died to the law that I may live to God in Christ.” And again, “It is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me.” Indeed, those who are taken in by heretics are as though devoured by death while they are still alive.
