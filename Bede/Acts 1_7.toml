[[commentary]]
quote='''
It is not for you to know times or seasons which the Father has placed in His own authority. He said this, indicating that the time of that (kingdom) is so secret that it lies within the knowledge of the Father alone. And when He says: It is not for you to know, He shows that He Himself knows, whose are all the things that are the Father's, but it is not expedient for mortals to know, so that always uncertain about the coming of the judge, they may live every day as though they were to be judged on another day.
