Simon, whom he surnamed Peter, and Andrew his brother. Not now for the first time did he give Simon the surname Peter, but long before, when, having been brought to him by his brother Andrew, he looked at him and said: "You are Simon, son of Jonah, you shall be called Cephas," which is translated as Peter (John I). But when Luke, wanting to enumerate the names of the twelve apostles, had to mention Peter, he wished to briefly note that he was not previously called by this name, but the Lord surnamed him thus, even though it was not then, but when John recorded the very words of the Lord, evidently making the listeners attentive. For if he had been previously called this, you would not see the mystery of the rock in the same way, thinking he was so named by chance, and not by God's providence. Therefore, he wished him to be called by another name first, so that through the very change of name, the liveliness of the sacrament might be commended. Therefore, in Latin it is Peter, in Syriac Cephas, and in both languages, the name is derived from rock, undoubtedly that which Paul said: "The rock was Christ" (1 Cor. X). For just as Christ, the true light, granted the apostles to be called the light of the world, so also to Simon, who believed in Christ the rock, he granted the name Peter. Referring to another etymology, he said: "You are Peter, and on this rock I will build my Church" (Matt. XVI). Hence, some violently seeking a Hebrew etymology for the Latin or Greek name say that Peter is interpreted as "one who loosens," or "one who takes off his shoes," or "one who recognizes," although both the exposition of John's Gospel, which I recalled, and the Hebrew language itself, which does not sound the P letter at all, testify that this name is not Hebrew. For those who abusively write Fetrum for Peter, as well as Faulum for Paul, and Filatum for Pilate, violently attach a false interpretation to a fictitious name. Simon, however, is interpreted as obedient. Moreover, Andrew is a Greek name, derived from ἀπὸ τοῦ ἀνδρός, that is from "man," meaning manly. These names rightfully adorn the first of the apostles, who soon recognized the Lamb of God from John and took care to see and hear him. But the fact that Simon is interpreted as "putting aside sadness" or "hearing sorrow," fits that time when, after the resurrection, having seen the Lord, he put aside the sadness of his death or his denial, but immediately heard the sorrow of his own death, with the Lord saying: "But when you grow old, you will stretch out your hands, and another will gird you and lead you where you do not wish to go" (John XXI).

But all these things were being heard by the Pharisees, who were greedy and derided him. The Lord was indeed admonishing the scribes and Pharisees, not to think highly of themselves, not to presume on their own righteousness, but to receive sinners and publicans who repent, and to redeem by alms their sins which might incidentally appear; but they derided the teacher of mercy, humility, and frugality for two main reasons. Because, forsooth, either he commanded less useful things, never to be performed as if he were giving harmful orders, or certainly useful things, but being superfluous brought forward what they had already done.
