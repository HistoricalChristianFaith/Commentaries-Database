Similarly also the cup, after he had supped, saying: This cup is the new testament in my blood, which shall be shed for you. What he says: Similarly also the cup, it is understood to be given in common (ἀπὸ κοινοῦ), as the full sentence: Similarly also the cup, after he had supped, he gave to them. Therefore, because bread strengthens the body and wine works blood in the body, this refers mystically to the body of Christ, that to the blood. But because it is necessary that both we in Christ, and Christ in us remain, the wine of the Lord’s cup is mixed with water. For as John testifies, the waters are peoples (Rev. 15). And it is not permitted to offer water alone, nor wine alone, just as neither is it permitted to offer wheat grain alone without mixing and processing it into bread, lest such offering would signify as if the head is to be separated from the members, and either that Christ could suffer without the love of our redemption, or that we could be saved without Christ's passion, and be offered to the Father; if anyone is moved that when the Savior had supped with the apostles, he handed over his body and blood, why then are we taught by the universal Church’s custom of fasting to receive the same sacraments? Let him briefly hear that therefore the apostles then, having supped, communicated, because it was necessary for that typical Passover to be consummated first, and so to move on to the sacraments of the true Passover. Now, in honor of such a great and so terrible sacrament, it pleased the teachers of the Church that we first be strengthened by the participation in the Lord’s passion, first to be sanctified by spiritual feasts inwardly and outwardly, and thereafter the body to be refreshed by earthly banquets and common foods. And what he says: This is the cup of the new testament in my blood, refers to the distinction of the old Testament, which was dedicated with the blood of goats and calves, as the legislator said while sprinkling: This is the blood of the testament which God has commanded unto you (Heb. 9). For it is necessary indeed that the examples of heavenly things be purified with these, but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these, according to what the Apostle throughout the whole Epistle to the Hebrews distinguishes between the law and the Gospel, with very beautiful exposition and complete reasoning declares.
