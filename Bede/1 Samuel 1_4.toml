Therefore, the day came, and Elkanah offered sacrifice. The shadow of the law having passed, the light of new grace came, and the possession of God, namely, Christ becoming visible in flesh; He taught people heavenly things, and at the same time granted them to love, hope, and believe. For what He grants to His own to do, He Himself is said to do, as the Apostle testifies, who says: For it is God who works in you both to will and to work for His good pleasure. And the Spirit Himself intercedes for us with unutterable groanings (Philippians 2; Romans 8); namely, because He makes us to ask and to groan by His grace. Hence, above, not without reason, in Elkanah ascending, worshipping, and offering sacrifice, we understood Him who disposes ascents in the hearts of the blessed in the valley of tears, and teaches them to worship and persevere in good deeds.
