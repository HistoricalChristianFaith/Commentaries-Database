For I tell you, I will not drink of the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God comes. This verse can indeed be taken simply, that from this hour of the supper until the time of the resurrection, when He would come in the kingdom of God, He would not drink wine. For afterwards, the apostle Peter testifies that He took food and drink, who said: Who ate and drank with Him after He rose from the dead (Acts X). But it is much more consistent that, just as above He denies eating the typical lamb, He also denies drinking the typical passover drink, until, with the glory of His resurrection shown and manifested, the faith of the kingdom of God comes to the world. So that by the two greatest edicts of the law, namely the Passover meal and drink spiritually changed, you might learn that all the sacraments of the law, or commands which seemed to sound carnal, are now to be transferred to spiritual observance.
