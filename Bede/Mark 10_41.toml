And when the ten heard it, they began to be indignant about James and John. The ten apostles did not become indignant with the mother of the sons of Zebedee, nor did they attribute the audacity of the request to the woman, but to the sons, who, unaware of their own measure, were inflamed with excessive desire. To whom also the Lord had said: You do not know what you are asking.
