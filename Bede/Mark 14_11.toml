Upon hearing this, they rejoiced and promised to give him money. And he sought how he might opportunely betray Him. Many today are horrified by Judasâ€™s crime of selling his Lord and Master, and God with money, as something monstrous and wicked, yet they do not take heed. For when they speak false testimony against anyone for the sake of women, indeed because they deny the truth for money, they sell God for money. For He said: I am the truth. When they defile the fellowship of brotherhood with some plague of discord, they betray the Lord, because God is love. Therefore, those who spurn the commands of love and truth betray God, who is indeed love and truth, especially when they sin not out of weakness or ignorance, but in the likeness of Judas seek opportunities to change truth with lies and virtue with crime.
