The unhappy Judas wishes to compensate with the price of his Master for the loss which he thought he hadmade by the pouring out of the ointment. Where it is said: “And Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went unto the Chief Priests to betray Him unto them.”.
But by the words, “he went out”, itis shown that he was not invited by the Chief Priests, nor bound by any necessity, but entered upon this design from the spontaneous wickedness of his own mind.
Many in this day shudder at the crime of Judas in selling his Master, his Lord and his God, for money, as monstrous and horrible wickedness. They however do not take heed, for when the sake of gain they trample on the rights of charity and truth, they are traitors to God, Who is Charity and Truth.
