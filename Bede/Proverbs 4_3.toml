And he taught me and said: Let your heart embrace my words. Such admonitions given to Solomon by his father David, he who reads Chronicles finds. But why does Solomon call himself the only begotten before his mother, when Scripture testifies that a uterine brother preceded him, unless because that one, born but immediately unnamed, departed life as if he had never been?
