There was no one found to return and give glory to God except this foreigner. According to the body, indeed, it is easy to see a man who does not have leprosy and yet is not of good spirit; but according to the significance of this miracle, it troubles the observer to consider how the world can be ungrateful. But now it is also easy to see that it may happen that anyone in the society of the Church acquires sound and true doctrine and argues everything according to the rule of the Catholic faith, distinguishes the creature from the Creator, and is thus revealed to have been free from the diversity of lies like leprosy, and yet is ungrateful to God and his purifying Lord, because, elevated by pride, he is not humbled by holy thanksgiving, and thus becomes like those of whom the Apostle says: Although they knew God, they did not glorify him as God or give thanks. For by saying they knew God, he shows they had been cleansed from leprosy, but nevertheless immediately accuses them of being ungrateful.
