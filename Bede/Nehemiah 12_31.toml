The leaders of Judah (i.e., “confession” or “praise”) are all those more perfect teachers of the holy church who at the dedication of the city go up on top of the wall because when the time of retribution appears, they will be proven to have risen above the ordinary life of the holy church by their more exalted manner of living. For they are the ones concerning whom the Lord promises this holy church through the prophet, saying, “I have posted guardians on your walls.” Thus it is just that those today who have been placed in the office of watchman over the holy church’s walls will at that time also be distinguished by the glory of this same reward.
