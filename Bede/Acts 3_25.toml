And in your seed all the families of the earth shall be blessed. The seed of Abraham is indeed Christ, in whose faith the blessing was promised to all the families of the earth, that is, to Jews and Gentiles alike. The apostle soothes the minds of the Jews to make them more prompt to believe, saying that the Healer of the whole world chose to visit and bless them first.

Saying to Abraham: And in your seed all the families of the earth shall be blessed. From both this testimony, namely that which was given to Moses, and that which was proclaimed to Abraham by the Lord, both his severity and goodness are shown: goodness indeed in those who, having received faith in Christ, deserve to be blessed by him; severity, however, in those who, due to their own contempt and disobedience, are exterminated from the people of the blessed, that is, cast out beyond the boundaries of eternal happiness. But it was said: In your seed all the families of the earth shall be blessed, just as it was said in the Gospel: He was the true light which enlightens every man coming into the world (John I). For not all the families of the earth are blessed in Christ, nor is every man coming into the world enlightened by Christ, since many are those who, living in the darkness and curse in which they were born due to the first transgression, or even adding worse deeds, are damned to eternity. But it must be understood that in the seed of Abraham, that is, in Christ, all the families of the earth who are to be blessed are blessed; and by his grace, every man who belongs to the lot of the saints, which is in light, is enlightened: nor is there another name under heaven given to men in which we must be saved (Acts IV). Although it can also rightly be understood in this way, that there is no clan or family of the earth in which some do not receive the blessing of the heavenly inheritance: I speak of those families, or clans of seventy-two, into which the human race was divided after the flood in the construction of the tower. Therefore, in the seed of Abraham, namely the Mediator of God and men, the man Jesus Christ, all the chosen are blessed, not only those who believed in him after his Incarnation, but also those who, being born in the flesh, preceded the times of his Incarnation. For to all the same man God, ascending to the heavens, opened the gates of the heavenly kingdom, to all he will say on the day of judgment: Come, blessed of my Father, receive the kingdom (Matthew XXV).
