And behold, there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon, and this man was just and devout, waiting for the consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was upon him. When the Lord was born in the flesh, not only did angels from heaven, but also every age of mortals and both sexes, bear witness. For it was fitting that the Savior of all, as he was to come in the flesh, be foretold by the deeds or words of all the faithful throughout the ages, and thus also coming, be proclaimed by the common praise of all, fulfilling the prophecy which says: Praise the Lord from the heavens (Psalm 148), etc., up to where it says: Young men and maidens, old men and children, let them praise the name of the Lord, for his name alone is exalted. His majesty is above heaven and earth. Just, it says, and devout (Ibid.), because justice is difficultly kept without fear. I do not refer to that fear which under penal law dreads the loss of temporal goods, which perfect love is accustomed to cast out, but the holy fear of the Lord which remains forever, by which the just man, the more ardently he loves his God, the more diligently he avoids offending Him.
