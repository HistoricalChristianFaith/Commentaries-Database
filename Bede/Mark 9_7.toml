And a cloud overshadowed them. He who sought a material tabernacle received the overshadowing of a cloud, that he might learn that in the resurrection the saints are to be protected not by the covering of dwellings, but by the glory of the Holy Spirit. From which the Psalmist says: But the children of men will trust in the shelter of your wings (Psalm 35). And in his Apocalypse, John says: And I saw no temple in it (Rev. 21), for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are its temple.

And a voice came out of the cloud, saying, "This is my beloved Son; listen to him." Because they had asked foolishly, they were not worthy to receive a response from the Lord; but the Father answers on behalf of the Son, so that the word of the Lord might be fulfilled. "I do not speak for myself, but the Father who sent me speaks for me" (John V). The voice of the Father speaking from heaven is also heard, bearing witness concerning the Son, and teaching Peter, with error removed, the truth: indeed, through Peter, teaching the other apostles. "This," he says, "is my beloved Son; it is to him that a tent must be built, it is he who must be obeyed. This is the Son; they, Moses and Elijah, are servants. They also must prepare a tent for the Lord within the innermost parts of their hearts, along with you." Indeed, this place in the Gospel agrees with the words of Moses himself, with which bearing witness to the Lord's incarnation he said: "The Lord your God will raise up for you a prophet from your brethren; you shall listen to him just as you listen to me, according to all that he tells you. But it shall come to pass: Every soul that does not listen to that prophet will be cut off from the people" (Deut. XVIII). Therefore, whom Moses foretold would come in the flesh and should be listened to by every soul that wishes to be saved, God the Father now shows to the disciples as having already come in the flesh and marked him as his Son with a heavenly voice. And as if more clearly expounding the faith concerning his arrival to them, he says: "This man, this is he whom this Moses promised to you would be born in the world many times. Listen to his words according to the commandment of Moses, and command all true lovers to listen." And it should be noted that just as when the Lord was baptized in the Jordan, so also on the mountain where he was glorified, the mystery of the whole Holy Trinity is declared. Because indeed the glory of him which believers confess in baptism, we will behold and praise in the resurrection. And it is not in vain that the Holy Spirit appears here in a bright cloud, as another evangelist mentions, whereas there he appeared as a dove, because those who now keep with a simple heart the faith they have received, will then with clear light behold what they have believed, and they will be perpetually protected by that very grace with which they have been illuminated.
