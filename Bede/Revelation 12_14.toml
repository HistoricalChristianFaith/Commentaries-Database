wings: The Church is upheld by the two Testaments, and avoids the envenomed tumult of the world, and seeks in the affection of her mind the solitude of a &quot;meek and quiet spirit,&quot; while she thus sings with joy, &quot;Behold I got me away far off in flight, and abode in the wilderness.&quot; Nor does it make any difference that there she asks for the wings of a dove, but here receives those of an eagle. For as the Church, &quot;whose youth is renewed as an eagle's,&quot; is represented in the former because of the gift of the Holy Spirit, so also is it in the latter, because of the lofty flight and heavenly vision, by which it beholds God with a clean heart.

Supported by the two Testaments, the church avoids the poisonous tumults of the world, and by the affection of the mind each day seeks the solitude of a quick and gentle spirit. And so in joy she sings, “Behold, I have gone far away in flight and remain in solitude.” Nor is it contradictory that [in the psalm] she asked for the wings of a dove while here she received the wings of an eagle. For, just as the church, whose youth will be renewed as the eagle’s, is represented in the former because of the gift of the Holy Spirit, so in the latter she is symbolized because of the lofty flight and sublime sight by which she sees God with a pure heart. “Where she is to be nourished for a time, and times, and half a time.” He is speaking of the whole time of the church, which is comprehended in the number of days mentioned previously. For a “time” signifies one year, “times” signifies two years, and “half a time” signifies six months.
