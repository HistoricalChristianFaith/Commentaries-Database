What the wicked fears shall come upon him, etc. He speaks of that wicked one who sins knowingly. Therefore, the wicked fear to see the strict judge; the righteous desire to be dissolved and be with Christ: he, lest he be deprived of earthly joys and punished with eternal vengeance; they, lest their pilgrimage be prolonged and they receive the rewards for which they have strived. But to both, what they fear in their heart will come upon them.
