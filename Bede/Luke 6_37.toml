Do not judge, and you will not be judged; do not condemn, and you will not be condemned. I believe nothing else is commanded to us in this place, except that we interpret acts, whose intention is doubtful, in a better sense. For it is written: By their fruits you shall know them, this is said of manifest things, which cannot be done with a good intention, such as debaucheries, or blasphemies, or thefts, or drunkenness, and such things, about which it is permitted for us to judge. However, concerning foods, because any human food can be taken indifferently without fault of concupiscence with a good intention and simple heart, the Apostle prohibits us from judging those who ate meat and drank wine, by those who abstained from such foods. He who eats (he says) should not despise the one who does not eat; and he who does not eat should not judge the one who eats (Rom. XIV). This also pertains to what he says elsewhere: Do not judge anything before the time, until the Lord comes, who will also illuminate the hidden things of darkness, and will manifest the counsels of the hearts (I Cor. IV). Therefore, there are certain actions, which we do not know with what intention they are done, which can be done with both good and bad intentions, about which it is rash to judge, especially to condemn. The time will come, however, for these to be judged, when the Lord will illuminate the hidden things of darkness, and reveal the counsels of the hearts (Ibid.). There are two things, however, in which we should avoid rash judgment, when it is uncertain with what intention anything is done, or when it is uncertain what someone will become, who now appears either good or evil.

Forgive, and you will be forgiven. Give, and it will be given to you. He commands us to forgive injuries, to give benefits, so that our sins may also be forgiven, and eternal life may be given to us. By this, brief but excellent sentence, he comprehensively concludes all the commands about dealing with enemies that he had given extensively.
