The gift of a man makes his way broad, etc. The gift of charity or other virtues which the faithful receive from the Lord broadens the way of their actions because the more they are internally filled with the grace of the Spirit, the more they abundantly multiply their steps of good works outwardly, and they attain a peak of honor among the great leaders of the Church in the future. Alternatively, the spiritual gift of the Savior, which he brought to the world, broadened his way that he might come to many nations of the world through his presence in faith and love; and he made not only the peoples, but also the rulers themselves, renounce desires and willingly obey him.
