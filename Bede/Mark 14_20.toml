He said to them, "One of the twelve, who is dipping his hand with me in the dish." Oh marvelous power of the Lord! First he had said, "One of you will betray me," the betrayer persists in evil, he is more clearly accused, and yet his name is not specifically designated. Judas, while the others were saddened and withdrawing their hands and forbidding food to their mouths, with the rashness and impudence by which he was about to betray the master, even puts his hand with the master into the dish, so that his audacity could falsely claim a good conscience.
