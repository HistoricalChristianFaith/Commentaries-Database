Surely the holy teachers are often understood by the word rams, since they are the leaders of flocks that follow the Lord. Hence the psalmist says in a pleasing manner: “Bring to the Lord, O children of God, bring to the Lord the offspring of rams,” which is clearly to say, “Bring to the Lord, O angels of God to whom the responsibility for this task has been delegated, bring to the Lord in heaven the spirits of the faithful who, through imitation of the blessed apostles’ life and faith, have proved worthy to become their offspring.”
