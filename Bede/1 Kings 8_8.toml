"And when the poles protruded, and the ends of them appeared, etc." [1 Kings 8:8] As the ark was brought into the holy of holies, it is said: And when the poles protruded, and the ends of them appeared outside the sanctuary before the oracle, they no longer appeared outside; this is written more clearly in the volume of Chronicles. The ends of the poles, he says, with which they carried the ark, since they were a little longer, appeared before the oracle. But if anyone had been slightly outside, they could not see them (II Chron. V). Where it should be noted that even if the ends of the poles appeared to those who came closer and looked more carefully before the oracle, it was not possible for the very ends of them to protrude before the oracle, because it was indeed necessary, with the oracle closed and the veil hung before the doors, for the poles themselves also to be hidden entirely within along with the ark and the cherubim. This could not happen if the poles protruding further did not allow space for the doors to be shut. The positioning of the poles which Scripture has taken care to explain so diligently is not without reason, but rather with great consideration of a sacrament. For it is evident that the outer house of the temple designates the Church journeying on earth, while the holy of holies designates the internal happiness of the heavenly homeland. Likewise, the ark brought into the holy of holies typifies the assumed humanity of Christ, brought within the veil of the heavenly kingdom; and the poles with which the same ark was carried typically denote the preachers of the word, through whom He was made known to the world. Now in the ark there was a golden urn holding manna, which in the man Christ all the fullness of divinity dwells bodily. There was Aaron's rod, which had blossomed again after being cut off, signifying that all the power of judgment belongs to Him, whose judgment in the humility of His passion seemed to be removed. There were also the tablets of the covenant, because in Him are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge. Attached to it were the carrying poles, by which it was carried, signifying the teachers who formerly labored in the word of Christ, now rejoice in the present vision of the glory of Christ. For what one of them said of himself: "I desire to depart and be with Christ" (Philippians 2), he undoubtedly left to be understood of all the companions of his work. The ends of the poles appeared outside in front of the oracle not always, but when the doors of the same oracle happened to be opened; and this not to everyone, but only to those who, approaching closer, diligently strive to behold the things inside. But the ark itself, what it was like and how it was placed, was allowed to be seen only by those who had entered the oracle, because none of the saints still in this life, even if they are highly elevated in mind, but only the citizens of that homeland fully behold the glory of their Redeemer there. The poles and the ark are also stored together in the oracle, signifying that even now the perfect elect who have gone before us into the hidden presence of God, from the turmoil of men, are also hidden. Nevertheless, the ends of the poles are sometimes seen through the open oracle by those who approach, when divine grace grants to the more perfect and to those who purify the eye of their heart with all intention, some glimpse of the joy of the citizens above; which certainly is not granted to those who have retreated a little further, because as much as they remain outwardly empty of mind, so much less do they see the internal joys.
