Mystically, our Lord, after being banished from the minds of the Jews, passed over to the Gentiles. The passage or journey here is His descent from heaven to earth, where He saw the blind man, i.e. looked with compassion on the human race.
For when the Son declared that He worked the works of the Father, He proved that His and His Fatherâ€™s works were the same: which are to heal the sick, to strengthen the weak, and enlighten man.
