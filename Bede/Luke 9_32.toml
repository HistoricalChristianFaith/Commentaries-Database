Peter, and those who were with him, were heavy with sleep, but when they were fully awake, they saw His majesty and the two men standing with Him. Not by mere chance, but by the reason of the mystery were the disciples heavy with sleep, namely, that they might see a representation of the resurrection after physical rest. Those who are awakened to the glory of the saints will see the majesty of the Lord more truly, the more they will rejoice in the immortality of their own flesh, in which they had conquered death. Then they will behold Moses and Elijah in glory, because they will better understand how not one jot or one tittle got passed from the law, nor the Lord came to dissolve the law or the prophets, but to fulfill them (Matthew V).
