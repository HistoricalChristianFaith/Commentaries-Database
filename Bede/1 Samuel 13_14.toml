The Lord sought for Himself a man after His own heart, etc. Under the persona of David, he signifies Christ and the leaders of the Christian people; hence he specifically mentions his own people, and does not add Israel; so that even the Gentiles might be shown to belong to this leader’s command. However, the Lord did not seek as if He did not know, speaking to men in a human manner, even thus speaking, He seeks us. For the Son of Man came to seek and to save that which was lost (Luke 19). We were already known to Him, so that we existed in Him before the foundation of the world. Therefore, the Lord sought for Himself a man after His own heart, that is, one who would recognize the counsel of His will with a pure mind, and who would follow it with pious devotion. This is rightly understood of David, who, understanding beyond all his teachers, recognized the uncertain and hidden things of divine wisdom by manifest revelation, and sang of them with wonderful sweetness (Psalm 51). But it is much better and perfect to understand it of the angel of great counsel, who alone is the conscious revealer of the Father’s secrets. For it is not to be believed that the heart of God, according to the Anthropomorphites, is a member of a human body, but rather signifies the inner secret of divine counsel and wisdom. As indeed it was said above, when the new priesthood of Christ and the Church, as well as here the kingdom, was prophesied to come, with the old one put aside, as the man of God said to Eli: And I will raise up for Myself a faithful priest, who shall do according to My heart and soul (1 Samuel 2).
