But Achis said to him: Against whom have you made a raid today? etc. Although he seems to deceive in the literal sense, who, rising against the Philistines, devastating the province not far from them, said he had made a raid against the one who arouses their king against his own people: yet the figure of speech does not deceive, because while he draws the nations to faith, Christ arises against the clear and burning blasphemy of the Jews. For by His just judgement, blindness in part has happened to Israel, until the fullness of the Gentiles has come in, and thus all Israel shall be saved (Rom. XI): therefore, while bringing in the nations, He rises against Judea, which, out of pride, broke not a few branches of the good olive tree, so that by grafting in the wild olive tree, He might make it a partaker of the good root and fatness of the olive tree. And it is well said to be a rising against, because He who falls, says He, upon this rock, will be broken; but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder (Luke XX).
