Therefore, those who had been scattered returned, preaching the word of God. Instead of “the dispersed,” the Greek text has “disseminated,” that is, scattered like seed, for they were those about whom Isaiah said, “their offspring in the midst of the peoples” and about whom the Lord in the parable of the Gospel said, “the good seed is those sons of the kingdom.” For this seed was disseminated throughout many regions, so that the harvest of faith that started in Jerusalem filled first Judea and Samaria and then the whole world. About these same ones, dispersed or rather disseminated through the next generations, it is said that they spoke the word not only to Jews but also to Greeks, and the noblest foundations of the new church in Antioch were planted through these.
