The Lord visited Sarah as He had promised, and fulfilled what He had spoken to her; she conceived and bore a son in her old age at the time God had predicted to her. God is said to visit Sarah as one who is sick and already despaired of all offspring, so that what nature seemed to deny, the presence of divine grace bestows: which word aptly suits all the children of the promise, who are saved not by their own free will but by the choice of grace, not by the effort of their own labor but by the Lord visiting their hearts and fulfilling the gift of grace which He promised.
