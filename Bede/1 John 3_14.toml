Let no one who is preparing death traps for the members of Christ, no one who is still abiding in death, presume to approach the holy mysteries of life, as if prepared to receive them.

By death, John means the death of the soul, for the soul which sins will surely die. The soul is the life of the flesh, but the life of the soul is God. Therefore when the body dies, the soul leaves it, but when the soul dies, it is God who abandons it. Thus we can say that all of us who are born into this world are dead in soul, since we have inherited original sin from Adam, but the grace of Christ works in believers by giving a new life, so that our souls may live once again.
