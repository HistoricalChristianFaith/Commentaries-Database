And you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of power, and coming with the clouds of heaven. Therefore, if for you in Christ, O Jew, pagan, and heretic, contempt, weakness, and the cross are an insult, see that through these the Son of Man is to sit at the right hand of God the Father, and, born from the Virgin's womb as a man, is to come in His majesty with the clouds of heaven. Hence, the Apostle also, after describing the rejection of the cross, saying that He humbled Himself, became obedient unto death, even death on a cross, added and said: Therefore God also exalted Him and gave Him the name that is above every name, that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven, on earth, and under the earth, and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is in the glory of God the Father (Philipp. II).
