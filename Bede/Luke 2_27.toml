And when his parents brought in the child Jesus, to do for him according to the custom of the law, he also took him into his arms. Indeed, the power of the Lord is great, but his humility shines no less, so that he who is not contained by heaven and earth is carried wholly in the arms of an aged man. But Simeon also tropically takes Christ, the old man the infant, to teach us to put off the old man who is corrupted by his deeds, and to be renewed in the spirit of our mind to put on him who, according to God, is created in righteousness and holiness and truth (Ephesians 4), that is, putting away lying, to speak the truth, and to perform the rest of what pertains to the state of the new man, by mouth, heart, and deed. The righteous and devout elder according to the law takes the child Jesus into his arms to signify the justice of the works that was from the law (For who does not know that works are always represented by the hands and arms?), indeed humble, but to be changed by the grace of the salvific faith of the Gospel. The elder takes the infant Christ to suggest that this age as if already worn out and fatigued by long life, will return to the innocence and (if I may say so) infancy of Christian conduct, and like the youth of an eagle, his youth will be renewed.
