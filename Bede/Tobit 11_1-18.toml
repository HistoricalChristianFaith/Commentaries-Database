The angel and Tobias went ahead to his parents; then his wife followed with substance and her family. After the divine grace, the illuminator, precedes to enlighten the blindness of the Jewish people, and they recognize in their writings that Christ is true God and man, and after the acknowledgment of the true faith, as if seeing the angel and their son whom they had not seen for a long time, rejoicing greatly; thus finally they join themselves to the holy Church, which is gathered from the Gentiles, in the participation of heavenly mysteries.

As they approached the house, the dog that had been with them on the journey ran ahead and, as if acting as a messenger, joyfully wagged his tail. The figure of this dog, which is a traveler and a companion of the angel, is not to be despised. The dog represents the teachers of the Church, who, as we taught above, often fight against heretics, driving away the grievous wolves from the fold of the Chief Shepherd. To them, it is fitting that dogs naturally repay kindness with gratitude and keep vigilant watch for the safety of their masters. Therefore, the dog runs ahead because he first announces salvation to the house, and then the Lord, the illuminator of the world's hearts, follows. It beautifully says "as if acting as a messenger" because indeed every faithful teacher is a messenger of the truth; it beautifully says "wagging his tail joyfully," for the tail, which is the end of the body, signifies the end of good work, that is, perfection, or certainly the reward which is given without end. Thus, the dog joyfully wagged his tail when he revisited the home of his masters, from whom he had been away for a long time. The teachers rejoice in the fulfillment of their work when they understand that Judea will be gathered by the Lord through their ministry. They rejoice in the reception of the eternal life reward and in this same reward, which is common to all the elect, they gladden the hearts of those to whom they preach, while they promise them the immediate coming of Christ's grace.

Therefore, when the dog announced that Tobias had come, his blind father, rising, began to run, stumbling with his feet. Hearing the word of salvation from the teachers, the Hebrew people rise from the long slumber of their infidelity and run with love to the Lord; although stumbling in their works, until the fullness of faith and good work, they receive the light, being regenerated and instructed in Christ.

And taking the hand of the boy, he ran to meet his son. The blind man takes the hand of the boy so that he may run with unimpeded steps to the Lord; even if he himself does not fully understand the path of faith, he still strives to give his assent to the one who knows the light of truth well, so that he may reach the Lord.

And receiving him, he kissed him with his wife, weeping for joy. Judaea, in the end, joyfully receiving the union with Christ, joined weeping to its joy: rejoicing because it believes; grieving because it came to the Lord so late.

Then Tobias, taking some of the fish’s gall, anointed his father’s eyes. And the Lord reveals more openly to believers how great is the malice of the ancient serpent, who once eagerly sought to devour Him in His passion; but by this, he himself was rather killed, losing his members, that is, those he previously held.

A sort of membrane, like an egg, began to come out of Tobias’ eyes after they were anointed with the fish’s gall, and he regained his sight. And the people of the Jews, after they recognize the bitter malice of the most wicked enemy, will regain the lost light. The membrane, which had covered his eyes, signifies the folly of self-pleasing. For they have a zeal for God, but not according to knowledge (Rom. X). And as it says again: Seeking to establish their own righteousness, they have not submitted to the righteousness of God (Ibid.). For the black pupil sees, the white one is darkened. And those who seem wise to themselves, saying, "Are we also blind?" (John IX), the truth is not in them. But those who are conscious of their own frailty and ignorance and know how to say, "My God, enlighten my darkness" (Psalm XVII), these will enjoy the light of life in the Lord. Moreover, the membrane was like an egg, for eggs signify hope; because it is not yet alive, not yet animated, but is separated from the bird that laid it, waiting to live, proceed, run, and fly. And the Apostle says: "But if we hope for what we do not see, we wait for it with patience" (Rom. VIII). Hence, in the evangelical parable, under the name of bread, fish, and egg, the three highest virtues, faith, hope, and charity are expressed. Therefore, the people of the Jews still have a veil before the face of their heart, so that they do not understand the grace of Christ. They have a cataract, because they seem to themselves white and just above all. But they have this cataract like the membrane of an egg; because they endure the blindness of the mind under the most foolish and vain hope of Christ being born in the flesh and delivering them and giving them a great kingdom throughout the world. But to any of them from whom the mist of error is removed, they will recognize that Christ has already come and redeemed the world with His blood. It aptly fits what follows:

Because, having received sight, Tobias glorified God with his wife, and all his acquaintances, saying, "I bless you, Lord God of Israel, because you have chastised me, and you have saved me," etc. The seven days signify the light of spiritual grace, which is taken as sevenfold. Therefore, after seven days, Tobias, having been illuminated, his son’s wife enters, because after Judaea has been illuminated through faith, after receiving the grace of the Holy Spirit, the Church will enter it, so that there may be one fold and one shepherd, and one house of Christ founded on one cornerstone.

The livestock and camels also entered, and the wife’s considerable wealth. Many faithful persons and many virtues of the Church will then be gathered among the Jewish people.

But also the money that he had received from Gabael. The knowledge of the Scriptures, which they once lent to the Gentiles, will then be returned to them.

Tobias’ relatives came, congratulating him on all the good things the Lord had done for him, and they feasted with him for seven days. This is what Moses said in the song: "Rejoice, O Gentiles, with His people" (Rom. XV). They feast together for seven days; because they rejoice in spiritual gifts and virtues. The angel, about to return to heaven, more openly explains to them who he is, why he came, and that he is returning to God. And the Lord will then reveal more broadly to that advancing people the gifts of His knowledge, opening and showing to all that He is in the Father, and the Father in Him. Therefore, the angel returns to God, and Tobias remains with his father. And the Lord is understood by the elect, equal to the Father in divinity, consubstantial with us in humanity.
