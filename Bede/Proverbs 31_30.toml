"Grace is deceitful, and beauty is vain," etc. "Grace" is the praise that a person receives from men is deceitful, and "beauty" of chastity or good works which the soul shows to men is vain if it lacks the fear of God. But that conscience is truly worthy of praise, which in all things keeps the fear of God. For he is the beginning and guardian of all virtues, as Scripture says: "The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom" (Ps. 111; Prov. 1, 9; Ecclus. 1). And again: "He who fears the Lord neglects nothing" (Sir. 7). For this reason blessed Job, both in prosperity flourished incomparably in virtues, and in adversity remained an insuperable enemy, because he could truly say: "For I always feared the Lord like waves swelling over me, and I could not bear his weight" (Job 31). Hence, the grace of dissemblers is deceitful; the decoration of the work of fools is vain. But the Church, which lives temporally in the fear of its pilgrimage, because it will offer burning lamps of virtues to its coming Judge and Husband, rightly praised by him, will enter with him the gate of the heavenly kingdom. How he praises her is taught in the concluding verse:
