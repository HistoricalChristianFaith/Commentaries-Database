After them, the Tekoites repaired another section, etc. Indeed, the wall of the temple is the body of the Lord Savior, about which He Himself said to the Jews: "Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up" (John 2): which, of course, the temple of His body, His persecutors destroyed in death, but being raised up, and exalted to the heavens, His lovers saw in glory, and do not cease to see forever. Therefore, from the great and eminent tower, even to the wall of the temple, the structure of the holy city is reached, as every just person, from the height of contemplation, in which, with earthly temporals despised even in this life, they are elevated to aspire to celestial things, and in that life, with the brightness of the Lord's incarnation revealed, they also ascend to the eternity of divine glory. And because Tekoa means trumpet or horn, the Tekoites are interpreted as trumpeters, it is aptly said that the Tekoites built these things; for it is the duty of teachers, whose sound has gone out to all the earth, to reveal either the present gifts of God, or the future in His city, that is, the people of the faithful.
