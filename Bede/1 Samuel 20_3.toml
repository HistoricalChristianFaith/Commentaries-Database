Moreover, as the Lord lives, and as your soul lives, etc. He was separated from death by only a single step, that is, by the wall of the house in which he was staying, when (as the title of the fifty-eighth psalm also contains) Saul sent and watched him, seeking to kill him. But immediately slipping from death through a window, he was rescued and fled away, saved completely, so that by the Lord's mercy, what was foretold in the same title might happen: "Do not destroy David," in the title's inscription. This should likewise be understood also of the Lord Savior, as He was separated from death by only a single step, so to speak, due to the temerity of men, when the chief priests sent and watched over His tomb, trying to block His resurrection, by denying the entrance to it, drawing His disciples away from the faith, and erasing all memory of His name from the midst if His disciples were retracted from faith. But according to the testimony of the mentioned inscription, just as neither the title written by Pilate, "This is the King of the Jews," nor the kingdom of the same King could ever be corrupted.
