quote='''
I have set the Lord always before me, because He is at my right hand, that I should not be moved. Coming, he says, into the transient things, I did not take my eye off Him who always remains, foreseeing this, that after passing through temporal things I should turn to Him, because He favors me, so that I may remain steadfastly in Him, and I attribute this, that I did not commit sin nor was deceit found in my mouth (I Peter II), not to humanity, but to divinity; on account of this, there is joy in my thoughts, and rejoicing in my words, because of the resurrection, namely, because through it the world has been delivered.
