As though Judas was asking an innocent question, our Lord simply and gently explained the mystery of what Mary’s action meant, namely that he himself was about to die, and that he was to be anointed for his burial with the spices.… This is to say clearly, “She will not be able to touch my body once I am dead; she has done what she was able to do; she has anticipated, while I am still alive, the performance of the duty of burying me.”
