[[commentary]]
quote='''
The Mount of Olives designates the height of the Lord’s benevolence and mercy, for in Greek “mercy” is called oleos, and an olive plantation is called oleon, and also because anointing with oil usually soothes weary and aching limbs. But oil is preeminent in power and purity too, and it tends to make its way up and float on the top of any liquid that you choose to pour into it. This fact not inappropriately suggests the grace of heavenly mercy.…Let us come then with all our concentration of mind to him who has his place on the invisible Mount of Olives. God, his God, has anointed him with the oil of gladness above his companions in order that he may deign to make us also companions of that anointing of his, that is, sharers of spiritual grace.
