Hand in hand, the evil will not be innocent. He who joins hands does indeed nothing. But hand in hand, the evil will not be innocent, because even if he withdraws his hand from impious action for a time, the evil cannot have the innocence of the heart. Hence it is also said beforehand, The small heart is an abomination to the Lord.

But the seed of the righteous will be saved. This is what is said above, But to him who sows righteousness, there will be a faithful reward. Or surely, the seed of the righteous will be saved, because those who follow the examples of the previous righteous also follow their footsteps to see the joys of eternal salvation. Of whom Isaiah speaks, All who see them will recognize them, because they are the seed which the Lord has blessed.
