A disciple is not above his teacher. But everyone who is fully trained will be like his teacher. If the teacher, who could almost like God, did not seek to avenge his own injuries but preferred to make his pursuers gentler by enduring them, it is necessary that disciples, who are pure humans, follow that rule of perfection.
