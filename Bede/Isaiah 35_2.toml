Because a multitude of Gentiles followed it after Judah came to faith in the Lord’s incarnation and an astonished partaker of the same grace hastened its own unexpected conversion, Judah exclaimed in surprise, “Who is this that ascends from the desert, flowing with delights, leaning upon my beloved?” The church of the Gentiles ascends from the desert because the one who was deserted by its Creator for a very long time now arrives at his grace by the incremental steps of faith and good works, thus fulfilling what the prophet Isaiah said: “The desert and the dry land will rejoice, and the wilderness will exult and bloom like the lily.” Indeed, she is truly flowing with those delights about which the spouse spoke above: “How beautiful you are, and how lovely, my dear, with delights,” that is, with the delights of heavenly life. “Leaning upon my beloved” means leaning upon him without whose assistance she would be able neither to ascend above nor to rise again, for we are unable to possess either advancement in the virtues or the beginning of faith itself unless the Lord bestows them upon us.Therefore, Judah was even more awestruck by this grace of the Gentiles’ new conversion, a grace that it believed pertained only to itself and to those who were received in its rite through the mystery of circumcision, as the Acts of the Apostles made abundantly clear.
