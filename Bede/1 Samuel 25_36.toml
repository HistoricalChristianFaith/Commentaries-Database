Moreover, Abigail came to Nabal, and behold, there was a feast in his house. After showing the Lord the affection of her devotion, the Synagogue of believers came to see the life and mind of the unbelievers, in case she might be able to call them to faith as well. But when she saw them satiated with the feasts of legal sacrifices, rejoicing that they were a royal race above other nations, and, what is worse, inflated with a mad intoxication against the word of the Gospel, she was silent for a while about the danger of the crime committed, until she herself, more and more confirmed by the light of the Holy Spirit, proceeded more freely to reprove and they, with the glory of Christ shining openly, would recognize the sin they had committed against Him more evidently, and recognizing, would lament, lamenting would cleanse themselves. However, they, recognizing their guilt, chose not to cleanse it with repentance, but to increase it with pride. For even the apostles and all who repented from the snares of the devil are believed to pertain to Abigail, that is, to the person of the Father's exultation, either as companions or as gifts.
