He who hides grain in time, etc. He who keeps the words of holy preaching to himself will be cursed among the people, because for the fault of silence alone, he is condemned for the punishment of many whom he could have corrected. He is the wicked and slothful servant, cast into outer darkness for keeping the talent which he received (Matthew 25). But they sell the grain who impart the word of life to those who hear it, from whom they receive the price of faith and confession, as the Lord says, "Trade until I come" (Luke 19). Blessing descends upon their head, while the Lord says to each one returning with such business, "Well done, good and faithful servant; because you have been faithful over a few things, I will set you over many; enter into the joy of your Lord" (ibid.).
