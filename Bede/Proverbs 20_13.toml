Do not love sleep, etc. Do not love the sleep of sin and slothfulness, about which the Apostle says, "It is high time to awake out of sleep" (Rom. XIII); lest, if you do not wish to be vigilant now, you be overtaken by that dire poverty in the future where you cannot find even a single drop of water when thirsty. Open the eyes of your heart to holy vigils, and seek the satisfaction of heavenly joys by living well.
