It is good that the angel said “has been born today” and did not say “this night.” He appeared with heavenly light to those who were conducting the watch by night and brought the good news that day was born.… He who appeared temporally in the city of David as a human being from a virgin mother was, in truth, himself born before all time and without spatial limitation, light from light, true God from true God. Because, therefore, the light of life rose for those of us dwelling in the region of the shadow of death, the herald of this rising says, “A savior has been born to you today.” So that being always advised by this word we may remember that the night of ancient blindness is past and the day of eternal salvation has arrived. Let us cast off the works of darkness. And let us walk as children of light, “for the fruit of the light is in all justice and holiness.”
