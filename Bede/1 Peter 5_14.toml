The holy kiss is the exact opposite of the kiss with which Judas betrayed the Savior. That is the sort of kiss used by those who speak peace to their neighbors, but their hearts are full of wickedness. The holy kiss, in sharp contrast to this, is one which is given not in word only but in deed and in truth as well.
