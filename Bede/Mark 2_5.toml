When Jesus saw their faith, etc. The Lord, about to cure a man of paralysis, first dissolved the bonds of sins, to show that he was condemned due to the bonds of sins by the dissolution of his limbs, and that he could not be restored to health in his limbs unless these bonds were relaxed. Likewise, to that paralytic, who was waiting in vain by the pool of Bethesda for the movement of the water for a long time, it is said by the Lord, healed: "Behold, you have been made well; do not sin anymore, lest something worse happen to you." (John XIV).

"Son," he said, "your sins are forgiven you." O wondrous humility! He calls "son" the despised and weak man, dissolved in all his limbs, whom the priests would not deign to touch. Or rightly "son" because his sins are forgiven him. It should indeed be considered how much the faith of each person is worth before God, since the faith of others was so great that a whole man, that is, was suddenly saved both outwardly and inwardly, and the errors of some were loosed by the merit of others.
