And Jesus said to them: You will all be scandalized in this night. He foretells what they will suffer so that when they suffer, they do not despair of salvation but find release by repenting. And He specifically added, "in this night you will be scandalized," because just as those who get drunk, get drunk at night, so also those who suffer scandal, suffer it in the night and in darkness. But let us say: "The night is far spent, the day is at hand" (Romans 13).

For it is written: "I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered." This is written in other words in the prophet Zechariah; and, if I am not mistaken, it is spoken by the prophet to God: "Smite the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered" (Zechariah 13). The sixty-eighth psalm, which is entirely sung by the Lord, corresponds to this sense: "For they persecuted him whom you have smitten." The good shepherd is smitten so that he may lay down his life for his sheep and from many wandering flocks there may be made one flock and one shepherd.
