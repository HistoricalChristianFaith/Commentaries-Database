Saul and all the people cried out, etc. Jews, Gentiles, and heretics, although they are all enemies of the Church, wound each other with the sword of the word. The Jews themselves fight among themselves through the Pharisees and Sadducees: likewise heretics and pagans, with so much dissonance of various doctrines and sacred matters, bring no less wars among themselves than with the Church. But there is one, he says, my dove, my perfect one (Canticles VI): she is the only one of her mother, the chosen one of her who bore her, from whom Jonathan, that most valiant leader, received the name of virtue, that he might be called the gift of the dove; whose perpetual peace even the discord of the wicked serves.
