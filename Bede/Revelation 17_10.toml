It says that the heads of the beast are kings of the world. For because of the swelling of their pride, they are compared with high mountains on which wanton ungodliness rests, so that they oppress by force and deceive by fraud.… Since the number seven indicates the full [duration] of earthly dominion, whose final period, that of the kingdom of the antichrist, has not yet come; it accordingly indicates that five have passed away, the sixth now exists, and the seventh is yet to come. “When he comes, he must remain only a little while.” Since the Lord considers us, both the proud and the weak, it says that those days that he will inflict on us and that will be especially evil will be made short for mercy’s sake. [This will be] so that he might terrify their arrogance by the adversities of that time yet might revive their weakness because of its brevity.
