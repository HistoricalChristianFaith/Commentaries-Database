(1 Samuel 19) "But Saul spoke to Jonathan his son," etc. The princes of the Jews, together with the elders and scribes, spoke to the apostles, strictly commanding them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus.

Moreover, Jonathan, the son of Saul, loved David greatly, etc. Likewise, the apostles loved Christ greatly, and, recounting the accusations of the faithless, they beseeched Him to defend His Church, to preserve the faith in His name within the Church; remaining secretly in the hearts of the believers, yet hidden from the disturbance of men. We, however, they say, you dwelling fruitfully in the minds of the pious (Genesis 27). For this is truly the field full of fragrance and grace, which the Lord has blessed; we will speak and teach this people in Your name, and those who prefer to believe rather than disbelieve from among them, we will announce to Your holy Church, so that, knowing the state of each, it may learn to join the faithful and to protect itself from the unbelievers.
