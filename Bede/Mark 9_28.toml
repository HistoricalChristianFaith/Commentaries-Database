And when He had entered into the house, His disciples asked Him privately: Why could not we cast him out? And He said to them: This kind can go out by nothing but by prayer and fasting. While teaching the apostles how the most wicked demon should be expelled, He instructed all to life, so that we may know that all the gravest temptations of either unclean spirits or men are to be overcome by fasting and prayers. The wrath of the Lord, when kindled in vengeance of our sins, can also be appeased by this singular remedy. Generally, fasting is not only to abstain from food but also to refrain from all carnal temptations, indeed, to contain oneself from all passions of vices. Likewise, general prayer is not solely in the words with which we invoke divine clemency, but also in all things which we do in devout faith as service to our Creator, as the apostle testifies, saying: Always rejoicing, pray without ceasing (I Thess. V). For how can anyone invoke God with words at all hours and moments without ceasing? But then we pray without ceasing when we conduct those works alone which commend us to the piety of our Creator. By which fasting and what prayer, with the Lord's help, we will vanquish and repel all the snares of the ancient enemy.
