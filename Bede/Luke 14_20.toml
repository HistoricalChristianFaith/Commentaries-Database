And another said: I have married a wife, and therefore I cannot come. What is understood by a wife, except carnal pleasure? For although marriage is good and instituted by Divine Providence for the propagation of offspring, some nevertheless seek in it not the fruitfulness of offspring, but the desires of pleasure. And therefore, through a just matter, an unjust matter can not incongruously be signified. Therefore, the highest Master of the house invites us to the banquet of the eternal feast, but while this one is occupied with earthly care, another is devoured by the keen thought of another's actions, and even the mind of another is polluted by carnal pleasure, each fastidious one does not hasten to the feasts of eternal life.
