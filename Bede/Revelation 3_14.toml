Laodicea: Laodicea means &quot;the lovely tribe of the Lord,&quot; or, &quot;they were in vomiting.&quot; For there were there both those to whom He said, &quot;I will spew thee out of My mouth,&quot; and those also to whom He said this, &quot;Whom I love, I rebuke and chasten.&quot; But, according to the Greek, it is interpreted, &quot;a just people.&quot;

Laodicea is interpreted “tribe beloved of the Lord” or “they were in vomit.” For there were some there to whom he had said, “I will begin to spew you out of my mouth,” and others to whom he said, “Those whom I love, I reprove and chastise.” According to the Greek, [Laodicea] is interpreted “just people.”
