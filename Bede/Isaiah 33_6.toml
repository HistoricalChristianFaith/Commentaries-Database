But “true wealth” signifies either the joy of eternal life itself, concerning which it is written, “the riches of his inheritance in the saints,” or those spiritual virtues with which the fullness of life is attained, about which Isaiah said, “the riches of salvation, wisdom, and knowledge; the fear of the Lord himself is its treasure.”“And if you are unfaithful with goods that are not yours, who will give you something of your own?” The resources of this world are alien to us, that is, external to the nature of our habitat, “for we brought nothing into this world and we are without doubt unable to take anything from it.” Our possession is the kingdom of heaven, our life is Christ, and our wealth consists in the fruitfulness of spiritual works, about which Solomon said, “The redemption of a man’s soul is his wealth.”
