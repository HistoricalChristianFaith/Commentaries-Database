And they blasphemed the God of heaven, etc. He did not attribute it to their hardness but to the just indignation of God, who gave such a kind of plague, in which they do not remember. For who, being afflicted bodily, does not feel the hand of God as Antiochus did? For he said they blasphemed, not openly, but indulging in their sins.
