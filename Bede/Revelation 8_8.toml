The second trumpet indicates the expulsion of the devil from the church that he might burn more hotly in the sea of the world.… As the Christian religion increased, the devil, puffed up with pride and burning with the fire of his own anger, was cast into the sea of the world, as the Lord said: “If you should say to this mountain, ‘Be taken up and cast yourself into the sea,’ it will be done,” not because he was not there before but because, thrown out of the church, he began to rage even more against his own followers, inflicting upon them spiritual death by the arrogance of fleshly wisdom. For to be wise according to the flesh is death. For flesh and blood did not teach the apostles, but the Father who is in heaven. For they guided the ship of faith upon that sea that had proven itself suitable for walking to the feet of the Lord.
