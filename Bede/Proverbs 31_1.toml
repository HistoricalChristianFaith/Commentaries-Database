The words of King Lemuel, etc. Lemuel is interpreted as, "in whom is God." And he is the same who is spoken of above, called by the same name translated into Latin, "The vision which the man spoke, with whom is God." But the mother, who taught him this vision, is understood no better than as divine grace, which invisibly instructed him in the heart with the understanding of wisdom which he himself would minister outwardly to men. Although even his physical mother, Solomon, can rightly be understood to have taught him this when he was a child. Which indeed he, because he knew it to be wisely spoken, wanted to mix into the work of his parables. And therefore rightly, after it is said in the title, "The words of King Lemuel," it is immediately added, "The vision with which his mother instructed him," because when he was anointed to the kingdom, he received the spirit of wisdom, he saw in the same spirit how prudently his good mother had taught him.
