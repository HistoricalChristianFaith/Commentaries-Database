By wine we are refreshed inwardly. By a garment we are outwardly covered. Both relate to the dynamics of spiritual life. The garment indicates good works performed outwardly in order to shine in the sight of the world. By wine and new wine we mean that fervor of faith, hope and love by means of which, in the sight of our maker, our souls are recovered inwardly to newness of spirit.
