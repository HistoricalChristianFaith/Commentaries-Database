The leaders of the Jews and the elders and scribes spoke to the apostles and strictly commanded them not to speak or teach in the name of Jesus. …
Moreover, the apostles loved Christ mightily and, as they counted the abusive attacks of the treacherous, they asked him to defend his church and to save his name and to stay in the church in a hidden manner and to hide in the hearts of the believers away from the consternation of men. They said, “As you dwell in the flowering minds of the pious—for here is a field full of aroma and grace which the Lord has blessed—we will speak and teach this people in your name, and those among it who prefer to believe rather than remain in unbelief we will announce to your holy church so that as each one knows the state of each individual, he will know to ally himself with the faithful and to preserve himself from the unbelievers.” - "Four Books on 1 Samuel 3.19"
