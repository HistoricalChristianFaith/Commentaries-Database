In Marc., 2, 31: Decapolis is aregion of ten cities, across the Jordan, to the east, over against Galilee When therefore it is said that the Lord came to the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the borders of Decapolis, it does not mean that He entered the confines of Decapolis themselves; for He is not said to have crossed the sea, but rather to have cometo the borders of the sea, and to have reached quite up to the place, which was opposite to the midst of the coasts of Decapolis, which were situated at adistance across the sea. It goes on, “And they bring Him one that was deaf and dumb, and they besought Him to lay hands upon him. "There follows, “And He took him aside from the multitude, and put His fingers into his ears.”.
He looked up to heaven, that Hemight teach us that thence is to be procured speech for the dumb, hearing forthe deaf, health for all who are sick. And He sighed, not that it was necessary for Him to be any thing from His Father with groaning, for He, together with the Father, gives all things to them who ask, but that He might give us an example of sighing, when for our own errors and those of our neighbours, we invoke the guardianship of the Divine mercy.
But that which He says, “Ephphatha,that is, Be opened,” belong properly to the ears, for the ears are to be opened for hearing, but the tongue to be loosed from the bonds of its impediment, that is may be able to speak. Wherefore it goes on, “And straightway his ears were opened, and the string of his tongue was loosed, and he spake plain. "It goes on, “And He charged them that they should tell no man.”.
Or he is deaf and dumb, who neither has ears to hear the words of God, nor opens his mouth to speak them, and such must be presented to the Lord for healing, by men who have already learned to hear and speak the divine oracles.
