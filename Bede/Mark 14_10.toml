And Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went to the chief priests to betray him to them. Unfortunate Judas! He believes he has suffered a loss from the pouring out of the ointment and wants to compensate it with the price of his master, not even asking for a fixed amount, as if to make the betrayal seem at least lucrative, but, as if selling a worthless slave, placed it in the power of the buyers to give as much as they wanted. The fact that it says, “He went to the chief priests to betray him to them,” shows that he was neither invited by the leaders nor constrained by any necessity but spontaneously entered into the plan with a wicked mind.
