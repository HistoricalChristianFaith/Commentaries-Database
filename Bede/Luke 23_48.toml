And all the multitude of those who came together to this spectacle, and saw the things that happened, returned beating their breasts. That they beat their breasts, because it is a sign of repentance and mourning, can be understood in two ways. For either they mourned unjustly for the one whose life they loved, being killed, or they trembled as they remembered having obtained his death, seeing him more glorified in death. But whether this, or that, or both reasons together caused various and dissenting persons in the crowd to beat their breasts, the distinction between the nation and the nation must be noted. For the Gentiles, fearing God with the death of Christ, glorify with open confession, while the Jews, only beating their breasts, silently return home.
