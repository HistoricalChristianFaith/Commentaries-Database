Honor the Lord with your substance, etc. Many give much to the poor, but from another's substance and harvests, which they have taken by force or fraud. Many give of their own, but do not honor the Lord in their giving, because they do it for human favor, and not for the love of the Heavenly Inspector. Therefore, anyone who wishes the fruit of alms to be profitable to them should give from their own possessions, and in honor of the Creator, who has deigned to graciously and abundantly bestow them with his kindness, so that men who are his creation, made in his image, may be refreshed, and we may be found his true and faithful stewards of good things. But it must be noted that we are commanded not only to honor from the substance of money, which we extend to the poor, but also from the entirety of good action that we do, and from the fruits of all heavenly grace that we receive, for the substance or fruits of men; that is, to seek his praise in all things, and not our own. And he honors the Lord with his substance and the first fruits of his crops, who attributes all his good works not to his own strength and merits, but to heavenly grace, mindful of that word, "For without me you can do nothing" (John XV).
