The gold leaf with which the house was covered is the manifold works of piety that pure love exhibits in the service either of its Creator or of a brotherâ€™s need. The gold nails with which the gold leaf was attached are the very precepts of charity or promises of eternal glory through which by the gift of the grace of Christ we are kept constant in the exercise and pursuit of virtue in case we should fail.
