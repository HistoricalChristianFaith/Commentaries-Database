Because the Holy Spirit well spoke through Isaiah the prophet to your fathers, saying: "Go to this people and say: You will hear indeed, etc." This prophecy, which the Apostle affirms was pronounced by the Holy Spirit, the book of the prophet itself recalls as having been spoken by the Lord. From this, it is clearly shown that the will and nature of the Lord and the Holy Spirit are one, and the name of the Lord is also understood in the appellation of the Spirit. And indeed, Paul, having no other Holy Spirit when he wrote these things about him, who was in the prophets before the coming of the Lord, was referring to the same Spirit of whom he himself was also a partaker, and all those who were brought in the faith of perfect virtue. Hence, he mentions the Spirit with the article, confirming it to be singular and one, and as he says, not simply "Holy Spirit," but with the added article "the Holy Spirit," and he recalls Isaiah prophesying with the word "the Holy Spirit." Peter too, in that speech by which he persuaded the present, said: "It was necessary for the Scripture to be fulfilled which the Holy Spirit spoke (that is, 'the Holy Spirit') through the mouth of David concerning Judas" (Acts I). He too shows that the same Spirit worked in the prophets and in the apostles. These excerpts from the books of the blessed Didymus should hold this place in our writings.
