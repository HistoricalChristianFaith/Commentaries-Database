You see, our Lord provided encouragement for the multitude that was following him as the Passover, the Jewsâ€™ festival day, was drawing near. He did this by his words of salvation, together with the help of his cures. As another Evangelist wrote, he spoke to them about the kingdom of God and healed those who were in need of being cured. When his acts of teaching and healing were completed, he refreshed them most abundantly from a small amount of food.
