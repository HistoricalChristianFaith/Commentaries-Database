It is better to meet a bear robbed of her cubs, etc. It was easier for the holy teachers to confront the fury of the pagans, having snatched some people from them and converted them from their bestial cruelty to the piety of faith by preaching, than to confront any heretic confident in the defiance of his dogma; because surely that battle was fought against outsiders, this against their own people. The bear's name can be understood as the very malice of the ancient enemy, from whom we snatch cubs when we join those who were sons of the devil to the company of the sons of God by catechizing and baptizing. And this is often accomplished with much lighter labor than if you try to call a heretic back to the right faith, or to bring a Catholic doing wrong to the state of good action.
