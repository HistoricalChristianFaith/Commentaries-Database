Surely the entire divinely arranged plan of our Redeemer’s [coming] in the flesh is the reconciliation of the world—it was for this purpose that he became incarnate, for this he suffered, for this he was raised from the dead—that he might lead us, who had incurred God’s anger by sinning, back to God’s peace by his act of reconciliation. Hence he was rightly given the name “Father of the world to come” and “Prince of peace” by the prophet; and the apostle, writing about him to those from among the nations who had believed, said, “And coming, he brought the good news of peace to you who were from far off and peace to those who were near, since through him we both have access in one Spirit to the Father.”

Clothed in flesh, [Christ] descended into the water as “an angel of great counsel,” that is, as a herald of the Father’s will to Jewish people. By his deeds and his teaching he moved sinners, so that he would be killed—he who, by his bodily death, was able not only to heal those who were ailing spiritually but also to bring the dead back to life. The movement of the water, then, suggests the Lord’s passion, which occurred by the Jewish nation being moved and stirred up.

“Which will be to all people,” not to all the people of the Jews, nor to all the people of the nations, but to all the people who, either from the Jews or from the nations of the whole world, are brought together in one flock to one confession of Christ. From one and the same partaking of the mysteries of Christ they are called “Christian.” …The light of life rose for those of us dwelling in the region of the shadow of death.
