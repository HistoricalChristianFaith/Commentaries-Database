The law was indeed given through Moses, and there it was determined by a heavenly rule what was to be done and what was to be avoided, but what it commanded was completed only by the grace of Christ. On the one hand, that law was capable of pointing out sin, teaching justice and showing transgressors what they are charged with. On the other hand, the grace of Christ, poured out in the hearts of the faithful through the spirit of charity, brings it about that what the law commanded may be fulfilled. Hence that which was written, “do not covet,” is the law given through Moses because it is commanded, but grace comes through Christ when what is commanded is fulfilled. Truth came through Christ because “the law has but a shadow of the good things to come, instead of the true form of these realities.” And, as the apostle says elsewhere, “These things happened to them as a figure.” But in place of a shadow Christ displayed the light of truth, and in place of the figure of the law he displayed the exact image of the things which were prefigured when, with the giving of the grace of the Spirit, he made clear to his disciples the meaning so that they could understand the Scriptures. The law was given through Moses when the people were commanded to be made clean by the sprinkling of the blood of a lamb. The grace and truth which were prefigured in the law came through Jesus Christ when he himself, having suffered on the cross, “freed us from our sins by his blood.”
