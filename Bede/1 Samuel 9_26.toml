“And he spoke with Saul on the sun porch atop the house. For when he had arisen early and it had already grown light, Samuel called to Saul on the sun porch, saying, ‘Arise that I might send you.’ ” John spoke with the Lord in the light that came from recognizing his divinity. It is called a sun porch because it receives the rays of the sun first before the lower portions of the building. Without doubt, then, the sun porch represents those hearts for whom the sun of righteousness has arisen as they have been lifted up from earthly desires by the fear of God. For when John commenced with the beginning of the dispensation for which he was sent and when the new light of grace gradually began to shine clearly in the world, the very same John confessed that Jesus was the Christ, the Son of God, but that he himself had been sent before him. John desired with the full intent of his mind that Christ would rise in the flesh to perform his divine works and let John rest at the right time from his office of forerunner to Christ.

“And Saul arose and the two departed, namely, Saul and Samuel.” So too Jesus “manifested his glory and his disciples believed in him.” The two, namely, Jesus and John, set out and departed from their secret contemplation of the divine will to show the miraculous works in plain sight.
