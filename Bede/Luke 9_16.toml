After taking the five loaves and the two fish, he looked up to heaven, blessed them, broke them, and gave them to his disciples to set before the crowd. The Savior, seeing the hungry crowds, does not create new food, but blesses what the disciples have brought, because, coming in the flesh, he preaches nothing other than what has been foretold, but demonstrates the sayings of prophecy filled with the mysteries of grace. He looks to heaven to teach that the gaze of the mind should be directed there, and that the light of knowledge is to be sought there. He breaks the loaves and distributes them to his disciples to set before the crowd, because he reveals the closed sacraments of the law and prophecy to those who will preach throughout the world.
