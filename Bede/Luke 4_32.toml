And they were amazed at his teaching, because his word was with authority. The word of the teacher is made with authority when he performs the things he teaches. For he who destroys his own words with deeds is scorned. Whom, on the contrary, the Apostle instituting against the teacher says: Let no one despise your youth (1 Tim. 4). But uniquely the Lord and principally alone spoke from good authority, because he committed none from bad weakness. For from the power of divinity he had that which he ministered to us through the innocence of his humanity. In another way, his word was with authority, or as another evangelist says, he was teaching them as one having authority, and not as the scribes. Because the scribes were giving the people the precepts they learned through the law. But he, as the author and fulfiller of the law, either by changing or by augmenting what seemed less, acting freely, substituted them.
