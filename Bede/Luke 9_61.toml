And another said: I will follow you, Lord, but first allow me to say farewell to those who are at home. If a disciple of the Lord, because he wishes to say this farewell at home, is reproved, what will happen to those who, with no purpose of usefulness or of building faith, often do not fear to revisit the homes of those relatives they left in the world?
