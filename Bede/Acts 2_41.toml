When the Church's baptism was celebrated for the first time, divine mercy providentially gathered together three thousand souls for the profession of the holy Trinity. On the 5th day of the Passover, when the law was given, Moses indeed ordered the festival of first fruits to be introduced. Now, however, with the coming of the Holy Spirit, it is not sheaves of grain, but the first fruits of souls, which are consecrated to the Lord.
