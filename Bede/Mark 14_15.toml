And he will show you a large upper room furnished and prepared there for us, etc. The large upper room is the spiritual law, which leaving the narrowness of the letter, receives the Savior in a high place. For he who still observes the killing letter, who understands nothing in the lamb but a mere animal, certainly does less of the Passover: because he has not yet learned to grasp the majesty of the spirit in the words of God. But he who follows the water bearer, that is, the preacher of grace, into the house of the Church, prepares for Christ a banquet room in the high chamber of the mind by transcending the surface of the letter through the illuminating spirit, because he recognizes that all the mysteries of the Passover, or other decrees of the law, are his mysteries.
