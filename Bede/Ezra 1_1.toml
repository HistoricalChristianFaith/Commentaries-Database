The holy prophets Isaiah and Jeremiah clearly foretold that all these events would thus come to pass. Jeremiah even predicted the number of years in which they would be held captive in Babylonia and when they would be brought back to their homeland, whereas Isaiah, without any of the obscurities of prophetic speech, even revealed the name of King Cyrus, by whom they were to be freed from slavery, brought back to their homeland, and by whose permission they would  restore the temple. For Jeremiah says: Thus says the Lord of Hosts, the God of Israel, to all that I carried into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon: Build houses and dwell in them. For thus says the Lord of Hosts, when the seventy years have begun to be fulfilled in Babylon, I will come to you and raise up my voice over you and bring you back to that place. And Isaiah says: This is what the Lord says, your Redeemer and Maker from the womb: 'I am the Lord, who make all things;' and a little farther on: / who say to the deep: 'Be desolate, and I will dry up your rivers'. I who say to Cyrus: 'You are my shepherd, and shall perform all my will'. I who say to Jerusalem: 'You shall be built'; and to the temple: 'Your foundation shall be laid'. This is what the Lord says to my anointed Cyrus, whose right hand I have taken hold of so that I may subdue nations before him and turn the backs of kings, and I will open doors before him and gates will not be shut: I will go before you and will level the great ones of the earth; I will knock down the gates of bronze and break through bars of iron. I will give you hidden treasures and secrets of secrets, so that you may know that I who call your name am the Lord, the God of Israel. For the sake of Jacob my servant and of Israel my elect, I have summoned you by name and have made you like “them”, though you have not known me. I am the Lord, and there is no other; apart from me there is no God. I have armed you, and you have not known me.5 From this prophecy of Isaiah it ought to be believed that King Cyrus greatly loved the children of Israel and freed them from captivity and sent them home and commanded them to rebuild the Lord's temple, because he had heard what their prophets had foretold through the spirit of God concerning Cyrus' kingdom and the destruction of the Babylonians' kingdom. For these prophets had specifically described the kind of assault by which Cyrus seized Babylon, of whom Isaiah says:  who say to the deep: Be desolate, and I will dry up your rivers; but Jeremiah: That very wall of Babylon, very broad though it is, shall be utterly broken down, and her high gates shall be set on fire. For the accounts tell that the enemy entered Babylon via the dry and abandoned bed of the River Euphrates, which flows through the middle of the city but which had been diverted and emptied into many channels. Let this much be said briefly concerning the historical sense.
