Now Joshua begot Joakim, etc. Finally, Jeddua, who is placed last among these, Josephus writes (Antiquities II, 8) was the high priest in the times of Alexander the Great, and humbly and honorably received by him when he met him with his brothers. Indeed, he names him Jaddus, and says that he was the father of Onias the high priest, of whom it is written in the book of the Maccabees; not that Nehemiah, the author of this book, could have lived in the flesh until those times, but because he knew his infancy, who yet could have reached the grade of priesthood after a long time following his death. For at the end of this little book, there is also mention of the sons of Joiada, the son of Eliasib, that one of them was the son-in-law of Sanballat the Horonite, although the name of this son-in-law is indeed omitted. But because Joiada is the same grandfather of Jeddua, it is clear that the son-in-law spoken of is either the actual father of this Jeddua, or his uncle; therefore, he could have been born while Nehemiah was still alive.
