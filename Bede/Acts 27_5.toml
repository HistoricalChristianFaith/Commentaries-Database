And sailing through the sea of Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Lystrus, which is of Lycia. For Lystrus, in Greek, it is written Smyrna, for which Jerome in the book of Hebrew names puts Myra: which I think is found thus in some Codices, because in Greek μύῤῥα is called Smyrna. Furthermore, in the psalm where we sing: Myrrh, and aloes, and cassia (Psalm XLIV), in Greek it is written thus: Smyrna, and stacte, and cassia.
