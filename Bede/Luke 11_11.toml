Which of you is there, who, if your son asks for bread, will give him a stone? Bread is understood as charity due to its greater desirability and so necessary that without it, everything else is nothing, just like a table is impoverished without bread. Its contrary is the hardness of heart, which he compared to a stone.

Or if he asks for a fish, will he for a fish give him a serpent? A fish represents faith in invisible things, either because of the water of baptism or because it is taken from invisible places. Since faith is also not broken by the waves of this world, it is rightly compared to a fish. Its contrary he set as the serpent because of the poison of deceit, which by evil persuasion also first sowed in man.
