But Herod, with his soldiers, despised him, and mocking, arrayed him in a white garment and sent him back to Pilate. The white garment, in which he was arrayed, signifies the purity of his passion, since the spotless Lamb of God was about to take away the sins of the whole world. For he who was despised and mocked in a white garment, suffered and was buried in a pure body. Alternatively: that he was mocked here in a white garment, but according to other evangelists in a purple or scarlet garment, expresses the double type of martyrdom, with which the passions of the holy Church are adorned. Which, admiring the innocent death of her Lord and groom, says: "My beloved is white and ruddy" (Cant. V). White in action, doubtless, and ruddy in blood. And he himself, blooming with the various flowers of his members, brings forth lilies in peace, and roses in war.
