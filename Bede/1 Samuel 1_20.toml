And it happened after the cycle of days Anna conceived, etc. It happened after the illumination of much spiritual knowledge and the manifestation of virtues, through which the apostles shone upon the world, the Gentiles conceived through catechizing and gave birth to a people believing in God through baptizing, or rather the people believed in God through His people. For both must rightly be confessed, not only according to the reason of faith and truth but also as the very name of Samuel implies. For it is interpreted: God is there, or His name is God. God is there in the people who will be born, whom the Lord has chosen. His name is God, specifically whose, if not that of Him who, to signify that He would be constantly born in His own through grace, says: Whoever does the will of my Father who is in heaven is my brother, sister, and mother (Matthew VII). Nor should it seem strange to anyone that we have said that both the husband and son of the same Anna carry the type of Christ; because indeed the same Mediator of God and men is simultaneously the bridegroom and son of the holy Church which He governs: the bridegroom, always helping her to believe, hope, and love; the son, recently coming into the hearts of those believing, hoping, and loving through grace.
