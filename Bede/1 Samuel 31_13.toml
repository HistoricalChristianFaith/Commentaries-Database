And they fasted for seven days. Literally and rightly for the dead, so that they may reach rest, it is fasted for seven days, which after the six ages of this world, in which we labor in the flesh, the seventh is in that world the age of rest for the souls freed from the flesh, in which the blessed await that glorious time when they may deserve to rise. The figure of this rest and resurrection, and the seventh day in the law, and the seventh or fiftieth year, in which rest of works was given, typologically foretold. The Lord showed the same example of our hope and dispensation of faith, who was crucified on the sixth day of the week, rested on the seventh in the tomb with His body, and on the eighth which is the first day of the week, rose from the dead. But in part of the allegory, regarding the blindness of the Jews who thus far observe the Sabbath carnally, his faithful fellow citizens and kinsmen rightfully retain sorrow and continuous grief in their hearts, as if they are fasting for seven days; because while their brothers and kin are still established in error, they can in no way have full joy. But when they too have fully understood the mystery of the eighth day, that is, of the Lord's and their own resurrection, both together, aided by the grace of Christ, will rejoice in perpetual festivity.
