By the posture of his body Cornelius demonstrated what devotion he had within his heart. He came as a pupil to meet his teacher, and full of zeal, with pure heart, attentive ears and eager desire, he received the word of faith. Now one who is slowly dragged to belief is as though raised up from a prone position by his teacher. However, one who, out of shame for the stains of life, shows signs of humility and of shame at once by falling prostrate on his face justly deserves to be raised up by his master.
