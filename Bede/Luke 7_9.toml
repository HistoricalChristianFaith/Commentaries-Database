When Jesus heard this, he marveled. He marveled because he saw the centurion understand his majesty. But who had made that faith or understanding in him, except himself, who marveled at it? But if someone else had made it, what would he marvel at, who was prescient? Therefore, it must be noted that whatever the Lord marvels at, he signifies that we should marvel at, because we still need to be admonished in this way. For all such emotions, when they are said about God, are not signs of a disturbed mind, but of a teaching master.

And turning to the crowds following him, he said: Amen, I say to you, I have not found such faith even in Israel. He speaks not of all the past patriarchs and prophets, but of the people of the present age. For this reason, the centurion's faith is preferred because they were taught by the warnings of the law and prophets, whereas he, having been taught by no one, believed spontaneously.
