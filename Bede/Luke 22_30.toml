That you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom. This table is set for all the saints to enjoy; it is the heavenly glory of life. The food and drink is that of which it is said elsewhere: Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness (Matthew V), for they shall be filled. By enjoying, namely, the joy longed for and loved of the true and unwavering good. And you shall sit on thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel. This is what the psalm sings of as the change of the right hand of the Most High (Psalm LXXVI), so that those who now humbly rejoice to serve their fellow servants may then be nourished on the Lord's table with the feasts of eternal life; and those who, here in trials, are unjustly judged, may remain with the Lord, and there, with him, come as just judges over their tempters, and as much as they were despised in this world in great humility, so then, with received seats, they will rise in power with a greater summit.
