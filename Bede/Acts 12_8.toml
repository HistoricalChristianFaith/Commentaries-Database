Gird yourself and put on your sandals. And we read that prophets and apostles used belts, which Peter had loosened for a moment due to the rigidity of the prison, so that, with his tunic lowered around his feet, he could somewhat temper the cold of the night, providing an example to the weak that, when we are tempted by either bodily discomfort or human injury, it is permissible to relax the rigor of our purpose a little. And because it was said, “Let your loins be girded and your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace,” spiritually he is ordered to resume the emblems of virtues and of preaching the word.
