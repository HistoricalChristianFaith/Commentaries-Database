In the figure of the four living creatures the two designated by the man and the calf display the tokens of his passion and death, but the two prefigured by the lion and the eagle reveal the signs of the victory in which he destroyed death. For the man represents the Lord as he was made mortal through the incarnation; the calf stands for him as he was offered for us on the altar of the cross; the lion portrays him when he bravely conquered death; the eagle when he ascended into heaven.
