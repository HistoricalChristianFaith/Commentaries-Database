Behold, I come like a thief. Another edition more fittingly has: To the great day of Almighty God. Behold, he comes like a thief.

Blessed is he who watches and keeps his garments, etc. Blessed are those whose sins are covered (Psalm 31), who cover the shame of a blameworthy life before the eyes of the just with the cloak of subsequent good works. And in the Gospel, the Lord, using the example of avoiding a thief, commands the servants to be watchful.
