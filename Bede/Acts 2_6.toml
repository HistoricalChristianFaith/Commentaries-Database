Because each one was hearing them speak in his own language. It is asked in this place how each one heard them speaking the great things of God in his own language: whether those who were speaking in different languages were delivering what was being said in the language of each one, that is, whether each of them now spoke in this, now in another language, thus running through all, or it was more marvelous in this, that the speech of those who were speaking, whatever language had been pronounced, was understood by each one hearing according to his own language, that (for example) when any one apostle was teaching in the church (for it was necessary that one should speak while the others were silent, and one speech should reach the hearing of all), that same speech would have such a force in itself, that although there were listeners of different nations, each one would receive the hearing and grasp the understanding of that one speech pronounced by the apostle according to his own language. Unless perhaps it seemed more wonderful that this was a miracle of the listeners rather than of the speakers.
