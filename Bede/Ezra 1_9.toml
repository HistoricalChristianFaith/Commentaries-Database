And this is their number: thirty golden bowls, etc. Different types of vessels signify different persons or operations of the faithful. Finally, we read in the Apocalypse that the twenty-four elders had golden bowls full of incense (Rev. 5); and the Scripture explains: These are the prayers of the saints. Therefore, the bowls, which are open, bright vessels, signify the hearts of the simple, who know not how to conceal any deceitful thought within them, but are accustomed to express with a pure tongue what they hold in their mind. Wherefore it is rightly said that such aromatic substances, that is, prayers acceptable to God, are found in them. On the other hand, the impure hearts of the reprobate are deservedly compared to sponges, which are dark and convoluted within. Hence also the Jews, when the Lord was crucified, offered Him a sponge full of vinegar (Matt. 27; Mark 15; John 19); so that by such a service they might signify that to their Creator, coming to them in the flesh, they offered from a deceitful heart thoughts and bitter words, deviating far from the pure taste of their forefathers. The knives, however, which they used for cutting and dividing the limbs of the sacrifices according to the proper order, so that with everything properly distinguished, a part would be consumed on the sacred altar by fire, a part would be for the use of priests, a part for Levites, and a part for the offerers; these surely demonstrate in the Church those who are distinguished by the grace of discernment, who perfectly know how to discern from the saving sacrifice, which is Christ, what should be said to all, what to the more perfect, what exceeds the measure of human thought and should be attributed to the fire of the Holy Spirit; likewise, because all who are dedicated to Him in faithful service are victims of God. The knives by which the limbs of the sacrifice are divided into pieces are typologically understood to be the scribes educated in the kingdom of heaven; who, carefully examining the merits and thoughts of their hearers, know well how to judge with whom they should advance in the rank of ecclesiastical ministry. The cups, which are vessels for drinking, figuratively express those who are accustomed to be inflamed with the fervent ardor of inner charity. As for the fact that some vessels were gold, some silver; the golden ones signify those who shine with a greater splendor of spiritual wisdom; the silver ones, those who are clear in the beauty of speech and know how to expound eloquently what they know; whom the Apostle distinguishing from one another, says: To one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom, to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit (1 Cor. 12). And the fact that the number of vessels, both individually and collectively in total, is mentioned, reminds us that the Lord contains the sum of His elect, not only those who persevere in the purity of the received faith, but also those who, after they have strayed, return to faith by repentance, written in the book of eternal memory. In whose figure it is aptly added:
