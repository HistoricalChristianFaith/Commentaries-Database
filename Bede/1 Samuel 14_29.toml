You yourselves have seen that my eyes have been enlightened, etc. These words are fitting for the person who thinks that the reading of gentile literature is not harmful in the Church, whether for the learned or the teachers. You see, he says, that I have become more effective, sharper, and more ready to speak appropriately because I have tasted a little of the flower of Ciceronian reading; how much more if the Christian people had learned the sects and doctrines of the gentiles, would they not much more confidently and surely ridicule and simultaneously refute their errors, and rejoice much more devotedly in their sound faith, and give thanks to the Father of lights for this grace? For it should not be thought for any other reason that Moses or Daniel would have wanted to learn secular wisdom except that they might better destroy and conquer it once known.
