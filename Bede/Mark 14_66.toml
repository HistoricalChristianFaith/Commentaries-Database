And while Peter was in the courtyard below, one of the maidservants of the high priest came. And when she saw Peter warming himself, looking at him she said: You also were with Jesus of Nazareth, etc. What does it mean that the maidservant first betrayed him, when surely men could have recognized him more? unless it is that this sex might also appear to have sinned in the death of the Lord and that this sex might also be redeemed through the passion of the Lord. And therefore the woman first receives the mystery of the resurrection, and keeps the commandments to abolish the ancient error of transgression.
