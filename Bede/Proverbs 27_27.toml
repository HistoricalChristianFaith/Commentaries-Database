Let the milk of the goats suffice you for your food, etc. Feed the flock entrusted to you with such diligence, that neither new milk in summer nor in cold will be lacking to you, but always it will suffice for you and yours; that is, insist so diligently on doctrine, that you also promote former penitents to the office of teaching; so that through them, who formerly seemed to be placed on the left side of the judge due to the foulness of vices, reasonable and sincere milk of the word may now be ministered to those with little understanding. The milk of the goats becomes food for the handmaidens, when those who serve the Lord not yet with perfect love, but still with servile fear, are refreshed with the example or words of those who have been saved through repentance, and are united to advance to the greater growths of virtues. Some have placed what is said: The meadows are open, and the green herbs have appeared, and the hay is gathered from the mountains: lambs for your clothing, and kids for the price of the field; thus, "The monuments are open, the revived bodies have appeared, the sinners are separated from the saints, hay to be burned from the high places. The lambs are separated to the right, the kids to the left: lambs for the king's clothing, because he said, I will inhabit in them; the kids are sold for the price of the saints whom they harmed (or killed?) by fire."
