But that which fell among thorns, these are they who have heard, and going forth are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of life, and bring no fruit to perfection. It is remarkable how the Lord interpreted thorns as riches, since thorns prick, and these delight. And yet they are thorns because with the pricks of their thoughts they cut the mind, and when they lead to sin, they wound with inflicted injury. Which in this place, another evangelist witnessing, the Lord does not call riches, but deceitful riches. For they are deceitful, which cannot remain with us for long. They are deceitful, which do not expel the poverty of our mind. Only those riches are true, which make us rich in virtues. It is also to be noted that when the Lord explained, He said that cares and pleasures and riches choke. For they choke, because with their importunate thoughts they strangle the throat of the mind: and while they do not allow the good desire to enter the heart, they as it were kill the entrance of vital breath. It is also to be noted that there are two things which He joins to riches, namely cares and pleasures, because indeed through care they oppress the mind, and through abundance they loosen it: for by contrary action, they make their possessors both afflicted and unstable. But because pleasure cannot agree with affliction, indeed at one time they afflict through the anxiety of their care, and at another through abundance they soften into pleasures.
