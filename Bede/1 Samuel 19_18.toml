David was allotted the kingdom of the Israelites in place of Saul. He was a humble, innocent and gentle exile, yet he was for a long time tormented by [Saul’s] unjust persecution.… Whoever upon hearing these things begins to strive after humility and innocence and to drive pride and envy from his heart, has, as it were, found a draught of the clearest water, by which he may be refreshed. But if he recognizes that Saul signifies those who persecute, and David signifies Christ and the church; and if he recognizes that on account of the [persecutors’] lack of faith, both their material and spiritual sovereignty has been destroyed, while the reign of Christ and the church will always remain; [with this understanding] he will perceive a cup of wine made from the water, for he will know that he is reading not only about that king but about his own life and reign, where before he read [the story] as if it were an ancient history about others.

David, however, fleeing, was saved, etc. Ramathaim meaning heights, Naioth interpreted as beauty, which is a place in Ramah. Therefore, with Saul's messengers seeing only the image and goatskin in David's bed, David himself fleeing is saved; and with the Jews during the time of the Lord’s death arguing among themselves that he was a deceiver, and not truly innocent and just, but was crucified for his crime, the Lord, who was confined in the tomb, mighty arising from death, appears in the heights of life, with immortal glory to the disciples, saying: Because thus it is written, and thus it was necessary for the Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead (Luke 24); and he goes, and dwells in the beauty of the everlasting kingdom, which is in heaven. The Church has gone after him in hope both in soul and body, and thus will be with the Lord always.

It was announced to Saul by those saying, Behold, David is in Naioth in Ramah, etc. Which also concerning the second messengers, as well as the third, are related in similar order. It was announced to the Jews by the apostles and the disciples of the apostles that the Lord Jesus Christ, after his passion, resurrection, and ascension, sitting at the right hand of the Father, reigns exalted in heaven. But they immediately sent three of their former faith and religion, but now of their impiety and perfidy, namely priests, scribes, and Pharisees, to take away his confession from the believers who were persecuting; all of these persecutors, although bearing the mind of unbelievers, however, where disputing up to the statements of the prophets, to which the apostles with the revelation of the spiritual intelligence of Christ preside, they themselves also protesting these things written by the divine Spirit, simultaneously both loving them with the faithful and believing, though not even understanding, they were singing.
