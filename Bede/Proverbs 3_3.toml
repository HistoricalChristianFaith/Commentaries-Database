Let not mercy and truth forsake you. Let truth never depart from your mouth, which is to be spoken; let mercy never recede from your work, which is to be bestowed upon neighbors. Thus it happens that God's mercy and truth always follow you: mercy indeed to blot out your sins; truth, however, to fulfill his promises.

Bind them around your neck, etc. In the neck, the organ of the voice, on the tablets of the heart, he insinuates the breadth of thought. Thus let the virtue of mercy and truth be fixed at the root of the mind, and be brought out in the voice of the speaker, so that they may please God, the hidden inspector who alone searches the hearts and loins, in their secret intentions, and benefit neighbors with the office of speaking. But he correctly teaches that virtues should be bound around the neck, as the voice of the speaker is usually made inwardly in the neck, since the voice of preaching emanates from within, but circumferences outwardly and spreads to many listeners at the same time. For as it incites others to live well, so it urges good deeds and actions of the preacher, lest the action fall outside the sermon, lest life contradict the voice.
