David, however, placed these words in his heart, etc. The Lord saw in his wisdom the unbelieving and deceitful hearts of some of the Jews; and, as the Scripture customarily speaks of God in human manner, he feared so much from the face of the people who were his brothers by human communion of fragility, but were persecutors by the impiety of their conspiracy against the Lord, that to them he spoke his sacraments or warnings more in parables and riddles than in open light, lest he cast the holy to dogs and pearls to swine (Matt. VII). For just as David, who was accustomed to always show himself sober to his own, altered his mouth before the Gittites; so also the Lord, speaking in parables before the proud and those bearing hearts eager to torment him and his own, privately made everything manifest by explanation to his own; and indeed he appeared to them in understanding so that they might comprehend the scriptures. Some wish to say that the Lord altered his mouth when he said: "You have heard that it was said to those of old, but I say to you" (Matt. V); or when, with the priesthood having been transferred, he wanted also the transfer of the law and ceremonies to take place. But they should observe that he did not show this type of change specifically to his enemies, but rather to those receiving the mysteries of his faith; and for that reason, the alteration of the mouth, which the blessed David exhibited as a type of him so that he would not be recognized by his enemies, is rather to be referred to the understanding of those who, seeing the signs and doctrine of the Savior, did not see, and hearing, did not understand.
