And his father and mother were marveling at what was said about him, and Simeon blessed them. He calls Joseph the father of the Savior, not that he was truly his father according to the Photinians, but since he was considered by all to be the father for the preservation of Mary's reputation. Nor did the Evangelist forget that he told she had conceived by the Holy Spirit and given birth as a virgin, but expressing the opinion of the people, which is the true law of history, he calls Joseph the father of Christ. Although in that way, he can rightly be called his father, as he is rightly understood as the husband of Mary without physical union, by the marriage bond itself, much more closely united indeed than if he had been adopted from elsewhere. For neither should Joseph be called the father of Christ because he had not begotten him through intercourse, since he would rightly be the father even if he had adopted someone not born from his wife elsewhere.
