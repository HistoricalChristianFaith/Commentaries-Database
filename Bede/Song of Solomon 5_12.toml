[A dove] is inclined to sit above water so that it may avoid being seized by a hawk coming, since it has seen its shadow beforehand in the water. Let us also be clean, and take care to sit attentively at the cleansing streams of the Scriptures, and, thoroughly instructed by [their] mirrors, may we be capable of distinguishing and guarding ourselves against the snares of the ancient enemy.

His eyes are like doves beside streams of water. What should typically be understood of the bridegroom's eyes John reveals when he recounts that he saw the Lamb having seven horns, immediately adding by way of explanation: These are the seven spirits sent forth into all the earth (Rev. IV). He calls them seven spirits, meaning the seven gifts of the one and same Spirit, which Isaiah lists in the most recognized order of divine operation, because the Holy Spirit of discipline flees deceit. The Spirit delights in residing in those minds which, like living waters, make themselves clear; which allow nothing dirty, nothing dark, nothing that should not be approved by all lovers of truth, or indeed by Truth itself, which searches hearts and reins, to exist within them. It is well said, not "beside stagnant waters," but "beside streams of waters"; for if you inquire where these waters flow, where they run, the source of life from which they spring is revealed, that is, our Lord, from whom the hearts of the elect derive whatever purity and brightness they have. He said, In him will become a fountain of water springing up into eternal life (John IV); for those who seem to have purity of either word or deed but do not aim at the heavenly kingdom through that same purity, whether they dissemble or are simply ignorant, they indeed are to be counted not among streams, but among stagnant waters. However, those who open themselves to impurities, giving place to evil spirits, are likened not to clean waters but to wallows of mud, in which swine delight. Swine, therefore, take pleasure in the swamps, while doves in the streams of water, because unclean hearts offer a fitting dwelling for unclean spirits. But blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God (Matt. V), and they are filled with the light of divine gifts. These gifts, indeed, because they are given freely to the faithful and solely by the cause of heavenly benevolence, it is aptly added:

Things that are washed in milk, etc. For rightly by the name of milk, the gifts of divine generosity and pietas are indicated, because surely mothers who nourish their young offspring provide them with the nutrition of milk out of gratuitous and natural cause of affection. Therefore, the doves with which the eyes of the bridegroom are compared are washed in milk, because we have been saved by grace through faith, and this is not from ourselves, it is the gift of God (Ephesians 2:8). Thus, these doves, that is, the gifts of the Spirit, are said to be washed in milk, since they never had any filth, as it is said by the Psalmist: The words of the Lord are pure words; silver tried in a furnace of earth, purified seven times (Psalms 12:6), since it is clear that they never had anything of earthly pollution that should be purged by fire. Thus the Son, coeternal with the Father, and rightly believed to be born of the Father, and never not to have been born, is rightly, truly confessed and believed; and you have countless other such things in the Scriptures. Also, these doves dwell by the fullest streams, because whatever hearts overflow with the love of virtues, this spiritual grace most willingly inhabits, illuminating them with the higher regard of its presence, that those who diligently tend to heavenly things with the purity of sincere intention may be distinguished. If we wish to understand the preachers of His word to be in the eyes of the Lord, we will find them to be like doves over the streams of water: like doves indeed, because they are simple; over the streams of water, because they are enriched with spiritual grace. They are often described by the streams of water, because they attentively engage with the Holy Scriptures, which are often figured by the name of waters, by which, being taught, they may more easily recognize and avoid the snares of the devil. Indeed, doves over the streams of water commonly reside not only for drinking, or for washing, or for the pleasantness and cleanliness of the place; but no less with the intention, that in the clarity of the waters they might foresee the shadow of the coming hawk, and thus avoid impending danger from the enemy. The form of whose nature is in the open, because we have need of constant meditation on divine words, so that reading either the deeds of the saints or their sayings, we may diligently examine with a watchful mind by what kind of open assault the ancient enemy strives to fight and overthrow us, with what machines of fraud he tries to defeat and supplant us. And as soon as we perceive his future plots, our only refuge is to seek the crevices of our rock, that is, the protections of the Lord's faith, and we should strive to defend ourselves with the sign of His passion. But also let us swiftly with quick flight seek the cavern of the wall, that is, let us seek the frequent intercessions for us to the mercy of the pious Creator by the saints, or angels, or humans. This is considered necessary for all the faithful, especially those upon whom is placed the burden of caring for and teaching others. These are indeed the most firm and safest protections of the holy Church, for which the Lord above said, "Arise, my love, my fair one, and come, my dove, in the clefts of the rock, in the covert of the cliff." Well, it is said of these same doves, that is, the spiritual ministers of the word, "They are washed with milk, and sit beside full streams," to imply that they are first of all renewed by the washing of baptism: which is not absurdly expressed by the term milk, because among those sacraments are numbered by which the infancy of the holy Church is either accustomed to be born or to be nourished. If we believe there is any difference between rivulets of waters and full streams, it may be understood that in the rivulets of waters is the teaching of the Old Testament, whose followers have truly learned to say to God, "But the children of men shall trust in the protection of your wings" (Psalm 62), obviously lest they be seized by the snares of the aerial powers, like the claws of hawks. "They shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of your house; and you shall make them drink from the river of your pleasures, for with you is the fountain of life" (Psalm 35, 10). In the full streams can be not inconveniently understood the perfection of evangelical doctrine, of which such is the fullness that no greater can be for those dwelling in this life. Distinguishing between the two, the evangelist said, "For the law was given by Moses; grace and truth came by Jesus Christ" (John 1); and since the knowledge of both Testaments is given to the teachers of the truth, rightly the eyes of the Lord are said to be like doves over the rivulets of waters, which are washed with milk, and sit beside full streams.
