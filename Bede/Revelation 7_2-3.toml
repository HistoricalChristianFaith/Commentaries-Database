This is the Lord born in the flesh, who is the “angel of great counsel,” that is, the messenger of the Father’s will, “who has visited us as the dayspring from on high,”16 carrying the standard of the cross, by which he seals the foreheads of his own.… The great voice of the Lord is that exalted proclamation, “Repent, for the kingdom of heaven has drawn near.” … For this purpose was the rule of the nations destroyed, that the face of the saints might in freedom be marked by the sign of faith which they had resisted. For even the figure of the cross itself indicates that the kingdom of the Lord is everywhere extended, as the ancient distich shows:

  “Behold, the four-squared world, in distinct parts,
  that you might show the sign of faith to encompass all things.”

Nor in vain was the four-lettered name of the Lord written upon the forehead of the high priest, since this is the sign upon the foreheads of the faithful, about which the psalm “for the winevats” sings: “O Lord, our Lord, how majestic is thy name in all the earth,” and so on, until he says, “that you may destroy the enemy and the defender.”
