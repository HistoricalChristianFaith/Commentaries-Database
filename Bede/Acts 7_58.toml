And they cast him out of the city and stoned him. And the Lord suffered outside the gate, who chose us from the world into His heavenly kingdom and glory, and Stephen, as if a stranger to the world, is stoned outside the city. For he did not have a lasting city here, but sought the one to come with his whole mind. And by just change of things, the martyr directs his gaze from the world’s heart to the heavens, the persecutor of hard neck sends his hands to the stones. Hence Arator says: “Rebellious Judea, you deliriously seize stones against Stephen, you who [will] always be stony in your harsh crime.”
