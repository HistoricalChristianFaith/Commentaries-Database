On the day of John’s circumcision, when he also received his name, “fear came upon all their neighbors, and all these words were spread abroad throughout the mountain country of Judea.” Furthermore, at the time of our Lord’s resurrection, when the Spirit had been sent down from above and the glory of his name was made known to the world by the apostles, a most salutary fear immediately struck the hearts. Not only of the Jews, who were of the neighborhood either by their physical location or by their knowledge of the law, but also those of foreign nations, even to the ends of the earth. And John’s reputation for virtue exceeded not only the whole mountain country of Judea, but also all the heights of worldly kingdoms and worldly wisdom, so that everywhere people left behind their former way of life and flocked together to attain the sacramental mysteries of his faith.
