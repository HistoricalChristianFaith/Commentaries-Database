Deliver yourself like a gazelle from the hand, etc. Just as a gazelle seeks to escape from the hand of the captor, strive so much that, with your listener being healthily instructed, you are freed from the surety of his life. Or certainly, because the gazelle is by nature a pure animal, swift in running, and most keen in sight. Hence it is also named in Greek from seeing, that is, dorcas. But the bird, by flying, usually seeks the altar. When you are engaged in teaching your subjects, strive to be pure from all sins, vigorous in good works, keen in detecting the snares of the wicked, and supported by the wings of virtues: so that, having completed the task of preaching, you may deserve to fly to the heights and enter the pastures of heavenly life.
