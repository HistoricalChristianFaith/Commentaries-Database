To Gabael his fellow kinsman who was in need, Tobit gave ten silver talents in trust. And the people of God entrusted to the Gentiles through the seventy translators the knowledge of the divine law that is contained in the Decalogue in order thereby to free them from the indigence of unbelief; but they gave it in trust, that is, on condition that it be repaid after they themselves got wealthy or the one who had given it asked it back. On the other hand, the Gentiles received the Word of God from the people of Israel through the medium of translation because now after the Lordâ€™s incarnation they also understand it spiritually and work at acquiring the riches of the virtues; but they pay back the creditor when they receive into the unity of the church the Jews who believe at the end of the world; and, as well as entrusting to them the mysteries of Christ for their salvation, they also unlock for them the secrets of the Scriptures. - "On Tobit 1.9"
