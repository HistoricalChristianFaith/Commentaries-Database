And Joshua, the son of Jozadak, arose, etc. For Joshua and Zerubbabel, both of whom, as we mentioned above, fulfill one and the same figure of our Lord and Savior, were engaged in the work of divine worship. Joshua conspicuously for the priesthood, Zerubbabel for the kingdom; because the former descended from a priestly lineage, the latter from a royal lineage. Our Lord, however, is the true king of Israel, that is, of all who see the Lord; and also the true high priest according to the order of Melchizedek. He is a priest, evidently, because He cleanses us from our sins through the sacrifice of His body, and even after His passion and ascension, He intercedes for us at the right hand of the Father (Rom. VIII). He is a king because He equips us in the present for spiritual warfare, and helps us to conquer, and grants an eternal kingdom to the victorious in the future. Not only Joshua and Zerubbabel, but also their brothers were set over the people in the building; these brothers concerning whom our King and Priest, after the glory of His resurrection, appearing to the women who sought Him, said: Go and tell My brothers (Matt. XXVIII). These brothers, namely the more eminent ones in the Church who adhere more intimately to their Redeemer, build His house with Him, as they strengthen the hearts of the faithful with their words and examples, with His help. And it is fitting that he calls them brothers of Joshua priests. For the apostle Peter says to all the churches: But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood (1 Pet. II). Likewise, concerning the whole Church, John says in Revelation: Blessed and holy is he who has a part in the first resurrection: over these the second death has no power, but they will be priests of God and Christ (Rev. XX). For when the elect are members of the supreme priest, and offer their members as a living sacrifice, and render their contrite spirit as a sacrifice to God, they rightly deserve both the name of brotherhood and priesthood. Moreover, with great religious providence, the sons of the exile first built the altar of God, so that even though the temple of God was not yet founded, they would have a place where, by offering holocausts and sacrifices, they could show their devotion. We also do this spiritually today in the Church, when above all, we place in our hearts the faith of the Lord’s incarnation and passion, when we teach our listeners to receive this above all else and to root it deeply in their hearts, according to what the Apostle says, speaking to the still-infant Corinthians in Christ, For I determined to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ, and Him crucified (1 Cor. II). On this altar, we ought to offer our holocausts, that is our perfect thoughts and actions; for truly it is only in this way that the vows of our deeds can be pleasing to God the Father, if we partake in the sacraments of our Redeemer, if we are kindled with the fire of His Spirit as if on a sacred altar; for a holocaust means entirely burnt, by which name they called those sacrifices from which nothing was to be used for human purposes, but everything was to be given to God and consumed by sacred fire. These mystically expressed the life of those faithful who seek nothing of their own, but expend all their living in the service of the inner arbiter. Who not only trample underfoot the pleasures of their soul or body for the Lord’s sake, but also rejoice to lay down their own soul for Him, who can say with the apostles, Behold, we have left everything and followed You; what then will there be for us? (Matt. XIX). To whom He responds: And everyone who has left houses, or brothers, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands for My name’s sake, will receive a hundredfold and will inherit eternal life. This holocaust of a more continent and sacred life is to be offered on the altar of the God of Israel, for it is only through the faith of our Redeemer, as we have said, that our good works can be acceptable to God the Father. For Diogenes and his followers who adhered to foolish philosophy, even though they relinquished their own things and led a bare and poor life in the world, did not follow the Lord. They seemed indeed to make a holocaust, but they did not do it on the altar of the God of Israel; for while they made themselves strangers to their own pleasures, they did not know how to have Jesus Christ as an advocate with the Father. Concerning this altar, it is fittingly added:
