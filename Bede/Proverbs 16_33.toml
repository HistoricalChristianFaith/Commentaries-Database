Lots are cast into the lap, etc. Just as lots are openly cast into the lap and kept secret in the lap, it is the divine judgeâ€™s part to decide whose lot will be taken up; so the deeds of men are indeed visible to each other in the present life, but the merit of each one will become clear in the future, with the judgment of each one then brought forth and manifested, as if from the lap of divine examination.
