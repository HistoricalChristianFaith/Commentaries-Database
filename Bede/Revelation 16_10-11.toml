The throne of the beast, or his kingdom, as it were, his judicial authority is darkened by plagues of this kind, that is, by the false joy of earthly happiness. It became dark by being deprived of light, as the psalmist says, “You did cast them down even while they were being lifted up.” He did not say, “after they had been lifted up” [they gnawed their tongues.] Just as a righteous person will eat the fruit of his labors, so also an ungodly person, given punishments worthy of his blasphemy, is sated, as it were, with his own tongue. Therefore, those who blaspheme are simply hurting themselves, thinking that the wrath of God by which they are impaled is in fact gladness. [And they cursed God.] He does not refer to their hardness [of heart] but to the righteous indignation of God, who gave [to them] such a plague that in it they cannot remember. For when afflicted by a bodily torment, who does not feel the hand of God, as did Antiochus? It says, “they cursed,” not that they did this openly, but in that they reveled in their sins.
