Strength and dignity are her clothing, and she will laugh at the last day. Strength, to endure the harshness of the wicked; dignity, to exercise the grace of virtues. Dignity, because she works justice; strength, because she suffers persecution for justice (Matthew V). And therefore she will laugh at the last day, that is, she will rejoice in the recompense of the heavenly kingdom, who grieved in the struggle of present life. It is indeed customary in Scripture to put laughter for joy; as the Lord says: Blessed are you that weep now, for you shall laugh (Luke VI). And blessed Job: But the mouths of the righteous will be filled with laughter (Job...). The prophet indeed sets a similar sentiment regarding the Lord and Savior of this most powerful woman, saying: The Lord reigns, clothed in majesty, the Lord is clothed with strength, etc. (Psalm XCII). For when He preached the Gospel of the kingdom, He pleased some, displeased others; some spoke well of Him, others detracted, lacerated, bit, and calumniated Him. To those therefore whom He pleased, He was clothed in majesty, to those whom He displeased, in strength. Therefore, imitate your Lord, that you may be His attire; be with dignity among those who are pleased by your good works; be strong against detractors.
