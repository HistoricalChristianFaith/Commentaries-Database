The ancient tabernacle “indeed had ritual ordinances and a sanctuary, though an earthly one,” embellished with gold and silver. But the blood of the gospel is more precious than the metals of the law. It springs forth because that people, who had been lying enfeebled in mind before the golden doorpost, was saved in the name of him who was crucified and [so now] enters the temple of the heavenly kingdom. In any case, blessed Peter, mindful of the Lord’s command which was spoken, “Do not possess gold and silver,” did not hoard for himself the money that was put at the feet of the apostles but was inclined to reserve it for the use of the poor who had lost their birthright.
