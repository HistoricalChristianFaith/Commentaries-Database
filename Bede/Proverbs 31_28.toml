"Her children rise up," etc. Knowing this would certainly come to pass, he speaks prophetically as if it were already done. For the children of the church shall rise, namely all the elect in the end, endowed with the immortality of the flesh; and then they proclaim that their mother, who bore them to God from water and the Holy Spirit, is most blessed, even though she is now despised as wretched by the faithless. And truly, as the Apostle says: "If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable" (1 Cor. 15). But because we strive for another life in the present, when it appears what we shall be, we shall deservedly proclaim our mother, who, gathered from all the righteous, is called the one dove of Christ, the bride and friend, as most blessed. Her husband will also rise and praise her, saying in judgment: "Come, blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world. For I was hungry, and you gave me food," and so on (Matt. 25). Although he himself rose as the firstfruits of the sleeping from the dead, in the day of judgment he will more plainly demonstrate to all, whom he will judge worthy of his praise, how great is the glory of his resurrection. What is said, "Her children rise up and call her blessed," can also be fittingly understood in this time, when any of the faithful, having passed through the afflictions of the world, are led to the heavenly kingdoms. For to sit often pertains to humility, to rise to glory. Hence it is said: "Formerly sitting in ashes and sackcloth they repented" (Luke 10), that is, they were humbled. And the prophet: "I sat alone because of your hand, for you have filled me with indignation" (Jer. 15). And the Psalmist: "It is vain for you to rise up early; rise up after you have sat down, you who eat the bread of toil" (Ps. 127). This is plainly to say, "Why do you seek to rejoice in the present, which is reserved for the elect in the future? For you cannot in this life, that is, before the dawn of supernal retribution, possess the glory of true happiness; rather, after you have been humbled here for a time, there you should hope to be truly exalted forever; for you, to whom everything that seems sweet and pleasant to the lovers of the world is bitter. Therefore, the children of the Church rise and proclaim her most blessed when, exalted with heavenly goods, they see how great is the beatitude of that homeland to which they have merited to belong. And they celebrate her with due praise in the divine vision. Her husband praises her when he rewards the good deeds he has given. By what words he praises her is subsequently shown, when it is said:
