God’s word says: “Surely there is not a righteous man on earth who does good and never sins.” He himself has taught us not only that we cannot escape sin but also that we should pray: “Forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.” Therefore when we see even the apostles praying for their sins to be forgiven, as the Lord taught them, no one should think, as Pelagius taught, that it is possible to lead a sinless life here on earth.
