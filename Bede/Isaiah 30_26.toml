Moreover, when the day of judgment has been completed and the glory of the future life has become evident with the new heaven and the new earth, then will come to pass what the same prophet announced elsewhere: “The light of the moon will be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun will be increased sevenfold, like the light of seven days.”

Why should the lunar reckoning be calculated from the noontide hours, seeing that the moon had not yet been placed in the heavens or gone forth over the earth? On the contrary, none of the feast days of the law began and ended at noon or in the afternoon, but all did so in the evening. Or else perchance it is because sinful Adam was reproached by the Lord “in the cool of the afternoon” and thrust out from the joys of Paradise. In remembrance of that heavenly life which we changed for the tribulation of this world, the change of the moon, which imitates our toil by its everlasting waxing and waning, ought specifically to be observed at the hour in which we began our exile. In this way every day we may be reminded by the hour of the moon’s changing of that verse, “a fool changes as the moon” while the wise man “shall live as long as the sun,” and that we may sigh more ardently for that life, supremely blessed in eternal peace, when “the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold, as the light of seven days.” Indeed, because (as it is written) “from the moon is the sign of the feast day,” and just as the first light of the moon was shed upon the world at eventide, so in the law it is compulsory that every feast day begin in the evening and end in the evening.

But when there will be a new heaven and a new earth after the judgment—which is not one heaven and earth replacing another but these very same ones which will shine forth, having been renewed by fire and glorified by the power of the resurrection—then, as Isaiah predicts, “The light of the moon will be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun will be sevenfold, as the light of seven days.”
