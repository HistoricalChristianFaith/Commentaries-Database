And she wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger, because there was no room for them in the inn.â€”What shall I render to the Lord for all the things that he hath rendered to me? For what is greater than all praise: A little child is born to us, so that we might become perfect men? He who clothes the whole world in varied attire is wrapped in cheap swaddling clothes, so that we might be able to receive the first robe. By whom all things were made, his hands and feet are bound in the crib, so that our hands might be freed for good works, our feet directed into the path of peace. To whom heaven is a seat, he is contained in the narrowness of a hard manger, so that he might open up the joys of the heavenly kingdom for us. He who is the bread of angels, is laid in a manger, so that we, like holy animals, might be fed with the grain of his flesh. He who sits at the right hand of the Father needs a place in the inn, so that he might prepare many mansions for us in the house of his Father. Although the fact that he is born not in his parents' house but in an inn and on the way can be understood more deeply through its meaning. For he himself said, "I am the way, and the truth, and the life" (John 14). Therefore, he who remains truth and life by the essence of divinity, by the mystery of the Incarnation became the way, by which he might lead us to the homeland where we could enjoy truth and life.
