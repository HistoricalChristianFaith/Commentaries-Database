And they did not understand the word that he spoke to them. And he went down with them, and came to Nazareth, and was subject to them. How much an example of piety and humility in the Lord! His parents did not understand the word that he spoke to them about his divinity, and yet he, not ungrateful for their human diligence towards him, descended to where they commanded, and was subject to them. For what would the teacher of virtue be if he did not fulfill the duty of piety? What else among us than that he would do what he wanted us to do? He deferred to a man, he deferred to a maidservant. For she herself says: Behold the handmaid of the Lord (Luke 1). He deferred to the simulated father, he deferred to the true father who is God. And indeed he had preserved his mother, born of a virgin, as a virgin and chaste; indeed, he did not differ from the father by will, by act, or by time. In order that, being admonished by his example, we might recognize what we owe to our parents, who suffer so much for us. The Arians are wont to say that the Son was imperfect because he said, The Father is greater than I (John 14). But what marvel if from human reception he asserts himself lesser than the Father in heaven, from which he was also subject to his parents on earth?
