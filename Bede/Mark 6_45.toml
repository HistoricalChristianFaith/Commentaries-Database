And immediately he compelled his disciples to get into the ship and go before him to the other side, to Bethsaida, while he dismissed the crowd, etc. Why he compelled his disciples to get into the ship, and he himself, after dismissing the crowd, went up into the mountain to pray, John clearly declares, who, after completing that celestial refreshment, immediately added: "Jesus therefore, knowing that they would come and take him by force to make him king, fled again into the mountain himself alone" (John VI). Here he shows us a necessary example of living, that in the good things we do, we should avoid the retribution of human favor, and the exercise of spiritual virtues should not turn us to the desire for temporal pleasures. For it happened to some, that while they were admired for the merit of a higher life in their habits and were thought rightfully worthy of honor, upon receiving money or estates, they lost the rudiments of justice they had begun, and careless, they were corrupted by carnal seductions and avarice, and even by those who honored them for their good deeds, they became, due to their evil actions, not only despised but also hated. It is much less dangerous to be worn out by the wickedness of opponents in the things we do rightly than to be soothed by the favor of those who honor us. For the latter often corrupts a more secure mind, while the former always makes one circumspect and cautious. Hence the Lord, initiating the path of life for us to follow, when those who admired his virtues wanted to make him king, fled into the mountain to pray. But when those who envied his virtues intended to deliver him to death, he promptly faced them and offered himself to be bound and crucified by the furious, teaching us by an evident example to be ready to endure the adversities of the world and to be cautious to avoid its flatteries when they might ensnare us; and lest the world's prosperity decieve us by softening us, we should implore the Lord with frequent prayers. The disciples preceded the Lord across the sea to Bethsaida, which is a city in Galilee of the apostles Andrew, Peter, and Philip, near the lake Gennesaret, as we find in books about places. Here he rightly advises how Mark says, after the miracle of the loaves, the disciples came across the sea to Bethsaida, while Luke seems to say that the memorable miracle and the celestial refreshment took place in the regions of Bethsaida. For he says: "Taking them, he withdrew privately to a deserted place, which is Bethsaida. But when the crowds found out, they followed him, and he received them" (Luke IX). And other things followed, up to the completion of the sacred refreshment history. Unless perhaps we understand by what Luke says, to a deserted place, which is Bethsaida, not the vicinity of the city itself, but the deserted places pertaining to it. For Mark openly states that they preceded him to Bethsaida, where the boundaries of the city are clearly marked. But Luke, who does not say "to the deserted place, which is Bethsaida," but "which is Bethsaida," can rightly be understood, unless I am mistaken, as not referring to the city itself but to the deserted place pertaining to it, that is, adjacent to its boundaries. However, the Evangelist John narrates that the crowds ate bread near Tiberias, and the disciples getting into the ship came across the sea to Capernaum, both of which are cities in Galilee near the lake of Gennesaret, which is also called Tiberias from the city of Tiberias.
