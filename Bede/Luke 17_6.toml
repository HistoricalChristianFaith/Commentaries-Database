The Lord said: If you had faith as a grain of mustard seed, you would say to this mulberry tree: Be uprooted, and be transplanted into the sea, and it would obey you. He compares perfect faith to a grain of mustard seed, which is indeed humble to the face and fervent in the heart, seen as vile to those looking upon it everywhere and appearing to have no strength, but when pressed it shows what perfection it carries inside. It should also be noted that a grain of mustard serves very beneficially for the purgation of the head. For if you thoroughly grind it and sift it with tepid fatty honey, and gargle with it fasting under the warm sun or in the bath, it purges all harmful moisture from the head even if it is quite thick, and it prevents imminent weaknesses from arising. Thus indeed, faith tested by the pestle of temptations, sifted through the sieve of discernment from all the surface of light thoughts, and sweetened with the honey of perfect love, not only exhausts all vices from the heart, which is the head of our inner man, but it also prevents them from being able to gather in the future. And the mulberry tree to be uprooted and transplanted into the sea, or simply placed, can be understood because it evidently is a sign of consummate faith commanding the elements with a word, so that what was said of one thing in particular is believed to apply generally to all. Finally, the Lord says elsewhere when the fig tree withered by the word, and the disciples marveled: If you have faith and do not doubt, not only will you do what is done to the fig tree, but if you say to this mountain, be taken up and cast into the sea, it will happen (Matthew XXI). Or certainly by the mulberry tree, whose fruit and twigs redden with a bloody color and hence is called "rubus" in Latin, the Gospel of the cross is expressed, which through the faith of the apostles, having been uprooted from the Jewish people in whom it was held as in a stem of origin, was transplanted and planted into the sea of the Gentiles. The sense is also supported by the parables joined to this sentence, which deals with the ministers of the word. It is also helpful to note that mulberry leaves, when thrown on a serpent, bring death to it because the word of the cross, while bringing health to all, takes away all harmful things.
