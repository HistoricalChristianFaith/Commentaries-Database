devil: "Diabolus," is interpreted, "flowing downward." But in Greek he is called "the accuser." "Satan is " the adversary," or " prevaricator." So he is called "the dragon," on account of his malice in hurting; "the serpent," on account of cunning in deceiving; " the devil," on account of the fall of his estate; "Satan," on account of obstinacy in opposition against the Lord.

For if he were permitted to exert the whole of this, either by force, or deceit, he would beguile most of the weak in so long a time. By the "thousand years," he intended a part, namely, the remainder of the thousand years of the sixth day; in which the Lord was born and suffered.               <a

The devil is interpreted to mean “flowing downwards,” although in the Greek it means “accuser,” while Satan means “adversary” or “deceiver.” Therefore, he is called “dragon” because of the wicked harm he inflicts; he is called “serpent” because of the cunning of his deception; he is called “devil” because of the fall from his previous status; and he is called “Satan” because of the stubbornness of his opposition to the Lord.
