According to the historical sense, this indicates that the Mount of Olives was a thousand paces distant from the city of Jerusalem, for the law did not permit one to walk more than a thousand paces on the sabbath. According to the allegorical sense, however, anyone who becomes worthy of an interior vision of the glory of the Lord as he ascends to the Father, and of enrichment by the promise of the Holy Spirit, here enters the city of everlasting peace by a sabbath journey. There will be for him, in Isaiah’s words, “Sabbath after Sabbath,” because, having been free of wicked works here [in this life], he will be at rest there in heavenly recompense. On the other hand, anyone who in this world, as if during the period of the six [week] days, has neglected the working out of his salvation, showing scorn for that text of the Gospel [which says], “pray that your flight may not be in the winter, or on the Sabbath,” will at that time of everlasting rest be shut out from the boundaries of the blessed Jerusalem.
