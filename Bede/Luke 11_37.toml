And while he was speaking, a certain Pharisee asked him to dine with him, and he went in and reclined. Luke carefully does not say, "And when he had spoken these things," but "While he was speaking," to show that he was invited to dine by the Pharisee not immediately after finishing the words he had set out, but after some others were interposed. Matthew explains what these are, who, after concluding this speech of the Lord, which Luke records partly more briefly and partly more extensively, immediately added, "While he was still speaking to the crowds, behold, his mother and brothers stood outside, seeking to speak to him." "While he was still speaking," he said, so that you might understand, "while he was speaking these things," which he had indicated above. But Mark also, after he had related what the Lord said about the blasphemy against the Holy Spirit, said, "And his mother and brothers came." However, Luke did not follow the order of these events but preemptively narrated this event, having recalled it earlier. For he inserted it in such a way that it appears disconnected from the context both of the preceding and the following. Therefore, after he was informed that his mother and brothers were standing outside and he said, "Whoever does the will of God, he is my brother and sister and mother" (Mark 3), it is implied that he entered the Pharisee's house to dine, having been invited.
