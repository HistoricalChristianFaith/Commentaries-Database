Therefore, each struck a covenant before the Lord, etc. The Lord and the faithful strike a covenant with each other, that they should follow Him, and He should give them eternal life; and this before His divine presence, in whose faith He commands us to live, and to which He encourages us to aspire, assisting us. And the Lord remains in the Church, a dense forest of peoples, all the days until the consummation of the world (Matthew 8). However, each of the faithful, after completing the service of prayer or exhortation, or any other devotion offered to the Lord, returns to their conscience, so that, vacating external action, they may more freely for a time reflect on all that has been or is to be done by them, more freely purge themselves from what has been done badly, and more perfectly ready themselves for what is to be done well; such as these indeed can say with the prophet: Who will give me wings like a dove, and I will fly and be at rest (Psalm 54)? And deservedly too, with Jonathan, they can be called a gift of doves, indeed and with the apostle Peter they can be called sons of doves.
