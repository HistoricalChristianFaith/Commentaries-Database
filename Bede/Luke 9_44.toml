And all were marveling at all that he did, he said to his disciples: Let these words sink into your ears. For the Son of Man is to be delivered into the hands of men. Among the great works of divine power, he often impresses and reiterates the abasement of his human suffering, so that his sudden coming would not cause terror, but be endurable by a mind prepared in advance. Surely, what he said: “Let these words sink into your ears,” should be read with emphasis and greater force, addressed to you, who more familiarly adhere to my discipleship and to whom the hidden and uncertain elements of my wisdom I have more plainly revealed (Ps. L), while others only marvel at the divine deeds, you should deeply ponder the event of the precious blood, by which the world is to be redeemed.
