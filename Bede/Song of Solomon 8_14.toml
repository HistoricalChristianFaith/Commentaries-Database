Flee, my beloved, etc. This phrase can rightly be understood both concerning the triumph of the Lord's ascension and concerning those things which occur daily in the Church. For the beloved flees after speaking to the bridegroom and his sister, because, having completed the dispensation of our Redemption, he returned to the heavens. He is likened to a roebuck and to a young stag upon the mountains of spices, because he most frequently appears through the grace of compunction in the hearts of his faithful, who are mountains of spices, because, despising lowly desires, they are held by the love of heavenly things, and purged of the stench of vices, they are filled with the special fragrance of virtues, saying with the Apostle, “But our conversation is in heaven” (Philippians III); and, “We are a sweet savor of Christ” (II Corinthians II). And indeed it is fitting that at the end of this sacred song, mention is made of his ascension and the ensuing grace, because a little earlier, the joys of his incarnation had been desired by the bride, saying, “Who would give you to me, my brother, sucking the breasts of my mother?" The fruit of his passion had also been brought forth, with him saying, “I raised you up under the apple tree.” And again, “For love is strong as death.” Therefore, flee, my beloved, she says, and be like a roebuck or a young stag upon the mountains of spices: as if to say openly, “Since appearing in the flesh, you have deigned to confer upon me the precepts and gifts of heavenly life which I always desired, now, the task of the holy dispensation having been completed, return now to the heights, to the bosom of the Father; yet, I beseech you, do not entirely withdraw from me the light of your frequent visitation; but just as a roebuck or a young stag, which, though they are untamed animals, not accustomed to human access, yet are often seen on the mountains, so I ask you to remember to act with me, such that although you remain in the heavens bodily and do not return to human dwellings, you nevertheless provide me with the frequent aid of your divine presence. For in this way alone can I accomplish that great command which you gave me as a final farewell, that I always inhabit the gardens of virtues, always make my voice of confession and preaching heard to you. Moreover, this sentence can also, as we have said, be not inappropriately understood concerning the daily state of the holy Church. For the beloved indeed flees from the bride inhabiting the gardens whom he was addressing, when to a mind intent on good actions, either the grace of virtues, which he used to bestow, is temporarily withdrawn, or he submits it to the storms of temptations for testing, so that she is rightly compelled to say, “How long, O Lord, will you forget me? Forever? How long will you turn your face away from me?” etc., until the end of the psalm (Psalm XII). He is compared to a roebuck and a young stag on the mountains of spices; when again, as he himself judges it opportune, he places himself in the light of his protection, either lifting the peril of besetting temptations or restoring customary gifts of virtues which seemed to have been withdrawn. For, to pass over greater and more substantial charismata, as an example, healing the sick, raising the dead, casting out demons, a sure knowledge of secrets, a bright contemplation of heavenly joys and other such things, which even in the most exceptional members of the Church can hardly always be present. For it is evident concerning our smallness, because we can by no means always persist in the sweetness of prayers in the same and indistinguishable way, to shed tears either for the awareness of our guilt or for the desire of the heavenly homeland, to sympathize with a suffering neighbor, to resist pressing temptations; so that sometimes, much striving, we cannot use these goods, and at other times, even with less effort, we achieve abundance of them. What is to be made of this, unless because now the beloved flees, now he revisits our mind, with pious provision for each (somehow), so that we might grow in the progress of virtues through the grace bestowed and learn to guard humility through the virtue removed? He withdraws the desired effect of virtue for a time, so that it may be held more tightly when restored; he returns what was withdrawn, so that the mind, exercised by frequent renewal, may stretch more fervently toward heavenly things. Therefore, what he says, "Flee, my beloved," he speaks not by desiring; who would want to drive away from his presence someone he loves? but rather with his will burning, mindful indeed of his custom, whereby often leaving in the midst of discourse, he moved aside and withdrew, so that he could be found only by diligent and long search; mindful also of his condition, because he cannot see him continuously in this time or place of pilgrimage. What then did he add? "Become like a roe or a young stag on the mountains of spices"; he follows by desiring and supplicating much, knowing that this is the greatest happiness in the present life for him, that since he cannot endure continuous vision, at least he may be consoled by frequent visitation. Which certainly this happiness is granted only to those who, by the contempt of earthly things and desire for heavenly joys, are deemed worthy to be called spiritual mountains of spices.
