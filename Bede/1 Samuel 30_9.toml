David himself therefore went, and six hundred men who were with him, etc. The Brook Besor, which is interpreted as announcement or flesh, or the carnal sense of heretics difficult to correct, or signifies the redundancy of secular eloquence, and equally rapid and violent in its flow, not easily overcome except by the most perfect doctors. Therefore our desirable king, truly strong in hand, went to fight by the word of truth against the stubbornness of those erring, he and his chosen ones proved by the integrity of their work and the certainty of their hope, which the number six, by which the Lord completed His works, and one hundred, which in the reckoning first asks for the right hand in confession, clearly denote. Finally, in the hundredth psalm, the distinction of the final judgment, where the hope of all rightly hoping burns, is openly described, where, with mercy and judgment sung, the faithful of the earth and those walking in the immaculate way are by mercy promoted to the seat of eternal blessedness and the ministry of their Redeemer; but all sinners of the earth by the just judgment in the morning of declared action, which had long been hidden, are mentioned to be killed and destroyed from the city of supreme peace. However, while his saints accompany the Lord on the path of truth, when it comes to the point of disputing and overcoming heretics, some often even great men, though not from the purity of believing, yet tired from the skill of speaking, desist. For not all who know how to believe rightly also know how to overcome by reasoning those who think contrary to the right faith. For often the torrent of announcement, or flesh, or their carnal sense, who are unable to grasp spiritual matters, or the urge to pronounce the carnal things they feel stands in the way; which those less skilled may not know how to overcome and, like Elijah or Elisha, break through and disperse by the power of their discretion. This was especially evident in the Nicene Council, where among so many and such great doctors gathered from the whole world, hardly anyone at first, except Athanasius, the deacon of the Church of Alexandria, could be found who knew how to contend with Arius, immediately detect his evasions and deceits, and defeat them. Where a certain pagan philosopher, much armed with Aristotelian arguments, challenging the Christians very frequently, could be overcome by none of the doctors even distinguished in dialectical art, until one bishop of remarkable sanctity arose, utterly ignorant of sophistical speech, but distinguished in the wisdom of divine faith, and with simple yet truthful prosecution throughout nullified his multifaceted cunning. Therefore, only those who are either strengthened by an outstanding grace of the Spirit in faith or pre-taught with greater skill in disputing can suffice to cross such a torrent by teaching. They are rightly remembered as four hundred who pursue robbers, for they eminently excel in prudence, fortitude, temperance, and justice, because they rejoice to fight for the Gospel; rightly two hundred who, though tired, hold back; for there are those who, while they do not know how to defend faith and action by disputing, do not fail to exercise it by living.
