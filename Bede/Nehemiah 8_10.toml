"And he said to them: Go, eat rich foods, etc." For the day of the Lord is holy to us when we strive to hear and fulfill his words. On which day, although suffering external tribulations, we ought to be rejoicing in hope, according to the Apostle's saying: "As sorrowful, yet always rejoicing" (2 Cor. 6). On this day we are also commanded to eat rich foods and drink sweet wine; that is, to rejoice in the abundance of good action divinely bestowed upon us and in the sweetness of hearing the word of God. For sweet wine is wine sweetened with honey, hence it is called Oinomeli in Greek. But we are also instructed to send portions to those who have not prepared themselves, from these same most wholesome mental feasts, so that we may also strengthen the consciences of our weaker neighbors either by the example of pious action or by the sweetness of devout exhortation, so that their souls, according to the Psalmist, may be filled as with marrow and fatness from the abundance of heavenly generosity, and with joyful lips may praise the name of the Lord (Psalm 62). We ought to imitate this literally as well; so that, on feast days, after prayer, readings, and the completion of the singing of psalms, when we plan to care for the refreshment of the flesh, we also remember to give a portion to the poor and to strangers.
