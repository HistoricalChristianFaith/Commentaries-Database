“The shape of this world passes away,” not its substance; just as with our bodies too, the shape will be changed. The substance does not perish when “what is sowed as a physical body rises as a spiritual body.” But we read nothing of this sort about the fire and the water. Rather we have in the book of Revelation, “And the sea is now no longer,” and in the prophets, “And the light of the lamp shall shine for you no more.” “We wait for his promises,” he says, “in which righteousness dwells.” Righteousness dwells in the future age, because then the crown of righteousness will be given to each of the faithful in accord with the measure of their struggle. This is a thing that cannot at all happen in this life, according to the saying of Solomon, “I have seen beneath the sun wickedness in place of judgment and iniquity in place of righteousness and I said in my heart, ‘God will judge the righteous and the wicked, and there will be a time for everything.’ ” And again he says, “I saw the deceit that goes on beneath the sun and the tears of the innocent and that there was no comforter, nor were those deprived of the help of all able to resist their power, and I praised the dead rather than the living.”
