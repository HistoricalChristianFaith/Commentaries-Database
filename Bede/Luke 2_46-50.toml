This we may here affirm: By the number seven, as by the number twelve (which is made up from the parts of the number seven multiplied by each other), the whole universe of things, events and their perfection is signified. Accordingly, that he may teach in what manner all places and times are to be employed, the divine Light of Christ rightly makes a beginning from the number twelve.
