Clearly the abode in the hearts of the elect of the holy Trinity, the nature of whose divinity is one and indivisible, cannot be disparate. Therefore, when he was sitting in the temple, the Lord said, “I must be about my Father’s business,” and this is a declaration of his power and glory which are co-eternal with God the Father’s. However, when he returned to Nazareth, he was subject to his parents, and this is an indication of his true humanity as well as an example of humility. He was subject to human beings in that human nature in which he is less than the Father. Hence he himself said, “I go to the Father because the Father is greater than I.” In that human nature, he was made a little less than the angels. In that other nature, however, in which he and the Father are one, and in virtue of which he does not go to the Father only now and then but is always in him, all things were made through him, and he is before all things.
