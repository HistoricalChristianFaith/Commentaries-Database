But indeed Mizraim begot Ludim, and Anamim, and Lehabim, and Naphtuhim, and Pathrusim, and Casluhim, from whom came the Philistines and Caphtorim. These seem to be the names of peoples rather than of individual men, since it was stated clearly even Casluhim from whom came the Philistines. For all of them end in -im, which is the proper ending of the plural number in Hebrew in the masculine gender, but also interpreted they signify a plural number rather than a singular. Now indeed Lehabim are Libyans, Philistines are Palestinians, Caphtorim are Cappadocians, as we find set according to the opinion of the Seventy interpreters in the book of the names of the Hebrews. The names of the other peoples which are now known to us, however, are unknown. But they possessed the land from Gaza up to the boundaries and limits of Egypt.
