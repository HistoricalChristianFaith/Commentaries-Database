She shall not fear for her household from the snows. The cold of snow is the hearts of the reprobate, rigid with the numbness of their own treachery. Of whom the Lord says, "And because iniquity has abounded, the charity of many will grow cold" (Matthew 24). These indeed are oppressed by that most wicked snow, which, falling from heaven due to the merit of original pride into the depths of darkness, still presumptuously shows itself to fools as an angel of light, and offers to the ignorant the habit of its merits similar to the whiteness of snow. It is proper for the Lord and his angels to signify the brightness of their virtue in a snowy garment. However, the Church will not fear for her household from the cold of the aforementioned snow, because she believes the Lord's promise that the gates of hell will not prevail against her. For all her household are clothed with double garments: wisdom, to reveal the heretical doctrines of false brethren, and patience, to endure the battles of open enemies. Or certainly, they are clothed with double garments because they have the promise of life both present and future. Now, in the temporal pilgrimage, they are aided by divine assistance so that they do not fail; then, in the eternal habitation of the homeland, they are uplifted by the vision of divine grace to live happily forever. Likewise, her household is clothed with a double garment: one of works, the other of faith of the mind, having the coverings of deeds, and imbued and informed by the sacraments of their Redeemer and his examples. Thus it becomes as the Apostle says, "For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ" (Galatians 3). The cold of snow can also be understood as eternal torments, which we read are near both fire and cold; when it is said, "There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth" (Matthew 8). For indeed, fire and smoke produce weeping in the eyes, while cold usually causes gnashing of teeth. Hence the blessed Job speaks of the eternal punishments of the reprobate, saying, "They pass from the waters of snow to excessive heat" (Job 24). But from these, the Church will not fear for her household, because whoever perishes did not belong to her household, nor were they clothed in her spiritual garment; although for a time they seemed to be instructed in her mysteries. Indeed, we read in the Gospels that a man who presumed to enter the house of that feast with the filthy garments of works was cast out into the outer darkness, where there would be weeping and gnashing of teeth. Rightly indeed, he was bound to the cold of punishment, because he had neglected to have the garments of piety.
