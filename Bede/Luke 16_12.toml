If then you have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will entrust to you what is your own? It has been previously explained that unrighteous mammon signifies the riches of the wicked. Regarding which, the Savior elsewhere says the deceitfulness of riches chokes the word (Matthew XIII). But true riches, either the very joys of eternal life, of which it is written: What is the wealth of his glorious inheritance in the saints (Ephesians I), or the abundance of spiritual virtues, by which one attains life. Of which Isaiah says: The riches of salvation, wisdom, and knowledge. The fear of the Lord, that is his treasure (Isaiah XXXIII).

And if you have not been faithful in what is another's, who will give you what is your own? The resources of this world are alien to us, meaning, situated outside of our nature. For we brought nothing into this world, and it is certain that we cannot take anything out of it. But our possession is the kingdom of heaven. Our life is Christ. Our wealth is the fruits of spiritual works. Of which Solomon says: The redemption of a man's soul is his own wealth (Proverbs XIII). Therefore, he reproaches the Pharisees for fraud and avarice, who, since they were not faithful in their resources, preferring to have the Creator's common goods privately, did not deserve to receive Christ, whom that publican, Zacchaeus, who I mentioned a little earlier, offered half of his goods so he might acquire.
