If anyone strikes you on the cheek, offer the other also. He does not say, do not strike the one who strikes you, although this is also a great commandment, but he says: prepare yourself to be struck again. This pertains to mercy, as understood especially by those who serve like fathers, or those who serve those dearest to them, such as sick ones, little ones, or the mentally disturbed, from whom they often suffer many things. And if their health requires it, they even offer themselves to suffer more, until the weakness of age or illness passes. Therefore, the Lord, the physician of souls, instructed those who would heal others, what else could he teach them but to bear with the infirmities of those whose health they wish to care for with a calm mind? For all wickedness comes from weakness of spirit, because nothing is more innocent than one who is perfect in virtue. Many know how to offer the other cheek, but do not know how to love the one who strikes them. But the Lord himself, who certainly first fulfilled the precepts he taught, did not offer the other cheek to the servant of the priest who struck him, but moreover said: If I have spoken wrongly, bear witness to the wrong; but if rightly, why do you strike me? (John XVIII). Yet he was not unprepared in heart, not only to be struck on the other cheek for the salvation of all, but even to be crucified with his whole body.

And from one who takes away your cloak, do not withhold your tunic either. What has been said about the cloak and tunic is not just about these, but should apply to all things which we say are temporarily ours by some right. For if this has been commanded about necessities, how much more fitting it is to disdain superfluities.
