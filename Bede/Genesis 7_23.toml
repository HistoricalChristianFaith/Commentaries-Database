We read in the story of holy Noah how he miraculously escaped the flood which destroyed the impious by being preserved with his household in the ark. From this it is evident to everyone that the Lord who loves righteousness and hates iniquity knows how to deliver the pious from temptation and to punish the impious with the punishment they deserveâ€¦. Through spiritual understanding this same text is shown to be full of more sacred mysteries, when the ark is discerned to signify the catholic church; the water of the flood, baptism; the clean and unclean animals, those in the church both spiritual and carnal; the wood of the ark which was smooth and covered with pitch, the teachers who are stalwart as a result of their faith. .
