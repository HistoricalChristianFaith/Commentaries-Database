And he said to them: With desire I have desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer. First, he desires to eat the typical Passover with the disciples, and thus reveal the mysteries of his passion to the world, so that he may both be acknowledged as the fulfiller of the ancient and legal Passover and teach that this pertains to the figure of his own dispensation, restraining from exhibiting it carnally any further. Rather, as the shadow passes, he demonstrates that now the light of the true Passover has come. This is beautifully prefigured in the times of Joshua by the time and order of the fulfillment of the manna, where it is written: And they kept the Passover on the fourteenth day of the month at evening in the plains of Jericho, and they ate of the produce of the land on the next day, unleavened cakes, and parched grain of that year. And the manna ceased after they ate of the produce of the land, nor did the children of Israel use that food anymore (Joshua 5). Indeed, Joshua, taking up the people after the death of Moses, for some time beyond Jordan, refreshed them with the accustomed manna, by which he himself, although recognizing and having already tasted the fruit of the promised land, is refreshed. Thence he crosses the Jordan, circumcises with stone knives, and for three days and a half, up until the completed festival of Passover, does not take away the accustomed manna. For, with Moses dead, Joshua is appointed leader, because, with the law corrupted by the traditions of the Pharisees, Christ is incarnated. Joshua feeds and is fed with manna beyond the Jordan because the Lord up to the time of his baptism observes the ceremonies of the law himself and desires them to be observed by all. Joshua circumcises the people crossed over Jordan with stone because, with the grace of baptism celebrated, the Savior also by the severity of faith preempts the temptations that the law could not deter. And those three and a half years, as if nourished by the usual manna, he does not cease to observe the sacraments of the law, although gradually provoking to the promises of heaven, until at the designated time, eating the desired Passover with his disciples, thus at dawn breaking offering the most pure mysteries of his body and blood consecrated on the altar of the cross, as unleavened cakes of the promised land to be imbued by the faithful. Finally, what follows:
