But some of them said, "In Beelzebub, the prince of demons, He casts out demons." Not some from the crowd, but the Pharisees and scribes were slandering, as other evangelists testify. Indeed, to the crowds who seemed less educated, always marveling at the deeds of the Lord, those people, on the contrary, either tried to deny these things or to pervert what they could not deny with sinister interpretation, as if these were not the works of divinity but of an unclean spirit, that is, Beelzebub, who was the god of Ekron. For Beel is indeed Baal. Zebub, however, is called a fly. Nor is the letter l or d to be read at the end of the name according to certain erroneous copies, but b. Therefore, Beelzebub means Baal of the flies, that is, the lord of the flies, or the one having flies, supposedly because of the filth of sacrificial blood, from whose most foul rites or name they called the prince of demons.
