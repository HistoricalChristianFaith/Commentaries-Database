Her husband is known in the gates, etc. The husband of the holy Church, the Lord, is the husband of every faithful soul. He who seemed ignoble when he stood before the governor's tribunal, when he accepted reproaches, scourges, spit, and even the death of the cross; but he will appear noble when he comes to judge the world in righteousness, and all his angels with him. Then he will sit, he says, on the throne of his majesty, and all nations will be gathered before him, and he will separate them from one another, and so forth (Matthew 25). Her husband is noble in the gates, because the ancients used to sit at the gates to judge, so that those coming to the city from elsewhere would immediately receive the ready response of the judge. Neither would the unusual buildings of the city astonish rustics or shepherds, nor would the frequent disputes of litigants defile the inner peace of the city. Therefore, the Lord will be noble in the gates of his city, because he who is now thought to be contemptible by many, when the end of the world has come, when the entrance to the heavenly homeland has appeared to the elect, he will already be sublime to all. But he will sit with the senators of the earth. Amen, I say to you, that you who have followed me, in regeneration, when the Son of Man will sit on the throne of His majesty, you also will sit on twelve thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel (Matthew XIX).
