You are holy to the Lord, and the vessels are holy, etc. For it is fitting that the teachers of the Church should never forget the holiness by which they themselves are consecrated to the Lord through the Holy Spirit, in the day of redemption, for which they also prepare their hearers to receive; so that those who have already been offered to the Lord through the rudiments of faith are further confirmed by the examples and admonitions of those who have preceded them in faith, and become worthy of entrance into the heavenly city. They must be watchful in all things and ensure that none of the souls, namely the vessels of the Lord, entrusted to them is lost, but that they bring them in their entirety to the gates of the holy city.
