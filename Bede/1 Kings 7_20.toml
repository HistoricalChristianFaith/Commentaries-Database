We have said that the pomegranates were a type of either the whole church or of each individual believer, but the number one hundred that was originally applied to the right hand was sometimes apt to be used as a figure of eternal beatitude. There were twice this number of pomegranates around the second capital to suggest mystically that the people of both Testaments who were to be unified in Christ were to be brought in to receive the crown of eternal life. In keeping with this figure are the words written about the apostles fishing after the Lord’s resurrection when they saw him standing on the shore: “For they were not far from the land, but, as it were, two hundred cubits, dragging the net with the fish.” For the disciples indeed drag the net full of large fish for two hundred cubits to the Lord who is already on the shore showing the effects of his resurrection when holy preachers entrust the word of faith to both Jews and Gentiles and drag the elect of both peoples from the waves of this present world and lead them to the glory of the peace and immortality to come. The circumference, therefore, of the second capital has two rows of pomegranates when the sublimity of the heavenly kingdom assembles the elect of both peoples in one citadel of peace.
