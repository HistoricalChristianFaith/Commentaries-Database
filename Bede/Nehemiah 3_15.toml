The Pool of Siloa (which means “sent”), where the man born blind was given light, stands for the Lord Savior who was sent by God the Father for our illumination. The spring of this pool can be very aptly understood as the same Father from whom he was born, about which the psalmist well says, “For with you is the spring of life; in your light we shall see light.” And the Spring Gate is built in Jerusalem when teachers are ordained in the church to preach belief in divine eternity to the nations. The walls of the Pool of Siloa are built too when the very firm and invincible testimonies of the Scriptures, in which the mystery of the Lord’s incarnation is described, are rooted in the mind of the faithful. Moreover these walls of divine utterances reach as far as the King’s Garden when, having recognized the mysteries of the Lord’s dispensation, we begin to bring forth shoots of the virtues with the help of that same king, our Lord God.
