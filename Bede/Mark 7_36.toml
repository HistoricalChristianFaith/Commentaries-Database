And he commanded them not to tell anyone. But the more he commanded them, the more they proclaimed it, and they were exceedingly astonished, saying: He has done all things well, he makes the deaf hear, and the mute speak. If he knew they would proclaim it even more as he had the present and future wills of humans known, why then did he command this except to show the lazy how much more fervently and eagerly they ought to preach, whom he commands to preach when those who were forbidden could not keep silent?
