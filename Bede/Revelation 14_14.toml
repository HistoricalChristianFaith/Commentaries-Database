cloud: Thus far has the voice of the harlot been promised, and it now remains to exhibit the person of the Judge Himself, Who, when He comes to judgement, overshadows the glory of His divinity by a cloud of flesh, that the ungodly &quot;may see Him Whom they pierced.&quot;

Until now we have heard the voices of the heralds. However, now the person of the judge himself is revealed, who, when he comes for judgment, covers the glory of his divinity with a cloud of flesh so that the wicked might behold him whom they pierced.… What kind of crown this is was described above concerning the adornment of the woman, “And on her head a crown of twelve stars.” But perhaps it may signify the victory of the King.… [The sharp sickle] refers to the judicial sentence of separation, and we can in no way avoid this judgment. We are most definitely within it, no matter where we might try to flee, for whatever is felled by a sickle falls within.
