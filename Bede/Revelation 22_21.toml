Amen. Even so, come, Lord Jesus. She who daily cries out in prayer: "Your kingdom come" (Matt. VI). And in the psalm: "I will sing and give praise in the way of integrity. When will you come to me?" (Ps. CI).

The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen. Let the Pelagians go and, trusting in their own strength, deprive themselves of the grace of the Lord. But to the Apostle Paul, seeking help and saying: "Who will deliver me from this body of death?" (Rom. VII), let John, mindful of his own name, respond and say: "The grace of God through Jesus Christ our Lord" (Rom. VII). And lest the Donatists boast of the singular gift of God, let them hear that when he commended the grace of God, as if saying a final farewell, he added, "with you all." Amen.
