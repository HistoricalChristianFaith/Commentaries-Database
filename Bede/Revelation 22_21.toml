Let the Pelagians be confident in their own power and deprive themselves of the grace of the Lord. However, when the apostle Paul was seeking for help, he said, “Who will deliver me from this body of death?” Mindful of his own condition, let John respond and say, “The grace of God through Jesus Christ, our Lord.” And lest the Donatists deceive themselves concerning the singular gift of God, let them hear that when John commends the grace of God, as if it were a final farewell, he adds, “and with you all, Amen.”
