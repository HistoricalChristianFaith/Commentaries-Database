“Do not withhold good from those to whom it is due,” etc. Because above he diligently urged the observance of the law of the Lord and his counsel, and promised eternal rest to those who observe it, now he repeatedly explains in various ways what should be observed. First, returning to what he had previously mentioned, he teaches that mercy should be shown to one's neighbor, and that one should live justly with him; then, he warns that one should be cautious of the enemy. Thus he says, “Do not withhold good from those who deserve it; if you can, do good yourself. Do not hear from the Lord with the Pharisees, ‘You have not entered, and you hindered those who were entering’ (Luke 11).
