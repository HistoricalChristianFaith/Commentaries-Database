Then David said to his men, Let each one gird on his sword, etc. The sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God, can indeed be understood; with which the Mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus (Ephes. VI), was girded to vanquish the unbelievers, whenever he revealed the word of the Father to the world through his Gospel. And his disciples were girded when they preached the same. But because it is read in the following: David, being prohibited from striking the wicked, thanks to Abigail's intercession. The Church never prays, however, that Christ might not inflict the saving wound of his word upon the unbelievers. It is better understood in this place that the sword signifies the vengeance of destruction, which threatened the Jews after the Lord's passion; with which sword, indeed, the Lord himself, and his ministers of the same word, were girded, not by inflicting punishment on sinners, but by predicting this punishment as future to the sinners, unless they repented. Due to the fear of this sword, the Church, interceding with the Lord, suspended its blow for more than LX years.

And about four hundred men followed David, etc. Whoever could be found perfect in prudence, fortitude, temperance, and justice followed the Lord to the office of preaching. Moreover, others, content with the twin perfection of charity, preferred to live quietly with those they had won for Christ, rather than gird themselves for spiritual battles to win others.
