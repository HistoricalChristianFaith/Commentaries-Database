For who is greater, the one who reclines or the one who serves? Is it not the one who reclines? But I am among you as the one who serves. To his words of exhortation, he adds examples, which the evangelist John more fully records, writing among other things: If I, the Lord and Master, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another's feet (John XIII). Although by the word of serving, all the things that God did in the flesh can be understood. For he signifies that he will pour out the sacrament of his own blood to be administered to us, when he says: The Son of Man came not to be served but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many (Matthew XX), and showing this also as a primary example of service for the elders of the Church to emulate, so that we not only extend the ministries of mercies, charity, saving doctrine, spiritual example to our brothers, but also learn to lay down our lives for one another as he laid down his life for us.
