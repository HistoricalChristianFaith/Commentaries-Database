“O Jerusalem,” it says, “do not fear the power of the earthly city, which collapses from that very thing by which it subjugated you through the hatred of its wicked citizens.” Isaiah also describes Babylon as inhabited by impure monsters. For there is no other city than that of the devil, which receives every unclean spirit and in which every impurity remains throughout the world.
