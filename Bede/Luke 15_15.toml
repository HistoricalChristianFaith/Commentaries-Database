And he began to be in want, and went and joined himself to a citizen of that country. Rightly he began to be in want, who abandoned the treasures of the wisdom of God, the heights of heavenly riches. But a certain citizen of that country to whom the needy joined himself is surely he who, by the merit of his perversity, is set over earthly desires, called by the Lord the prince of this world. And of whom the Apostle says: The god of this age has blinded the minds of the unbelieving (2 Cor. 4).

And he sent him into his village to feed swine. To be sent to the village is to be subjected to the desire of worldly substance. Concerning which, in another parable, someone despising spiritual banquets to which he was invited, said: I have bought a village and I need to go out and see it (Luke XIV). But to feed swine is to perform those actions in which unclean spirits rejoice.
