And the man from whom the demons had gone out begged him that he might be with him. But Jesus sent him away, saying, "Return to your home, and tell how much God has done for you." These words can be rightly understood from the Apostle's sentiment when he says, "My desire is to depart and be with Christ, for that is far better; but to remain in the flesh is necessary on your account" (Philippians 1). Thus, one should understand that after the forgiveness of sins, he must return to a good conscience and serve the Gospel for the salvation of others as well, so that afterward he may rest with Christ. Otherwise, if someone wishes prematurely to be with Christ, he may neglect the ministry of preaching, suited for the redemption of his brothers.
