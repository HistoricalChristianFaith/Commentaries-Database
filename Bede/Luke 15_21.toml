And the son said to him: Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you. I am no longer worthy to be called your son. Now he begins, established in the Church, to confess his sins, and he does not say all he had promised to say, but only up to this: I am not worthy to be called your son. For he desires to become through grace what he confesses himself unworthy to be through merits. He did not add what he had said in that meditation: Make me like one of your hired servants. For when he lacked bread, he even desired to be a hired servant. Which, after his father's kiss, he most generously now disdains. For he understands that there is no small distinction between a son, a hired servant, and a slave. Namely, a slave is one who still, through fear of hell or the presence of laws, abstains from vices; a hired servant, who by hope and desire for the kingdom of heaven; a son, by affection for goodness itself and love of virtues. In the consummation of these three virtues, the blessed Apostle, summarizing all salvation, says: Now, he says, faith, hope, and charity remain, these three. But the greatest of these is charity. For faith is that which, through fear of future judgment and punishments, causes one to turn away from the contamination of vices. Hope, which calling our mind away from present things, by the expectation of heavenly rewards, despises all pleasures of the body. Charity, which lighting us up with the ardor of the mind towards the death of Christ and the fruit of spiritual virtues, makes us detest with complete hatred whatever is contrary to them. Therefore, the prodigal, after coming to his senses, feared the punishments of dire famine, and as if now made a slave, even thinking of the state of a hired servant from the reward, desires it. But the father, running to meet him, not content with granting lesser things, hastily passing through both stages, restores him to the former dignity of sons, and now makes him think not of the reward of a hireling, but of the inheritance of a parent.
