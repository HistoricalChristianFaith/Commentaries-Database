And I came to Jerusalem, and understood the evil thing Eliashib had done for Tobiah in providing him a storeroom in the vestibule of the house of God. We read above that Tobiah was an Ammonite official hostile to God's people,1 which is why Eliashib the priest acted very wickedly when, even though he was his relative,2 he made a storeroom in the vestibule of God's house to place his vessels having cast out from there the vessels of God's house as well as other articles which his service required. For what do righteousness and wickedness have in common? What harmony is there between Christ and Belial? What agreement is there between the temple of God and idols?3 What fellowship do heretics and schismatics have with the orthodox and peace-loving children of God?
