"A man who hastens to be rich," etc. For surely, he who ambitiously seeks to increase wealth neglects sin, caught like birds, when he begins, eager for the bait of earthly things, he does not realize he is being strangled by the snare of sin; when he desires any goods of this present world, he does not know what losses he will suffer in the future.
