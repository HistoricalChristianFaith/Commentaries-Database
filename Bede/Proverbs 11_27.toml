He indeed rises early who seeks what is good, etc. To seek the good things you ought to do, by which you may attain heavenly goods, this is to rise early well, that is, to be girded for good work with the growing light of knowledge. Or certainly, he rises well, that is, to life at the time of resurrection, who now seeks the good things in the time of action. But he who now diligently inquires into the evil which he may say or do, will then be hindered by their weight from reaching the higher kingdoms.
