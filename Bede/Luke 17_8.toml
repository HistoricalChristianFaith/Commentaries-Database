And gird yourself and serve me while I eat and drink. To gird oneself is to restrict one's humble mind from all wandering thoughts by which the steps of duties are usually impeded. For whoever girds their clothes does this to avoid being entangled to the point of stumbling while walking. To serve God is to confess that one is insignificant in everything and has no strength without His grace. For a minister takes his name from a lower status, that is, subjection, just as a master takes his name from a higher status. Therefore, he serves the Creator who, considering his nature, fearing His judgements, humbles himself regarding his own virtues.

And after this, you will eat and drink. After, he says, I have been delighted by the work of your preaching, and refreshed by the feasts of your compunction, then finally you will pass and recline, and you will be refreshed forever with the eternal feasts of my wisdom.
