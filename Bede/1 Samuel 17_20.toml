So David rose early, etc. The shadow of the law receded, truth arose from the earth; that is, the Lord in the flesh, who would minister the light of the Gospel to the world, appeared; whereby He did not abandon the ninety-nine elect sheep divinely in heaven, even when, made man, He sought the one erring sheep in the world. But He came full of grace and truth, and from His fullness we have all received, grace upon grace (John 1); the kind whom all the pious expected to come, believed in, preached, and loved.

And He came to the place of Magala, etc. The Lord appearing in the flesh found both the saints struggling for faith and the unclean spirits plotting to destroy the fortresses of faith. Such was the state of the world when the Lord was born, such it persists until the end of this age.
