Do not multiply lofty words, glorying, etc. It is said to the Jews and the Gentiles: Let it suffice to have so far gloried in your almost unique glory, now with the letter of the law transcended by grace, the truth of the Gospel trampling down the errors of the Gentiles, both receive the New Testament of Christ with faith, and the commandment of love. But we are also commanded to speak lofty things, but not to multiply lofty words glorying; that is, to seek and to desire the things above, not those on earth; yet not to think more highly than we ought to think, but to think soberly (Coloss. III; Rom. XII). The Gentiles are instructed to speak lofty things, by proclaiming the mysteries of the one true God, and not to multiply lofty words, by erring through many deceiving names.

For the Lord is the God of knowledge, etc. Therefore, it is necessary for you to not seek higher things for yourselves, nor to search into things stronger than yourselves (Eccles. III); for the source and treasure of wisdom and knowledge, who teaches man knowledge: the Lord knows the thoughts of men, that they are vain (Psa. XCIII).
