And it came to pass on one of those days, that he went into a ship with his disciples, and he said unto them: Let us go over to the other side of the lake. And they launched forth. In this voyage, the Lord deigns to show both natures of His one and the same person, in that He, as a man, sleeps in the boat, but as God, with a word, He calms the fury of the sea. Furthermore, according to the allegory, the sea or lake which He desires to cross with His own symbolizes the dark and bitter tides of this present world. However, the boat they board is best understood as the tree of the Lord's passion. By the advantage of which, all the faithful, assisted, having passed through the waves of the world, obtain the habitation of the heavenly homeland as the security of a stable shore. That the Savior Himself boarded a boat with the disciples means elsewhere, as He reveals when He, foretelling the mystery of His passion and resurrection, immediately said to everyone: If anyone wishes to come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me.
