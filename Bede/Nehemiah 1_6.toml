And it came to pass, when Sanballat, Tobiah, Geshem the Arabian, and the rest of our enemies heard that I had built the wall, and the rest until they say: 'Come and let us make a pact together in calves on one plain'.3 But they were scheming to harm me. So I sent messengers to them saying : 'I am doing a great work and cannot go down, in case the work is neglected when I come and go down to you'.1 The enemies of the holy city are urging Nehemiah to go down to the plains and to enter into a peace pact with them by together slaughtering calves as testimony to the arranged treaty, but he perseveres in  “362” the mountains so that the devout work is not neglected.
