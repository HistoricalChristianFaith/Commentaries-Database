In Marc., 1, 7: Since by the envy of the devil death first entered into the world, it was right that the medicine of healing should first work against the author of death; and therefore it is said, “And there was in their synagogue a man”.
For the devils, seeing the Lord on the earth, thought that they were immediately to be judged.
