Answering, however, Nabal spoke to David's young men, etc. The foolish leaders of the Jews, responding to the disciples of Christ preaching to them, said: We are disciples of Moses, but this man we do not know where he comes from (John IX). And the disciples of Jesus grew in the presumption of teaching, so that they could not be surpassed by anyone, who fled by despising the experts in the law, much their superiors in knowledge. Therefore, we will take up the words of the Holy Scripture, entrusted to us specifically for teaching, which can be read and understood simply; that is, to drink water: partly to be handled more carefully, so that they may be understood in this way, which is to break and eat bread by chewing. We will also take the deeds of the preceding fathers, which we have prepared for teaching to aid the life and virtue of our listeners, and we will give them to teachers, entirely separated from our religion and faith, who pervertedly transfer the holy words to the sense of their doctrine.
