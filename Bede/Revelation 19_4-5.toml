The church worships her Lord not only with her lips but also with the affection of the highest devotion. The words Amen and Hallelujah can be interpreted, for they refer to faith or to the truth and praise of the Lord. However, out of reverence for the holiness of the original language, the use and authority of these words is preserved. The church continues to sing Hallelujah on the days of the Lord and throughout the period of Quinquagesima because of the hope of the resurrection, which in the praise of the Lord is future.… It says “the small and the great,” because to be small in natural abilities does not matter if one’s heart and tongue are full of the praise of the Lord.
