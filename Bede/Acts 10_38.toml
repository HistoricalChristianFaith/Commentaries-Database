Another text says, “Inasmuch as God anointed him.” John preached Jesus inasmuch as God anointed him with the Holy Spirit at the time when he said, “He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit”; and again, “I saw the Spirit descending as a dove upon him.” Jesus was anointed “not with oil but with the gift of grace, which is signified by the visible oil with which the church anoints those who are baptized. Yet, Christ was not anointed with the Holy Spirit at the time when it descended as a dove upon him at his baptism, for at that time he condescended to prefigure his body, that is, his church, in which the baptized principally receive the Holy Spirit. Rather, he must be understood to have been anointed with a mystical and invisible anointing when the Word of God was made flesh, that is, when human nature, without any preceding merits from good works, was joined to God the Word in the womb of the Virgin, so as to become one person with him. Because of this we confess that he was born of the Holy Spirit and of the Virgin Mary.”
