I showed you all things. That is, not only must one persist in teaching amid pressures and tears, but one must also work with oneâ€™s hands to support the weak so that no one is burdened. This is what was meant by: And whatever more you spend, I will repay you when I return (Luke X), namely, to preach the Gospel and not to seek support from the Gospel.

It is more blessed to give than to receive. He does not prefer the rich almsgivers to those who, having left all, followed the Lord; but he glorifies those most greatly who, having renounced all they possess at once, still work with their hands to produce what is good so they have something to give to those in need.
