That is, not only that devotion to teaching is necessary amid oppression and tears, but also that manual labor is demanded so that none of the weak may be burdened. This is, however, what was said: “And whatever you spend in addition I will repay you when I return,” which means to preach the gospel and not to see one’s support from the gospel.

He does not value the rich, even if they give alms, more highly than those who have left all things and followed the Lord. Rather, he extols most highly those who have given up at once everything they had and who nevertheless labor, “working with their hands at what is good in order to have something to give to one who is suffering need.”
