Of those who are proud and at the same time treacherous it is said, “The foxes have dens and the birds of the air have nests.” And of all people in general it is said, “And man, when he was held in esteem” (that is, made in the image of God), “did not understand; he was like foolish cattle.” Solomon, however, shows humanity as it truly is, that is, uncorrupted, when he says, “Fear God and keep his commandments, for this is all there is to man.”

They have been appointed to this, that is, to this made human beings by nature, that they may believe God and obey his will, as Solomon attests when he says, “Fear God and obey his commandments, for this is [the duty of] every human being.” That is, every human being has been naturally made for this purpose, that he may fear God and obey his commandments.
