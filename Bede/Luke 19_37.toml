And as he was now approaching the descent of the Mount of Olives, the whole multitude of disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice. As the Lord descends from the Mount of Olives, the rejoicing and praising multitudes also descend, because with the author of mercy humbling himself by his own will, it is necessary for those who are most in need of mercy to imitate, as far as they can, the footsteps of His humility. It is necessary, I say, for us to look at how Jesus descended from the Mount of Olives, that is, how He, being in the form of God, humbled Himself, became obedient unto death, even death on a cross, we also should humble ourselves under His mighty hand, so that we may be exalted in the time of visitation.
