Do not turn to the right or to the left. The right way is taken as good, the left as reprobate. Therefore, we are forbidden to turn to the right way, but not to decline to the right. One turns to the left who is unjust; one turns to the right who arrogates to himself that he is just; one turns to the right who presumes on his own strengths; one turns to the left who, because of his frailty, despairs of being able to be saved; one turns to the left who serves folly; one turns to the right who wishes to be wiser than he ought to be. This is also understood in the same way concerning the rest of the virtues and vices.

Keep your foot from evil. This means do not deviate from the right, either to this side or that, because virtues seek discernment, and all excess is in vice. For the ways which are to the right, the Lord knows. That is, He has chosen, and they are pleasing to Him. Therefore, to those who are displeasing and reprobate He will say, I never knew you (Matt. 7:23); which is to say, I did not choose you, you are not pleasing to me. But He Himself will make your steps straight, etc. If you turn your foot away from evil, if you strive to do the good which I have taught with the Lord's help, He Himself will be propitious to your efforts, so that now you may walk rightly and then be able to reach eternal peace.
