For who has stretched out his hand against the Lord's anointed? etc., according to the ongoing exposition indeed demonstrates that no one is free from the crime of sacrilege, who attempts to invade the kingdom of the Jewish people, given specially to him by the Lord, and consecrated with holy oil, and to profane the city and the temple dedicated to divine worship, disregarding the fear of God. But according to the supplicant's sense of the statement, it teaches with what great reverence divine sacraments must be treated, even though they are dispensed by the hands of the wicked; how much honor is due to persons devoted to the service of the sacred altar, how much presumption should be restrained from harming these persons, no matter how wickedly they live, because of the mark of any rank, since he himself, the exile, innocent, refrained from killing the most unjust persecutor of him, solely because of the holy oil of anointing which he had received in the figure of Christ either of the name or of the kingdom which he was not to preserve, and restrained his soldier by command and himself by divine fear. Therefore, we must be careful not to presume to defame and attack the reputation of bishops, presbyters, deacons indiscriminately.
