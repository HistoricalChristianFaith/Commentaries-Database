Now Elizabeth’s time had come to give birth, and she bore a son. Holy Scripture is accustomed to use the term “fulfillment” only in the birth, or condition, or action of good things, which signifies the perfection of life. Hence it is said, “Elizabeth's time to give birth was fulfilled." “The days were fulfilled for Mary to give birth” (Luke II). “Solomon completed building the house of the Lord” (II Chron. III). “Abraham, or another of the fathers, died, full of days." And, “when the fullness of time had come, God sent his Son” (Gal. IV). But on the contrary, the days of the wicked are empty and void. For men of blood and deceit will not live out half their days (Psalm LIV).
