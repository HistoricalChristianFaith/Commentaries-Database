He also spoke a parable to them: No one puts a piece from a new garment on an old one; otherwise, he will tear the new, and the piece from the new will not match the old. When the Lord was asked why his disciples did not fast, he replied that those still carnal, not yet strengthened by the faith in his passion and resurrection, could not bear the stricter fasting and continence commands, lest through excessive austerity, they lose even the faith they seemed to have. Therefore, he refers to his disciples as old garments, to which a new patch is sewn inappropriately, that is, any part of the doctrine that pertains to the moderation of a new life. Because if this is done, even the doctrine will somehow be torn, whose part about the fasting of food is inappropriately given. That doctrine teaches general fasting, not only from the desire for food but from all delight in temporal joys, the patch of which, that is, a part concerning food, he says should not be imparted to men still given to old habits. Because it seems that there would be a tearing, and it does not match the old.
