But if you can do anything, help us, have compassion on us. Jesus said to him: If you can believe, all things are possible to the one who believes. The Lord renders a fitting answer to the petitioner. For he himself said: If you can do anything, help us. And the Lord: If you can, he said, believe, I can have compassion and help you, for true faith deserves to obtain all that it healthily asks for. To which the leper who cried out faithfully: Lord, if you will, you can make me clean (Luke V), received a response suitable to his faith: I will, be clean (Ibid).
