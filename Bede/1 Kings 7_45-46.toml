It is appropriate that the vessels of the Lord’s house were cast in the region of the Jordan, namely, in the river in which our Lord deigned to be baptized and by his immersion in the waves of its waters changed the element for us into a bath for sins. For every baptism of the faithful in which they are consecrated to the Lord is celebrated on the model of his baptism whereby he himself sanctified the waters. It is proper that the vessels of the Lord’s house should have been made in the country of the Jordan, for there is no other way for us to become vessels of election and mercy than by looking to his baptism that he underwent in that river and making sure that we too are washed in that life-giving river. However, it must be noted that he says these vessels were made not only in the country around the Jordan but also in its plains to signify the multiplication of the faithful that was to take place not only in Judea but also in the wide world of all the nations in fulfillment of the prophecy that says, “The plains and everything in them will rejoice.”
