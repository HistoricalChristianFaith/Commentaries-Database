But the righteous eats and fills his soul, etc. The righteous receive the foods of wisdom, which are found to have sprung in the fresh fields of the fathers, that is, in the works and words of preceding just men, and they transfer these to the profit of their soul by living well. The belly of the wicked, that is, the capacity of the sense of heretics, is insatiable; for, as the Apostle says, Ever learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth (II Tim. III). Why, indeed, they do not deserve to be filled with knowledge, unless it is because, not being replenished with the foods of paternal instruction, they gather these for others without judgment?
