And it happened that as the angels went away from them into heaven, the shepherds spoke to one another. Let us go over to Bethlehem and see this word that has happened, which the Lord has made and shown to us. Consider carefully how reasonable are the words of the shepherds, and worthy of the pastors of the Church. For indeed, as if keeping watch, they did not say: Let us see the child, let us see what is said, but: Let us see the word that has happened: In the beginning was the Word, and the Word became flesh (John 1). Let us see the Word that has always been, how it has been made for us, what the Lord has made and shown to us. This Word, it made itself: inasmuch as this very Word is the Lord. Let us see, therefore, how this very Word, that is, the Lord himself, made himself, and showed his flesh to us. For what we could not see while it was the Word, let us see made because it is flesh. It is similar to what John says: What was from the beginning, what we have heard, what we have seen with our eyes, what we have looked upon, and our hands have handled, concerning the word of life, and the life was manifested, and we have seen, and bear witness, and declare to you eternal life which was with the Father, and appeared to us (1 John 1).
