But with everyone denying it, Peter and those who were with him said: "Master, the crowds are pressing on you and afflicting you, and you say, 'Who touched me?'" The crowds press on all sides unpredictably, but one believing woman touches the Lord. For one who is afflicted by the various heresies amassed disorderly only seeks the one with a faithful heart of the Catholic Church. For, just as some see but do not see, and hear but do not hear, so too, those who touch do not touch, who do not faithfully touch Christ. Hence, to a certain one who loves indeed but who has not yet fully believed, he says: "Do not touch me, for I have not yet ascended to my Father" (John XX); clearly teaching what it means to truly touch Him, that is, to believe Him equal to the Father.
