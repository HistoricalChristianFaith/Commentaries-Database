And they gathered at Mizpah, and drew water, etc. The fact that they drew water during prayers and fastings and poured it out before the Lord is a sign and execution of pious devotion. They gathered, as the Lord was preaching, to hear the word of the people, and being deeply moved, they drew from the bottom of their hearts a fountain of tears, which they would pour out as the most pleasing libation to God, offering it through the vessels of their eyes; and they abstained from all the allurements of the world, in that light of heavenly grace, confessing past sins and imploring the mercy of Christ.

And Samuel judged the children of Israel at Mizpah. The heavens are not clean in his sight (Job XV), and he finds perversity in his elect. Therefore, those too who, transcending all earthly things, gathered at the lookout of heavenly things, which Mizpah signifies, to Christ, who pre-eminent by the name of the sons of Israel, that is, men seeing God, still have much for which, as men, they may be chastised by a strict judge. Whence Isaiah says: And he shall judge the poor in righteousness (Isa. XI). There is no doubt that he speaks to those to whom he says: Blessed are the poor, for yours is the kingdom of God (Matt. V); for judging the same, he says: Are you still without understanding? (Matt. XV).
