Among all the other things which were revealed to the prophets was the message that the fulfillment which they desired would not occur in their time but in yours, for you have been born at the end of the ages. Peter tells his hearers this so that they will value their salvation, knowing that the prophets and righteous people who lived before them were so eager to be on earth when it arrived.
