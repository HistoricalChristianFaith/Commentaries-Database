A wise king scatters the wicked, etc. It was the custom of the ancients, when victory was achieved over an enemy, to erect arches for themselves in which they described the praises of their virtues, as we read in the work of Saul. Therefore, our Lord the King not only destroys the malice of the wicked, but also perpetually celebrates the great glory of the same triumph with His elect. Another translation has this verse thus: A wise king winnows the wicked, and will bring upon them the wheel of evils, that is, a punishment to be consumed with no end. To which wheel namely is contrary the crown of eternal life, which God has promised to those who love Him.
