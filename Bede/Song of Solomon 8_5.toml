Who is this who ascends from the desert, etc.? But the Church of the gentiles ascends from the desert, because she who had been abandoned by her Creator for a very long time, now advancing with steps of faith and good works, has reached His grace, fulfilling the prophecy of Isaiah, where he says, "The wilderness and the solitary place shall be glad; and the desert shall rejoice, and blossom as the rose" (Isaiah 35). Overflowing with delights, namely those about which the bridegroom above says, "How beautiful and how charming you are, my love, in delights!" that is, in the desires of heavenly life. Leaning on my beloved: rightly leaning on Him, without whose aid she could not only ascend to the heights but could not even rise: for both the advancement of virtues and the very beginnings of faith we can only have by the Lord's granting. Therefore Judea marveled more at this grace of the new conversion of the gentiles, since she believed that only she and those who were received into her rite through the mystery of circumcision belonged to it, as the book of the Acts of the Apostles most openly testifies. Therefore, when she said with admiration, "Who is this who ascends from the desert, overflowing with delights?" she concluded with even greater admiration, leaning on my beloved. "My beloved," she said, meaning, "the one whom I thought loved only me and was unknown to other nations"; to which He, who is our peace, who made both one, and came to preach peace to us who were far off, and peace to those who were near (Ephesians 2), responded, reminding her to remember the grace by which she herself was rescued from gravest evils and brought to the way of truth, and to rejoice in the salvation of others as well, since the author of salvation and life is rich to all who call on Him.

Under the apple tree, I awakened you, etc. The apple tree most aptly symbolizes the wood of the holy cross, on which He deigned to hang for the salvation of all; about which the Church said above in praise, "As an apple tree among the trees of the woods, so is my beloved among the sons." Under the apple tree, therefore, the Lord awakened the Synagogue, which He recalled from eternal death through the faith in His Passion. Under this same tree, His mother and progenitor was also corrupted and violated, namely the major and elder portion of His people. Certainly, she who, seduced by the persuasion of her leaders, chose Barabbas over the Lord, foolishly shouting, "His blood be on us and on our children" (Matthew 27). For she was also under the tree of the cross, not humbly submitting herself to this faith, but stubbornly invoking its vengeance upon her. From whose company separating the people who agreed to believe, the Lord exhorts them to retain in their heart the memory of the grace given to them, and to join works worthy of the faith received. He follows with:
