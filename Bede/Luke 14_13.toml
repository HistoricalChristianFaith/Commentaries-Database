But when you make a banquet, call the poor, the weak, the lame, the blind, and you will be blessed, because they do not have the means to recompense you. For a recompense will be given to you in the resurrection of the just. He speaks of the resurrection of the just, who, although all will rise, it is rightly called their own, who do not doubt they will come to be blessed in this. Therefore, he who calls the poor to a banquet will receive a reward in the future. He who calls friends, brothers, and the wealthy receives his reward. But even if he does this for God's sake in the example of the sons of blessed Job, as other duties of brotherly love, He who commanded it will reward. He who invites gluttons and the luxurious for the sake of wantonness will be punished in the future with eternal penalty.
