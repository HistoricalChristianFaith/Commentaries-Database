But they did not understand this saying, and they were afraid to ask him. This ignorance of the disciples is born not so much from their slowness of mind as from the love of the Savior, who, while still carnal and ignorant of the mystery of the cross, could not believe that he whom they knew as true God would die. And because they were used to hearing him often speak through figures, fearing the event of his death, they wanted to interpret what he spoke plainly about his betrayal and passion as figuratively signifying something else.
