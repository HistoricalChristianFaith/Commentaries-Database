And they came with haste, and found Mary, and Joseph, and the babe lying in a manger. And when they had seen it, they made known abroad the saying which was told them concerning this child. The shepherds hasten to Christ whom they recognize, desiring with all the intent of their mind to see His coming. For Christâ€™s presence is not to be sought with idleness. And therefore, perhaps some seeking are not worthy to find because they seek Christ sluggishly. Therefore these shepherds found Him without delay because they ran to Him with unfeigned faith, to whom hastening to go is not to quicken the steps of the feet, but to advance always in faith and virtue. They found, it says, Mary and Joseph, and the babe lying in a manger. But also the shepherds of the Lord's flock, as they are more frequently and sweetly elevated by the heavenly oracle amid the darkness of this life, so more fervently they approach the sublime life of the preceding fathers, in which the bread of life is always preserved and refreshes, as contemplating they enter the gates of Bethlehem, and they find nothing else in it than the virginal beauty of the Catholic Church, as Mary, the virile company of spiritual teachers, as Joseph, and the humble coming of the Mediator between God and man, the man Jesus Christ, inserted in the pages of Holy Scripture, as a babe lying in a manger, Christ in the first vision they encounter. From the manger of the holy Scriptures that eminent animal and most sacred host was fed, which exultingly proclaimed: The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want; He maketh me to lie down in green pastures (Psalm 23). And a little later: Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies (Ibid.). And when they had seen it, they made known abroad the saying which was told them concerning this child, because it is indeed of just order that, having known, loved, and celebrated with worthy honor the Incarnation of the Word, by the sharpness of a prolonged exercise of the mind more capable, one may eventually attain to behold the glory of the Word Itself.
