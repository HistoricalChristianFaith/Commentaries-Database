A light for revelation to the Gentiles, and for glory to your people Israel. Light indeed for both the peoples, God's salvation, that is, Christ prepared by God the Father. Who is rather the glory of Israel, long hoped for by them, from whom pre-announced he has come, but he is said to be the revelation for the Gentiles, whose eyes of mind sunk in deep blindness and raised by no hope of the Lord's coming, he himself has deigned to visit, reveal, and illuminate alike. And it is well that the revelation of the Gentiles is preferred to the glory of Israel, because when the fullness of the Gentiles has entered, then all Israel will be saved. As the Psalmist also says: The Lord hath made known his salvation; he hath revealed his justice in the sight of the nations (Psalm 97); he joined on and says: He hath remembered his mercy to Jacob, and his truth to the house of Israel (Psalm 98).
