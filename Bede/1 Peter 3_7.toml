What Peter demanded of wives he now demands of husbands as well, for husbands must find out what God wants and give honor to the weaker vessel. If we abstain from intercourse we honor one another, but if we do not abstain, it is obvious that the intercourse, which we have is contrary to the demands of honor. Sexual intercourse is a barrier to prayer, as Paul also implied. This means that whenever I have intercourse I cannot pray. But if we are supposed to pray without ceasing, as Paul also said, it is obvious that I can never have sexual intercourse, because if I do so I shall have to interrupt my prayers.
