The meadows are open, etc. The pastures of the heavenly sacraments, which were long closed by legal types, are now open. The novelty of evangelical truth and grace has appeared; the writings of the old fathers are gathered into the pasture of the Lord's flock; indeed taken from the proud Jews by the sickle of divine retribution, and given to the humble people of the Church for spiritual sustenance; according to what the Lord said to them, The kingdom of God will be taken from you and given to a nation bearing its fruits (Matt. XXI).
