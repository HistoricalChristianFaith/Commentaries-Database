The ninth month is the one that is called Casleu [Chislev] by the Hebrews and December by the Romans. Who does not know that this month comes in the middle of winter and is rainy and surprisingly stormy? Hence we should note all the more carefully that when the people assembled in the middle of winter, it is recorded that they trembled “because of their sin and the rain.” For when they noticed that the rains were pouring down more than was usual even for this wet season, they were brought back to their conscience and understood that this had happened because of their sins and that heavenly wrath was imminent. Admonished by this disturbance of the sky, they grew frightened, and for this reason they had not dared to carry on their business in their own homes but sat down in the courtyard of the Lord’s house and put on penitential and humble garb. This was done as a lesson for those who, even when the elements are stirred up and weather deteriorates into violent winds, floods of rain, heavy snowstorms, parching drought or even the death of people and animals, and when the judge himself threatens the force of his anger through open signs, do not at all seek to correct their behavior so as to placate that judge and escape the destruction hanging over them but instead merely busy themselves to find some means to avoid or overcome the adverse conditions raging outside on account of their sins.
