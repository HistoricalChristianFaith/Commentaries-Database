And when they had completed everything according to the law of the Lord, they returned to Galilee, to their city Nazareth. In this place, Luke omitted what he knew to be sufficiently explained by Matthew, namely that the Lord, after these things, so that he would not be found and killed by Herod, was taken by his parents to Egypt, and after Herodâ€™s death, he thus returned to Galilee, and began to inhabit his city Nazareth. For the evangelists individually are accustomed to omit certain things that they either saw were mentioned by others, or foresaw would be mentioned by others in the spirit, so that in the continuous series of their own narrative, they appear to have omitted nothing. Nevertheless, a diligent reader can find out at what point omissions were made by considering the writing of the other evangelist.
