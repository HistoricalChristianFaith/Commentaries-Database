In his humiliation, his judgment was taken away. Because the judge of all did not find truth in judgment, but, without any fault, was condemned by the clamor of the Jews and the voice of Pilate.

Who shall declare his generation? Either it is to be understood of his divinity that it is impossible to know the mysteries of his divine birth, of which the Father speaks: I have begotten you from the womb before the morning star (Psalm 110); or of the Virgin's birth, which can be explained with difficulty. To Mary, seeking the reason, it is said through the angel: The Holy Spirit will come upon you. So either the angel or the evangelist should declare only the sacraments of his birth, who is a rare narrator.

For his life will be taken from the earth. So that he would live not on earth, but in heaven.
