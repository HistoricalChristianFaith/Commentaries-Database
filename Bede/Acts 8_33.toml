With respect to his divinity, this must be taken to mean that it is impossible to know the mysteries of his divine nativity, about which the Father said, “Before the day star I begot you.” Or, with respect to his virgin birth, it means that with difficulty one can explain that [mystery], the plan of which the angel spoke to Mary in answer to her question when he said, “The Holy Spirit will come upon you.” Hence, whether by angel or by Evangelist, the mysteries of his nativity are said to be so great that there are very few who can expound them.
