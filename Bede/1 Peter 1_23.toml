Born not of corruptible seed, etc. Such is in the Gospel of John: To those who believed in his name, who were born not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God (John 1). Therefore, just as the price of the Lord's passion by which we have been redeemed is incorruptible, so also is the sacrament of the holy font by which we are reborn. These are so interconnected with each other that neither can confer salvation upon us without the other. For indeed, the Lord in the time of His Incarnation redeemed us all together with His holy blood, so that also in our time, individually through the regeneration of baptism, we ought to reach the fellowship of the same regeneration. Of this regeneration, it is well said that it is not of corruptible seed, but through the word of the living and eternal God, so that it is understood hence that just as from corruptible seed is born flesh which is corrupted, so through water consecrated by the word of God, a life that does not know faith is granted to us.
