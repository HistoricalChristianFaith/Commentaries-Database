Just as the gift of the Lordâ€™s passion, by which we have been redeemed, is imperishable, so too is the sacrament of the sacred font  by which we have been born again. The two things are so intimately connected that it is impossible to be saved by one without the other. For just as the Lord, during the time of his incarnation, redeemed us all on a single occasion by the shedding of his blood, so we must now in our time become partakers of that regeneration by being born again through baptism. It is well said of this regeneration that it does not come from corruptible seed but operates by the word of the living and eternal God.
