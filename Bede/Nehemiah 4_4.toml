Hear us, our God, for we are despised. Turn their insult on their own head and cause them to be despised in a land of captivity, and so on. Similar to this is that saying of the psalmist speaking about the enemies of the elect as it were in the form of one wicked man: His sorrow shall be turned on his own head: and his iniquity shall come down upon him?
