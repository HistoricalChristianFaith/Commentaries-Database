The king who sits on the throne of judgment, etc. For although the elect suffer evil in this life from the reprobates, when the day of universal judgment appears, all evils will be dissipated; and the unjust will alone undergo punishment, while the just will be crowned with the Lord. This even now is partially done, when any of the saints departs as a victor from this world, and the persecutor who troubled him receives punishment worthy of his deeds. This verse can also be understood of the elect, who sometimes have hidden evils in their minds that cannot be seen by other men, but the Lord Himself sees them when with the secret gaze of grace He destroys them, as testified by him who said: The Lord turned and looked at Peter, and Peter remembered the word of the Lord, etc. (Luke 22).
