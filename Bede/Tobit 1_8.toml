Tobit shared all he could get every day with captives who were of his own kin, but also he gave tithes to strangers and proselytes. And the people of Israel through their teachers ministered the alms of God’s Word not only to the unlettered audience of their own nation but also to those of the Gentiles who wished to convert to the religious observance of their way of life. For whatever natural good thing they could get that was not confiscated by the enemy who held them captive, they showed it all to their own folk as an instance of virtue. But also they always gave a certain portion of their saving knowledge even to the Gentiles, which explains the significance of Tobit’s assigning a tithe of his property to strangers. - "On Tobit 1.2"
