John is talking here about people who deny the divinity of Christ or who say that he did not have a human soul or did not take on human flesh. But the person who misinterprets the commands and sayings of Jesus in a perverse way also denies him. So, too, does the person who upsets the unity of the church, which Jesus came to gather to himself.â€¦ The antichrist will come on the eve of the day of judgment. He will be a man born in the world but much more wicked than others, in fact the very son of iniquity. He is already in the world, dwelling in the minds of those who have rejected Christ either in word or in deed, to the point that there is no longer any hope for them.
