If Christ was seen on the white cloud as a reaper, who is this vintager, unless he be the Selfsame, the repetition nicely occurring because of the twofold fruit of the church? For he who sowed good seed in his field is also he who planted a vineyard in a fertile place. However, both plantings have come to ruin because of the neglect of the caretakers.
