And bring the fattened calf and kill it. The fattened calf is likewise the Lord, but according to the flesh. And well fattened, because his flesh is so richly endowed with spiritual virtue that it suffices for the salvation of the whole world to send forth a sweet odor, namely the aroma of sacrifice, to God, and to intercede for all. However, to bring the calf and kill it is to preach Christ and to intimate his death. Then indeed it is as if he is freshly killed for each one of us when we believe he was killed. Then his flesh is eaten when the sacrament of his passion is received by the mouth for cleansing, and thought of by the heart for imitation. And let us eat and celebrate, because this my son was dead and has come to life again, he was lost and has been found. Not only the son who comes to life and is found again, but even the father and his servants, are feasted on the sacred flesh of the calf that was slain for the son, because the father's food is our salvation, and the father's joy is the remission of our sins. Nor is it only that of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit. For just as there is one will and operation in the divinity, so too there is one delight of the holy and undivided Trinity. Hence blessed Abraham, receiving three angels as guests, is recorded to have slain a most tender and best calf, and offered it to them to feast with milk, bread, and butter. Because whoever desires to refresh the blessed Trinity with the services of right devotion, that is, to gladden it, ought also to celebrate with the sincerity of a pious confession the death of the only-begotten Son of God in the flesh, who is one person in the same Trinity. And it is to be noted that before the first robe, before the ring, before the shoes are granted, thus afterward the calf is sacrificed, because unless each person puts on the hope of the first immortality, unless he fortifies himself with the works of faith with a ring, unless he preaches the same faith by piously confessing it, he cannot partake in the heavenly Sacraments.
