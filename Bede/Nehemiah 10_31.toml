The peoples of the land, who bring goods for sale, etc. And for us, the Sabbath is always to be kept spiritually, always to abstain from servile work, that is, from sin, always to be free and to see that the Lord himself is God, so that after such a Sabbath, freed from the sins of conscience, we may reach the Sabbath of future glory in the heavens. But the peoples of the land seek to profane our Sabbath by bringing goods for sale to us on the sanctified day; because unclean spirits strive to defile the purity of our hearts, and by the price of our consent, to introduce the temptations of vices to us, so that they may pollute the day of the greatest sanctification; that is, to obscure the light of our pious thought or action with errors that are introduced. But we should avoid such a market, having enclosed ourselves within the walls of our city, which is the custody of a more perfect life.
