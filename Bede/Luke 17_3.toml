But we must mark, that Hedoes not bid us forgive every one who sins, but him only who repents of his sins. For bytaking this course we may avoid offenses, hurting no one, correcting the sinner with arighteous zeal, extending the bowels of mercy to the penitent.
By using the number seven He assigns no bound to the giving of pardon, but commands us either to forgive all sins, or always to forgive the penitent. For by seven the whole of any thing or time is frequently represented.
