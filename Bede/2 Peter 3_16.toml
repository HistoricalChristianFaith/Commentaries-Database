The heretics corrupt every part of Scripture. There is no book in either the Old or the New Testament which they have not perverted according to their own fantasies, by adding to it, subtracting from it or altering something which it says to make it mean something else. Those whom Peter calls unlearned and unstable are the people who have neither the light of knowledge nor the steadfastness of mind to stay in the company of the learned until they are properly instructed. For the only cure for the unlearned is to listen in all humility to the words of those who know better. The heretics do not have this humility, with the result that they are tossed about by the wind like chaff and are swept right out of the church. But those who try to corrupt the holy Scriptures and pervert the catholic faith do nothing other than condemn themselves.
