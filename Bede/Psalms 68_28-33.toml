“Arise and go to the south.” It is well that it was in the south that this man33 was sought, found and washed clean. Burning with devotion in his breast, he deserved to be consecrated to God as, so to speak, the firstfruits of the Gentiles. In him especially was fulfilled that saying of the psalmist, “Ethiopia will stretch out its hands to God.”
