And the Lord added to call Samuel again, etc. Let us not tire of repeating in our discussions what neither the Lord tired of saying, nor the historian of repeating in writing. God the Father calls God the Son, not as a man calls another man, by moving the air with words from one place to another; but showing Him, always remaining in His invisible presence, even when He bore man on earth through visible signs. And since Samuel means "God" or "name of God," we might rightly say that the Lord called Samuel when the Father demonstrated His incarnate Son with miracles as the true God, and he responded, "Here I am." To whom the same Son said: "I am in the Father, and the Father is in me" (John 14).

And he said, "Here I am," etc. Let the diligent reader note that the same allegorical interpretation is not always the same as the order of historical truth but alternates in a similar, unequal, or contrary manner. In a similar way, indeed, Samuel's simple youth and Eli's sluggish blindness signify the humility of the Lord Savior and the stubborn foolishness of the Jews. Unequally, however, the dubious words of Samuel saying, "Here I am, for you called me," prefigure the true and certain incarnation of Christ. Contrarily, as lower, David's sin in the matter of Uriah suggests the merciful grace of Christ, by which He condescended to save the nations.
