And being in agony, He prayed more earnestly. What would He who granted celestial things with power on earth, pray for Himself in agony? But as death approached, He expressed in Himself the struggle of our mind, we who suffer a certain force of terror and dread when we approach eternal judgment through the dissolution of the flesh. For then, no soul is unreasonably terrified when it finds, after this brief time, that which it cannot change forever.

And His sweat became like drops of blood falling to the ground. Let no one ascribe this sweat to weakness, for it is against nature to sweat blood. Nor can it in any way pertain to the heresy of weakness, which serves against the heresy lying of a phantom, towards the truth of the body by means of blood sweat. Rather, let him understand by the earth irrigated and sanctified with His blood, that it was declared openly for us, not for Himself who already knew, that He had achieved the result of His prayer, that is, to purify with His blood the faith of His disciples, which earthly frailty still accused, and whatever scandal they had borne about His death, He would erase entirely by dying Himself, and even more, with His innocent death, He would resurrect the entire vast world of the earth dead in sins to heavenly life.
