flying: As he had described the doubtful and varied fight of the Church with the dragon, as she is a sojourner in the age, it remains to assign a due recompence to both the combatants, and show what punishments await the bad, or what rewards the good. So, then, the preacher who runs hither and thither through the midst of the Church, carries with him the Gospel of eternal kingdom.

Since he had described the anticipated and diverse battles that the church in the world wages against the dragon, it remains now to assign to either army the appropriate prize, showing what penalty will follow those who are evil and what reward will follow those who are good. For this reason, the preacher who runs about within the church carries the gospel of the eternal kingdom.… It is appropriate that those who are lifted up by celestial flight should also, through preaching, lift their earthly minds from the place of their [present] sluggishness.… “This gospel,” it says, “will be preached throughout the whole world, and then the end will come.”
