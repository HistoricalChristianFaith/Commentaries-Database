And he said to him: "Rise, go; your faith has made you well." He who devoutly fell before the Lord is commanded to rise and go, because he who, subtly recognizing his infirmity, humbly lies down, is ordered to rise through the consolation of the divine word to strong deeds, and with increasing merits daily to advance to more perfect things everywhere. But if faith made him well who bent down to give thanks to his Savior and cleanser, then disbelief destroyed those who neglected to give glory to God for received benefits. Therefore, this reading is linked with the previous one by that reason, that there it is determined through the given parable that faith ought to be increased by humility, but here it is more clearly shown by actual events, not only that faith recognized the rationale, but that the executed operation of faith is what makes the believer well and gives glory to the Father who is in heaven.
