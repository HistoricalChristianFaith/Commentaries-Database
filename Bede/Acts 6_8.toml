Stephen, full of grace and strength, performed great wonders and signs among the people. But some from the synagogue, which was called the Synagogue of the Freedmen, etc., arose. Stephen, in Greek, is called Crowned in Latin. He anticipated in his name the reality of being crowned, humbly stoned, but sublimely crowned. In Hebrew, it is interpreted as your norm. Whose? Namely, of the subsequent martyrs, of whom he was the first to suffer, setting the example of dying for Christ.

Stephen, full of grace and power, was performing great wonders and signs among the people. In Greek it is added: In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. I wrote in the previous book that Stephen is interpreted as "crowned," and it is not far from the truth what I wrote. But learning more diligently, I found that Stephen in Greek signifies not "crowned," but "crown." For this name is of the masculine gender among them, and thus appropriate for a man; however, the term for "crowned" is στεφανηφόρον, as if, "bearing a crown." Indeed, in the psalm where we sing: You will bless the crown of the year with your goodness (Psalm 64), that verse begins among the Greeks as εὐλογήσεις τὸν στέφανον. Expounding beautifully on the mystery of this name, Eusebius says: "Immediately, after his ordination, he was stoned by those who also killed the Lord, whereby a crown is given to Stephen by Christ in accordance with his name." The term for "crown" in Greek is also in the neuter gender στέμμα. I thought this worth noting, because we often find this name included even in Latin books.
