Which of you, having a servant plowing or tending sheep. This parable teaches that faith, the more excellent it is outwardly in virtues, should become all the more humble within in conscience. For a servant plowing or tending sheep is understood as any teacher of the Church. About whom the Lord said: No one who puts his hand to the plow and looks back is fit for the kingdom of God. And to another who testified his love for Him, He responded for the third time: Feed my sheep.

Who, when he returns from the field, would immediately say to him, "Come along, sit down," and would not say to him, "Prepare what I may eat"? The servant returns from the field when, after pausing from the work of preaching for a time, the teacher returns to his conscience, and, retreating from public speaking to the court of his heart, privately reviews his acts or words with himself. To whom the Lord does not immediately say, "Come along, sit down," that is, "pass from this mortal life, and be refreshed in the blessed abode of eternal life." For He will say this later, but in the meantime, after the shepherding and farming, He orders him to prepare what he may eat at home, that is, to display the labor of open speech, as well as the humility of self-reflection. For the Lord deigns to enter such a temple of conscience and desires to partake most willingly of such a meal. For behold, He says, I stand at the door and knock, if anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in to him and dine with him, and he with me (Apoc. III).
