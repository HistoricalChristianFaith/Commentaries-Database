"Blessed is the man who is always fearful," etc. The wrath of the upcoming judgment will then be so much stricter as it is now scarcely feared amidst sins. Hence, it is said elsewhere, "In the day of prosperity, do not be unmindful of adversity; and in the day of adversity, do not be unmindful of prosperity" (Ecclesiasticus 11). Thus, both should be joined so that one always supports the other.
