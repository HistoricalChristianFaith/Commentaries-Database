It was about the sixth hour, and darkness came over all the land until the ninth hour, and the sun was obscured. The brightest light of the world withdrew its rays so that it might not see the Lord hanging, or that the impious blaspheming might not enjoy its light. And it is to be noted that the Lord was crucified at the sixth hour, that is, when the sun was about to leave the center of the world; and at dawn, that is, when the sun was already rising, he celebrated the mysteries of his resurrection. For the time signifies what he exhibited by the effect of the work. Because he died for our sins and rose for our justification (Rom. IV). For when Adam sinned, it is written that he heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden at the breeze after midday (Gen. III). After midday, indeed, with the light of faith declining, and at the breeze, with the warmth of charity cooling: he was heard walking because he had withdrawn from the sinning man. The order of reason therefore required that at the same time of the day at which he then closed for sinning Adam, now the Lord should open the gate of paradise to the repenting thief.
