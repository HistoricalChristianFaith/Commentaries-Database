And when he dismissed them, he went into the mountain to pray. Not everyone who prays ascends into the mountain; for there is prayer that commits sin. But he who prays well, who seeks God by praying, this one, progressing from earthly things to higher things, ascends the summit of higher care. However, he who prays concerned about riches, or worldly honor, or certainly the death of an enemy, lying in the lowest parts himself, sends vile prayers to God. The Lord, however, prays not to petition for himself, but to intercede for me. For although he has placed all things in the power of his Son; nevertheless, the Son, to fulfill the form of a man, thinks it proper to petition the Father for us, because he is our advocate. For the Apostle says, “We have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ” (1 John 2). If he is an advocate, he ought to intervene for my sins. Therefore, he prays not as weak, but as pious. Do you want to know that he can do all things he wills? He is both advocate and judge. In one is the duty of piety, in the other is the insignia of power.
