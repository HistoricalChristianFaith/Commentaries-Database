Just as agreement among good people is always beneficial, so agreement among evil people is always harmful to the good. Hence, the apostle attempted to cause dissension among his persecutors, so that they might in their division release the man whom in their agreement they had bound. So it was that the Red Sea, which when it was whole had blocked the passage of the sons of Israel, freed them from Egypt when it was divided. This is why [Paul] testified that he was “the son of Pharisees” (or, according to the Greek, “the son of a Pharisee”), which is what he gloried in above, [and] that he learned the prophets and the law at the feet of Gamaliel, who, as we read, was a Pharisee.
