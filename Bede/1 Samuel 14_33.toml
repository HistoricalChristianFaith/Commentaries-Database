They reported to Saul, saying that the people had sinned against the Lord, etc. The diligent leaders, knowing the negligence of idle teachers, wherein the people sin against the Lord, baptizing those who have not yet been purified from carnality nor fully instructed in faith, immediately rebuke such transgressors and command that the rule of heavenly life be openly proposed with Catholic authority; and they order the idle teachers, who had so far been vexed by common ignorance, to lead all those they have undertaken to instruct up to the model of life which they themselves had learned from their forefathers, and by catechizing them according to the most robust example of Catholic perfection, bring to an end their former way of life inherited from their fathers, and by baptizing, incorporate them into the members of the Church. Thus, they would no longer sin against the Lord, binding those who are ignorant of faith and heavenly life to the unity of His body, that is, the Church of Christ. Understand that the ox and the ram delivered from the Philistines, slaughtered and eaten by the people of God upon the intellectual rock, symbolize any foolish and arrogant person, renewed from deadly custom into spiritual life; as also mentioned above, sheep and calves together with the oxen taken from them signify movements of soul or flesh devoted to irrationality and lust, but saved through the Lord.
