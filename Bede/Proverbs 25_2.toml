The glory of the Lord, to conceal the word, etc. The glory of the Lord is more to show himself in the flesh of his humanity than in his divinity to the eyes of mortals, and to confess himself rather through the miracles of his works and mystical words, than through open assertions, the Word, that is, the Son of God. Hence, much more often in the Gospel he was accustomed to call himself the Son of Man rather than the Son of God. And the glory of his faithful disciples is to diligently investigate his word; by which, even when he does not say it openly, he mystically signifies God. Such as that, I and the Father are one (John X), and other such things. Finally, concealing the eternity of the word, and pretending the weakness of the flesh, he said: Who do men say that the Son of Man is (Matt. XVI)? To which the excellent of kings, having investigated his word, which he had often heard before, replied: You are the Christ, the Son of the living God (ibid.). Nor did he gain little glory from this investigation; for he immediately heard: Blessed are you, Simon Bar-Jona, and the rest (ibid.).
