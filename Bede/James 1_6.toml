The believer must present himself to God, by his exemplary life, in such a way as to appear to be worthy of being heard by him. For whoever knows that he has not kept the Lord’s commandments will quite rightly have no hope of being heard by him. As Scripture says: “If one turns away his ear from hearing the law, even his prayer is an abomination.”
