And after six days Jesus took Peter and James and John, and led them up into a high mountain apart by themselves, and he was transfigured before them. In the Gospel of Luke it is written thus: "And it came to pass about eight days after these sayings, he took Peter and John and James, and went up into a mountain to pray" (Luke IX). and so forth: But on the eighth day the Lord revealed to the disciples the glory of the promised future blessedness, so that by showing the sweetness of the heavenly life, he might refresh the hearts of all who could hear this, and by the number of eight days, he might teach that true joy of the resurrection would come at the due time. For on the eighth day, that is, after the sixth day of the Sabbath on which he ascended the cross, and the seventh day of the Sabbath on which he rested in the sepulcher, he rose from the dead, and we, after the six ages of this world in which we rejoice to suffer and labor for the Lord, and the seventh day of the Sabbath of souls, which in the meantime is carried on in another life, will rise again in the eighth age. For what Matthew and Mark say, that the Lord was transfigured after six days, they do not differ either in the order of time or in the reason of the mystery from Luke, who says eight days, because they only include the days in between, hence they recount absolutely that it happened after six days. He adds both the first day on which the Lord promised this, and the last day on which he fulfilled his promise. And so more temperately he states about eight days. And in the mystical reasoning there, it is significant for the saints to rest from all labor after the six ages of the world, but here it signifies that they will rise again at the eighth time. Hence the sixth psalm is beautifully inscribed for the octave, with the beginning: "O Lord, rebuke me not in your anger," because indeed through the six ages when it is allowed to work, one must persist in prayers, lest in the eighth time of retribution we be rebuked by an angry judge. Therefore the Lord himself wanted to teach us in this place by showing the example of his prayer, which according to Luke, says he went up into the mountain to pray. For he went up into the mountain to pray and was transfigured in such a way to show that those who expect the fruit of the resurrection, who desire to see the king in his beauty, should dwell in the heights of mind, and be devoted to continuous prayers. He takes only three disciples with him either because many are called, but few are chosen (Matt. XX), or because those who now preserve with incorrupt mind the faith they have received in the Holy Trinity, will then deserve to rejoice in his eternal vision.
