The city of this age is compared with an unstable millstone because of the weight and error of sins. For “the wicked walk in a circle.” [Babylon] is rightly swallowed up by the waves of retribution, for its citizens oppressed Jerusalem with the waves of infidelity when, sitting by the rivers of Babylon, they bemoaned their absence from the heavenly Zion. For the Lord says that those who cause one to fall are to be punished with a similar punishment. To be sure, the church is also likened to a stone, but one that is stable and firm and withstands the assaults of the tempestuous waves. The millstone may also be understood to represent the crushing of punishments, for even the blessed Ignatius is reported to have said as he was about to suffer, “I am the wheat of God; I am being ground by the teeth of beasts, so that I might be made a pure loaf.” “And the sound of harpers and minstrels, of flute players and trumpeters shall be heard in it no more.” Of the five senses, the text had until now neglected to mentioned the sense of hearing, which will be taken away along with the other senses. It is as though it said, “What is beautiful to the eye, and melodious to the ear, and smooth to the touch, and sweet to the smell and delicious to the taste, all of that will pass away from the world.”
