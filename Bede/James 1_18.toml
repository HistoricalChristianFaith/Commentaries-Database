God has changed us from being children of darkness into being children of light, not because of any merits of ours but by his own will, through the water of regeneration. But lest we should think that by “begetting” us in this way God has made us somehow a part of his own nature, James goes on to add that the result of the divine activity is that we have become “the first fruits of his creatures,” which means that we have been exalted over the rest of creation.
