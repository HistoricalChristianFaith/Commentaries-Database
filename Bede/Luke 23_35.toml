And the rulers mocked him, along with them saying: He saved others, let him save himself if he is the Christ, the chosen one of God. Even unwillingly, the rulers and people of the Jews confess that he saved others. Therefore, your own sentence condemns you. For he who saved others could indeed save himself if he wished. "Let him save himself," they say, "if he is the Christ, the chosen one of God." On the contrary, he did not want to save himself by descending from the cross precisely because he is the chosen one of God. For he, who came to be crucified for us, neglected to save himself by descending from the cross because, along with the other sinners, he also took care to save those who crucified him through dying.
