And they asked him, saying: Prophesy, who is it that struck you? And many other things blaspheming, they said against him. They did these things as a mockery of him, who wished to be regarded as a prophet by the people: but as he himself, who suffers, ordains, all things are done for us, so that as Peter exhorts, having suffered Christ in the flesh, we should arm ourselves with the same thought. And also heretics, or Jews to this day who deny Jesus as God, and evil Catholics, who, by their reproachful deeds, provoking him, do not believe that their thoughts and works of darkness are seen by him, as if mocking him, they say: Prophesy, who is it that struck you?
