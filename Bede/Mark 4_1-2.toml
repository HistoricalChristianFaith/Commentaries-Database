And a great crowd gathered to him, so that he got into a boat and sat in the sea, and the whole crowd was on the land by the sea; and he taught them many things in parables. The fact that a great crowd gathered to the Lord while he was teaching by the sea signifies the multitude of people flocking to the faith of truth through the preaching of the apostles. But the fact that he got into a boat and sat in the sea prefigured the Church to be built among the nations that were unbelieving and contradictory. For it is as if the Lord sits in the boat placed in the middle of the sea, when he enlightens the minds of the faithful, who dwell among the faithful, with the grace of his visitation, and consecrates his beloved dwelling among them. Furthermore, the crowd which was on the land by the sea, listening to the words of the Lord, such that they were neither touched by the waves of the sea nor sitting with him in the boat above the waves, most aptly represents those who have recently gathered to hear the word. Indeed, they are separated by the piety of their minds from the bitterness, obscurity, and instability of the reprobate, but they are still not yet imbued with the heavenly mysteries they desire.
