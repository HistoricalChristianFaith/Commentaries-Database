(I Reg. XXV.) Samuel died, etc. The shadow predicting truth to come waned with the dawning Gospel, nor could the people be removed from the rites of the customary ceremonies without sorrow, which they did not doubt had been established by the institution of the divine law. Hence James, speaking to the apostle Paul, said: “You see, brother, how many thousands of Jews have believed, and they are all zealous for the law” (Acts 21). Yet, as the custom of Judaizing gradually ceased in the Church, just as the prophet's lifeless members were removed from human view, they were laid in their house in Ramah, that is, in a high place; because while the sacraments of the law had ceased to be celebrated outwardly, all began to be sought, understood, and tested inwardly in Christ and the Church. Indeed, the prophet’s house is the church of the believers, and this is situated in that high place, of which it is written: “And the Most High has established her” (Psalm 86). And elsewhere: “For he is exalted” (Isaiah 2).

But David arose and went down to the wilderness of Paran. Paran is interpreted as wild ass, or fruitful, or their fierceness. Therefore, with the type of prophecy ceasing, and with Rama, that is in Christ, as it is said, and the Church fulfilled, Judea being left behind, the truth of faith has deigned to approach the nations long wild and of untamed spirit, but now about to be fruitful with the fruit of justice. And not only because of its wild or fierce name, but also because of its fierce and savage inhabitants, Paran is most fittingly suitable to signify the nations. For Scripture narrates that Ishmael, from whom the Saracens descend, lived in the wilderness of Paran, he concerning whom it is said: "Cast out the bondwoman and her son; for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the free woman" (Gen. XXI). The son of the free woman, that is, the people renewed by spiritual grace, dreading the turbulent neighborhood, complains, saying: "Woe is me, that my sojourning is prolonged, I have dwelt among the tents of Kedar" (Psalm CXIX), and so forth, until the end of the psalm, which describe the Saracens as special adversaries of the Church in a general manner. But so that Christ might call also the sons of the bondwoman, that is, the people serving this world, to freedom, and make them sons of the promise like Isaac, He descended to the wilderness of Paran, that is, the humbled hearts of the Gentiles, and infused them with the grace of His mercy.
