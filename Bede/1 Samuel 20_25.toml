And the place of David appeared empty, etc. To unbelievers, the place of Christ appears empty in the Scriptures; because although they recount the entire series of the Old Testament, they do not deserve to find Him whom the learned scribe in the kingdom of heaven knows to find nearly everywhere in the divine pages. Thus Saul, as a type of the Jews, sitting to eat the bread of Scripture, cannot have Christ present, whom he had driven from his table by hating Him. But Cleophas, with his companion, although not yet fully recognizing Him, but already loving Him, invited Him to the table; and therefore immediately recognized Him in the breaking of the bread (Luke XXIV). We also do both today while reading, as some, perverse, try to turn even clear sayings about Christ to something else; others, piously and soberly seeking Christ in the dishes of divine letters presented, begin to have Him present, though not immediately recognized, until He Himself gradually reveals to us what was previously closed mysteries, as if we recognize Him in the offering of bread which He broke for us. Yet not all who in the Scriptures they read, cannot understand Christ, can immediately also stir up questions or persecutions against Christ; because the human mind is accustomed to gradually decline into vices just as it progresses in virtues.
