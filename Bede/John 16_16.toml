Since he spoke these words on the night on which he was betrayed, it was “a little while,” that is, the [remaining] time of that same night and that of the following day, until the hour [came] when they would begin not to see him. For he was arrested on that night by the Jews, and he was crucified the next day when it was late. He was taken down from the cross and shut off from human sight within the confines of the sepulcher. “And again” it was “a little while” until they saw him again, for he rose from the dead on the third day and appeared to them with many proofs throughout forty days. As to why there had to be “a little while” when they would not see him, “and again a little while” and they would see him, he added the reason, saying, “Because I am going to the Father,” as if he were saying unmistakably, “After a little while I am going to be hidden from your sight within the closed space of the grave, and again after a little while I am going to appear for you to look at, after the sovereignty of death has been destroyed. This is so that I may now return to the Father, since the divinely arranged plan of my taking mortality on myself has been fulfilled, together with the triumph of my resurrection.”
