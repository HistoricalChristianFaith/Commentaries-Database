He said, A little while, and you shall not see Me alluding to His going tobe taken that night by the Jews, His crucifixion the next morning, and burial in the evening, which withdrew Him from all human sight.
Nor should it appear strange, ifone who departs from this life is said to be born. For as a man is said to be born when he comes out of his motherâ€™s womb into the light of day, so may he be said to be born who from out of the prison of the body, is raised to the light eternal. Whence the festivals of the saints, which are the days on which they died, are called their birthdays.
