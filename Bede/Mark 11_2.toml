Say to the daughter of Zion, “Behold, your king will come to you, gentle, and sitting upon a donkey, and its foal, the offspring of a beast of burden.” The daughter of Zion is the church of the faithful, a figure of the heavenly Jerusalem, which is the mother of us all, of which there then existed a sizeable group among the people of Israel. They had a king who was gentle, for it was not God’s pleasure to give an earthly kingdom to the powerful, but a heavenly kingdom to the gentle.
