Just as it is natural for dumb animals to be led into a trap in their search for food, so the heretics, like such animals, have spurned the pure and holy doctrine of the whole church in order to satisfy their corrupt appetites. Church history tells us that there were many such groups in apostolic times, like the Simonians, the Menandrians, the Basilidians, the Nicolaitans, the Ebionites, the Marcionites, the Cerdonians, and so on.
