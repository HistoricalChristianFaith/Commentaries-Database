To deliver you from the strange woman, etc. This verse depends on what was said earlier, where it was said, Prudence will watch over you. And the meaning is, Prudence will watch over you, to deliver you from the strange woman. Therefore, because previously Solomon admonished his hearer, whom he strives to teach wisdom, not to join thieves or run with them if he sees a thief, but to walk uprightly and simply, he now advises not to share their portion with adulterers. Of whom what was said before, To deliver you from the evil way and from the man who speaks perversely, can also be specifically understood; for what speech is more perverse than to persuade to debauchery? This chapter begins from the place where it says: My son, if you receive my words and hide my commandments with you. However, through the strange woman, the depravity of heretics, alien to the members of Christ and the Church, can be understood, which usually deceives the hearts of the innocent by the softness of persuasion and the blandishments of the tongue. From whence the Psalmist: They have sharpened their tongues like a serpent; the poison of asps is under their lips.
