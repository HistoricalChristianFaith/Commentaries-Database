The lips of the wise spread knowledge, etc. The lips of the Catholics spread knowledge of correct faith by preaching, while the heart of heretics will be different, because it conceives betrayal as knowledge to teach. It can also be understood that the heart of the devoted will be unlike itself, showing itself inconstantly variable with different thoughts, and never remaining what it was. Against this, it is said of Anna when she prayed to the Lord with an attentive mind: And her countenance was no longer changed (1 Sam. I, 18).
