This animal, which is very shrewd with respect to deceit and craftiness, represents the Jews, Gentiles and heretics, who are always plotting against the church of God, and, as it were, continuously making a racket with their babbling voices. Concerning them the command is given to the guardians of the church: “Catch for us the tiny foxes which are wrecking the vineyards.” - "Commentary on the Acts of the Apostles 19.14"
