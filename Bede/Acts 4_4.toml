If we take the five thousand men fed by the Lord in the wilderness as [standing for] the people established under the law, but created anew by Christ’s favor, they and this five thousand, who were instructed by the teaching of the apostles, can designate the people of the nations who would spiritually follow the mysteries of the same law. Also it was well done that both [groups of five thousand] were granted their heavenly favor in the evening, for when “the fullness of time came God sent his Son.”
