He will kiss the lips, etc. The kiss is a sign of peace and love. Therefore, he who answers correctly will kiss the lips, because whoever follows the words of justice alone, neglecting the acceptance of persons, though he may seem harsh and severe to the unwise, will yet find many prudent people with whom he has peace; many who embrace his sayings with love. Often, too, he will receive as friends and companions those whom he had endured as opponents to his right assertions, but who are afterwards converted to better things.
