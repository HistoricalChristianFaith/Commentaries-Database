She called on the name of the Lord who spoke to her: "You are the God who sees me." For she said, "Surely here I have seen the back of the one who sees me," therefore she called that well, "The well of the living one who sees me." It is clear from these words that Hagar could not see the face of the angel speaking with her, but only the back as he was departing; nevertheless, she recognized that she had seen him showing mercy and that he was living, that is, that he was truly God, or had come to her in the presence of the living God. The woman's wisdom is remarkable, or rather not remarkable at all, since she belonged to Abraham's household, in naming the well, by which she was comforted by the divine oracle, after that same God's name; as if clearly understanding that the well signified the deep divine dispensations by which He showed mercy to her affliction, commanded her to return to her mistress, and foretold that her offspring would be great; and just as in that well or fountain, as mentioned above, she saw living and perpetual water, so she understood the depth of the divine substance as always living and enduring without end or beginning, and rightly believed the well should be named after it. In correspondence with this figure, the Psalmist, having said: "As the deer longs for the streams of water, so my soul longs for you, O God" (Psal. 41:2); immediately added: "My soul thirsts for the living God." So that we might understand that just as the fountains have living and unfailing water, so God maintains an enduring life within himself. It is also noteworthy that Hagarâ€™s well between the wilderness of Kadesh and Bered is still shown today, and rightly so; as a testimony of her faith and confession.
