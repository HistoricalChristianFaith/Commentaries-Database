Nevertheless, I will not utterly cut off every man from you, etc. A place of repentance is not entirely denied to the sons of Aaron, even though they sinned greatly and grievously in the killing of the Lord; but if any of them wish, let them come to the church repentant, partake of the altar of Christ, while the rest remain in the blindness of their perfidy and envy, by the example of whose pious dispensation, even when Eli and his sons perished, not every man was utterly taken away from the altar of the Lord. For even in the days of Saul, Abijah, the grandson of his son Phinehas, is recorded as serving in the priesthood (1 Kings 13).

And a great part of your house will die, etc. A great part of the house of Eli, reaching adulthood, died when, by the betrayal of Doeg the Edomite, eighty-five priests were slaughtered together in the fury of Saul (1 Samuel 22). But even today a great portion of his house, when they come to the years of understanding, lose the rewards of life by the blade of their own perfidy.
