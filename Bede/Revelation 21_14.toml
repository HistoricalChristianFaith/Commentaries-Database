By “foundations” the patriarchs can be designated, for in themselves, that is, by way of figure they entail the persons of the apostles. This city was founded through [the patriarchs], although it is through the apostles, as though through gates more wide, that the city is open to the nations that are going to believe. It should also be noted that when “foundation” is used in the plural, it means either the teachers of the church or its virtues. However, when “foundation” is used in the singular, it signifies the Lord himself, who is the foundation of foundations.
