And behold, two men were speaking with him. They were Moses and Elias, of whom we read that one died, and the other was taken up into heaven. Unless this signifies the future glory of all the saints with the Lord in majesty, who at the time of judgment will reign with him, either found alive in the flesh or resurrected from death tasted long ago. For as the Apostle testifies, "The dead who are in Christ will rise first, then we who are alive, who are left, will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air, and so we shall always be with the Lord" (1 Thess. IV). Alternatively, Moses and Elias, that is, the lawgiver and the greatest of the prophets, appear and speak with the Lord to show that he is the one whom all the writings of the law and the prophets foretold. They appear, however, not in the lowlands, but on the mountain with him, because only those who seek the divine heights with their minds will perceive the majesty of the holy Scripture fulfilled in the Lord. Consequently, even the Jews saw Moses, but they did not merit to follow him as he ascended to God on the mountain. They see him also when he returned, but not without a veil. They knew Elias, but only Elisha with the sons of the prophets beheld the triumph of his ascent, because many of us read the words of Scripture here and there, but very few understand how lofty it shines in the mysteries of Christ.
