It is evident, and there is no need of a lengthy explanation why he calls this Spirit “the Paraclete,” that is, “the Consoler.” [The Spirit’s] coming consoled and refreshed the hearts of the disciples when [Christ’s] departure had caused them to be sad. But also, when [the Spirit] inspires a hope of pardon and heavenly mercy in any individual believers who are saddened about the commission of sin or are laboring under the ordinary afflictions of this life, he unquestionably relieves them of the anguish of their sorrow by enlightening their minds.
