And they asked him, saying: Why then do the Pharisees and Scribes say that Elijah must come first? It is a tradition of the Pharisees, according to Malachi the prophet, who is the last of the twelve, that Elijah will come before the advent of the Savior and will turn the hearts of the fathers to their children, and the hearts of the children to their fathers, and restore all things to their former state. Therefore, the disciples suppose this transformation of glory they had seen on the mountain to be the fulfillment, and they say: If you have already come in glory, how is it that your forerunner does not appear? Especially because they had seen Elijah depart. But when the scribes add and say that Elijah must come first, by saying first they imply that unless Elijah comes, there is no second advent of the Savior.
