When he had led him, behold, they reclined, etc. Heretics recline on the face of the earth, eating and drinking; whether they read the obscure or the clear Scriptures (for this is the difference between eating and drinking), they always seek not the heavenly things through these, but the earthly, nor can they say with the Apostle: "But our conversation is in heaven" (Philippians 3). And as if they celebrate a feast day for the spoils they had plundered from the land of the Philistines and Judah, regarding their inventions, by which they had taught some pagans to err worse under the pretext of Christ's name, or turned the faithful away from the path of truth, as the best light of knowledge, they joyfully say: "This is the day which the Lord hath made; we will rejoice and be glad in it" (Psalm 118).
