And Zacharias was troubled when he saw, and fear fell upon him. But the angel said to him, etc. The angel comforts the trembling Zacharias, because just as it is of human frailty to be troubled by the vision of a spiritual creature, so it is of angelic kindness to soothe mortals, frightened by its presence, by immediately offering reassurance. On the contrary, it is of demonic ferocity always to shake those who are terrified by their presence with even greater horror, which is better overcome by no other reason than unwavering faith.
