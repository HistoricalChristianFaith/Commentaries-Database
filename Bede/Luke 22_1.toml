Now the feast of unleavened bread, which is called the Passover, was approaching. The Passover, which in Hebrew is called phase, is named not from suffering, as many suppose, but from the transition, because the destroyer, seeing the blood on the doors of the Israelites, passed over and did not strike them, or the Lord Himself, providing help to His people, walked above. The evangelist John, examining the mystery of this word more sublimely, says: "Knowing that Jesus' hour had come that He should pass out of this world to the Father" (John XIII). Here he clearly declares that by the law the day of this festival is mystically called transition because the Lamb of God, who takes away the sins of the world, would either himself be passing from this world on that day or would lead us in a healthful transition as if out of Egyptian bondage. Certainly, according to the letter of the Old Testament, there is this distinction between the Passover and the unleavened bread: the Passover is called the day alone on which the lamb was slain in the evening, that is, the fourteenth moon of the first month. On the fifteenth moon, when they went out of Egypt, the feast of unleavened bread followed. Its feast is established for seven days, that is, until the twenty-first day of the same month, in the evening. Indeed, the Scripture of the Gospel often uses the day of unleavened bread for the Passover and the days of unleavened bread in place of the Passover. For Luke says: "The feast of unleavened bread, which is called the Passover." Again John, when the matter occurred on the first day of unleavened bread, that is the fifteenth moon, says: "And they did not enter into the judgment hall, so that they would not be defiled but might eat the Passover" (John XVIII). Because indeed the day of Passover is commanded to be celebrated with unleavened bread, and we, as if making a perpetual Passover, are always commanded to pass from this world. For having slain the lamb in the evening on one particular day, seven consecutive days of unleavened bread follow. Because Christ Jesus, having once suffered in the flesh for us in the fullness of times, orders us to live through all the time of this age, which is done in seven days, in the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth: always fleeing with earnest effort the desires of the world, as if the snares of Egypt, and admonishing us to undertake a hidden solitude of virtues as if from worldly conversation.
