And looking around at all of them, He said to the man: Stretch out your hand. And he stretched it out, and his hand was restored. The dry hand to be healed is commanded to be stretched out, because the barrenness of an unfruitful soul is cured by nothing better than the generosity of almsgiving. Hence John the Baptist, when asked by the crowds what they should do so as not to be cast into fire like barren trees, only gave this command: He who has two tunics, let him give to him who has none; and he who has food, let him do likewise (Luke 3). And in Ecclesiasticus, it is said: Son, let not your hand be extended to receive, and shut when it should be giving (Ecclesiasticus 4). For in vain does one stretch out his hand to God to pray for sins, who does not extend it to bring benefit to a begging widow.
