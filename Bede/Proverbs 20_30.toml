quote='''
The blueness of a wound cleanses away evil, etc. For when we are struck outwardly, we are silently and afflictedly recalled to the memory of our sins. And through what we suffer outwardly, we grieve more inwardly for what we have done; thus it happens that among the open wounds of the body, the secret wound of the belly cleanses us more, because it heals the wickedness of a depraved work, the hidden wound of sorrow. For indeed the belly is often taken to mean the mind, because just as the belly consumes food, thus the mind by pondering digests cares.
