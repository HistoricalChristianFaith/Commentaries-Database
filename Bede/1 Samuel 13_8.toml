And he waited seven days according to Samuel’s appointed time, etc. The assembly of legal scholars, together with their listeners, waited for the advent of Christ in the flesh throughout the entire time that the Sabbath was observed in the law, knowing that He would come in the last days of legal observance; but as He delayed, so that He might come at the fullness of time which He had predestined, a considerable portion of their listeners, having slipped away, deserted the camp of the spiritual army. And indeed, concerning those who waited well, the prophet says: “But My just one lives by faith” (Habakkuk 2). But concerning those who fell away, he adds: “But if he draws back, My soul shall have no pleasure in him” (Hebrews 10).
