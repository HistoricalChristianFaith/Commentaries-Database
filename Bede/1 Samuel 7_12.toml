And Samuel took a stone, etc. And indeed we read above of the stone of help, which in Hebrew is called Ebenezer; but there the historian anticipated, whereas here he expresses both the time and the cause of the name being given; which, as a clear type of the Mediator, is rightly called one stone, because there is one Lord Jesus Christ, who justifies the circumcision by faith and the uncircumcision through faith; rightly placed between Masphat and Shen, that is, between the place where the altar of the Lord's cross was erected and the singular lamb was offered who takes away the sins of the world, and between it and the place where the victory of the Lord's word could spread throughout the world. That place, most beautifully lying above Bethcar, that is, the house of the lamb or of recognition, because the same Church of Christ shines throughout the entire world. Nor is it by chance that the same place Shen, that is, is said to be named, because the people of the Gentiles, who cry out to the Lord from the ends of the earth, and with Israel they hear: Rejoice, because your names are written in heaven (Luke 10). Of which it is also said elsewhere: And he calls his own sheep by name (John 10). Therefore the Lord took the precious stone, the chosen cornerstone, that is, himself; and set it between the people of the Jews and the Gentiles, who by the powerful help of his Spirit would gather both into one, and miraculously rescued from all adversities, would raise them up to the contemplation of the glory of his divine majesty; to the vision of which, than which nothing is better (for indeed, whatever we who have merited to behold it, seek nothing greater), because we will rejoice in the greatest good, it is said very well: Because the Lord has helped us thus far. Whence also in the Gospel, the Lord, as if promising the highest and incomparable good to the faithful people, says: He who loves me will be loved by my Father, and I will love him and reveal myself to him (John 14).
