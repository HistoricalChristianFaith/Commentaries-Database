Who can say, My heart is clean, I am pure from sin? It should be noted that He does not say, Who can have a clean heart and be pure from sin? But He says, Who can say, My heart is clean, I am pure from sin? Because there are those who, by the grace of God, can have according to human measure the purity of heart and work. Hence the Lord's saying, Blessed are the clean of heart, for they shall see God (Matthew 5); and in the psalm: Who shall ascend into the mountain of the Lord, or who shall stand in His holy place? He that has clean hands and a pure heart (Psalm 23). For if no one has a clean heart, and there is none pure from sin, it would certainly follow that no one would ascend the mountain of the Lord, nor would any man stand in His holy place. But because it is certain that many will ascend the mountain of the Lord, and will stand in His holy place, therefore many must have a clean heart, and according to the measure of human possibility, be pure from sin. Yet no one should rashly declare himself clean of heart and free from sin. For the boasting of one's own praise is foolish; it is rash to glory in one's own innocence or justice.
