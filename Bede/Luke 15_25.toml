But his elder son was in the field. The elder son is the people of Israel who, although he did not go into the distant land, is said not to have stayed at home, but in the field, because the same people neither forsook the Creator to the point of worshipping idols, nor penetrated into the depths of the law they had received, but content with merely the letter of the law, they were accustomed both to work and hope for outward and earthly things, hearing through the prophet: "If you are willing and obedient, you shall eat the good of the land" (Isaiah 1).

And as he came and drew near to the house, he heard music and dancing. The son draws near to the house when those more considerate among the Israelites (for many such were found among them, and often are found) condemn the labor of servile works and from the same Scriptures consider the freedom of the Church. He hears music and dancing, that is, those filled with the Spirit preaching the Gospel with harmonious voices, to whom it was said: "I beseech you, brethren, that you all speak the same thing" (1 Cor. 1), and of those living in harmony, being of one soul and heart in the praises of God.
