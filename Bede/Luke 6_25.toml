Woe to you who are full now, for you shall hunger (Luke 6:25). The rich man clothed in purple was full when he feasted sumptuously every day, but he endured a dire woe when he was hungry and sought a drop of water from the finger of Lazarus, whom he had despised. Another interpretation is that if those who hunger always for the works of justice are blessed, in contrast, those who are pleased with their own desires, suffering no hunger for the true and steadfast good, must be considered unfortunate, thinking themselves blessed if they are not deprived of their pleasure for the moment.

Woe to you who laugh now, for you shall mourn and weep. And Solomon says: "Laughter will be mixed with pain, and the end of joy is sorrow" (Prov. 14). And again: "The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning, but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth" (Eccl. 7). Clearly teaching that foolishness is to be assigned to those laughing, and wisdom, as we have taught above, to those who are always weeping.
