God said to Noah, "Go forth from the ark, you and your wife, your sons and your sons' wives with you; bring out with you all the living creatures that are with you of all flesh, both birds and animals, and every creeping thing that creeps on the earth, so that they may abound on the earth, be fruitful and multiply on the earth." So Noah went out, with his sons and his wife and his sons' wives. In many ways and through many symbols, the mysteries of Christ's Church are often repeated. Thus, Noah's departure from the ark to a land purified by the flood, along with those humans and animals he had brought with him, symbolically corresponds to the time when the faithful, washed in the fountain of baptism, also go forth to perform good works in public, with Christ as their leader, just as spiritual Noah, and immediately grow and multiply through the increase of spiritual virtues. "Go, therefore, into the world," he says, "teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit" (Matthew 28:19); which is figuratively to say: bring into the ark all kinds of living creatures to be washed by the waters; and straightaway, he added: "Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you" (Ibid., 20), as if to say, in a figurative manner: And let the creatures that go out of the ark after the flood enter into a renewed face of the earth, flourishing with new flowers, and there let them multiply and increase. Now, the fact that they leave the ark on the twenty-seventh day of the month, which is a perfect cubical number, as we have previously stated, signifies the perfection of faith consecrated in baptism, which can in no way waver, but remains always invincible and steadfast against all the snares of the devil. Notably, according to the literal sense, they were in the ark for a full solar year, entering it on the seventeenth day of the second month, and emerging after a year on the twenty-seventh day of the same month. For if today, for example, the moon were the seventeenth over the Calends of April, the next year on the day before the same Calends, the moon would be the twenty-seventh, having completed three hundred and sixty-five days, which completes a solar year. Therefore, they were in the ark for a whole yearâ€”that is, until the sun, having traversed the ecliptic circle, illuminated all regions of the world through its twelve months, just as the water covering the entire world washed it clean, so by cooperating over the same period of time, the sun, passing around the whole world, irradiates it with the light of its brightness. Now, just as the Fountain of Life is figuratively called the Lord, so also the Sun of Righteousness. He is called the Fountain because he regenerates; the Sun, because he illuminates us, according to the Psalmist's words: "For with you is the fountain of life; in your light, we see light" (Psalm 35:10). And for a full solar year, Noah was in the ark with those living creatures and humans to be saved through the flood, because the Lord washes his Church throughout the duration of this age, and all regions of the world, with the waters of the saving laver, and enlightens it with the grace of his Spirit.
