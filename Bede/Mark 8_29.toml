“Messiah” in the Hebrew language means “Christ” in Greek; in Latin it is interpreted as “the Anointed One.” Hence “chrisma” in Greek means “anointing” in Latin. The Lord is named Christ, that is, the Anointed One, because, as Peter says, “God has anointed him with the Holy Spirit and with power.” Hence the Psalmist also speaks in his praise, “God, your God, has anointed you with the oil of gladness above your companions.” He calls us his companions since we have also been fully anointed with visible chrism for the reception of the grace of the Holy Spirit in baptism, and we are called “Christians” from Christ’s name.
