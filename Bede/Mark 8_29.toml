“Messiah” in the Hebrew language means “Christ” in Greek; in Latin it is interpreted as “the Anointed One.” Hence “chrisma” in Greek means “anointing” in Latin. The Lord is named Christ, that is, the Anointed One, because, as Peter says, “God has anointed him with the Holy Spirit and with power.” Hence the Psalmist also speaks in his praise, “God, your God, has anointed you with the oil of gladness above your companions.” He calls us his companions since we have also been fully anointed with visible chrism for the reception of the grace of the Holy Spirit in baptism, and we are called “Christians” from Christ’s name.

Then he says to them: But who do you say that I am? Note, prudent reader, from the following text that the apostles are not at all called men, but gods. For when he had said: Who do men say I am, he added: But who do you say that I am? To them who are men giving human opinions, he says: But you, who are gods, who do you think I am?

Peter answered, saying: You are the Christ. Although the other apostles knew, Peter responded before the others. He encompassed everything, expressing both nature and name, in which is the summit of virtues. Do we indeed discuss questions about the generation of God? When Paul indicated knowing nothing except Christ Jesus, and him crucified, and Peter thought nothing more than that Christ should be confessed as the Son of God, do we examine with human frailty when and how he was born, and how great he is? Therefore, the end of my faith is Christ, the end of faith is the Son. I am not permitted to know the sequence of the generation, but I am not permitted to be ignorant of the faith of the generation.
