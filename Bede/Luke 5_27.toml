And after these things, he went out and saw a tax collector named Levi sitting at the tax office, and he said to him: Follow me. The same Levi who is Matthew, but Luke and Mark, out of respect and honor for the evangelist, did not want to use the common name. However, Matthew himself, according to what is written, "A righteous man accuses himself" (Prov. XVIII), at the beginning of his own discourse calls himself Matthew and a tax collector: so that readers understand that no one who has been converted should despair of salvation, since he himself changed suddenly from a tax collector into an apostle, from a toll collector into an evangelist. And leaving everything behind, he arose and followed him. Understanding truly what it means to follow the Lord, Matthew leaves everything and follows him. To follow is to imitate. Therefore, that he might follow poor Christ not so much in step as in affections, he left behind his own goods who used to seize others' property, and giving us the perfect example of renouncing the world, not only did he leave the profits of the tax office, but also disregarded the danger that could come from the rulers of the world, because he had left behind the incomplete and disorganized accounts of the taxes. For he was so driven by the desire to follow the Lord, that he did not retain for himself any regard or thought for this life. Because of this, deservedly, while diligently abandoning human affairs, he earned the reward to be a faithful steward of the Lord's talents.
