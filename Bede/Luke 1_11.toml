It is meant as a token of particular merit, when a man has a name given him or changed by God.
John is therefore interpreted, &#8220;one in whom is grace, or the grace of God;&#8221; by which name it is declared, first, that grace was given to his parents, to whom in their old age a son was to be born, next, to John himself, who was to become great before the Lord; lastly, also to the children of Israel, whom he was to convert to the Lord. Hence it follows, And he shall be a joy to you, and a cause of rejoicing.
