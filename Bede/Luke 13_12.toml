When Jesus saw her, he called her over and said to her, "Woman, you are freed from your infirmity." And he laid his hands on her, and immediately she was made straight, and she glorified God. He saw her through predestined grace, called her through enlightening teaching, laid hands on her with spiritual gifts to help, raised her to glorify God, by promoting her firm in good works until the end. "Those he predestined," says the Apostle, "he also called; those he called, he also justified; those he justified, he also glorified." (Romans 8).
