Samuel said: Gather all Israel to Mizpah, etc. The Savior said to the apostles that by preaching the word of the Gospel, they should gather all spiritual Israel to Mizpah, that is, to the watchtower, namely of the new truth and life. From this gathering of the universal church, the Catholic Church took its name in Greek. Placed in its unity, the Savior himself, praying, commends each to the Father, who before his passion, praying through the apostles, said: But I do not pray for these only, but also for those who will believe in me through their word, that they all might be one (John XVII). And now the Apostle teaches that he does the same, saying: Who is at the right hand of God, who also intercedes for us (Rom. VIII).
