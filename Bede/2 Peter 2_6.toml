The destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah has two sides to it. First of all, the cities were reduced to ashes, and then the Dead Sea was made to go over the ruins, in which nothing can live. If God did that to visible cities, so that they would stand forever afterwards as an example of how he punishes the ungodly, it is clear that fire awaits the wicked in the spiritual realm and that the smoke of their torment will ascend forever.
