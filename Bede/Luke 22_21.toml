Nevertheless, behold the hand of the one betraying me is with me on the table. And indeed, the Son of Man goes as it has been determined, but woe to that man by whom he is betrayed. He who foretold the passion also foretells the betrayer, giving a chance for repentance, so that when he understood that his thoughts and hidden plans were known, he might repent of his deed. Yet he does not specifically designate him, lest, being openly corrected, he might become more shameless. He casts the crime upon a number so that the guilty might secretly repent. He also foretells the punishment, so that those who shame could not conquer might be corrected by the announced penalties. But even today and forever, woe to that man who approaches the Lordâ€™s table wickedly, who, with plots conceived in his mind, who, with a heart polluted by some crime, does not fear to partake in the mysteries of Christ. For indeed, he, in the example of Judas, betrays the Son of Man, not to the sinful Jews, but nevertheless to sinners, to his own members, who dare to violate that inestimable and inviolable body of the Lord. He sells the Lord, who, neglecting his love and fear, is found to love and care more for earthly and perishable things, indeed even for criminal ones. Woe, I say, to that man, of whom Jesus, who during the offering at the holiest altars, as one who is about to consecrate the presented gifts, is not doubted to be present, with the ministers of heaven standing by him, is forced to ask: Behold, he says, the hand of the one betraying me is with me on the table.
