The prophets heard God speaking to them in the secret recesses of their own hearts. They simply conveyed that message by their preaching and writing to Godâ€™s people. They were not like pagan oracles, which distorted the divine message in their own interest, for they did not write their own words but the words of God. For this reason the reader cannot interpret them by himself, because he is liable to depart from the true meaning, but rather he must wait to hear how the One who wrote the words wants them to be understood.
