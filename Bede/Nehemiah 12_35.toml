And of the sons of the priests with trumpets, Zechariah, etc. Indeed, in this life, the sons of the priests play the trumpets at the dedication of the city of God, because they inflame the hearts of the listeners with the memory of the heavenly homeland by preaching, and this is in the vessels of the song of David, the man of God, when, relying not on their own sense or desires, but following in all things the life of the fathers and prophets, they insist on doctrine, the word of preaching. Ezra, the scribe of the law of God, precedes them to the gate of the fountain, as in all that they do, they keep the words of the sacred Scripture before their eyes, by which they may be led to the entrance of eternal life. About this, the Psalmist says to the Lord: They will be filled from the abundance of your house, and you will give them drink from the torrent of your pleasure, for with you is the fountain of life (Psalm 36).
