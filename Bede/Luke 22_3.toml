But Satan entered into Judas surnamed Iscariot, who was one of the twelve. John notes in his Gospel that when the Lord had dipped the bread, he gave it to Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot, and after the morsel, then Satan entered into him. But this does not contradict Luke, who recounts that Satan had already invaded him before the morsel, because the one whom he now entered to deceive, he later entered to possess more fully as one already handed over. Now he entered to tempt as though he were still a stranger, then to drag him, as though already his own, to accomplish any harmful deeds he wished.
