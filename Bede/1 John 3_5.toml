John the Baptist testified of Jesus that he was the Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world. He could do this because there was no sin in him. There are many great people in the world who are respected as if they were perfect, but none of them could take away the sins of the world because none of them could live in the world entirely free of sin. For there is no one who can take away sin apart from the One who has no sin at all himself.
