And Jonathan brought David to Saul, etc. Jonathan speaks well of David to Saul, and is heard, as the apostles preaching about Christ catechize the Jews, gaining their faith. He introduces the same one when, baptizing them, they refresh them with the flesh and blood of Christ, instruct them in the precepts of Christ, and strengthen them with the love of Christ. He becomes before him as he was yesterday and the day before when the listeners of this age received him with the same faith, hope, and charity that those who saw him in the flesh from that people, recognized him as God, or hoped for him to come in the flesh from ages past.
