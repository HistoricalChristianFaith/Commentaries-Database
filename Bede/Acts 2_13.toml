These mockers nevertheless mystically bore witness to truths, for they [the disciples] were not filled with the old wine, which ran short in the marriage of the church, but with the new wine of spiritual grace. For now new wine had come in new skins, since the apostles reechoed the wonderful works of God not “in the oldness of the letter but in the newness of the Spirit.”
