harpers: When all the saints are God's harpers, for &quot;by crucifying the flesh with its vices and lusts&quot; they praise Him on the psaltery and harp; how much more are they who, by the privilege of evangelical chastity, make themselves altogether a perfect sacrifice to the Lord, and who, in a special manner, &quot;deny themselves,&quot; and &quot;take up their cross,&quot; and follow the Lamb whithersoever He goeth?              <a

waters: The loud voice of the saints is the great devotion of love, which he states that he heard from heaven, in saying that they who uttered the voice &quot;stood on Mount Zion.&quot; For he intended to shew that by Mount Zion he meant no other than the Church, which, in order to overcome the grievances of its afflictions, is exalted by the sublime delight of contemplation, and celebrates at once by praise and by imitation the conflicts of her King. For this is in truth to sing unto the Lamb Who stands.
