And how can you say to your brother: Brother, let me cast out the speck from your eye, when you yourself do not see the beam in your own eye? You do this with your brother if (for example), what he sins by anger, you criticize by hatred. And just as a beam is to a speck, so is hatred to anger. For hatred is anger long-standing, which with the passage of time has so grown that it is rightly called a beam. It can happen that if you are angry with a man, you wish him to be corrected. But if you hate a man, you cannot wish him to be corrected. And therefore it is said to be impossible for one to remove the speck from his brother's eye who carries the beam in his own eye.

Hypocrite, first take the beam out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to take the speck out of your brother’s eye. That is, first expel hatred from yourself, and then you will be able to correct the one whom you love. And it is truly necessary and troublesome to beware of the hypocrites, that is, the disguised kind, who take up accusations of all vices with hatred and envy, and also want to seem advisers. And therefore it is necessary to carefully and piously watch so that when necessity begins to blame or reprove someone, we first think whether it is a vice we never had or one from which we have already abstained. And if we never had it, let us think that we too are human, and could have had it. If indeed we had it and do not have it now, let common weakness touch memory, so that the reproof or correction is preceded not by hatred but by mercy. So that whether it works for his correction, for which we do it, or to his confusion (since the outcome is uncertain), we may be secure in the simplicity of our own eye. But if thinking to ourselves we find that we are in the same vice as the one whom we intended to reprove, let us not reprove or correct but rather sigh and invite him to strive together, not so that he conforms to us. Therefore, reproofs should be used rarely and with great necessity, yet in such a way that in these very matters we urge not ourselves but to serve God; for He is the end, to do nothing with a double heart, removing the beam of envy, malice, or disguise from our eye, so that we may see to take the speck out of our brother’s eye.
