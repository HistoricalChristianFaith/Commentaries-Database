That is, obedient and humble; for he who disdains to be made humble, cannot be saved.
But by seed he means not so much those who are begotten in the flesh, as those who have followed the steps of Abraham's faith, to whom the Savior's coming was promised for evermore.

Through all the time of this transitory age, the just and merciful Creator is willing to oppose the proud and give grace to the humble. After her general commemoration of the divine benevolence and justice, she did well to turn the words of her confession to the special divinely arranged plan of the unheardof incarnation, by which God deigned to redeem the world, as she said, “He has taken his child Israel under his protection, being mindful of his mercy.” Indeed, Israel means “a man seeing God,” by which name is designated every society of redeemed human beings. On their account, God himself appeared in visible form among human beings, so that they might be capable of seeing God. He took Israel under his protection as a physician takes a sick person for whom he is caring. Or as a king, he defends the people from the invasion of enemies. Moreover, he returns them to liberty when the enemy has been overthrown and allows them to reign with him perpetually.
