Through all the time of this transitory age, the just and merciful Creator is willing to oppose the proud and give grace to the humble.After her general commemoration of the divine benevolence and justice, she did well to turn the words of her confession to the special divinely arranged plan of the unheard-of incarnation, by which God deigned to redeem the world, as she said, “He has taken his child Israel under his protection, being mindful of his mercy.” Indeed, Israel means “a man seeing God,” by which name is designated every society of redeemed human beings. On their account, God himself appeared in visible form among human beings, so that they might be capable of seeing God. He took Israel under his protection as a physician takes a sick person for whom he is caring. Or as a king, he defends the people from the invasion of enemies. Moreover, he returns them to liberty when the enemy has been overthrown and allows them to reign with him perpetually.

He has taken up Israel, His servant, remembering mercy. He beautifully calls Israel the servant of the Lord, who has been taken up by Him for salvation, namely obedient and humble, as Hosea says: "For Israel is a child, and I loved him" (Hosea XI). For whoever refuses to be humbled cannot indeed be saved, nor say with the Prophet: "Behold, God is my helper, and the Lord is the protector of my soul" (Psalm LIII). But whoever humbles himself like a little child, he is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven (Matthew XVIII).
