And they returned and came to the fountain of Mesphat. This is Kadesh. Mesphat is interpreted as Judgment, hence the ancient translation more plainly says, "they came to the fountain of judgment." However, this is also said by anticipation, since the place received that name much later because the Lord judged the people who had come out of Egypt there.
