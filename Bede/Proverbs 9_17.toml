Stolen waters are sweeter, etc. Wisdom has publicly set forth her table and mixed her wine; but the foolish woman, having nothing pure, gathers whoever she can to stolen waters and hidden bread, because the Catholic Church publicly spreads the feast of the divine words to the world, and has commanded the mysteries of the divinity and humanity of Christ to be celebrated. Or certainly, in the mixed wine, she offers to her listeners the historical and allegorical knowledge together, so that each one, according to his capacity, may be refreshed by the cups of life. But the doctrine of heretics secretly prefers the decrees of its public faith and profession, and when it has nothing spiritual to offer, it boasts of teaching knowledge sweeter than that of the Catholic pastors, so that what is forbidden to be said and believed openly in the Church is more willingly heard and acted upon. And so, ignorance is more sweetly received as it is thought to be knowledge, whose forbidden hearing it steals. The baptism of heretics can be signified in the stolen waters, and their sacrifice in the hidden bread. But literally, it asserts that the adulterous woman in stolen waters and hidden bread asserts that forbidden and illicit unions are sweeter.
