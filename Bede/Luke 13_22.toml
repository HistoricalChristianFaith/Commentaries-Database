However, you say that some are moved to inquire why in the Apocalypse, in the new interpretation, I have assigned Matthew to the lion and Mark to the man; they should have considered, whoever is moved by this, that I did not proclaim this as something new, but as something handed down in the ancient explanation of the fathers. For it did not appear to me from my own insight but I recalled that it had been explained in this way by the blessed Augustine, and I briefly mentioned also from where he affirmed this. It is not without reason that we present his very words, showing what he thought about the evangelists and their typified animals, by which our work may be saved from unjust criticism and this may be confirmed by the authority of such a great doctor.
