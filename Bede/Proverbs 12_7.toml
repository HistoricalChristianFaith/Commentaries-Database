Turn the wicked, and they will be no more, etc. When the wicked depart from this life, they will not be as they were, because after death they find not what they believed, but frustrated in their hope, they receive torments instead of rewards. However, the house of the righteous, that is, the Church, which partly sojourns on earth, partly reigns in heaven, never fails; but whatever members of it pass from here to there, find the joys they hoped for there. Alternatively, Turn the wicked, and they will be no more, because there was much impiety in the gods of the gentiles, much in the sects of heretics, much in the illusions of magicians, much in the persecutions by pagans. But with these being overthrown by the Lord's gift, the memory of their impiety was equally taken away, even the foolish authorities themselves, and the doctrines were seized by fire, as we read was done in Ephesus during the time of the apostles. However, the house of the righteous will remain, because the holy Church could never be hidden or taken away, no length of time prevailed to corrupt any of its Scriptures, nor to violate its faith in any way. It can also be understood thus, Turn the wicked, and they will be no more: turn them from impiety, and they will no longer be wicked, but righteous. For this, another translation says: Wherever the wicked turn, they will be exterminated. To which it is said against them about the saints: For those who love God, all work together for good.
