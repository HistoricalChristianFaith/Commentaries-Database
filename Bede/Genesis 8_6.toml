And when forty days had passed, Noah opened the window of the ark, which he had made, and sent out a raven, etc. We have spoken above about the window of the ark, which, after the flood has subsided, is opened, indicating the secret mysteries of the heavens, to which those baptized are especially initiated; but with these same sacraments some are led to the allurements of the world, others to works of piety; and these indeed are represented by the raven, those by the dove. The fact that forty days are completed by four tens indicates not unreasonably the fulfillment of the divine law, which is perfected by the grace of the gospel. For the law is contained in ten commandments: the doctrine of the gospel is described in four books, and rightly after the beginning of the tenth month, after the appearance of the peaks of the mountains, forty days pass, and so Noah, opening his window, revealed the entry of new light into the ark, because surely Christ revealed to the faithful the future life they are to receive, laid bare the pride of those who, placed outside the Church, boast of worldly glory, and also revealed to His faithful that the precepts of the law should be fulfilled, not by the power of human liberty, but by the gift of evangelical grace, which they deserve to know, as if the window, newly opened in the ark, reveals higher gifts of the heavenly homeland, but the same knowledge of heavenly gifts, as we have said, some use to their ruin, others to salvation; hence it is well said of the raven sent out from the ark.
