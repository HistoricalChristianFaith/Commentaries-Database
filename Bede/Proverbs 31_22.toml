She made herself a striped garment, etc. A striped garment, which is usually made very strong by varied weaving, signifies the strong works of the Church and her diverse ornaments of virtues. Of which the prophet, in the praise of the supreme king, namely that man, sang: "The queen stood at your right hand in a garment of gold, clothed with variety" (Psalm 45). Fine linen and purple are her clothing; fine linen, in the whiteness of pure conscience and conversation; purple, in the shedding of precious blood. For fine linen is of a white color; and purple, made from the blood of a creature called purpura, has the appearance of blood itself: hence it was beautifully said by the Fathers that the Holy Church, blooming with the flowers of the elect, has lilies in peace, and roses in war. Likewise, because fine linen, which grows green from the earth, through long and varied exercises, loses its moisture and native greenness, is brought to the adornment of a white garment. Purple, however, is the royal attire. The Church is clothed with fine linen when the elect chastise their bodies and subject them to servitude; with purple, when they exercise the same continence, not for popular favor, but to acquire the blessedness of the eternal kingdom. But this habit of virtues in the present indeed seems contemptible to the ignorant, but in the future, what it was will be clearly evident. Hence, John beautifully reports in his Apocalypse that he heard the voice of the saints saying, "Let us rejoice and exult, because the marriage of the Lamb has come, and his wife has prepared herself, and it was given to her to be clothed with bright, clean fine linen" (Revelation 19). For fine linen is the righteous acts of the saints.
