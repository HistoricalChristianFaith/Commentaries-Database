And bowing himself, David prostrated on the ground and worshiped. The Savior, with his compassionate heart, bowed down to help and aid earthly and weak hearts, showing through the ministers of His word, He Himself first presented examples of worship and reconciliation with God to those who had already offended Him long ago. He said to the people of the Jews through the heralds of the Gospel: "Why do you listen to the words of human wisdom, of the Scribes and Pharisees speaking: Jesus seeks harm against you; if we let Him go on like this, everyone will believe in Him, and the Romans will come and take away both our place and our nation" (John 11). Behold, at the time of My passion with so many miracles appearing, whoever could truly see, saw in you that the Lord had delivered you into My power, since at a single gentle word of My response when I said, "I am He," such a large armed band fell trembling, and when I was crucified, an unusual darkness covered the whole sky at midday; when I gave up My spirit, the whole earth was moved, rocks were split, tombs were opened, and countless bodies of the dead were raised. Finally, at the appearance of an angel testifying to My resurrection, an immense earthquake occurred, and your guards were stunned and became like the dead. And indeed I thought that if you did not repent, I would destroy you; but patient regard of My compassion spared you, favoring that through penance you might deserve pardon and salvation. For I said: I will not strike completely, nor will I remove from the midst the people, although sinful and hostile to Me, from which I received the form of a servant, in which I would win back the whole world; which in the fathers long ago divine generosity imbued with the blessing of singular grace.
