And responding, he said to them: Do you think that these Galileans were sinners above all other Galileans, because they suffered such things? I tell you, no, but unless you repent, you will all likewise perish. Indeed, those who did not repent similarly perished, because in the fortieth year of the passion of the Lord, the Romans came, identified by Pilate who, as belonging to their nation and kingdom, began from Galilee, whence the preaching of the Lord had commenced, and destroyed so completely the impious nation that not only the courts of the temple where sacrifices were usually offered, but also the inner parts of the house where Galileans had no access, were defiled with human blood. For truly, Pilate, whose name is interpreted as the mouth of a hammerer, symbolizes the devil, always ready to strike, the blood signifies sin, and the sacrifices express good actions, Pilate mingled the blood of the Galileans with their sacrifices, when the devil taints alms, prayers, fasting, and other good deeds of the faithful, either with deadly indulgence of the flesh and blood, or with meditation of hatred, or with the fury of envy, or with the ambition of human praise, or with any other wicked plague, so that although they seem to be offered to the Lord, the crafty adversary makes it so that they benefit nothing to those who offer them, something we wish we did not know happens with us daily.
