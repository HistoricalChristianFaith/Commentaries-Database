I will arise and go to my father and say to him: Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you. How merciful and compassionate a father he knew, who, not offended by his son, does not disdain to hear the word "father." I will arise, therefore, he says, because I have recognized that I lie down. And I will go, because I have departed far away. To my father, because I languish under the prince of swine with miserable destitution: I have sinned, however, against heaven, before the angelic spirits and holy souls, in whom the seat of God is signified. Before you truly, in the inner chamber of conscience, which the eyes of God alone could penetrate.
