Our Lord first did a thing, then taught it: as it is said, Jesus began both to do and to teach. (Acts 1:1)

To know what is good, and not to do it, tendeth not to happiness, but to condemnation; as James saith, To him that knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to him it is sin (James 4:17). Wherefore He adds, If ye know these things, happy are ye if yo do them.
