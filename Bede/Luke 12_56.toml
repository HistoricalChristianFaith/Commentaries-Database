Hypocrites, you know how to interpret the appearance of the earth and the sky. But how is it that you do not know how to interpret this time? We have briefly touched upon what is mystically signified by the cloud and the south wind. But the literal sense is also clear, because those who from the change of elements could easily predict the state of the weather as they wished, could also, if they wanted, understand this time, that is, the first or second coming of the Lord (for he had warned about both) from the words of the prophets, who have clearly indicated both with the most evident signs, either of things or of years. And lest anyone from the crowd perhaps flatter themselves with their ignorance and plead that they, being unlearned and ignorant of the prophetic readings, could not interpret the course of the times, he vigilantly adds.
