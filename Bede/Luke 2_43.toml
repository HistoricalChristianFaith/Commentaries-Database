And his parents did not know. But assuming that he was in the company, they went a day's journey, and sought him among relatives and acquaintances, and not finding him, they returned to Jerusalem searching for him. Someone might ask how the Son of God, reared with such care by his parents, could have been forgotten and left behind as they went away. To this, it must be answered that it was the custom of the sons of Israel that during festive times, whether they converged on Jerusalem or returned to their own places, the men and women would walk separately in choruses, and infants or children could go with either parent indifferently. And thus, the blessed Mary or Joseph might have thought by turns that the boy Jesus, whom they did not see accompanying themselves, had returned with the other parent.
