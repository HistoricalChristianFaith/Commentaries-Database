And he had received a response from the Holy Spirit that he would not see death before he had seen the Lord's Christ; and he came in the Spirit into the temple. Observe the expressions of the Scriptures: he said to see death. How is it seen, and with what eyes, that thing which, upon coming, closes the very eyes so that they may see nothing? But to see death signifies to experience it. And very fortunate is he who will see the death of the flesh, whoever first strives to see the Lord's Christ with the eyes of the heart, having his conversation in the heavenly Jerusalem, frequently visiting the thresholds of God's temple, that is, by following the pious examples of the saints in whom the Lord dwells, yearning with the Psalmist: One thing I have asked of the Lord; this will I seek after: that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life, that I may behold the Lord's delight (Psalm 26). For thus he will also be worthy to receive in his hands the word of God, and to embrace it with the arms of his faith and charity. But when he says: And he came in the Spirit into the temple, it signifies that through the same grace of the Spirit by which he had previously known beforehand that he would come, he also now recognized that he himself was coming and was now about to see the Savior.
