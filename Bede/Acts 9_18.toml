Every dragon’s body is said to be covered with scales. Therefore, because the Jews were called “serpents and a brood of vipers,” this man, who had been an eager follower of their lack of faith, covered over the eyes of his heart, so to speak, with a serpent’s skin. With the falling of the scales from his eyes under the hands of Ananias, however, his face showed that he had received the true light in his mind.
