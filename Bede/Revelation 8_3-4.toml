He “stood before the altar,” that is, he appeared in the sight of the church. He was himself made the censer, from which God received the smell of sweet savor and became more favorable toward the world. Another version reads “upon the altar,” because for us he offered to the Father upon the altar of the cross his own golden censer, namely, his own sinless body conceived by the Holy Spirit.… When Christ offered himself to the Lord as an agreeable and acceptable sacrifice, he made the sorrow of the hearts of the saints acceptable, which arising from the fire within elicits tears, as is usual with smoke.
