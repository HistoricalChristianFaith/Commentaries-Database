John stood, because hehad ascended that citadel of all excellences, from which no temptations could cast him down: his disciples stood with him, as stout-hearted followers of their master.
The Lamb therefore he calls Him; for that He was about to give us freely His fleece, that wemight make of it a wedding garment; i.e. would leave us an example of life, by which we should be warmed into love.
The walking of Jesus has a reference to the  economy of the Incarnation, by means of which He has condescended to come to us, and give us a pattern of life.
