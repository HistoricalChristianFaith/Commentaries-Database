And he put his hand into his bag, etc. We said above that the pastoral bag represents the hearts of the shepherds, who cling intimately to the side of Christ. Why then should not more rightly the conscience or soul of the highest and singularly good shepherd be called the pastoral bag? It contains five most clear stones, strong enough to overthrow the enemy: for it holds the purest knowledge of divine law, by which all error is conquered: whose fullness is expressed in one stone, and its breadth is spread in five books, which Christ alone could perfectly know and fulfill. Putting his hand into this bag, he took one of the five stones he had placed there, arming himself with one of the five books of Moses, of which he was the author and fulfiller, that is Deuteronomy, he used it as testimony to repel the ancient enemy's temptations. Moreover, he taught us, instructed by the Holy Scriptures, to overcome the snares of the same enemy through the unity of faith and charity. And he skillfully threw with the sling; for by the spiritual sense of the Scriptures, which we showed above as triple, he broke the pride of the enemy and gave us spiritual understanding as weapons against him. And he skillfully struck the Philistine on the forehead, because the very audacity of his presumption felled the devil: from the very show of his profession, he proved the worshippers of perverse doctrines to be foolish. For just as the hand indicates the strength of operations, so the forehead indicates the recognition of profession. Therefore, whoever fears being struck on the forehead, let him arm his forehead with the sign of the life-giving cross, saying with the Apostle: But far be it from me to boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ (Galatians VI). Finally, David himself, because he knew how to say: The light of your countenance is signed upon us, O Lord (Psalm IV), indeed struck down the forehead of the loquacious boasting Philistine, not sealed with the light of heavenly grace, although covered with the helmet of boasting. And rightly the stone is said to be fixed in his forehead, because the devil will never completely shake off the sentence of the divine word, which he receives either in himself or in his followers from Christ the Saviour or His members, but cursed he will suffer eternal damnation in hell without end. Similar to what Isaiah testifies to his irrevocable damnation, saying: And the passage of the rod is founded, which the Lord God will rest upon him (Isaiah XXX), that is, he will never be saved from torments in eternity, nor will he roam between punishments over varying times, nor will he find rest after the manner of our blows, who frequently raise the rod or lash from the back of the one being flogged, so that we can strike again, but without any interval of rest, he will groan subjected to perpetual retribution. This is against those who, because of Isaiah’s testimony, where it is written about the impious, say: And they will be imprisoned together in the dungeon, and after many days they will be visited (Isaiah XXIV); promise the devil and his angels and all the reprobate remission of such great crimes and eternal life with the Lord after long and innumerable ages, against the judgment of the Lord himself, who foretold that he will say in the last judgment: Depart from me, you cursed, into eternal fire (Matthew XXV). But the giant, struck by the stone, fell to the ground; because the diabolic error, struck by the word of God, no longer lofty as it once boasted, was revealed to be not heavenly but earthly and even lowest.
