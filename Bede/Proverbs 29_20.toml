Do you see a man quick to speak, etc. Indeed, stupidity is a grave vice, but verbosity is not lighter. For it often happens that a dull person, even one ignorant of letters, more quickly accepts the words of salutary reproof than one who, endowed with an abundance of speech, arrogantly prefers to spout what he knows or thinks he knows, rather than to listen to the words of the wise.
