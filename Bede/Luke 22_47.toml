While he was still speaking, behold, a crowd, and he who was called Judas, one of the twelve, was leading them, and he drew near to Jesus to kiss him. Why he kissed him, the other evangelists make clear; that is, so that by this sign they might recognize that it was he who would betray him. However, the Lord accepted the kiss of the betrayer, not to teach us dissimulation but so as not to seem to flee betrayal, and at the same time fulfilling what is in the Psalm of David: "With those who hate peace, I was peaceful" (Psalm 119).
