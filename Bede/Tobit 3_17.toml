The reason why the Lord’s holy angel Raphael (which means “the healing of God”) was sent was to rid Tobit of blindness and Sarah of the demon. The Lord, who says of himself, “It is not those who are well that need the physician but those who are ill,” was sent into the world to redeem both the Jewish people from the darkness of unbelief and the Gentiles from the bondage of idolatry. And of him the prophet said, “And his name shall be called the angel of great counsel.” - "On Tobit 3.25"
