But they prevailed, saying: He stirs up the people, teaching throughout all Judea, beginning from Galilee even to here. This speech of the accusers teaches more that he who is accused is innocent, and that they who accuse are perverse. For to have taught the people, and by teaching to have stirred them from the indolence of former times, and by such an action to have traversed from Galilee to Judea, that is the entire land of promise from end to end, this is shown to be an indication of virtue, not of crime. For indeed some lover of the Lord, as he also did, could place this same statement in the place of praise, saying to good listeners: You know that the word was proclaimed throughout all Judea. For starting from Galilee after the baptism which John preached, Jesus of Nazareth, how God anointed him with the Holy Spirit and power, who went about doing good, and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, because the Lord was with him. Finally, Pilate, not thinking it necessary to question the Savior about this, but seizing the opportunity, more desires to set him free by judging him.
