Those who previously were seeking to frighten the builders of the holy city in order to hinder them from working now are themselves frightened when the construction of this same city is completed, and they are disheartened when they realize that its construction was begun and completed through Godâ€™s authority. So too in the holy church, when the sturdy structure of charity, self-restraint, peace and the rest of virtues is erected, unclean spirits grow afraid and their temptation, put to flight by our strength, is repelled and makes our victory all the greater. This can be understood to apply equally to heretics and to false catholics, who, through the steadfast faith of good people that works through love, are either set straight and reformed or, having been exposed so that people can be on their guard against them, are expelled from the boundaries of the church.
