Amen, I say to you, I will not drink of the fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God. The vine or vineyard of the Lord has been called the Synagogue, as all Scripture frequently testifies, and Isaiah more openly in the song sung about it: "The vineyard of the Lord of hosts is the house of Israel" (Isaiah V). From which vineyard, indeed, the Lord was drinking for a long time, although many branches turned into the bitterness of a foreign vine, because even though many in that people deviated from the straight path of faith, there were always many throughout the time of the law, whose pious thoughts and excellent virtues delighted God. But with the Lord suffering in the flesh and rising from the dead, it was time for that legal and figurative observance to cease, and for those things which were carried out according to the letter to be transferred into a spiritual sense and held better in the new testament, with the grace of the Holy Spirit helping. Therefore, going to His passion, the Lord said: I will no longer drink of the fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God. As if He said openly: I will no longer delight in the carnal ceremonies of the Synagogue, in which even those sacred rites of the paschal lamb held a special place. For the time of my resurrection will come, that day will come, when I, placed in the kingdom of God, that is, exalted in the glory of immortal life, will be filled with new joy together with you, from the fountain of the grace of the Spirit regenerated in the salvation of that same people.
