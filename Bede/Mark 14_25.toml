When the rites of the old Passover were finished, He passed to the new, in order, that is, to substitute the Sacrament of His own Body and Blood, for the flesh and blood of the lamb. Wherefore there follows: “And as they did eat, Jesus took bread”; that is, in order to show that He, Himself, is that person to whom the Lord swore, “Thouart a Priest forever after the order of Melchizedec.” There follows: “And blessed, and brake it.”.
The wine of the Lord’s cup is mixed with water, because we should remain in Christ and Christ in us. For on the testimony of John, the waters are the people, and it is not lawful for any one to offer either wine alone, or water alone, lest such an oblation should mean that the head may be severed from the members, and either that Christ could suffer without love for our redemption, and that we can be saved or be offered to the Father without His Passion. It goes on: “And they all drank of it.”.
This refers to the different circumstances of the Old Testament, which was consecrated by the blood of calves and of goats; and the lawgiver said in sprinking it, “This is the blood of the Testament which God has injoined unto you.” It goes on: “Which is shed for many.”.
Or else, Isaiah testifies that the synagogue is called the vine or the vineyard of the Lord, saying, “The vineyard of the Lord of hosts is the house of Israel.” The Lord therefore when about to go to His Passion, says, “I will drink no more of the fruit of the vine,” as if He had said openly, I will no longer delight in the carnal rites of the synagogue, in which also these rites of the Paschal Lamb have held the chief place. For the time of My Resurrection shall come, that day shall come, when in the kingdom of Heaven, that is, raised on high with the glory of immortal life, I will be filled with a new joy, together with you, for the salvation of the same people born again of the fountain of spiritual grace.
