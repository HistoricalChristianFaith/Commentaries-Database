"As the roaring of a lion, so is the anger of a king," etc. It speaks of God the King, who in judgment is both cheerful and gentle to the just, but will appear terrible to the unjust. "A foolish son is a father's grief." God, who is always impassible and placid in His nature, is nevertheless said to grieve in our manner when He sees that men, whom He created to believe in and praise Him, rather serve a malignant enemy than Himself. Hence Moses also says of Him, "He repented that He had made man on earth." And being inwardly touched with sorrow of heart, He said, "I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth" (Gen 6:7). "And a contentious woman is like a continuous dripping." Just as roofs that continuously drip indeed receive rain from heaven, yet do not distribute it for any useful purpose, but rather cause annoyance to those living below; so too, indeed, the Church of heretics, improperly interpreting and arguing against Catholics, receives gifts of heavenly words, not for the salvation of souls, but for the misuse of its wickedness. For dripping roofs indeed receive pure drops of rain, but render those beneath them filthy, and a heretic, though he hears the purest words of the heavenly oracle with his body, yet when he touches these with a defiled heart, he administers them mingled with filth to his audience. "Laziness induces sleep." He is called lazy, who, though correctly perceiving, is almost awake, yet is slothful by doing nothing. But laziness induces sleep, because even the vigilance of correct perception is lost for a while, whenever one ceases from the pursuit of good deeds. And rightly it is added: "And a loose soul shall hunger." For since it does not direct itself by striving towards higher things, it expands downward through neglect towards desires. And while it is not constrained by the vigor of diligent study, it is wounded by the craving for the lowest desires, so that by rejecting restraint through discipline, it scatters itself in hunger through the desires of pleasures.
