Therefore, what he says, "The heart of her husband trusts in her," is undoubtedly drawn from human practice; just as he who has a strong, faithful, and chaste wife, confidently trusts in her because she can do nothing against his will, nor be contaminated even by adulterous thought, she would gladly endure all adversities for his love and desire to convert anyone to his friendship, thus undeniably does our Lord and Redeemer trust in the Church. For He knows the spirit of grace which He gave, He knows the power of charity which He infused into her breast. Therefore, He does not doubt that she will not only be incorruptibly firm in the integrity of faith but will also continually strive to gather more into the unity of that same faith. For this is what follows, "And she will not lack gain," the Church spoils the devil when through her preachers, she calls back those whom he had deceived to the path of truth. And well it is said, "Will not lack gain," for the Church will never cease to restore souls freed from the diabolical deceit to the faith of Christ until, with the completed course of the world, the fixed number of her members is also completed.
