Nabal means “fool” and Abigail means “father’s joy.” Foolish was anyone skilled in the law, who had the key to knowledge but did not himself enter and prevented from entering those who wanted to. But the synagogue is rightly called “the Father’s joy,” inasmuch as it is said, “Rejoice because your names are written in heaven.” For in such circumstances she was very wise to understand the word of faith and she was respectable to carry out what she understood, although her teachers were harsh because of their unbelief, evil because of their evil manner of living and wicked because of their plotting treachery against the Lord.
