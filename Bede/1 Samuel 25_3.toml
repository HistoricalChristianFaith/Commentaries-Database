The name of that man was Nabal, etc. Nabal means foolish, Abigail is called the father's joy: and the foolish man was a legal expert who, having the key of knowledge, neither entered himself, nor allowed those who wished to enter. The father's joy, however, is rightly called the synagogue among those to whom it is said: But rejoice that your names are written in heaven (Luke X). For she was most prudent in such matters, understanding the word of faith; and beautiful in doing what she could understand. Meanwhile, her masters were hardened in unbelief, wicked in living badly, and malicious in plotting against the Lord.
