And every weight was recorded in that time. For the priests in the temple record all the weight of silver and gold, and of the vessels offered to the Lord, just as diligent teachers examine the lives of those under them, and discern by careful inquiry how much each one has progressed in faith or work, and according to the measure of their capacity, they arrange each in the house of God by their fitting steps. But even if now the laziness of overseers lies dormant and either ignores the lives of those entrusted to them or pretends not to know them, the internal judge is present, who keeps intact the number of believers and the weight of each oneâ€™s soul in the balance of His examination, so that He may render to each according to his work. It can also be said; because when holy preachers reach the heavenly Jerusalem with those whom they have instructed, all the weight of their good action is recorded at that time in the book of life and they are rewarded in heaven with deserving retribution.
