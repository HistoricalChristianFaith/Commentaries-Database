And Pilate adjudged that their petition be made. But he released to them the one who had been cast into prison for murder and sedition, whom they requested. Jesus, however, he delivered to their will. The seditious thief and author of murders was released to the Jewish people, that is, the devil, who long ago, due to the guilt of pride, had been expelled from the homeland of light and cast into the prison of darkness, and thus the Jews cannot have peace because they preferred to choose the leader of seditions rather than the Lord. Since Barabbas means son of the father or son of the master, he can carry the type of the Antichrist, whom those of whom it is said: "You are of your father the devil" (John VIII), will prefer to the true Son of God. The son of the devil, the Antichrist, is called not by birth from him, but by imitating him, as other sinners do.
