Go against a foolish man, etc. Therefore the mocker does not find the wisdom he seeks because even if you openly proceed by disputing against his foolishness, he does not know how to understand what you say: like Arius, who contended that the word "consubstantiality" between the Father and the Son could nowhere be found in the Scriptures, although it was clearly objected to him, "I and the Father are one"; and "the Word was God," etc. Therefore, the doctrine of the prudent is easy because the lips of prudence with wisdom, that is, because whatever lips are governed by the moderation of prudence, they only delight in speaking and hearing wisdom, and they strive to devote themselves to its meditation with effort.
