Now a certain centurion's servant, who was sick and about to die, who was precious to him. Someone might ask, either piously to find out or impiously to criticize, on what grounds the evangelist said of a servant who was not dead but was healed that he was about to die. To which a brief response should be given that he truly was about to die if he had not been restored to life by the faith of his beseeching master and the compassion of Christ. In the same way, King Hezekiah was about to die according to a certain manner of human nature, when he heard the words of the true prophet: “Set your house in order, for you shall die and not live” (2 Kings 20); but by the hidden judgment of divine providence, which has arranged all things in measure, number, and weight, he was to obtain fifteen more years of life through tears and prayers.
