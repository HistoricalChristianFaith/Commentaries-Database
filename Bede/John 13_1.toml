He loved them so much that by that very love he would end his bodily life for a time and soon pass from death to life, from this world to the Father. “Greater love has no one than this, that he should lay down his life for his friends.” And so, each passing over—the one under the Law and the other under the gospel—was consecrated with blood, the former with the paschal lamb, the latter with “Christ, our Passover, who was sacrificed for us.” The latter had his blood poured out on the cross, the former had its blood sprinkled in the manner of a cross in the middle of the lintel and the middle of the door posts.
