He who trusts in his riches will fall, etc. He who hankers after present goods and does not think of future ones, will lack both in the end. But those who do good in the hope of future rewards, justly receive what they hope for at present. Indeed, a green leaf on a tree signifies the fruits that it does not yet show. And the just flourish like a green leaf, because having been saved by hope, they do not cease to grow in faith and the grace of virtues, until they reach the fruit of the desired retribution, that is, the heavenly homeland.
