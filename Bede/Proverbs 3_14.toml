Better is her acquisition, etc. Let no one fear the correction of poverty, whoever has acquired the wealth of wisdom, because the celestial gift infinitely surpasses earthly treasures.

Its first and purest fruits. If, according to Ecclesiasticus, the root of wisdom is to fear God, what are the fruits of wisdom except to see God? And these are the first and purest, either because God, who is from the beginning, is seen, and nothing defiled incurs in His vision; or because man was first created to contemplate this. Hence, the younger son, even though he had squandered all his substance by living luxuriously, when he returned to the father penitent, is remembered to have received the first robe (Luke 15); or because the first and crude gold is usually the purest, and our first beatitude alone is truly to be believed as beatitude, which is promised to be rendered to us more perfectly by the Lord in the resurrection.
