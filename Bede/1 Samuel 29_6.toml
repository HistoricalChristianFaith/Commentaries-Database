Achish himself confesses that David was upright, innocent and good, like an angel of God, but he ordered him to depart from the battleline of the Philistines and to go his way in peace, since Achish did not wish to offend the princes of the Philistines. The throng of the faithful among the Gentiles praises, loves and proclaims the righteousness, mercy and holiness of Christ, since he had been sent by God to save the Gentiles. But they beg not to be forced to entrust the word to blasphemers, arrogant people and notorious idolaters, lest by chance they hear something and refuse to believe it and bring greater judgment against them. They ask their Lord, as it were, that he be content to rest in the peaceful and calm heart of the believers rather than to offer to the unbelievers an opportunity to persecute them as these opponents stir up trouble.
