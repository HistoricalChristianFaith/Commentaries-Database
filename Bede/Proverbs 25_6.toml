Do not appear glorious before the king, etc. He had previously warned the leader, now the subordinate: for, as he said there, Let him show cheerful faces to his subjects, so now he advises that he should not appear arrogant in the presence of the greater, but rather, placed in a moderate position, he should deserve to be called higher. Which is similar to that of the Lord: When you are invited to a wedding, do not sit in the first place, and so on (Luke XIV). We can understand, however, that the Lord is signified in the king and prince, in whose presence it is always necessary for us to be humble, as the apostle Peter advises, who says: Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in the time of visitation (1 Pet. V).
