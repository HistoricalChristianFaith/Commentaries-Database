works: Our works and words, no doubt, may be known to men.

Our works and our words may be made known to people, but what is their intention and what we wish to accomplish through them, only the Lord knows who sees what anyone thinks and in what he takes pleasure. And for what purpose is he who punishes fornication and idolatry, which are manifest sins, said to be one who knows hidden secrets, unless these sins are contained even in the least of transgressions? “You will destroy,” he says, “all who commit fornication from you.” And when he was discussing about false brothers, the same apostle John, who had heard this, ended by saying, “Little children, keep yourselves from idols.”
