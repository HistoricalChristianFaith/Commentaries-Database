Let no one, therefore, believe, as Pelagius teaches, that he can live without sins and debts, when he sees the apostles praying earnestly for their own transgressions, as the Lord teaches. And there is also written elsewhere, “The righteous falls seven times and rises again.” For it is impossible even for the saints to live without occasionally incurring guilt in very small sins which are committed through talk, thought, ignorance, forgetfulness, necessity, will, surprise. But still they do not cease being righteous, because with the Lord’s assistance they rise again more quickly from their guilty act.

Although the righteous may offend perhaps through the frailty of the flesh or through ignorance, nevertheless he does not cease to be righteous, because just as there is daily and unavoidable offense of this kind, so also there is the daily remedy of prayers and good works that quickly raises up the righteous offender, so that he may not tumble to the ground and befoul with the dust of vices the marriage dress of charity and faith.

For the just man falls seven times, etc. But how is he called just, who is remembered to fall, that is, to sin? unless he speaks of the slight and daily sins, without which none of the just could exist in this life? For certainly through ignorance, through forgetfulness, through thought, through speech, through surprise, through necessity, through the frailty of the flesh, each day, either unwillingly or willingly, we frequently incur guilt. And yet the righteous rises again, evidently because he is righteous, nor does the fall of human frailty prejudice his righteousness. Hence, well, when speaking of the fall of the righteous, he did not add "into evil," because although it is evil that they fall, they are nevertheless not able to remain in evil, by promptly rising again they procure [their recovery]. But on the contrary it is said of the reprobates: "But the impious will fall into evil," because evidently the impious, when they fall, or worse, when they sin grievously, as Scripture says, that is, when they commit capital crimes, they so delight in their fall that they scorn to rise again by repenting.
