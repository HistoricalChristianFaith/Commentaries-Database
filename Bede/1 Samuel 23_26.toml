And so Saul and his men surrounded David like a crown, etc. For, with the Lord Savior protecting His faithful, very often those who, out of fear of God, did not want to act, were compelled by the consideration of human peace or some other advantage to cease from tearing them apart. Therefore, the faith of Christ, upon which His Church is built, rightly prevails against the gates of hell (Matthew XVI); it is called the dividing rock because it wonderfully defends His often despairing followers in the present and separates those who hope for future reward from the perpetual turmoil of men. Whether these things happened in modern times or are believed to happen in the future under the Antichrist, let the reader see and consider, not without tears, something worthy of tears, how much the state of the Church deteriorates daily to worse things, or to say it more mildly, to weaker deeds. The city of Nobe, due to receiving David with all his men, suffered martyrdom, which is to render good fruit through patience. Ceila, saved by David along with its citizens from the enemy, lost its savior because it did not fear to betray him at the imminent moment of persecution; and this is to receive the seed of the word with joy but immediately stumble when tribulation arises because of the word (Matthew XIII; Luke VIII). The Ziphites, upon discovering that David was staying nearby, not only did not invite him to themselves, but also volunteered to betray him, not to avoid danger, but to gain the friendship of Saul, plotting to track his ways and overthrow his steps; and these are those who, according to the recalled parable of the Lord, hear the word, but the worry of this age and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful. I do not follow this reasoning as if I did not believe that even today there exist and will always exist many perfected in faith and truth; but because I see that, for the most part, the times are now approaching that were predicted long ago, in which, with iniquity abounding, the love of many will grow cold (Matthew XXIV). The title of the fifty-third Psalm, remembering the reading and betrayal by the Ziphites, is as follows: For the end, in songs, understanding of David, when the Ziphites came and said to Saul: "Is not David hidden among us?" Which, to explain briefly, denotes that the psalm is spoken in the end, in the person of Christ. For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes (Romans X). In songs, in great distress, yet the Psalmist declares the same song with rejoicing according to the one who said: "But we also glory in tribulation" (Romans V). For it seems to me that the psalms inscribed in songs always declare the joy of the singer amidst adversities. The understanding of David shows that David, obsessed with anguish, but also unexpectedly delivered, understood that the body of the true David, of which he himself was a member, would suffer from the wicked, how great the grace of his Redeemer was, to be often delivered at present, and always crowned in the future. But what is said at the beginning of the same psalm: "O God, save me by your name, and in your strength, deliver me," is what David seeks in this reading, refuge in the rock. And for this reason, it is called the dividing rock because of the beginning of deliverance. For the fathers drank from the spiritual rock that followed them. And the rock was Christ.
