Does he give thanks to that servant because he did what was commanded of him? I think not. So also you, when you have done all things that are commanded you, say: We are unprofitable servants. If a man, he says, demands not uniform but multiple service from a human servant, and yet does not give him thanks, how much more you, who can do nothing without me? You ought not to measure the merits of labors by the length of time, but by love and voluntary service, always increasing the former by new endeavors. Therefore say: We are unprofitable servants. Indeed, servants, because you were bought at a price. Truly unprofitable, because the Lord does not need your goods. If, however, he is unprofitable who has done all things, what is to be said about him who either could not accomplish what was commanded due to weakness, or, what is worse, despised it out of pride? Otherwise: We are unprofitable servants, because the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory that shall be revealed in us (Romans 8). And elsewhere: Who crowns me with mercy and compassion (Psalm 103). He does not say with merits and works, because by whose mercy we are prevented, that we may humbly serve God, by his gift we are crowned, that we may reign loftily with him.
