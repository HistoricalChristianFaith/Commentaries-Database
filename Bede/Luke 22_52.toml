Jesus said to those who had come to him, the chief priests, and officers of the temple, and elders. It is asked how Jesus is said to have addressed the chief priests, officers of the temple, and elders who came to him, when other evangelists report that they did not come themselves but sent servants while waiting in Caiaphas’s court. But since the chief priests, Pharisees, and elders managed the Lord’s death in such a way that they appeared innocent of His blood: Let Him not be handed over by us, but by His disciple; let Him not be seized by us, but by the tribune and the mob; let Barabbas be chosen by the people, not by us; and finally, let Him be condemned not by us but by the governor, and crucified not by our hand but by Roman soldiers; the evangelist, wishing to show that those who orchestrated everything were guilty of His blood, says that the chief priests, officers of the temple, and elders came to apprehend the Savior, so that it might be understood that just as they did not seize Christ themselves, but through those they sent, so too all those who shouted for His crucifixion did not kill Him by their own hands but through the one who was impelled by their clamor to this wickedness.

"Have you come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs? When I was daily with you in the temple, you did not stretch forth hands against me. But this is your hour and the power of darkness." It is foolish (he says) to seek him with swords and clubs, who willingly surrenders to your hands; to search for him at night as if he were hiding and avoiding your sight through a betrayer, who teaches daily in the temple. But you gather against me in the darkness because your power, which is armed against the light of the world, is itself in darkness.
