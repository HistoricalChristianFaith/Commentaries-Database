But he said to them: "The kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship over them, and those in authority over them are called benefactors. But it shall not be so among you. Rather, the greatest among you must become like the youngest, and the leader like one who serves." While the disciples were contending for precedence, the pious master did not rebuke them for initiating a dispute, but modestly described the form of humility they should follow. Yet, in obtaining this form, those who are greater and precedent, that is, the teachers of the Church, need not a small amount of discretion so that they do not, like the kings of the Gentiles, lord over their subjects and enjoy being raised by their superfluous praises, but, following the example of the King, they must preside and become like ministers. Because it is necessary for those acting in humility to be companions so that they may be raised against the vices of those who sin through the zeal of justice, so that they neither put themselves above the good in anything, nor when the fault of the wicked demands it, do they fail to recognize the power of their priority. Lest, indeed, the mind of the presiding one be carried away to the elation of power by the pleasure of it, it is rightly said by a wise man: "They have made you a leader, do not be lifted up, but be among them as one of them" (Ecclus. 32). Hence also Peter says: "Not domineering over those in your charge, but being examples to the flock" (1 Pet. 5). And yet sometimes it is a graver sin if among the perverse equality is preserved more than discipline, because, overcome with false piety, Eli did not wish to strike his sinning sons, yet suffered cruel punishment with them before the strict judge. Hence it is necessary that the ruler exhibits to his subjects both the piety of a mother and the discipline of a father. And amidst these, a careful circumspection must be provided with solicitude, lest either rigid strictness or remiss piety prevails.
