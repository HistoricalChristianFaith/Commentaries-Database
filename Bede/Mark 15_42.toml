And when evening had already come, because it was the day of preparation, which is before the Sabbath, Joseph of Arimathea, a noble councillor, came. He is called a councillor because he is from the order of the council and administers the office of the council. He is also usually called a curial by handling civic duties. Arimathea itself is Ramathaim, the city of Elkanah and Samuel in the region of Thamna near Diospolis. Παρασκευὴ in Greek is called preparation in Latin. By this name, the Jews who lived among the Greeks used to call the sixth day of the Sabbath, because on that day they were accustomed to prepare what was necessary for the rest of the Sabbath. According to what was once commanded about manna: On the sixth day you will collect double, etc. Because man was made on the sixth day, and the whole creation of the world was completed, and on the seventh, the Creator rested from His work, hence He wished to call it the Sabbath, that is, rest. The Savior, rightly crucified on the same sixth day, fulfilled the mystery of human restoration. Therefore, when he received the vinegar, he said: It is finished, which means, on the sixth day, what I have undertaken for the world's restoration, the whole work is now completed. And resting in the tomb on the Sabbath, He awaited the event of the resurrection which was to come on the eighth day. Here shines the example of our devotion and blessed reward, that in this sixth age of the world we must suffer for the Lord and as if be crucified to the world. In the seventh age, that is, when someone pays the debt of death, the bodies indeed rest in graves, but the souls remain in secret peace with the Lord and must rest after good works, until finally, when the eighth age comes, even the bodies themselves, glorified by the resurrection, with the souls receive the incorruption of the eternal inheritance.
