[[commentary]]
quote='''
Under the law the people were ordered to work for six days and to rest on the seventh … because the Lord completed the creation of the world in six days and desisted from his work on the seventh. Mystically speaking, we are counseled by all this that those who in life devote themselves to good works for the Lord’s sake are in the future led by the Lord to sabbath, that is, to eternal rest.
