The prophets inquired and sought out whatever information they could obtain from the Lord or from angels, in the secret recesses of their hearts, about the future grace of the gospel and about how and when eternal salvation would come into the world. They then prophesied by speaking openly to other people and revealing to them what they had learned through their own private contemplation.
