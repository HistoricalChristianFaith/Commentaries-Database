For if they do these things to the green wood, what will happen to the dry one? The green wood signifies himself and his chosen ones, while the dry one signifies the impious and sinners. Therefore, if I, he says, who have not committed sin, who has rightly been called the tree of life, bring forth the fruits of grace twelve times a year, without leaving the world without the fire of passion, what torment do you think awaits those who are empty of fruits and furthermore do not fear to give the very tree of life to the flames? If now is the time for judgment to begin with the house of God, and all who wish to live godly in Christ suffer persecution, what will be the end of those who do not believe the gospel of God?
