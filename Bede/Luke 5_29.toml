And Levi made him a great feast in his house. He who receives Christ within his home is nourished with the greatest joys far surpassing pleasures. Thus the Lord gladly enters and reclines in the affection of the one who has believed, and this is the spiritual feast of good works, which the rich crowd lacks, and the poor one feasts on.

And there was a great crowd of tax collectors and others who were reclining with them. They had seen a tax collector converted from sins to better things, finding a place of repentance, and because of this they too do not despair of salvation.
