And it came to pass, while he was praying, the appearance of his face was altered, and his clothing became white and dazzling. The Savior transfigured did not lose the substance of true flesh, but showed the glory of future resurrection, either his or ours. Just as he appeared then to the apostles, so shall he appear to all the elect after judgment. For in the very time of judging both the good and the evil, he will be seen in the form of a servant, so that the impious who spurned him, the Jews who denied him, the soldiers who crucified him, Pilate and Herod who judged him, may recognize the judge. The clothing of the Lord, however, is taken to mean the chorus of his saints, whom the Apostle glorifying says: For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ (Galatians 3). This same attire, while the Lord remained on earth, appeared humble and similar to others, but as he sought the mountain, it shone with new whiteness, for now we are sons of God, and it has not yet appeared what we shall be. We know that when he appears, we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is (1 John 3). Hence Mark, describing these clothes well, says: such as no launderer on earth can whiten (Mark 9). For the launderer to be understood here is the one whom the penitent Psalmist prays to: Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin (Psalm 51), he cannot give his faithful on earth the brightness, which remains preserved for them in heaven.
