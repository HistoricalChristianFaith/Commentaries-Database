When the left hand of Christ is interpreted as referring to something good, the present life of holy church is understood. Hence it is written, “Length of days is in her right hand, in her left riches and glory.” Length of days in her right hand [refers to] our Redeemer’s wisdom because in the fatherland of the dwelling on high unfailing light is granted to the elect of both angels and human beings. Riches and glory are in her left hand, because we are restored during [our time of] exile in our journey [on this earth] by both the riches of the virtues and the glory of our faith, until we come to our eternal [resting place]. Of his glory the apostle says, “And we glory in our hope of the glory of the children of God, and not only this, but we also glory in our tribulations”; and of these riches he says, “Because in everything you have become rich in him, with all speech and knowledge.”

Length of days is in her right hand, etc. With the vision of his divinity, He grants the chosen ones in perpetual light, and in this present life, he strengthens and illuminates them with the sacraments and charisms of his incarnation. He gives them, who sell all things for themselves, a hundredfold in this time, and eternal life in the future age. It follows in this place according to the ancient translation, which our codices do not have: Justice proceeds from his mouth, but he carries law and mercy on his tongue. This I believed should be noted because verses are often found placed in the works of the Fathers.
