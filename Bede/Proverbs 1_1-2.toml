“The parables of Solomon, son of David, the king of Israel.” What are called “parables” in Greek are called “similes” in Latin. Solomon gave this title to the book to encourage us to understand more deeply, not only according to the literal sense, because the Lord would speak to the crowds in parables, just as he also announces the everlasting kingdom of Christ and the church both in his own name and through the peaceful state of his kingdom, about which it is written: “His rule will be multiplied and there will be no end to peace upon his throne and upon his kingdom.” Likewise, by the construction and dedication of the temple, he insinuates the building up of holy church, which will be dedicated for eternity at the time of the resurrection. He was also declared to be the son of David himself and the spiritual king of Israel by the testimony of the crowds of people who greeted him with praises and palm branches upon his entry to Jerusalem. It must be noted, however, that the common translation of “parables,” which in Hebrew is māšlôt, is called parhoemias15 [in Greek], that is, “parables.” But this term is not inconsistent with the truth. For what are rightly called parables because they are mysterious can also not incongruously be called proverbs because such matters, often found in the course of conversation, ought to be contemplated and retained in memory. Proverbs are frequently so full of mystery that they can also be known as parables, as the Lord attests when he says, “I have said these things to you in proverbs; the hour is coming when I will no longer speak to you in proverbs, but I will announce the Father to you plainly.”
