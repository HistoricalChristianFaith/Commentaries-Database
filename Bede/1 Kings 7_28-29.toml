Hence the surface of the bases was not level at any point, but whichever side one turned, it was carved with mystical figures because the minds of the saints, indeed their whole way of life, displays the charm of the virtues in everything, and not an empty or idle hour passes them by that they fail to have time for good works or words or, at all events, thoughts. They have little crowns carved on them when they yearn with untiring longing for entry into eternal life; they have ledges when, amid their longing for the life of heaven that is above, they never undo the bonds of fraternal intercourse that is at hand; they have lions between the little crowns and ledges when they so raise their minds to hope for heavenly things and so open them out to the love of their neighbor that they do not shirk the zealous exercise of stern denunciation on any sinners entrusted to their charge. In addition to lions, they have oxen when they employ even the invective of correction in a spirit of meekness, when, in the heat of rebuking, they never cease to have the cloven hoof of prudent action and word or to roll the words of divine reading around in the mouth as if ruminating on them. Finally, blessed Stephen, the one who was the pillar of excellence of the Lord’s temple, seemed to show the fierce teeth and claws of a lion when he said to his persecutors, “You stiff-necked people, uncircumcised in heart and ears, you always resist the Holy Spirit; which of the prophets did your fathers not persecute?” and so forth; but in saying this he showed how much of the compassion of bovine meekness he nurtured in his heart within, when, for these same persecutors raging to kill him, he knelt and said, “Lord, lay not this sin to their charge.” But because we can have neither hope of things eternal in heaven, nor love of neighbor on earth, nor the fervor of trenchant zeal nor the gentleness of compassionate restraint, without knowledge of the holy Scriptures, it is aptly remarked that after crown and ledges, after lions and oxen, cherubim too were carved. For it is generally accepted that cherubim are a type of sacred scripture, whether because the two cherubim on the propitiatory of the ark were fashioned as a figure of the two Testaments that sing in harmony of Christ or because the name itself means “much knowledge.”
