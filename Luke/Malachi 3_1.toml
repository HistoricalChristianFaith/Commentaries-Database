And when the messengers of John were departed, he began to speak unto the people concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderness for to see? A reed shaken with the wind?  But what went ye out for to see? A man clothed in soft raiment? Behold, they which are gorgeously apparelled, and live delicately, are in kings' courts.  But what went ye out for to see? A prophet? Yea, I say unto you, and much more than a prophet.  This is he, of whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee. [Malachi 3:1] For I say unto you, Among those that are born of women there is not a greater prophet than John the Baptist: but he that is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.
