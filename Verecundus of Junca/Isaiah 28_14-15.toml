“He has become my help and my protector unto salvation.” They are said to be helpers who grant us their cooperation through specific acts. Protectors, however, are those who defend us with their power. Protection can take a variety of forms. For some, God is a protection, but deception becomes a protection for others, who lie about themselves, as Isaiah said: “We have established deception as our hope, and we are protected by lies.”
