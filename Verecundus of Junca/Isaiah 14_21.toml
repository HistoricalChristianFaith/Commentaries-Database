God’s warning is twofold, one directed toward the submissive and the other toward obstinate minds. As was said about the submissive: “I will punish their crimes with a rod and their sins with a whip, but I will not remove my mercy from them or deceive them in my truth.” But the wrath of God’s rebuke upon obstinate sinners is unbearable, as Isaiah testifies: “The descendants of the evil will never be named. Prepare their sons to be killed for the iniquity of their fathers. They will not rise, or inherit the earth or fill the face of the world with children. ‘And I will rise against them,’ says the Lord of hosts, ‘and I will destroy the name of Babylon and its seed and offspring,’ said the Lord.”
