Because the Lord Jesus would destroy their staff, that is, their power to oppress, Isaiah said, “How has the oppressor ceased and the tax ended? Was his oppressor’s staff destroyed?” It befits Christians to be cautious, therefore, and it is right for the people of the Lord to be observant, lest oppressors who had once been repelled by divine grace should rouse themselves again to demand the kind of taxes which are paid with spiritual delinquency.
