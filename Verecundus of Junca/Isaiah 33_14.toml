“He looked upon them, and the nations shook and the mountains quickly scattered.” The sight of the Lord shattered what was hardened and melted what was tightly compact, so that the truth expressed by Isaiah might be evident, for God is a living fire who advances to purify, not to kill: “Who among you can dwell with the devouring fire, or who among you can walk with eternal flames?” Whomever he looks upon, therefore, and touches with his warmth, he melts on the spot. Consequently, when he will later look upon the nations with mercy and judge them to be most worthy of redemption through his Christ, immediately their hardness will be shattered. - "Commentary on the Canticle of Habakkuk 6.5"
