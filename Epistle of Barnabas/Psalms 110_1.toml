Observe again that it is Jesus, not a son of a man but the Son of God, and revealed in the flesh by a symbol.Since, however, they were going to say that the Messiah is the son of David, David himself, fearing and understanding the error of sinners, prophesied, “The Lord said to my Lord, ‘Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet.’ ” And again, Isaiah says as follows: “The Lord said to the Messiah my Lord, whose right hand I held, that the nations would obey him, and I will shatter the strength of kings.” Observe how David calls him “Lord” and does not call him “son.”
