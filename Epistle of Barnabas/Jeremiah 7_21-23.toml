He has abolished these things so that the new law of our Lord Jesus Christ, which is without the yoke of necessity, might have a human offering. And again he says to them, “Did I command your ancestors, when they went out from the land of Egypt, to offer to me burnt offerings and sacrifices? But this rather I commanded them, Let no one of you cherish any evil in his heart against his neighbor and love not an oath of falsehood.” We ought, therefore, being possessed of understanding, to perceive the gracious intention of our Father. He speaks to us, desirous that we, not going astray like them, should ask how we may approach him. To us, then, he declares, “A sacrifice pleasing to God is a broken spirit. A smell of sweet savor to the Lord is a heart that glorifies him that made it.” We ought, therefore, carefully to inquire concerning our salvation, lest the wicked one, having made his entrance by deceit, should hurl us forth from our [true] life.
