And again the prophet says, seeing that as a hard stone he was ordained for crushing, “Behold, I will put into the foundations of Zion a stone very precious, elect, a chief cornerstone, honorable.” Then again [read] what he says: “And whosoever shall set his hope on him shall live forever.” Is our hope then set upon a stone? Far from it. But it is because the Lord has set his flesh in strength. For he says, “And he set me as a hard rock.”
