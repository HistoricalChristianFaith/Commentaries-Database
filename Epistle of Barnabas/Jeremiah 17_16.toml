It is also written concerning the sabbath in the Decalogue that the Lord spoke, face to face, to Moses on Mount Sinai, “And sanctify the sabbath of the Lord with clean hands and a pure heart.” And he says in another place, “If my children keep the sabbath, then will I cause my mercy to rest on them.”
