You see what he means: It is not the present sabbaths that I find acceptable but the one which I have made. After I have given rest to all things, I will make the beginning of the eighth day, which is the beginning of another world. It is for this reason that we celebrate on the eighth day, the day on which Jesus also rose from the dead, appeared and ascended into heaven.
