God says to the Jews: “I will not abide your new moons and your sabbaths.” You see what he means: The present sabbaths are not acceptable to me, but that sabbath which I have made, in which, after giving rest to all things, I will make the beginning of the eighth day, that is, the beginning of another world. Therefore, we also celebrate with joy the eighth day on which Jesus also rose from the dead after his rest, was made manifest and ascended into heaven.
