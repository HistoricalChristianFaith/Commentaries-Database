God circumcised our ears that we might hear the word and believe. But the circumcision in which they trust has also been abolished. For God said that circumcision was not of the flesh. But they were mistaken because an evil angel was teaching them vain cleverness. He says to them, “Thus says the Lord your God.” Here I find a commandment, “sow not among thorns. Be circumcised to your Lord.” And what does he say? “Circumcise the hardness of your heart, and do not stiffen your neck.” Take this again: “Behold, says the Lord, all the Gentiles are uncircumcised in the foreskin, but this people is uncircumcised in their heart.”
