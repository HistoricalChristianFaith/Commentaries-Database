Brothers, let us hear the Lord’s answer to the question, an answer that shows the way to the heavenly tabernacle.… He who drives the tempter and his temptations far from his heart, defeats his malice and dashes his rising thoughts against the Rock Christ. He who fears the Lord without growing proud of his virtue and humbly acknowledges that what is good in him does not proceed from himself. He who gives God his due and with the prophet blesses the work of God in himself: “Not to us, O Lord, not to us, but to your name give the glory.” The apostle Paul found nothing of his own to boast of in his preaching: “By the grace of God [says he] I am what I am,” and again, “He who glories, let him glory in the Lord.” RULE OF ST.
