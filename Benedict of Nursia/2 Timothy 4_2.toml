In his teaching the abbot is ever to observe this rule of the apostle: “Reprove, beseech, correct.” This consists in a judicious timing: to mix gentleness with sternness—at one time to show the severity of a master, at another the tenderness of a father. Use rigor with the irregular and the turbulent, but win to better things the obedient, mild and patient.
