The keeper of the wine cellar for the community shall be chosen out of the community, discreet, mature in his behavior and sober. If a brother chance to demand anything unreasonable of him, he is not to be contemptuous in his refusal but to refuse reasonably and humbly. He is to be careful of his own soul and remember that St. Paul says: “He that has done his duty well, gains for himself a good degree.” He is to show a particular concern for the sick, children, strangers and the poor, as being accountable for them at the day of judgment.
