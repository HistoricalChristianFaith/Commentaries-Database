But it also must be noted that the Savior’s tomb, above which a memorial canopy is often seen, can properly be called a cave or a den. Clearly, then, it was about the Lord Jesus Christ in the tomb that the prophet prophesied, “He lived in a high cave of fortified rocks,” and shortly thereafter added, with regard to the apostles rejoicing at the resurrection of the Lord: “You will see the king in his glory.” - "On the Holy Places 1.2.13"
