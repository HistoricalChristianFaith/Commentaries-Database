We heard in the Gospel the voice of the Lord saying, “Not everyone who says to me ‘Lord, Lord’ will enter the kingdom of heaven.” To whom does this word pertain? It is doubtlessly to those to whom he had said in another place: “This people honors me with their lips, but their heart is far from me.” We should be vigilant, therefore, that our lives remain consonant and harmonious with the profession of our lips, for if our works cry out to God with sincerity of conscience and probity of life, the mercy of the Lord will turn toward us whom he has heard.
