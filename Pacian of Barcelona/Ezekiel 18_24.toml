quote='''
Observe every one of the sins for which the Lord makes threats; you will at once see that they are current ones. But if someone’s past righteousness is not beneficial to the righteous individual in the time of his sin, then neither will the sin that has been forsaken harm the wicked individual in the time of his righteousness.
