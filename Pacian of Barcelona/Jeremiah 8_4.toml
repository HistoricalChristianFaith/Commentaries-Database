Did not confession deliver the king of the Babylonians when he had been condemned after so many sins of idolatry? And what is it that the Lord says? “Shall he who has fallen not arise, and shall he who has turned away not return?”

Immediately, on your return, the robe shall be put on you. The ring will adorn you. Your Father’s embrace again shall receive you. Behold, he says, “I do not wish the death of the sinner as much as I prefer that he turn about and live.” And again he says, “Shall he who has fallen not arise, and shall he who has turned away not return?” The apostle states, “God has the power to make him stand.”
