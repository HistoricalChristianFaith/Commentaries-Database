Will you be able to persuade anyone that, by receiving those who lapsed, the entire church has fallen? That the party of those who receive them back has become like someone who denies the faith because they admit penitents? But even if a congregation somehow has been too lenient, have other congregations who did not approve of their actions but rather followed convention and kept communion, also lost the name Christian? Hear the voice of Jeremiah! “In those days they shall not say, ‘The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children’s teeth are set on edge.’ But each one shall die for his own sin.”
