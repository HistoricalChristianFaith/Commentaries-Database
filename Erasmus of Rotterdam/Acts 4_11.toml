The stone means Christ Himself; the builders are the teachers of the Jews who rejected Him as if He were useless.

But when He rose from the dead, He was set in place as the head of the corner, that is, He became the head of the Church, joining Jews and Gentiles in one faith. For as the stone which forms the corner of a building makes continuous the walls leading to it and from it, so Christ has bound all together in one faith.
