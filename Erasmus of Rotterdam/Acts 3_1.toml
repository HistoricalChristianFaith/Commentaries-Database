Peter and John, with others, used to go together to the temple towards the ninth hour as the day began to decline. This is a time when other people, already drunk, usually play or sleep; it had become the custom of the apostles, however, to be free for holy prayers, fasting until evening. The two princes of the apostolic order went forth without horse or mule, but attend the apostolic procession.
